1
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:32,886
Help!

2
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,959
Help me!

3
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,190
Dry heaves are gone, so am I.

4
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,889
I'll check with the doctor.

5
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:46,400
No, no, no. I'm here voluntarily.
Just got to check with me.

6
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,698
I'm sorry. Dr. Nolan
left specific instructions.

7
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,738
She's not sick, she's
scared. So tell her to tell...

8
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:56,902
Wow.

9
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,009
And he's black.

10
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,443
Thought you'd be a little more
sensitive on the slavery issue.

11
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,296
You can't keep me.

12
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,441
Dr. House, you
look a lot better.

13
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,592
I am a lot better.

14
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,261
No painkillers,
no hallucinations.

15
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,963
Leg hurts, but it's manageable.

16
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,903
Great job. Gonna miss you.

17
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,964
Want to start missing
you as soon as possible.

18
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,876
Well, legally, you're free to go
whenever you want, but I suggest you stay.

19
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,413
I'll take it under advisement.

20
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,825
If you thought the hallucinations
were from your Vicodin problem,

21
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,994
why didn't you just check
yourself into a rehab facility?

22
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,578
I was deluded into
thinking I might be crazy.

23
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,782
But you have been
abusing Vicodin for years.

24
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,189
Never had delusions,
never had trouble sleeping,

25
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,751
never had any problems, other than
narcissism and anti-social behavior,

26
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,266
until two colleagues
died, your father died.

27
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,130
Your issues run
deeper than Vicodin.

28
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,905
That's not gonna
cheer me up, is it?

29
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,203
You need to be transferred
to our long-term ward,

30
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,072
started on medication,
talk therapy...

31
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,406
Yeah. I get it.

32
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,848
Just one thing I'm getting hung
up on. I can leave whenever I want.

33
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,009
How about I start with that?

34
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,517
You can't go back to
practicing medicine.

35
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,485
I don't want to
practice medicine.

36
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,071
I've decided I want
to be an astronaut.

37
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,997
Well, if you want your
state astronaut's license,

38
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,557
you're gonna need
my recommendation.

39
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,765
Is that a popular new
treatment, blackmail?

40
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,465
You need to get better.

41
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,715
Welcome to Ward Six.

42
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,728
So, brass tacks.

43
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,425
What do I have to do and
how long do I have to be here?

44
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,594
Depends on you.
Process is pretty basic.

45
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,832
If you follow the schedule,
agree to take meds,

46
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,875
participate in group and individual
therapy, we can work on goals...

47
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,068
I set a goal.

48
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,235
Excellent. What is it?

49
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,213
My goal is to get your boss to
write the letter that I want him to write.

50
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,476
Now let's talk process.

51
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,212
I can smile through
gritted teeth and play nice,

52
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,663
but there are serious risks of
violence involved in that choice.

53
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,316
So I'm going with turning
this ward upside down,

54
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,451
making you and your boss'
job and life so unmanageable

55
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,587
that he'll write whatever he
has to write to get rid of me.

56
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,892
He's all set.

57
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,023
Thanks.

58
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,308
Yo, I don't need an
escort. Get off me.

59
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,613
Who are you? You
believe these guys?

60
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,621
Lecturing me on manic depression,
like I couldn't write a book or two.

61
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,180
I stopped taking my meds because
I want to stop taking my meds,

62
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:01,058
because nothing is wrong with me. No
reason to keep dragging me back here.

63
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,495
When I'm on them, everything
slows down, that's when the problem is.

64
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,862
Hey, nice to see you.

65
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,412
My roomie last time
couldn't stand me.

66
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,526
Really?

67
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,434
I'm Juan Alvarez.
J.A.'s my stage name,

68
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,802
but Alvie's what everybody
around here calls me.

69
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,138
Like the Woody Allen
character in <i>Annie Hall,</i>

70
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,303
but the Puerto Rican
version and not as neurotic.

71
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,540
So, what do I call you?

72
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,810
You're actually waiting
for an answer this time?

73
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,010
You can call me House.

74
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,383
<i>He's a brick house</i>

75
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:31,819
Hey, wait up.

76
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,056
I've already got the whole place
wired, so I'll give you the rundown.

77
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,122
Yo, everybody, this is my
new roomie House, y'all.

78
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,134
Main thing you gotta
know... Is this a line?

79
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,727
Hey, Gabby, meet my
new roommate, House.

80
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:44,998
You can call him Hizzy.

81
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,164
No, you can't.

82
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,839
Don't worry, she
won't call you anything.

83
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,434
She hasn't talked in like
10 years or something.

84
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,969
Good you came here. You
need to know the lay of the land.

85
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,606
I need to request a new room.

86
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,048
You're funny.

87
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,828
You're also gonna come
here to get your meds.

88
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,081
I'm not on any meds.

89
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,587
You either? Good for you.

90
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,146
Tell me my mind works too fast,

91
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,818
probably tell Usain
Bolt he runs too fast.

92
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,761
Excuse me. I know you're busy
ignoring me, but my mini-bar is empty.

93
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,695
You think Bolt could
do the long jump?

94
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,845
That sport needs to evolve,

95
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,130
had the same world
record for like 20 years.

96
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,727
I think if one guy
launched himself head first

97
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,706
and right before he hits the
ground does a front flip instead,

98
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,367
get three extra feet
out of that, easy.

99
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,434
Go be that man.

100
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,980
My head!

101
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,916
My head!

102
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,289
You're not getting
any Haldol. Sorry.

103
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,931
That's Hal. His real name is
Connor, but we call him Hal because...

104
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,553
Yeah. I got it.

105
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,900
We can't play that.
They keep it locked up.

106
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,077
I wish we could,
but at the same time,

107
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,297
you can imagine how
annoying that could be.

108
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,914
Crazy people playing
on it all the time.

109
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,304
We'd never get any peace.

110
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,173
Come on, I want to
introduce you to everybody.

111
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,401
You think he's serious?

112
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,846
He's a doctor. He knows that acting
out will only reinforce our diagnosis.

113
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,577
Or it'll work.

114
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,946
You actually think this is something
we should be concerned about?

115
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,649
A patient makes a threat, you
should always be concerned.

116
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:20,858
There are two new additions
to our ward. You all know Alvie.

117
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:21,934
Thank you. Thank you.

118
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,562
Hold your applause. It's great
to be back here in Mayfield.

119
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,300
Not just for the food,
not just for the ladies...

120
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,605
Well, okay, maybe
just for the ladies.

121
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,441
And you should also
welcome Greg to the floor.

122
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,175
Don't worry about the
name. Just passing through.

123
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,716
I don't want to
break any hearts.

124
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,342
Can we go outside now?

125
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,545
Not now, Jay.

126
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,112
So he's claustrophobic,
right? You're claustrophobic.

127
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,181
Can I get a pen to
write this stuff down?

128
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,726
Where are you going?
Where's he going?

129
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:49,795
It's okay.

130
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,297
Paranoid. Check.

131
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,629
Dr. Beasley, I'm having
an issue with the food.

132
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,829
What's the problem?

133
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,735
I swear I'm eating less and less

134
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,434
and I just keep getting
bigger and bigger.

135
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:02,669
A crayon, anybody?

136
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,574
We'll talk about
it another time.

137
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,512
I understand you all
had art therapy yesterday.

138
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,175
Maybe we can hang some
of the new pieces on the wall.

139
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,048
Cut your wrists, huh?

140
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,717
Greg, there are
certain topics...

141
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,313
Oh. I'm sorry, is suicide taboo?

142
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,255
Gosh, if I've broken a rule
on my first day, I will kill myself.

143
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,057
Group's over.

144
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,164
That flew by.

145
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,101
You realize you're not the first
uncooperative patient on this floor?

146
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,763
Really? Is there a club?

147
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,331
Yes. Come with
me to the clubhouse.

148
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,941
That didn't take long.

149
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,141
I'm that good.

150
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,755
Come on, come on, come on.

151
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,523
Come on, Alvie,
let's see some action.

152
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,901
Me! Me! Me! Pass. Pass. Pass.

153
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,162
Good!

154
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:03,931
Come on, guys.

155
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,207
Ready to play nice?

156
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,970
Would you believe
me if I said yes?

157
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,102
No.

158
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,009
Then yes.

159
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,982
You do know I'm
trying to help you.

160
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,211
I also know you're trying to
be sweet, caring and effective.

161
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,880
You're just not.

162
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:28,157
You want out.
Just talk, be honest,

163
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,396
try to work with people,
try to deal with people.

164
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,397
Okay.

165
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,736
House! House! He's on my team.

166
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,778
Shut up. Nobody likes you.

167
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,445
Hey. Am I crowding you? What?

168
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,143
Can't see the sun?

169
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,449
Oh, no. Everything's closing in.

170
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,750
Okay. Okay.

171
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,817
He's the claustrophobic
one, right?

172
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,586
Because I'm doing
this from memory.

173
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:00,726
You have to dribble.

174
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,817
Why?

175
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,093
CIA satellites aren't watching
me, they're watching you

176
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,259
'cause you're wearing green.

177
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,731
That one was just too easy.

178
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,537
Seriously, anorexia? Were
you supposed to be a girl?

179
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,237
And in answer to
your implicit question,

180
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,076
yes, those pants
do make you look fat.

181
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,053
How upset were you
when you woke up in the ER

182
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,820
and you were still
alive and a failure?

183
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,692
Two-nothing, good guys.

184
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,438
You're right. It is
rewarding to reach out.

185
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,257
You can't go up there.
It's yard time right now.

186
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,811
Put it on my tab.

187
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,839
I think you'll find music
therapy is more effective

188
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,571
if the patients are
inside to hear it.

189
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,740
Where'd you get the key?

190
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,280
They gave it to me.

191
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,517
So, if she ever talks, are we
gonna get a German accent?

192
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:44,088
No. She's my husband's sister.

193
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,459
So let him come play the piano.

194
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,559
He doesn't know how to play.

195
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,999
Nice. A little heavy on
the right foot, though.

196
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,947
See her head? It
bobs to the music.

197
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,181
It's the only real reaction
I'm getting from her.

198
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,089
Feels like we're talking.

199
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,623
You're not talking.

200
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,793
Her head is
bobbing to her pulse.

201
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,060
Are you a new
doctor on the ward?

202
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,533
Technically, yes.

203
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,436
Can I lead this time?

204
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,134
Come on.

205
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,609
Leave the lid unlocked
when you're done.

206
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,478
Can you close the door?
You're letting all the cool air out.

207
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,818
If you keep up this
scorched earth policy,

208
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,944
you're gonna end
up living in this room.

209
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,213
Are you ready to
try another strategy

210
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,224
or do you want me
to leave you in here?

211
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,237
Twenty-one. Two-one. That's
game. Hey, House is back.

212
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,005
I'll get the ball.

213
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,437
Come on. I need some
meat. I got no one left to play.

214
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,504
I'll play you.

215
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,312
Pssh, girl. Come on,
House. You can serve.

216
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,387
I had some time to think about
the approach I've been taking.

217
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,226
I'm new, I'm unhappy here, and
I've been taking it out on you guys.

218
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,530
Unfairly.

219
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,562
It was misdirected anger.

220
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:12,702
'Cause when you think about it,
the real jerks here are the doctors.

221
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,336
House.

222
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,244
You see how they give
you a ping-pong table,

223
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,411
but no paddles, no net.

224
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,045
It's like they're mocking you.

225
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,214
Preach.

226
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,259
The game is called table
tennis not table volleyball.

227
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,385
Greg, you know
where this is gonna end.

228
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,930
Whoever saw a tennis
court without a net?

229
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:34,331
A little run-down park across
from my apartment, growing up.

230
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,495
Three courts, no nets,
no one ever used it.

231
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,335
No one's gonna try to hang
themselves with a ping-pong net.

232
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,806
Of course not.
That's ridiculous.

233
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,719
It ain't right, Doc. You
treat us like little kids.

234
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:47,145
Little kids are allowed to play
ping-pong, they can play the piano.

235
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,409
Yeah, worse than little kids.

236
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,680
All right. Why don't we just
go and sit down and discuss it?

237
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,244
No, no, no! No! I want
to discuss it right here!

238
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,720
Guys.

239
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:01,921
Guys.

240
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,427
Guys!

241
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,300
We want...

242
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:33,423
House is right. I think
everyone here can handle these.

243
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,934
Seriously?

244
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:46,135
Is that your strategy? Give
everybody what they want, except me?

245
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,174
You're a natural leader.

246
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,801
You could do something
useful down here.

247
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,505
For them. Definitely for you.

248
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,979
Or we could keep fighting.

249
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,482
If you think you can break me,

250
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,317
if you think I'm not every
bit as stubborn as you.

251
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,561
<i>He came to fight the Man
And he had the master plan</i>

252
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:16,160
<i>But it started to unravel Nolan
smashed him with his gavel like...</i>

253
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,533
Shut up.

254
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,215
So, you're gonna keep trying
to make them miserable?

255
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,468
No.

256
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,634
New plan?

257
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,801
Yep.

258
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,572
What is it?

259
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:26,874
I don't know yet.

260
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,845
<i>His mind is burning
The wheels are turning</i>

261
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,283
<i>The butter is churning</i>

262
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,718
<i>You think Nolan can
keep House from strolling?</i>

263
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,246
You know, it's easier to come
up with a new plan in silence.

264
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,792
Right. Cool.

265
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,064
Can I hum?

266
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:57,944
I'd like you all to welcome another
new addition to our ward. Steve.

267
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,569
Freedom Master.

268
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,313
Steve Elkerton's just a cover.

269
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,907
It's like Clark Kent or Bruce
Wayne or Peter Parker.

270
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,681
Cool, we get more
Jesuses than superheroes.

271
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,779
Well, I try to blend
in, in the outside world,

272
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,314
but I figure in here
everybody gets it.

273
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,361
Hey, we're living in
the Ward of Justice.

274
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,452
Alvie.

275
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,225
Can you explain a little more
about what you think everybody gets?

276
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,234
That there's good
and evil in the world.

277
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,395
And some people are special,

278
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,996
and they're chosen to
help keep evil forces at bay.

279
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,474
You don't think you
can stop bullets, do you?

280
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,568
I move out of their way.

281
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,374
Can you read minds?

282
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,939
No.

283
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,112
Group time, Greg.

284
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:41,985
Why isn't she talking?

285
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,820
She needs help. She
needs somebody to save her.

286
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,489
That's what we're
all trying to do.

287
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,758
Let's take five minutes.
Everybody get to know Steve.

288
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,040
I can fly.

289
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,145
I know you're scheming,

290
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,183
working on your next
elaborate plan to get out of here.

291
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,285
Why don't you put the plan on hold
for a few days, see what happens?

292
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,086
Just let me do my job.

293
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,652
If you prefer private to group, we
can do that, maybe try some SSRIs.

294
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:27,393
If you think nothing's working, you
can always go back to your schemes.

295
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,833
God, if only you'd said
that two minutes ago,

296
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:33,361
before I came up with my new
scheme. Now I'm committed.

297
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,902
Get it?

298
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,944
<i>Shaq up in my area</i>

299
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,276
<i>I'm a better baller and
a better rapper, what?</i>

300
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,748
<i>And I'm good at basketball, too!</i>

301
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,344
Do you have
third-floor privileges?

302
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,948
Ever since I shared in group
about my uncle fondling me.

303
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,751
Is that true? Yeah.

304
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,762
And now I can use the
third-floor vending machines.

305
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,306
Do you eat sour
cream and onion chips?

306
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,675
I mean, the whole
point is the dipping.

307
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,031
Sure, we save time by not adding

308
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,878
the mix to the sour cream,
but you're missing out...

309
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,996
I need you to break
into Nolan's office.

310
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,300
Commando style.

311
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,897
I want you to focus.

312
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,168
You want me to mess him up?

313
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,472
Go into Nolan's office,
look at his calendar.

314
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,775
I need the name of the woman
he met with at 11:00 today.

315
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,940
No problem. And I'll get
you some old-school chips.

316
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,592
If they have them,
I'll get you some dip,

317
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,860
but I've never seen dip
in the vending machine...

318
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,547
Yes, get me chips
and dip. What else?

319
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,713
I get it, I get it.

320
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,780
Plan B. "B" is for blackmail.

321
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,554
I got you covered.
Commando style.

322
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,664
Let me go! I just wanted a
little snack. That ain't right.

323
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,902
Yo, I didn't know the machine
was moved. I want some Ritz Bits.

324
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,911
Yo, I might be pregnant.
I get these cravings.

325
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,774
You get the name?

326
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,897
Nolan's schedule book just has a big "X"
marking out the whole middle of the day.

327
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:32,187
Then we can assume the
girl he's with is called "Nooner."

328
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:35,251
<i>Nooner, nooner
Nolan's gonna spoon her</i>

329
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,327
He's gonna fork her.

330
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,660
<i>And then he's gonna knife her</i>

331
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,676
I didn't get a chance to check
the phone or anything else.

332
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,033
That's okay. I got
her license plate.

333
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,413
I call my friend,
he gets the name,

334
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,303
I get the letter that
gets me out of here.

335
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:49,137
You got phone privileges?

336
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,042
I'm on level minus four.
I'm still writing with a crayon.

337
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,137
You? You gotta be a level five.

338
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,977
That's like the top
of the Space Needle.

339
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,847
Hal's the only one
that's up that high.

340
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,181
Hal's a level five?

341
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,812
They give him a point
every time he clears his plate.

342
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,322
I've been eating his potatoes.

343
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,653
Will he sell you some minutes?

344
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,886
No, I pay two cigarettes
for the potatoes.

345
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,861
Phone's worth a lot more.

346
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,929
Can you cheek a pill?

347
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,160
No.

348
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,837
That's too bad for you.

349
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,110
You sure you're good with this?

350
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,513
Yeah, yeah. Gotta be done.

351
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,983
So, how do we start?

352
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,357
I think we just start.
Make it good. Make it real.

353
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,388
Just do it already.

354
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,071
Code Gray!

355
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,734
Give me five
milligrams of Haldol!

356
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,875
Get him off me! Hey!

357
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,481
Give it to him.

358
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,902
Dude, that was awesome.

359
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,147
You think Hal will
mind if they're wet?

360
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,117
<i>House?</i>

361
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,686
No, it's your other
friend at the asylum.

362
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,065
How's it going?

363
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,568
Hallucinations are
gone, so is the Vicodin.

364
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,503
How's the leg? How's the pain?

365
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,403
<i>They got me on
some non-narcotic.</i>

366
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,407
I'm dealing. I need you
to run a license plate.

367
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,740
Was there a
hit-and-run on your floor?

368
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,109
House, just do what
you're supposed to do,

369
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,981
listen to the doctors, and
I'll be able to visit soon.

370
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,293
Track down the owner
of this car and I'll be

371
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:17,581
able to visit you. In
your office. Tomorrow.

372
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:21,616
My doctor's too smart, too old, and too
well-dressed to only be running one ward.

373
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,428
<i>He screwed up
something in his life,</i>

374
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,775
<i>and I think he's doing it again.</i>

375
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,059
I need her name, so I can
blackmail the blackmailer.

376
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,691
House, he called me.

377
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,764
What did he want to know?

378
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,034
He wanted to know about you.

379
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:40,075
<i>He wanted to warn me that
you'd be calling for something,</i>

380
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,549
and he told me if I wanted to help you
get better, I had to let him do his job.

381
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,584
Yeah, well, now I'm calling you
to tell you that if he calls you...

382
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,249
House, I'm so sorry. I
wish I could help you.

383
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,753
You can.

384
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,735
Turns out,

385
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,764
you're my only friend.

386
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,242
<i>House ain't a newbie
Now he's living on this floor</i>

387
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,380
And I hate you.

388
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,217
I'm gonna cooperate.

389
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,949
That's not much of a plan.
That's actually their plan.

390
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,825
No. I'm pretty sure their plan is
for me to actually swallow the pills,

391
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,920
to actually cooperate.

392
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,961
I'm so proud of
my little roomie.

393
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,522
I only taught him
everything he knows.

394
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,101
One, two, three.

395
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,373
Okay, Stomp, you start the
betting. Highest card wins.

396
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,976
That's probably a fold. Richter?

397
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,270
Two cigarettes.

398
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,009
He's not confident, Alvie.

399
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,678
You can crush him. In the
form of a rhyme if you wanted.

400
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,119
<i>No regrets Raise 10 cigarettes</i>

401
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,523
Whoa. That's a lot of nerve for
someone with a two on their head.

402
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:08,925
You're messing with me.

403
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,156
You can't raise
10, I only have five.

404
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,230
Throw in your phone card.

405
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,391
I'm not gonna throw
in my phone card.

406
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,832
Can I play?

407
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:18,364
Come here. Why?

408
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,978
I want to see if you've
got what it takes.

409
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,168
Give me your best poker face.

410
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,613
Too rich for my blood.
You can take my seat.

411
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,446
Med time!

412
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,613
How are you feeling today?

413
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,177
Better than yesterday,
not as good as tomorrow.

414
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,605
I've been humming to her.

415
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,477
She sways. Might be significant.

416
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,082
Are you ignoring me or are you
just letting my charm wash over you?

417
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,056
Kind of tough to play and chat.

418
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,095
Couple of weeks ago, you told me

419
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,926
playing to her was a
complete waste of time.

420
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:23,425
You're right. Your playing
does get worse when you talk.

421
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,328
I assume she loved music.

422
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:30,399
She played for the
Philadelphia Philharmonic. Cello.

423
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:34,907
If she responded to the piano, she
might respond even better to the cello.

424
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,877
I play a little.

425
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,843
Hmm.

426
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:43,548
Maybe I'll bring one
in Tuesday. Thank you.

427
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,155
Different desk.
Different doctor.

428
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,823
You've been on
meds for a while now.

429
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,232
I'll be checking in with you periodically
to see if we need to adjust your dose.

430
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,861
Any dry mouth? Trouble sleeping?

431
00:28:58,937 --> 00:28:59,961
No.

432
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,799
Can I go now? There's
a manic out there

433
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,208
with a fresh carton of cigarettes
and he's a terrible bluffer.

434
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,011
It's nice to see that you
and Alvie are friends again.

435
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,106
Tell me about your fight.

436
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,209
He hit me, I hit him back.

437
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,015
Repeat until pulpy.

438
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,522
Alvie told me you
instigated the thing.

439
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,455
That tends to be
the way fights work.

440
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,993
Different interpretations
of the same circumstances.

441
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,722
Very understanding attitude.

442
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:24,854
There's that tone again.

443
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,398
You're smart.

444
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:29,924
How come every time you compliment
me, it sounds like an accusation?

445
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,972
You're not having any side-effects
from your meds, which is unusual.

446
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,131
It's not that unusual.

447
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,516
The story about the
fight isn't adding up.

448
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,738
Why don't you stop pretending that
you haven't reached a conclusion?

449
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,110
You don't trust me. Actually,
it's more fundamental than that.

450
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,180
You don't like me.

451
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,272
I didn't say that.

452
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,181
You think I'm not
taking my meds.

453
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,243
Are you? Yes.

454
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,951
So, what do you want me to
do? Want me to take a urine test?

455
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,959
Will that earn your trust?

456
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,026
Actually, yeah.

457
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,373
Have at it.

458
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,305
A little dignity, please.

459
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,675
You know the rules.
I have to watch.

460
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:17,807
Yes, but you don't have to have court
side seats. Can I at least use a stall?

461
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,972
<i>For he himself has said it</i>

462
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:51,642
<i>And it's greatly to his credit</i>

463
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:55,813
<i>That he is an Englishman</i>

464
00:30:55,887 --> 00:31:01,019
<i>He is</i>

465
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:05,497
<i>An Englishman</i>

466
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,109
Get it while it's hot.

467
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,195
I'm sorry I doubted you.

468
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,595
Freedom Master, think
you could help me out?

469
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,071
You need help? Of
course. That's what I do.

470
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,939
Great. Could you
move the piano for me?

471
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:55,371
Five hundred pounds
is not too much, is it?

472
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,609
Is there something
trapped underneath or...

473
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,776
No, I just want to move
it away from the window.

474
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,396
I'm sorry, my powers
aren't for frivolous...

475
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,321
Just one quick lift.

476
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,388
Why are you doing that?

477
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,618
House, it's none
of your business.

478
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,526
I'm just curious, as a
doctor. What are you doing?

479
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,963
Either he is Freedom Master
and he shouldn't be here

480
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,866
or else he's suffering from a
serious and dangerous delusion

481
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,460
that he needs to deal with.

482
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:21,234
So legit medical reasons.

483
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,980
You're not just trying to break the
guy because he's a little different.

484
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,911
He's not different,
he's delusional.

485
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,002
Can you help me out?

486
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,274
What is she looking at?

487
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,907
You're not a superhero, Steven.

488
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,128
You're just a regular person,
that's okay. I can save her.

489
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,485
We're all just regular people.
It's what we do with that...

490
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:40,219
They stole her voice
box. They have it in there.

491
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,523
That's what she's staring at.
That's what she's staring at.

492
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:44,635
She's always staring at...

493
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,688
Your wife is dead.

494
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,504
Good can defeat evil.

495
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,304
Not every time. Evil people
killed a lot of good people that day.

496
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,401
You couldn't save her.
No one could save her.

497
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:05,941
It's in there. Her voice is in
there. Her voice is in there.

498
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,383
Code Gray.

499
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,818
Her voice is in...

500
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:14,316
Her voice is in there!
Her voice is in there!

501
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,163
Don't do it.

502
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,667
I'm not doing anything.

503
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,134
You're thinking.

504
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,297
Things go from thinking to
doing way too fast in this place.

505
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,807
Keep thinking, you're gonna
wind up with no mo in your mojo.

506
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,275
I'm thinking of
hitting you again.

507
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,279
You hate Medina, you hate all
of them, you want to hurt them.

508
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,713
You gotta keep pretending.
Step away from the hate.

509
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:41,014
What's the difference between
pretending to cooperate and cooperating?

510
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:44,056
Pretending is pretending.
It's not real, you don't mean it.

511
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,183
I sat and watched while he did
something stupid and pointless.

512
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,318
I cooperated.

513
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,557
In a few days, you won't have to
watch because you're going home.

514
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,064
You'll be getting your job back.

515
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,494
Everybody, inside.

516
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:59,504
Closing ceremonies, everyone
attends. One of you is going home.

517
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,908
It's been a great week.

518
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,742
A number of you have
made tremendous strides.

519
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,716
But today we're here
to congratulate Susan.

520
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:20,383
We are proud of her. We
wish her well and we hope

521
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,792
- to never see her again.
- To never see her again.

522
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,731
Isn't it pretty?

523
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,911
Where's Freedom Master?

524
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:47,577
He isn't able to take part.

525
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,396
Get out there. He said
everybody has to get out there.

526
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,368
Talk. Say something.

527
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,962
Dr. House, leave him alone.

528
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,870
Did you drug him?

529
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,203
Of course I didn't drug him.

530
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,972
He's in flat affect. He's
practically catatonic.

531
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,068
Hey, we got cake.

532
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,204
He's fine.

533
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,748
Double chocolate. Yummy, yummy.

534
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,250
Don't tell me that
he's fine! You did this!

535
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,513
He was functioning.
He was happy.

536
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,020
He was delusional.

537
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,818
Yeah. He's way better off now.

538
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,050
Dr. House.

539
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,358
Let's talk.

540
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,325
Thinking sucks.

541
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,141
I'm not allowed to get
angry? They screwed him up.

542
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,767
And for the record,

543
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,312
I am two privilege
levels above Susan.

544
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,007
I got the same
depression scale score.

545
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,914
Every patient is different. It's
not about scores and levels and...

546
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,782
Happiness is happiness, the
test is the test, coping is coping.

547
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,379
And you think
you're... Absolutely!

548
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,288
I need to address
some deeper issues,

549
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,953
which I could do on
an outpatient basis.

550
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,223
Three hours a week?

551
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,008
That's just my opening offer. If
you want to counter, I'll likely fold.

552
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,032
No.

553
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,330
"No" is not an argument.

554
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,479
You trying to frustrate me?

555
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,562
No.

556
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,538
"No" again?

557
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,871
I can cope. I'm coping.

558
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,877
In fact, I'm coping
better than you think.

559
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,616
I've not been taking
my meds. Not one.

560
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:28,347
And yet I still scored a
"high-functioning" on your depression test.

561
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,049
So your proof of your
well-being is that you lied?

562
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,681
Manipulated.

563
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,691
My proof is that I can
fool the test, I can fool you,

564
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,092
which means I am
high-functioning.

565
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:40,291
I'm sane, rational, capable.
I should not be here.

566
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,527
These are your pills from today?

567
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,331
I'm not gonna take it.
I'll just cheek it again.

568
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,171
Lick it.

569
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,806
You want me to lick your hand.

570
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,368
I washed.

571
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,982
It's sugar.

572
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:06,222
Your test results were improving
too regularly and too quickly.

573
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,102
I was concerned that you
weren't taking your pills,

574
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,961
that it was all an act. So I
switched you to a placebo

575
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,660
to see if your improvements
would continue.

576
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,499
Your psych tests
told me nothing,

577
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,634
but your urine tests
told me you were faking.

578
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,715
You need to stop
fighting the system.

579
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,682
You need to let me do my job.

580
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,451
So, what's the next plan?

581
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,258
There is no new plan.

582
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,656
I'm out of plans.

583
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,223
So, what do we do?

584
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,632
We stop talking.

585
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,240
I see you got some
cello in your trunk.

586
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,103
No, it's not a euphemism.

587
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,407
Are you spying on me?

588
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,280
I'm living in a
psychiatric hospital.

589
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,115
Staring out of the
window is what we do.

590
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:44,713
I assume you'll need
help carrying it up.

591
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,690
I still got grounds privileges.

592
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,791
And who's going to carry you
when you're carrying the cello?

593
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:54,799
Yes, cast aside the useless
cripple. How very German of you.

594
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:59,497
Seriously. The thing weighs a ton
with that case. I think I'll need a dolly.

595
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:02,905
Or we could ask
Clark Kent to pitch in.

596
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,301
The dolly's probably easier.

597
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,540
The dolly already
feels good about itself.

598
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:13,049
He was a happy-go-lucky superhero
until they told him he has no powers.

599
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,746
You let him help out, he
feels good about himself,

600
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,812
might be less depressed.

601
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,755
So, why do you
put your life on hold

602
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,956
to visit your sister-in-law
five times a week?

603
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:29,026
Am I somehow a bad person
for showing compassion?

604
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,333
No. You're not even a bad person
for lying about why you're doing it.

605
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:40,368
Oh, that is impressive.
That is a superhuman feat.

606
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:47,445
Why don't you take a rest before
you fly that thing up to the ward?

607
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,292
He's still depressed.
Give me your car keys.

608
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,886
You gonna dangle them in
front of him to entertain him?

609
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,692
I'm gonna make him
feel like he's flying.

610
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:03,860
I'll just drive him around the
grounds, top down, wind in his hair.

611
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,665
Seriously? You're
gonna say no to that?

612
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,152
Why are you so nice to me?

613
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,250
I think you have a good heart.

614
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,691
Would you still be nice to
me if I told you that I lied?

615
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,074
I'm not just driving around
the grounds in your convertible.

616
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,658
I'm kidnapping him
and stealing your car.

617
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,005
You sure?

618
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,603
I was just starting to feel
a little heat between us.

619
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:49,023
Thought we had kind of a
Bonnie and Clyde thing going there.

620
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,380
Bonnie and Clyde
get shot to pieces.

621
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,082
Hmm. See you.

622
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:19,841
You can do this. And if you
hold my hand, I can do it, too.

623
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,302
Don't let go!

624
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:56,142
Going up!

625
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,619
Freedom Master is back!

626
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:17,195
Keep it down, Freedom Master,
you're scaring the good citizens.

627
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,380
That was the coolest
moment of my life.

628
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,804
It was fun.

629
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,535
You can repay me by
telling Nolan he's an idiot.

630
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:27,136
Smell that fresh air. And
the warmth of your yellow sun.

631
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,804
We do enjoy it.

632
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:34,482
Careful of the traffic. Don't
want to go damaging any fenders.

633
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:40,185
Hey! Hey! Come on. Get down.

634
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,460
There's no cry for help.
There's no cat in a tree.

635
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:49,892
Thank you, Greg.

636
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,526
No!

637
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,648
He's lucky to be alive.

638
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,883
He's got a lacerated spleen,
rotational pelvic fracture,

639
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,718
compound break of
the femur and humerus.

640
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:15,593
Everything in your life has
been about finding the truth,

641
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,826
but suddenly, with this guy, you
decide to reinforce a sick man's delusions.

642
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,164
You just wanted to take
a swing at me. Hmm?

643
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,967
You don't care about getting
out, you don't care about him.

644
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,011
You don't even
care about the truth.

645
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,079
You don't care about
anything, House.

646
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,885
I'm transferring you
to Winslow Psychiatric.

647
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:46,152
You'll have better luck pulling
the wool over their eyes. I'm done.

648
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:48,189
Don't.

649
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,864
I need help.

650
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,886
So, how is this
supposed to work?

651
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,286
You sit. I sit. We talk.

652
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,657
About what? About
whatever you want.

653
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,353
You want me to whine
about my mother?

654
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,895
Do you want to whine
about your mother?

655
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:28,296
I could tell you about the time
I was five and my goldfish died.

656
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,925
If that's where
you'd like to start.

657
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,813
I've had a billion things
happen to me in my life,

658
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,581
how am I supposed to know
which ones are relevant?

659
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,350
As far as I'm concerned,
they're all relevant.

660
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:39,867
Well, we better get moving 'cause
this session could take 50 years.

661
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:42,243
Yes, you are the sum of
everything that's happened to you,

662
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:46,114
and, yes, some events are
more relevant than others,

663
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:51,012
but the only way we can figure
out which ones are is to talk.

664
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,614
So, tell me, what's
on your mind?

665
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:56,254
What do you want?

666
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,928
I want to get better.

667
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,063
Whatever the hell that means.

668
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,163
I'm sick of being miserable.

669
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:08,604
So you'd like to be happy?

670
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:11,074
Again with the reflecting.
Yes, I'd like to be happy.

671
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:13,236
Being happy is
an excellent goal.

672
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,212
Not many patients
can crystallize

673
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,924
exactly what they're
hoping to get out of this.

674
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:18,280
Well, bully for me.

675
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:20,375
So, now all we have to do

676
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:24,320
is figure out how to get
you from here to happy.

677
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,790
SSRIs? That's your
genius technique?

678
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,796
I don't think we should
ignore any tools that can help.

679
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,832
I know you don't have
a problem taking drugs.

680
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,833
For my leg. For pain.

681
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,336
Well, think of this as
being for psychic pain.

682
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:44,869
I don't want to change who I am.

683
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:45,966
Miserable?

684
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:54,243
You think that by taking
meds you'll lose your edge?

685
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,085
Stop making the unique connections
that make you a successful doctor?

686
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,090
If Van Gogh was your patient,

687
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,922
he'd be satisfied painting
houses instead of the <i>Starry Night.</i>

688
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:06,954
Van Gogh would still be making
inspired paintings of the night sky,

689
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:09,296
just maybe not from
the room of his asylum.

690
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:10,391
You don't know that.

691
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:13,404
I know both his
ears would be intact.

692
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:17,506
And I know his
life would be better.

693
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:31,687
I know this doesn't
come naturally to you,

694
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:36,491
but you want my help, which
means you need to trust me.

695
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,331
Hmm.

696
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,340
Delicious.

697
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,314
Why are you here?

698
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,655
Waiting for my communion wafer.

699
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,296
You're cheeking it, right?

700
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,128
Nope.

701
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:19,595
Tell me you're cheeking it.

702
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,895
I swallowed it.

703
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,406
No, you didn't. We
don't take meds.

704
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:24,840
You don't take meds, Alvie.

705
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:26,673
I decided to get sane.

706
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:28,804
You're scamming
again. You can tell me.

707
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,348
I'm not scamming, Alvie.

708
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,077
They broke you.

709
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,989
They didn't break
me. I am broken.

710
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,857
And stop worshipping me and
go worry about your own loser life.

711
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:51,425
I hate you.

712
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:03,813
Prom?

713
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,247
Got an assignment for you.

714
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:06,841
Role playing?

715
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,020
I'm not sure how pretending
to be a businessman

716
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:13,319
with a foot fetish is going
to help, but I'm game.

717
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,691
Have you connected with
any of the other patients?

718
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:18,024
You've been here four weeks.

719
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:21,429
Tell me about your relationships
with the other patients.

720
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:25,561
Diane is convinced
that Silent Girl hates her.

721
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,332
Richter is not as
paranoid as you think,

722
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,636
he just likes that
you think that,

723
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:31,141
and my roommate hates me.

724
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,448
Only one of the things you said

725
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,674
indicated how somebody
else feels about you. So...

726
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:41,080
I'm sure they've done some form
of rudimentary analysis on me,

727
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:42,279
concluded that I'm a jerk.

728
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:45,221
You know, there is a way for
them to find out things about you

729
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,121
without deductive reasoning.

730
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:48,750
I have had relationships.

731
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:50,886
You've screwed up relationships.

732
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,863
Every one of them. Almost
like that was the goal.

733
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:58,494
I want you to trust people.

734
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,236
Try.

735
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,911
Get dressed.

736
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,321
Just open up?

737
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,393
Just open up. Trust.

738
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,537
Strangers?

739
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:36,698
We'll start with strangers,
then work our way up.

740
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:42,143
If it helps, I find "Hello" to
be an excellent ice breaker.

741
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,482
Hi.

742
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:55,488
Hi.

743
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,091
It's like hello, only shorter.

744
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,857
Yes.

745
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,592
Glad we were able
to save that time.

746
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,762
Judging by the fancy suit,
I'd say you were a donor,

747
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,137
but the nervous demeanor
says maybe you've had issues,

748
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,507
probably that's why this
place has personal meaning.

749
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,871
But this is supposed
to be about me.

750
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,448
I take advantage of my friends.

751
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,917
Friend, really.
I've only got one.

752
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,384
It can be tough sometimes.

753
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:29,552
I'm not gay.

754
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:30,627
Neither am I.

755
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,356
Actually, I am.

756
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,455
See that guy over there?

757
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:38,965
He's my lover. He's
also my psychiatrist.

758
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,062
Which some would argue
is a little inappropriate,

759
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,370
but they just don't know
what love is. Am I right?

760
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,216
You're not gay. No.

761
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:55,344
But I have to tell
intimate secrets to people.

762
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,679
Maybe they should be true.

763
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,485
Hadn't thought of that.

764
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,686
To be on the safe side, I
should probably do both.

765
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,492
Starting with the fun ones.
Come on, let's get me better.

766
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,364
Hi.

767
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:18,932
Hi.

768
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,643
I'm a philanderer.

769
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,111
Oh.

770
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,296
Philanderer doesn't mean
that I give a lot to charity,

771
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,320
it means...

772
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,753
I know what it means.

773
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:37,621
You were asking me if there
were any nuts in the hors d'oeuvres.

774
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:38,754
What?

775
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:40,758
Honey.

776
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,661
What did my husband
just say to you?

777
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:52,907
I was asking him if there
were nuts in the hors d'oeuvres.

778
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,569
Then where is your EpiPen?

779
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:55,738
My what?

780
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,942
No one with an allergy would
walk around without an EpiPen.

781
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:00,314
Give me your purse. No.

782
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:02,046
Give me your purse. Stop. No.

783
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,556
What really happened is...

784
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:10,684
I thought he was
cute. I hit on him.

785
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:11,956
We're going.

786
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:21,562
You having fun?

787
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,334
I did connect with one guy,

788
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,877
but then my propensity for
screwing things up overtook me.

789
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,747
Then my desire to have
fun overcame my propensity.

790
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,752
You didn't screw it up.

791
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,085
The assignment wasn't to get you to
trust people with a piece of your soul,

792
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,388
the assignment was to
teach you that you can trust.

793
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:47,459
Did any of these people rat you
out as the obnoxious womanizer

794
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:50,501
or the porn producer
that they think you are?

795
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:56,536
Why do you think that people would
treat you worse if they knew the truth?

796
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,908
Good night, Doctor.

797
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,212
Are you in trouble?

798
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,353
Apparently not.

799
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:15,587
So, what's next? You
wanna be my pimp?

800
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,388
Why don't we just talk?

801
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,028
Okay.

802
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:29,665
How come you weren't pissed
at me for stealing your car?

803
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,773
It was a nice thing to do.

804
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,904
Hmm. I'm not sure about the
German-English translation of "nice."

805
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:42,283
The stealing was nice or the
ruining of Freedom Master's life?

806
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:47,682
What you did was
misguided and irresponsible,

807
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,357
but it was also nice.

808
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:53,591
You gave him a moment
of pure happiness.

809
00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:00,404
You asked me why I come
here so often to visit Annie.

810
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,701
She was my best friend.

811
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:09,110
Then she started pulling
away from everybody.

812
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:12,241
The doctors don't know why.

813
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,884
I think I married her brother

814
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:21,824
because he was the only other one
who was going through the same thing.

815
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:27,223
But he stopped visiting
after a couple of years.

816
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:31,393
I just couldn't stop.

817
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,572
I miss her.

818
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,072
I should go.

819
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:49,720
Good night.

820
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,365
Good night.

821
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,250
So, what happened?

822
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:27,650
You're talking to me now.

823
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:28,953
No.

824
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,532
Was it fun?

825
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,564
Yeah.

826
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,905
She kissed me.

827
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:56,919
Don't read into the phrasing.
We kissed each other.

828
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:58,227
And how do you feel about that?

829
00:55:58,255 --> 00:56:02,124
How do I feel about that? It was
a kiss. Kisses are good things.

830
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:04,154
Okay.

831
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,555
That was a loaded "okay."

832
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,530
Not at all. Why would
you assume that?

833
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,626
You're being judgmental.

834
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,434
If I'd said that I had some delicious
Chilean sea bass for dinner last night,

835
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,350
would you say, "And how
do you feel about that?"

836
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,138
If the sea bass
was married, I might.

837
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,644
See, you're being judgmental.

838
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,674
Isn't that against your
code or something?

839
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,444
I'm simply stating the obvious.

840
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,849
It's complicated, not just
because she's married

841
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:31,753
and not just because
you're institutionalized.

842
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:36,089
I know you spent the last 12 hours
trying to figure out what that kiss means.

843
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:41,258
Who was that woman you
were with in the parking lot?

844
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,026
When you deflect,

845
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,365
it's more effective when
you're not that transparent.

846
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:48,030
Obviously you have no
problem with infidelity.

847
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:52,509
You're trying to rationalize that if
it's okay for your doctor, it's okay.

848
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,045
But just for the record, I
am not having an affair.

849
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:57,257
Then who is she? Why do
you think you're working so hard

850
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:59,058
to figure out the details
of my personal life?

851
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,211
Might not have to work so hard if
there were some personal items in here.

852
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:05,688
You've got one number
on speed dial, it says "Dad."

853
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,554
Come on, how old are you?

854
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,135
Why are you so afraid
to talk about this?

855
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,638
I want to talk about you. I want to
know who I'm taking advice from.

856
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:13,927
I'm not giving you advice,
I'm asking you questions.

857
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,933
I think that kiss meant a
lot. I think that scares you.

858
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,992
I think there are no
personal items in here

859
00:57:19,069 --> 00:57:20,731
because you have
no personal life.

860
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,534
How do you think
you and Lydia will end?

861
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,575
You are a lonely man.

862
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,042
You've screwed up every
opportunity you've had in life.

863
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,942
What's the ending to this story?

864
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:35,575
I don't know.

865
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:41,349
Visiting time.

866
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,742
Why did you kiss me?

867
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,445
How many reasons are there?

868
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,855
I like you. It felt like a nice
way of showing you that.

869
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,336
How'd it go with Lydia?

870
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:09,972
I found out she can only be happy
so long before the catatonic guy

871
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:15,281
with two broken limbs rolls off the
elevator. Philosophically speaking.

872
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:18,845
Why do you value your failures
more than your successes?

873
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,154
My mother caught me masturbating
to pictures of her mother.

874
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,558
Can we get past
these cute deflections?

875
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:29,995
Successes only last until someone
screws them up. Failures are forever.

876
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,036
So you accept that fact?

877
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,437
You accept that there's
nothing you can do?

878
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,974
Okay. I accept the fact
that there's nothing I can do.

879
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,669
Now what can I do?

880
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:43,942
You acknowledge failure
and you move past it.

881
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:45,811
You apologize.

882
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,443
Wow.

883
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,720
Powerful things,
these apologies.

884
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,621
You get someone
to jump off a building,

885
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,353
you say two words and
you move on with your life.

886
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,418
Hardly seems fair.

887
00:59:58,495 --> 00:59:59,758
Is that the issue?

888
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,260
You caused him pain.

889
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:11,241
If the world is just, you
have to suffer equally?

890
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,404
You're not God, House.

891
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:22,249
You're just another screwed-up
human being who needs to move on.

892
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:27,947
Apologize to him.
Let yourself feel better.

893
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:34,290
Then you can learn to let
yourself keep feeling better.

894
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,052
Hey.

895
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,571
Dr. House. Everything okay?

896
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,104
Yeah.

897
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:23,978
Time for group.
Group time, everybody.

898
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,915
I have a surprise.

899
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:34,219
Two weeks from today, we're going
to have the Mayfield Talent Show.

900
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,889
Talent show? Who's in it?

901
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,953
I'd really love it if everybody
here could participate.

902
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,555
But then who's gonna watch?

903
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,897
The staff will come.
Friends and family.

904
01:01:44,968 --> 01:01:46,095
Are you going to tape this?

905
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,569
No, it's just for us.

906
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,402
Well, if it's just for us,
I vote we don't do it.

907
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:55,309
Think of it as a fun way to
work on our therapeutic issues.

908
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,711
Alvie, maybe you could
sing one of your songs.

909
01:01:57,781 --> 01:01:59,272
I don't sing, I rap.

910
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:01,818
Okay. Well, you can
write something just for us.

911
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:04,878
I don't write. I just
do. Freestyle style.

912
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,787
I think you're gonna
wanna be prepared.

913
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,791
Make something special.

914
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:10,190
Always special.

915
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,924
How about you, Diane? Is
there something you'd like to do?

916
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:15,761
I don't have any talents.

917
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,666
Sure, you do. You all do.

918
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:21,497
Steve, don't you think
that Diane has hidden talent

919
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,063
that we'd all like
to see come out?

920
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,607
You really think
he's going to answer?

921
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,475
Eventually. Why?

922
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:32,672
Because things pass.

923
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,776
Things change, doesn't
mean they get better.

924
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,012
You gotta make things better,

925
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:39,613
you can't just keep talking
and hope for the best.

926
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,960
Diane, maybe you and I can work
together and figure something out.

927
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:48,927
I can save him.

928
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,864
"They stole her voice
box." That's what he said.

929
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,098
That's what she was staring at.

930
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:56,503
That's why he's staring.

931
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:58,269
Dr. House, please.

932
01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,685
Because there's a
music box in there.

933
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,938
Orderly.

934
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,738
Come on, just
give it to me. I can...

935
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:08,615
I'm not having a
psychotic break.

936
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:10,313
I promise you this will work.

937
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,454
It's that blue box
on the top shelf.

938
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:29,104
This is what you wanted. This
is what you needed. A voice.

939
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,135
You thought you could
cure Silent Girl with this.

940
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,201
So by your own rationale,
it should cure you.

941
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,208
There's nothing wrong
with you. You're healing.

942
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:42,582
All the parts work. Just speak.

943
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:45,886
Come on. Speak. Say something.

944
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:48,550
I think maybe everyone
should take a break now.

945
01:03:57,334 --> 01:04:01,066
You're trying to fix,
instead of moving on.

946
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:25,393
I brought Dvorák. Four hands.

947
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,560
What?

948
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,495
I need to know what this is.

949
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,733
It's sheet music.

950
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:44,580
I told you. It's just
two people having fun.

951
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:47,983
There's two possible outcomes.

952
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:52,386
It ends, someone gets hurt, or it
doesn't end and someone gets hurt.

953
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,652
So the end sucks, it doesn't
mean the beginning has to.

954
01:04:58,161 --> 01:05:02,861
Everything ends, life ends. It
doesn't mean that we can't enjoy it.

955
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,666
I can't... I can't do this.

956
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:12,636
All I know is I was happy five
minutes ago, and now I'm not.

957
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,573
How is that better?

958
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:18,672
Goodbye, Lydia.

959
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:28,723
I'm really worried about ECT.

960
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:32,229
Apprehension's normal.
Has anyone else had it?

961
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,127
They shocked me, man.

962
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:37,899
Thanks, that's very reassuring.

963
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:40,002
I don't know if I should do it.

964
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,664
Just do the
treatment or shut up.

965
01:05:42,739 --> 01:05:44,105
Greg, there's a process.

966
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:47,975
Yes, a process. Wouldn't want
to disrupt the process with results.

967
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,603
Hizzy had a rough
night last night.

968
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,672
Guess he decided to go back to
being an ass instead of a hypocrite.

969
01:05:52,749 --> 01:05:54,479
Let's move on.

970
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:57,453
Alvie, are you making any
progress writing your rap?

971
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,890
Yeah. But really, no. I just don't
want to write my songs down,

972
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,622
it takes all the spontaneity
out of it, it's not of the moment.

973
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,095
Alvie, if you write
things down...

974
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:12,360
<i>When the time comes, my rhyme
comes When my spotlight shines...</i>

975
01:06:13,236 --> 01:06:16,695
Yeah. You're a genius.
Rhymes with penius.

976
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:21,143
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Beasley.
Dr. Nolan asked me to give you this.

977
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:27,548
Is this a day pass?

978
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:29,051
He'd like to see you.

979
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,803
Thanks for coming.

980
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,104
I was hoping you could
take a look at my dad's chart.

981
01:06:55,078 --> 01:06:57,741
A consult? What happened?

982
01:06:57,814 --> 01:07:00,443
You went through every
sane doctor in town?

983
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,782
I thought you wouldn't
mind getting off the ward.

984
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:09,757
The cleaning lady found
him on the kitchen floor.

985
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:14,025
Doctors here don't think that he'll
recover. That I should pull the plug.

986
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:18,330
I want a second opinion, so I
thought I'd be a fool not to call you.

987
01:07:21,938 --> 01:07:25,773
Lacunar infarct converted
to hemorrhagic stroke.

988
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:30,336
He squashed his brain.
They didn't miss anything.

989
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:32,907
That's what I thought.

990
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,917
That's what you knew.

991
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:39,053
His brain has been
replaced by blood.

992
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:44,618
It's over, and it's obvious to any doctor
who looked at that scan. Even a shrink.

993
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:47,425
You want someone to tell you
that what you need to do is okay.

994
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:49,989
You need permission. Absolution.

995
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,796
Not now, House.

996
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,633
You have no friends, no family.

997
01:07:55,705 --> 01:08:00,268
At some point, you made a
mistake, you lost everything.

998
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,771
And now I'm the closest
thing you got to a friend.

999
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,315
Just shut up.

1000
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:11,712
I don't need you
here to play this game.

1001
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:05,801
I'm sorry I pushed you away.

1002
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,509
It's what I do when I'm afraid.

1003
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:14,644
Again, the German-English
translation may be a little off.

1004
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:20,551
I'm not crying because of you.

1005
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:24,589
I'm crying because I'm pathetic.

1006
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:31,099
I brought her cello. In case she
magically wakes up for the show.

1007
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,200
Well, then I take
the apology back.

1008
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:40,235
We're all pathetic. It's what
makes everything interesting.

1009
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,938
I'm sick of life
being interesting.

1010
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:53,327
<i>You're nobody 'til
somebody loves you</i>

1011
01:12:54,003 --> 01:12:59,533
<i>You're nobody 'til
somebody cares</i>

1012
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:40,176
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the
one, the only, Juan Alvarez!</i>

1013
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,551
<i>Yo, yo, what's up? Ward
Six is jumping off, y'all.</i>

1014
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:52,117
<i>Give it up for DJ Richter
on the ones and twos.</i>

1015
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:54,595
<i>Yo, DJ Richter, spin that.</i>

1016
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,770
<i>Welcome to Mayfield
Where the day feels long</i>

1017
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,307
<i>We act strong But there's
got to be something wrong</i>

1018
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:08,401
<i>See, we got hidden talents
You don't see hidden secrets</i>

1019
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,106
<i>If we could show you those...</i>

1020
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,414
<i>If we could show you those...</i>

1021
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:28,126
<i>Then we wouldn't have no regrets</i>

1022
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:35,264
<i>Wanna know my secret?
Sit back and let me explain it</i>

1023
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:38,103
<i>My Pop split, Momma
got sick Cliché, ain't it?</i>

1024
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:40,769
<i>Now I'm a manic Hispanic
I'm trying to make it work</i>

1025
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,210
<i>But the doctors
think I'm lazy...</i>

1026
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,547
<i>And my roommate is a jerk</i>

1027
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,249
<i>Dr. House is in the house, y'all</i>

1028
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,318
<i>Give it up for Dr. House
to the stage, y'all</i>

1029
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:02,559
<i>Paging Dr. House
to the stage, y'all</i>

1030
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:08,127
<i>Are you there, Dr. House?
It's on, bring it on, on</i>

1031
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:11,663
<i>Oh, yo, he's coming
to the stage, y'all</i>

1032
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:16,406
<i>It's Dr. House on the remix
Dr. House on the remix</i>

1033
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:18,948
<i>Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo</i>

1034
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,849
<i>They say to take their pills
They say don't be a creep</i>

1035
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:24,182
<i>But how can I get better...</i>

1036
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:28,023
<i>If I can't get no sleep</i>

1037
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:32,152
<i>You gotta think before
you act in order to progress</i>

1038
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:37,659
<i>If you don't make connections
then your whole life is a mess</i>

1039
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,433
<i>Yeah, so tell me, Doctor
what I really gotta know</i>

1040
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,507
<i>How do I get better?</i>

1041
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,076
<i>Just do a talent show!</i>

1042
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:51,640
<i>Oh, well, I guess I'm just a
mess, yes! Preach it to me, brother</i>

1043
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:52,977
<i>A life of restlessness</i>

1044
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,847
<i>But at least we have each other!</i>

1045
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:57,079
<i>We got each other!
We got each other!</i>

1046
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:58,781
<i>Like two brothers
from another mother</i>

1047
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:01,483
<i>Duck and run for cover Ward Six</i>

1048
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:13,467
How are you doing?
You hanging in there?

1049
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:16,199
Usually, I open with that.

1050
01:16:18,808 --> 01:16:20,936
Thanks for staying.

1051
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:25,876
So, what do you
want to talk about?

1052
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,248
Things are actually...

1053
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:32,649
Actually good.

1054
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,966
You're not just saying that
because you don't want to complain

1055
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,858
in front of the guy
who just lost his father?

1056
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,327
I'm not that cured.

1057
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,622
I still got stuff to do,

1058
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:46,502
but I'm good.

1059
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,976
I'm sorry.

1060
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:13,259
I was trying to prove a point.

1061
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,463
I was trying to be right.

1062
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,097
I ended up putting you
in a dangerous situation,

1063
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:24,663
and I was not
equipped to handle it.

1064
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,972
And you got hurt,
and it's my fault.

1065
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,638
And I'm sorry.

1066
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:43,423
Med time.

1067
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:52,163
I'm going to try one of
those pink ones today. You?

1068
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,212
Thank you.

1069
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:49,218
You're welcome.

1070
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:00,460
Got a surprise.

1071
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:19,644
Today we're here to
congratulate Annie.

1072
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:25,719
We are proud of her, we
wish her well, and we hope to

1073
01:20:25,788 --> 01:20:28,781
- never see her again.
- Never see her again.

1074
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,434
If you go silent
for over a decade,

1075
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:46,771
you don't just get to slide
right back into society.

1076
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:52,973
She's going to a rehab
facility first. In Arizona.

1077
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,077
Her family's moving there.

1078
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:03,948
I'm sorry, House. I
just found out myself.

1079
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:11,263
I want an overnight pass.

1080
01:21:16,772 --> 01:21:17,933
I can help you with this.

1081
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:19,406
I've earned it. You have, but...

1082
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:22,809
Isn't extending trust part of the
whole "getting me better" thing?

1083
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,177
If you insist on a
pass, I'll give it to you.

1084
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:28,979
But I know where you're going and I
know you haven't thought it through.

1085
01:21:29,852 --> 01:21:32,583
We need to sit down
and talk about this.

1086
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,316
Please give me the pass.

1087
01:22:03,886 --> 01:22:05,115
Hi.

1088
01:22:05,187 --> 01:22:07,088
Hello. Who are you?

1089
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:08,556
I'm...

1090
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,285
Ben, go inside, okay?

1091
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,202
You didn't say anything.

1092
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:24,901
And now Annie's leaving, and
I hear you're going to Arizona.

1093
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,743
My husband travels
to Phoenix a lot,

1094
01:22:28,811 --> 01:22:31,178
his corporate
headquarters are there.

1095
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:32,771
We've been wanting
to move for years,

1096
01:22:32,848 --> 01:22:35,340
but we've been tethered here.

1097
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,908
Now we're not.

1098
01:22:39,388 --> 01:22:41,254
I don't want you to go.

1099
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:44,757
I don't want to go.

1100
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:49,928
But I can't break up my family.

1101
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,796
I can't leave my children.

1102
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:56,368
I just don't want it to change.

1103
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:03,776
I'm sorry that I didn't
come to say goodbye.

1104
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:09,482
I thought it ended
kind of perfect.

1105
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,753
I have to go.

1106
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:41,574
Not the most exciting use of
the overnight pass I've ever seen.

1107
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:43,016
She left.

1108
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:45,918
And

1109
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:48,554
I'm lost.

1110
01:24:01,837 --> 01:24:03,863
I'm gonna write your letter,

1111
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,404
to the medical board,

1112
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:09,240
recommending that they
give your license back.

1113
01:24:09,311 --> 01:24:13,544
You can't just console me by giving
me a lollipop when I skin my knee.

1114
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:14,844
Two things just happened.

1115
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:17,853
You got hurt, which means
you connected to someone else

1116
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,548
strongly enough to miss them.

1117
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:22,785
And more important,
you recognized the pain

1118
01:24:22,858 --> 01:24:27,125
and came to talk to me, instead
of hiding from it in a Vicodin bottle.

1119
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:31,023
The fact that you're
hurting and you came here,

1120
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:34,627
the fact that you're taking your
meds, and we're talking right now.

1121
01:24:37,339 --> 01:24:39,570
Come inside and get some sleep.

1122
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:42,577
Tomorrow, you can start
saying your goodbyes.

1123
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:52,619
Today we're here
to congratulate Greg.

1124
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:57,057
We are proud of him, we
wish him well, and we hope to

1125
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,993
- never see him again.
- Never see him again.

1126
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:01,760
House.

1127
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,542
Back off. People
already think we're gay.

1128
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:39,888
What do you need, Alvie?

1129
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:41,020
My meds.

1130
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:45,460
I want to get better.
