1
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,128
A crane collapsed
in downtown Trenton.

2
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,570
Don't care.

3
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,636
My great-grandfather.

4
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,509
No, it's just a book he wrote.

5
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,248
Open it up.

6
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,479
Seriously? You're
giving this to us?

7
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:56,988
It's a big step you're taking.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,855
I wanted to congratulate you.

9
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,861
I understand that's
the adult thing to do.

10
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,396
How did you know?

11
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,055
I've known for a while.

12
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:08,125
The fact that you decided to
cohabitate is not exactly a spoiler.

13
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,528
Unless my intel is wrong.

14
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,173
Trouble in paradise?

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,902
We have to get to Trenton.

16
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,081
Somebody, help me.

17
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,328
Can you hear me?

18
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,599
Hmm.

19
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,704
Did that sound like a "yes"?

20
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,676
Sir, we have to get you to the
OR. You have a bad wound,

21
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,372
but we're gonna pack it and
transport you as fast as we can.

22
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:05,008
Skull fracture. Glasgow Coma
score of 11. She's immediate.

23
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,288
Move on. This guy's dead.

24
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,355
His wounds aren't so...

25
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,255
Forget the wound,
look at his toes.

26
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,692
Atherosclerotic emboli. He'll
never survive the surgery.

27
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,286
Maybe his shoes were too tight.

28
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:19,231
It's not the shoes, skin
shows smoker's facies.

29
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,576
He's not gonna
make it to morning.

30
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,040
He'll just take up
an ambulance ride,

31
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:23,468
surgeons' time and an ICU bed.

32
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,135
He's expectant. Leave him.

33
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,746
I only nodded off for a second.

34
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,373
I lost control of the
load. I'm so sorry.

35
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,126
Don't worry. We're
gonna get you out of here.

36
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,675
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:39,929
He's secure. McCREANEY: Ready?

38
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,353
Three, two, one.

39
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,524
Crane operator. He made
it through amazingly well.

40
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,592
Lucid and responsive,
stable fracture, right humerus.

41
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,293
Haven't gotten to
his lower half yet.

42
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,998
Tell me when something hurts.

43
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,638
I fell asleep, killed
all those people.

44
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,731
Something other
than your conscience.

45
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,442
Is that a pill in your pocket

46
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,878
or are you just happy to
have a tiny, pill-shaped penis?

47
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,010
Caffeine pills.

48
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,152
You fell asleep taking these?

49
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,812
I drank two cups of coffee, too.

50
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,246
Is that normal for you?

51
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,346
No, I hate coffee.

52
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,858
I'm working on no sleep.
My daughter has the flu.

53
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,917
This much caffeine
for a coffee virgin...

54
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,864
There's no way he fell
asleep. He passed out.

55
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,159
Which means a
neurological disorder

56
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,826
caused the crash, not fatigue.

57
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,426
Hey!

58
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,370
We're taking the crane
operator back to Princeton.

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,272
They said he was
barely hurt, he can wait.

60
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,201
Steal an ambulance
and call the team.

61
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,354
Tell them we've got a case.

62
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,177
House, no. I need you here.

63
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,874
But he needs me there, and
he moans louder than you do.

64
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,670
There were over 100
people in that building,

65
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,381
only 76 have been accounted for.

66
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,288
Foreman and your team can
handle the crane operator for now.

67
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,469
Having fun down there?

68
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:14,547
<i>Lots!</i>

69
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,374
Every time Cuddy
leans over a patient,

70
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,883
it's another opportunity
for a downblouse nipslip.

71
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,255
What's going on
between her and Lucas?

72
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,689
Besides them moving in together?

73
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,919
That's not enough for you?

74
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,990
I gave her the
housewarming gift earlier,

75
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,724
and she paused
for a split second,

76
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,596
like she was hiding something.

77
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,326
It's probably her moral
revulsion at housewarming gifts.

78
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,367
Or maybe she didn't
want to accept a gift

79
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,997
for something she
wasn't gonna do.

80
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,610
<i>You actually think they're
not moving in together?</i>

81
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,945
What was that? You okay?

82
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,071
<i>Yeah.</i>

83
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,874
Vending machine collapsed.

84
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,816
She still using your
ex-wife as her realtor?

85
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,115
<i>As far as I know.</i>

86
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,721
<i>Well, know a little farther,
will you? Look into it.</i>

87
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:32,951
Hey!

88
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,723
Somebody down here!

89
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,798
If you can hear me, tap
three times or call out.

90
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,838
Is anyone there?

91
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,670
I'm not getting anything.

92
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,975
I heard something. There's
got to be a void down there.

93
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,393
There's a million voids down
there, it was the parking garage.

94
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,961
But our equipment hasn't
picked up any movement,

95
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,263
dogs haven't
picked up any scent.

96
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,497
There's smashed cars down there,

97
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,299
you don't think that gasoline
could throw off their scent?

98
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,121
We gotta get back to work, okay?

99
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,751
We'll get to this area
soon. Excuse me.

100
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,113
Anybody hear me?

101
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,590
Hey! Can anybody hear me?

102
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,286
Help me.

103
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,823
What's your name?

104
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,796
Please...

105
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,466
My husband's gift...

106
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:39,445
I was supposed to pick it
up at the framers. It's on Elm.

107
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,756
You should have told me earlier,

108
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,874
I could've picked
it up on the way.

109
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,110
What's your name?

110
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,951
It's a picture from our
Tortola trip for his birthday.

111
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,321
I'm not asking your name
because I wanna become friends.

112
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,083
I'm trying to gauge
your mental state.

113
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,423
Hanna.

114
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,594
Okay, that's a start.
What day of the week is it?

115
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,798
Tuesday.

116
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:00,890
Better still.

117
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:03,829
What happened?

118
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,439
You know that giant
construction crane next door?

119
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,203
It's kind of on top
of you right now.

120
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,403
Okay, I'm gonna
try to pull you out.

121
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,680
Ow! My leg!

122
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,513
Okay. Okay.

123
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,384
I really need to get help.

124
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,791
No. Stay.

125
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,523
Someone else will come.

126
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:30,859
No one knows I'm down here.

127
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,166
Please! Stay with me!

128
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,592
Don't leave me in the dark!

129
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,330
I'll be right back.

130
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,996
No! Don't leave me in the dark!

131
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,302
Please stay!

132
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,206
He's still in the ER, House.

133
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,757
We haven't had time
to start a differential.

134
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,876
Perfect, we'll start right
now. Put me on speaker.

135
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,820
What causes syncope?

136
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,254
Your guy's stable. The
two dozen other patients...

137
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,553
Don't need to be diagnosed,

138
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,322
they just need to be bandaged.

139
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,158
What causes syncope?

140
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,425
Vasovagal reaction.

141
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,160
Meningioma, sick
sinus syndrome...

142
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,862
<i>Or you're wrong and
he just fell asleep.</i>

143
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,547
How's he gonna sleep
with 50 cups of coffee

144
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:12,664
going through his veins?

145
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,049
Were you never a
medical resident?

146
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,339
I hear Ten, Eleven and
Twelve. Where's Thirteen?

147
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,503
She's not here.

148
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,688
And answer to your
next question is,

149
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,823
"I don't know where she is."

150
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,658
Do you have the answer
to my question after that?

151
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,481
<i>A space-occupying lesion
in his brain is most likely.</i>

152
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,120
MRI will prove I'm right.

153
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,945
Or it'll just prove he suffered
head trauma from the crash.

154
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,389
Which we'd want to find anyway.

155
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,926
Two birds with one scan. Do it.

156
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,958
Having trouble finding
a vein for Hanna's IV.

157
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,891
Is she getting weaker? Paler?

158
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,024
No, no, she's stable.

159
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,297
That means her blood loss is
minimal. It buys us some time.

160
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,803
Get the IV into her tibia.

161
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,705
It's almost hollow, feeds
into the venous system.

162
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,968
Which they, obviously, don't
teach you in EMT school.

163
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,658
This side's still leaning pretty
bad, got to shore up this beam.

164
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,053
What do you got?

165
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,526
We need six 4X4s...

166
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,223
Told you I'd be back.

167
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,964
Heard you might be thirsty.

168
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,431
I assume that bodes
well for the rescue.

169
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,436
Structural beam, high-compression
concrete. I can't break it up.

170
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,938
You can't get me out of here?

171
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,704
No. Just means
we're gonna move on

172
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,404
to a different
piece of equipment.

173
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,572
I got airbags coming
in that'll lift 70 tons.

174
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,443
What's your name?

175
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,247
You testing my mental state?

176
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,345
If I'm gonna be stuck
down here for a while,

177
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,049
I'd like somebody to talk to.

178
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,200
Look, the guy who just left

179
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,102
is the one who's gonna be
holding your hand through all this.

180
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,389
You can talk to him.

181
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:42,852
Little pinch.

182
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,224
Ow! Ow!

183
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,601
Okay. Big pinch.

184
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,030
I got to call my husband.
Can I use your phone?

185
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,501
No bars down here.

186
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,369
<i>L'chaim.</i>

187
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,341
Where're you going? Don't worry.

188
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,111
Fire Marshal Bill
will be back soon.

189
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,224
So, I hope I didn't weird
you out, giving you that gift.

190
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,726
Can we talk about this later?

191
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,959
Of course.

192
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,393
Is now later?

193
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,832
Maybe things aren't
going so well with Lucas?

194
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,704
If so, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to step into anything.

195
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,040
There's no problems. We're
doing just great. Thank you.

196
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,707
So why the weirdness?

197
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,182
Can you help?

198
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,990
When I opened it, I didn't
think it was a housewarming gift,

199
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,789
I thought it was an
engagement present.

200
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,532
It just happened last night.

201
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,473
No wonder you'd
wanna hide this from me,

202
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,065
since I'm such
a delicate flower.

203
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,271
I didn't know what to say,

204
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,664
and I've been
slightly distracted.

205
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,541
That might make sense, except
you're not wearing the ring.

206
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,412
So you are hiding it,
which begs the question...

207
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,919
House, it's in my office drawer

208
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,047
because I knew I
was coming here.

209
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,254
It's not weird,
there's no mystery.

210
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,721
I'm just getting married.

211
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,896
Excuse me.

212
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,726
<i>How much longer?</i>

213
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,763
Less than a minute.
Are you in any pain?

214
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,776
<i>Nothing new. Just a
little claustrophobic.</i>

215
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,577
<i>Shouldn't you be taking
care of those other people?</i>

216
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,874
<i>The ones that I hurt?</i>

217
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,144
Everything checks out okay.

218
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,519
My nose is bleeding.

219
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,258
It's expected, given the
trauma you've sustained.

220
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,463
That's not expected.

221
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,686
The way things fell,
this support beam

222
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,872
is now holding up a
giant pile of rubble.

223
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,744
We can't lift it without
jeopardizing everyone down here.

224
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,415
So it's time to
discuss amputation.

225
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,352
No.

226
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,591
Please listen to me. You've
been down here almost two hours.

227
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,975
By the time they
clear away the rubble...

228
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,025
We're not cutting off her leg.

229
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,567
You don't have to rush to
this to make his job easier.

230
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,006
You kidding me?

231
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,132
We leave the leg pinned,

232
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,733
we're risking crush syndrome.

233
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,834
What's that?

234
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,971
Your leg isn't getting
enough circulation.

235
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,277
The longer it's pinned,
the more the muscle dies.

236
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,180
So what does that
mean, like a limp?

237
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,014
Dying muscles release poisons.

238
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,451
We free your leg, the poisons
rush back into your system.

239
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,716
It could stop your heart.

240
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,020
So could cheeseburgers.

241
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,818
Just get your lazy friends
to start moving that pile.

242
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,155
She's got two more hours before
crush syndrome could possibly set in.

243
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,009
McCREANEY: We're
digging up there by hand.

244
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,501
I can't guarantee
I can get 10 tons

245
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:09,934
of debris pulled
off in two hours.

246
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,334
Well, you need to try.

247
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,905
It's my leg.

248
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,452
McCREANEY: It's not just crush
syndrome you got to worry about, okay?

249
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,753
There's gas leaks, there's fire,

250
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,188
we can never rule out
secondary collapses,

251
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,852
no matter how much
we shore this thing up.

252
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,257
You think chopping
off someone's limb

253
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,307
inside a pile of
dirty rocks is safe?

254
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,011
Sepsis, fat embolism,
hemorrhage...

255
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,451
Those risks are nothing compared

256
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,318
to the risk of this thing
coming down again.

257
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:33,155
Captain, he's a jerk, but
that's what the patient wants.

258
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,922
Can we please just give
it a couple more hours?

259
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,091
Yeah.

260
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,537
I got to get up to triage.

261
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,668
Thank you, Doctor.

262
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,378
House.

263
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,876
You don't need to thank
me. It just makes sense.

264
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,183
Just promise me you
won't let them cut off my leg.

265
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,187
I promise.

266
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,467
Does that make you feel better?

267
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,653
For some reason, it does.

268
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,726
Your phone is working down here.

269
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,235
Switched carriers, better
rollover minutes. Talk.

270
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,168
MRI was clean, but afterwards

271
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,997
he started bleeding
out of his eyes and nose.

272
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,208
So there was something
wrong before the collapse.

273
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,904
Unless it's just conjunctive
coagulopathy from the trauma.

274
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,742
Yeah, yeah, you don't think
he was sick before, we get it.

275
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,008
<i>You're wrong.</i>

276
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,242
Brain infection?

277
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,443
Sorry I'm late.

278
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,929
- Where were you?
<i>- Physical therapy.</i>

279
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,216
I left my phone in my locker.

280
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,587
The infection causes
neurological symptoms,

281
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,489
goes systemic, and
DIC causes the bleed.

282
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,618
<i>Good theory.</i>

283
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,333
Except for the part
that there's no fever.

284
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,962
<i>Get an X-ray venogram.</i>

285
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,931
See if you can find a
reason for your existence.

286
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,324
<i>Also look for venous
sinus thrombosis.</i>

287
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,699
We would've seen it on the MRI.

288
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,635
Not if you were too
busy not looking for it.

289
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,137
We should X-ray for
a facial fracture first,

290
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,572
this could all be simple trauma.

291
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,007
Just do what I tell you.

292
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,175
<i>I'll be back in 10 minutes.</i>

293
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,639
You're leaving?

294
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,649
There's a dozen people
here who can save you.

295
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,916
I'm apparently the only one
who can save this other guy.

296
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:08,880
Wait.

297
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,322
Don't go.

298
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,597
Hanna's freaking out.

299
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,770
She's having a panic
attack, she can't breathe,

300
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,080
she's gonna rip out all her IVs.

301
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,231
So calm her down.

302
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:27,806
She wants you.

303
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,301
I'm flattered. Give her oxygen.

304
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,840
They won't let O2 down
there, fear of explosion.

305
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:38,316
You have to go back.
She needs you, House.

306
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,198
You only came back
because I freaked out, right?

307
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:06,041
Not at all. I just realized
how big and scary the world is,

308
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:09,310
and how cozy and
safe this little place is.

309
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,520
Thank you. I'm
sorry I needed you.

310
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,763
Here. Call your husband.

311
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,771
Charlie?

312
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,434
I'm here in...

313
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,772
They called you?

314
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,546
They're helping me.

315
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,110
Are you coming?

316
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,885
I don't know how this
could've happened.

317
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,692
It's your birthday.
I'm so sorry.

318
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,753
See, this is why I
lied about the phone.

319
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,096
Your BP is spiking, so you're
bleeding faster from your leg wound,

320
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,329
and we'll have less
time to save it. Hang up.

321
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,031
Okay. Okay, they're
telling me I have to go.

322
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,207
That was stupid of me.

323
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,475
It was nice.

324
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,050
I don't see that
as a contradiction.

325
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,379
He was already on his way.

326
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,756
He was in Baltimore and
they all saw it on the news.

327
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,855
How many people were hurt?

328
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,660
What did I tell you about not
raising your blood pressure?

329
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,764
Can I ask what's
wrong with your leg?

330
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,333
Crane fell on it.

331
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,635
Small world.

332
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,373
You could've just said no.

333
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,215
I'll remember that for
my next human contact.

334
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,044
Would you pray with me?

335
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,980
No.

336
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:02,127
I'm not in the habit of encouraging
my patients' superstitions.

337
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,159
How's that a habit?

338
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,662
You plan on getting trapped
under a building again?

339
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,402
I don't believe in God.

340
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,262
I don't either.

341
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,570
Please.

342
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,585
I always thought

343
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,425
if I did the right thing,

344
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,922
if I treated people right,

345
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,665
then good things
would happen to me.

346
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,894
Do you think
that's how it works?

347
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,899
I didn't use to.

348
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,711
Then recently I tried.

349
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,644
Now I don't know.

350
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,422
McCREANEY: Good news.

351
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,622
Advancing catheter
through interior jugular vein.

352
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,767
You told House
you were at therapy.

353
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,303
Did you transcribe
the entire meeting?

354
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,270
Entering the cavernous sinus.

355
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,637
Your therapy's on Thursdays.

356
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,934
It got rescheduled.
Injecting dye.

357
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,308
Really?

358
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,143
I'm not gonna rat
you out, we're friends.

359
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,985
I just wanna make
sure you're okay.

360
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,418
No filling defects.

361
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,027
Don't worry. I'm okay.

362
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,665
Do you think we could be
friends when I get out of here?

363
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,332
Yeah.

364
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,133
We'll catch a ball game or a
group sex show or something.

365
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,609
Put it in there.

366
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,648
Okay, when the beam starts
lifting, you're gonna feel pain.

367
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,648
It's gonna be like your foot's
gone to sleep times a billion.

368
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,589
You'll notice that I'm
waiting till now to tell you.

369
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,691
We're ready.

370
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,085
Lifting.

371
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:21,196
I'm feeling the pain already.

372
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,661
That's good. Means
the pressure's coming off.

373
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,167
Closer to getting out of here.

374
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,371
Come on. Help me pull her out.

375
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,205
Come on.

376
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:37,306
It's moving!

377
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,483
Hanna!

378
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,214
Hanna!

379
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,820
What the hell happened?

380
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,293
McCREANEY: I think the adjacent
beam snapped during the lift.

381
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,958
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
We got a secondary collapse.

382
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,866
We're all right,
how are you guys?

383
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,632
<i>Rescue 1, copy the mayday.</i>

384
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,833
<i>Main tunnel looks fine.
Red Team is on the way.</i>

385
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,375
Lift this up.

386
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,002
One, two...

387
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,480
The kit. Give me the kit.

388
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:51,556
McCREANEY: All right.

389
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,462
No breath sounds on the left
side. Tension pneumothorax.

390
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,294
Hey, Hanna.

391
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,299
One of your lungs has collapsed.

392
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,994
I'm gonna have
to reinflate it, okay?

393
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,460
Hey, you better get back up top,

394
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:21,181
make sure you
didn't nick an artery.

395
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,258
I'm gonna have to go.

396
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,193
McCREANEY: It's
okay. You're all right.

397
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:40,835
You're lucky this isn't worse.

398
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,567
You know who's even luckier?

399
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,736
You and just about every other
human being who wasn't down there.

400
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,415
What did the venogram say?

401
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,713
Clean. Now the guy is
starting to spike a fever.

402
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,583
Subarachnoid bleed.

403
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:55,911
Meningitis?

404
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,065
He didn't say his neck was sore.

405
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,785
That's because
everything's sore.

406
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:02,157
He just took a 15-story swan
dive into concrete. Do an LP.

407
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,805
We also have to
consider other infections.

408
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,297
So you're suggesting
we do an LP?

409
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,627
I guess I am.

410
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,090
Genius.

411
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,824
Hey, bad news.

412
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,180
Because of the collapse,
we can't try the airbag again

413
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:13,866
until we get
everything off the top.

414
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,033
Be five, six hours, at least.

415
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,333
Then we have to amputate. No.

416
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,504
It's been four hours already.

417
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,014
It used to be a long
shot, now it's crazy.

418
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,244
Crush syndrome is basically
a build up of potassium.

419
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,649
If we remove potassium...

420
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,619
We're already treating
with sodium bicarbonate.

421
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,656
Not with glucose and insulin.

422
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,134
We got glucose in the kit, there's
got to be a diabetic here somewhere.

423
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,127
You want to dose
the insulin here?

424
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,356
In a non-hospital
setting? That is insane.

425
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,831
It's not worth it. Really?

426
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:41,876
Because I think I'm
the only one here

427
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,163
who knows what a leg is worth.

428
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,837
And fortunately, you're not
the one who's in charge, he is.

429
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,805
And he knows that
I'd testify against him

430
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,433
if Hanna sues
for cutting off a leg

431
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,238
without exhausting every option.

432
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,171
Give us a minute?

433
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,243
I know you're angry,

434
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:02,413
but please don't put her life
at risk just to get back at me.

435
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,455
Really? Wow.

436
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,359
So this is all about you now?

437
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:10,294
You took her side against me

438
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,024
right after you heard
about my engagement.

439
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,192
Yeah, that must be it. It's not
that you're a pathetic narcissist.

440
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:16,701
I don't love you.

441
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:21,096
So just accept it and
move on with your life

442
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,732
instead of making
everyone miserable.

443
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,935
That's great.

444
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,103
A life lesson from a
middle-aged single mom

445
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,476
who's dating a man-child.

446
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,645
Screw you.

447
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,114
I'm sick of making
excuses for you.

448
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,420
I'm sick of other people
having to tiptoe around you

449
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,687
and make their own lives worse

450
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,987
while they try to keep
you from collapsing.

451
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:42,751
I'm done.

452
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,895
Fantastic. Just stay
away from my patient.

453
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,099
What are you clinging to, House?

454
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,329
You're gonna risk her
life just to save her leg?

455
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,238
It really worked out
well for you, didn't it?

456
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,740
What do you have in
your life? Honestly, tell me.

457
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,115
I'm moving on.
Wilson is moving on.

458
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:06,414
And you? You've got
nothing, House. Nothing.

459
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:09,585
I'm going down there,

460
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:12,648
and I'm gonna convince
her to let me cut her leg off.

461
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,893
If you have any decency
left, you'll stay out of it.

462
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,327
No.

463
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,602
Dr. House promised.

464
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,235
If there was any other way...

465
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,779
It doesn't hurt right
now. I can wait.

466
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:38,707
Dr. House,

467
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:40,984
tell her.

468
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,851
Hanna,

469
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,891
we have to amputate your leg.

470
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:55,427
No. You said that
there was time.

471
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,799
There was. And it's run out.

472
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:01,833
No.

473
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,344
You asked me how
I had hurt my leg.

474
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,214
I had a blood clot, and
the muscle was dying.

475
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,261
And I had all these doctors
telling me I should amputate.

476
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,151
And I said no. And they did this

477
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,287
very risky operation.

478
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,952
I almost died.

479
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,186
But you saved your leg.

480
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,330
I wish I hadn't.

481
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,628
They cut out a chunk of
muscle about the size of my fist.

482
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,832
They left me with this
mutilated, useless thing.

483
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,074
And I'm in pain every day.

484
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,573
And it changed me.

485
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,476
It made me a harder person.

486
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,719
A worse person.

487
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,487
And now...

488
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,680
Now I'm alone.

489
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,026
You don't wanna be like me.

490
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,400
You got a husband who loves you.

491
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,134
You have friends,
you can start a family.

492
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,468
You have a life.

493
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,142
And this is just a leg.

494
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,127
Okay.

495
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,237
I got it.

496
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,987
I can't put you out 'cause it could
depress your respiration too much.

497
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,461
This should take
away some of the pain.

498
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,531
Will it be quick?

499
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,378
I'll use the scalpel to slice
through the skin, muscle and fat.

500
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,812
That should go pretty fast.

501
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,441
Then I'll switch over to the
electric saw when I get to the bone.

502
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,420
It's two bones about as
thick as a broom stick,

503
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,116
and takes about as
long to get through.

504
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,489
I'm gonna cut as close
to the concrete as I can.

505
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,460
Save as much of
your limb as possible.

506
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,189
Then the orthopedic surgeons

507
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,607
back at the hospital
will clean you up,

508
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,361
have you fitted
for a prosthetic.

509
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,661
You'll be running circles
around me in no time.

510
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,311
How bad will it hurt?

511
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,842
Like nothing you've
ever felt before.

512
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,923
Hanna.

513
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,057
Baby, I'm so sorry.

514
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,225
Shut up. It's all right.

515
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,030
You always loved my legs.

516
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:59,003
Baby, I don't care
about your legs.

517
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,595
Baby, I love you.

518
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,038
I love you.

519
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:03,439
I love you.

520
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,247
What?

521
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:46,149
He's fallen into a coma.
LP was clean, but...

522
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,344
<i>What are his vitals?</i>

523
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,648
Excuse me, Officer.

524
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,949
What do you mean "Officer"?

525
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,490
How long has there
been a cop there?

526
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,948
I don't know, 10 minutes.

527
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,085
He was being questioned
when he fell into the coma.

528
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:59,461
Was anything else making him nervous
or worried before his other symptoms?

529
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,275
He was claustrophobic
right before the bleed.

530
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,427
And before the
fever, we told him

531
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,094
that he probably
did fall asleep.

532
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,502
<i>It's his BP spiking.</i>

533
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,001
But that didn't cause
his first symptom.

534
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,009
Yeah, it did. All the caffeine.

535
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:13,705
We thought the
problem was in his toilet,

536
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,338
and by that, of course,
I mean his head,

537
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,171
<i>which distracted
us from the fact that</i>

538
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,149
<i>it could've been just a
clog in his sewer pipe,</i>

539
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,550
<i>and by that, of course, I
mean his spinal cord and...</i>

540
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,682
Blah, blah, blah,
blah. You get the idea.

541
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,720
An arachnoid cyst on his lower
spine, that's why we missed it.

542
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,256
He's been sitting
10 hours a day,

543
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,885
spiked his spinal
fluid pressure.

544
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,327
Run a CT...

545
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,698
BP 72 over 42.

546
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:35,995
Hanna?

547
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,036
Hanna? I can't breathe.

548
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,183
I can't breathe.

549
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,499
Breath sounds bilaterally.

550
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,373
It's not another pneumothorax.

551
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,876
Neck veins flat, no tamponade.

552
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,345
Damn it. I waited too long.

553
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,877
Hanna, you've got a clot in
your lungs. I'm gonna fix this.

554
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,547
IV streptokinase.

555
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,716
What's happening?
What's going on?

556
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,761
Her body won't get any oxygen
unless we can bust the clot.

557
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,920
This is a blood thinner.

558
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,561
Is she gonna be all right?

559
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,834
It'll make her bleed more,
we'll take care of that next.

560
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,141
It's not busting the clot.

561
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,808
Maybe it's the heart.

562
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,462
What? It's not a clot.

563
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:46,498
It's a fat embolism
from the amputation.

564
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,441
Okay. So what can we do?

565
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,338
Come on.

566
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,749
Do something. Please.
Please, do something.

567
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,812
Come on, guys, do
something. Come on.

568
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,982
Please, come on, do something.

569
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,719
Come on, do
something! Do something!

570
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:42,690
There's no way to
prevent a fat embolism.

571
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,956
Even if you'd
done this in an OR,

572
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,225
you couldn't have saved her.

573
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:04,180
You can't blame
yourself for her death.

574
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,615
This wasn't your fault.

575
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,276
That's the point!

576
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:10,083
I did everything right.
She died anyway.

577
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,924
Why the hell did you think that
would make me feel any better?

578
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,666
You shouldn't be
alone right now.

579
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,869
You're bleeding.

580
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,843
I'm gonna give you a
task, as an employee.

581
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,709
Get out of my way.

582
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,672
What's that?

583
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,435
I'm asking for some time off.

584
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,241
What's wrong?

585
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,487
Are you okay?

586
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,149
Obviously not.

587
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,511
You're gonna leap
across the room

588
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,776
and grab them out of my hand?

589
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:29,512
No.

590
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,556
It's your choice if you
wanna go back on drugs.

591
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,319
Okay.

592
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:41,025
Just so you know, I'm finding
it hard to see the downside.

593
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,625
You need to rebandage
your shoulder.

594
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,632
Is that why you're
here? Foreman sent you?

595
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:52,635
No.

596
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,702
Here to yell at me again?

597
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:55,803
No.

598
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,181
Well, I'm running out of ideas.

599
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,915
Lucas...

600
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,182
Oh, great.

601
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,450
You're feeling
uncomfortable again.

602
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,369
Probably means you just got back

603
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,089
for some quickie
wedding in Vegas,

604
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:11,390
or you're already pregnant...

605
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,760
I ended it.

606
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,093
What?

607
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,796
I'm stuck, House.

608
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,916
I keep wanting to move forward,

609
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,035
I keep wanting to
move on, and I can't.

610
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,406
I'm in my new house
with my new fiancé,

611
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,039
and all I can
think about is you.

612
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:37,611
I just need to know
if you and I can work.

613
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,990
You think I can fix myself?

614
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,497
I don't know.

615
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,738
'Cause I am the most
screwed up person in the world.

616
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:55,000
I know.

617
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,908
I love you.

618
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,874
I wish I didn't.

619
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,014
But I can't help it.

620
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,848
How do I know I'm
not hallucinating?

621
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,618
Did you take the Vicodin?

622
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,291
Nope.

623
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:58,493
Then I think we're okay.

624
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,564
Yeah.
