1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,802
Let's get back
to Phil and Diane.

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,940
Phil's been having a
hard time finding work,

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,504
and Diane wants him to talk to her
about his fear, his disappointment.

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:19,483
And Phil wants Diane to trust
him, that they'll get through this,

5
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,852
ideally without having to
keep discussing feelings.

6
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,422
Not your exact
words, but am I wrong?

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,091
And most guys out
there are the same way.

8
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:34,499
But, ladies, if you're
feeling frustrated, remember,

9
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,796
it's not our fault.

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,968
We were raised to be
strong, not emotional,

11
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,301
to deny vulnerability,
not embrace it.

12
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,676
And you know what that makes us?

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,042
Dinosaurs.

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,318
Nobody needs us to
hunt wild animals for food.

15
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:54,614
Nobody needs us to cut
down trees to build shelter.

16
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,481
They need us to evolve.

17
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,158
To catch up.

18
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:05,364
Since the 1960s, women's
roles have shifted radically.

19
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,999
And as their roles have changed,

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,836
so have women.

21
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,501
Well, they've become tougher,

22
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,206
more demanding
of us, their partners.

23
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,976
And who can blame
them? Who can...

24
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,249
Who can...

25
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,710
For expecting us to

26
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,512
do the...

27
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,723
Joe!

28
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,654
Joe. Joe.

29
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,367
We need an ambulance.

30
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,532
You want? I'm good.

31
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,407
Your limp's almost gone.

32
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,874
It pains me to interrupt
the collegial banter.

33
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,203
It pains me even more
to listen to it continue.

34
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,976
38-year-old man spikes a fever and
collapses during a speaking engagement.

35
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,643
ER checks out blood volume,

36
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,654
cardiac function and
autonomic reflexes. All normal.

37
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,487
Our patient makes a living telling
men to behave more like women.

38
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,289
Surprised you didn't throw psych
symptoms into the differential.

39
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,227
Either way, could
be a cerebral AVM.

40
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,765
ER did a head
CT, no sign of AVM.

41
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,891
Decent thought, though.

42
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,195
The patient's philosophy
makes perfect sense.

43
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,668
Its only flaw is
that it's impossible.

44
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:56,341
Evolution doesn't work that
way. You can't talk legs onto a fish.

45
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,342
If we're gonna go
extinct, we're gonna do it

46
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,745
drinking scotch and
driving muscle cars.

47
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,009
Am I right?

48
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:05,842
Am I... Thank you.

49
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,090
Cephalic fibromuscular
dysplasia? Doesn't explain the fever.

50
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,955
The patient's talking
about compromise.

51
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,427
If you don't think that's possible, you
don't think relationships are possible.

52
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,623
Anyone in this room in a
position to disprove that?

53
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,790
This guy's just
playing to his audience.

54
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,859
Women are by far the biggest
consumers of the self-help industry.

55
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,369
He could have a
pulmonary embolism.

56
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,270
Clot in his lung increases
right ventricular afterload,

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,651
drops the blood
flow to his brain.

58
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,041
We should do a
pulmonary angiogram.

59
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,169
Patient lacks major
risk factors for a PE.

60
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,474
Doesn't rule it out,
just makes it unlikely.

61
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,549
Maybe we start with a D-dimer?
Less invasive than the angiogram.

62
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:38,675
Good idea.

63
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,947
Fine.

64
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,384
Now, I am hereby
searching for a number two.

65
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,289
Which is why I'm
eating a lot of bran.

66
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:54,162
Also, I want a team leader,
someone to fill Foreman's old job.

67
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,197
Why? You're right.

68
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:02,207
We don't need any more structure.
It's not like we had a near-fatal stabbing.

69
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,014
Well, if it isn't the
old ball and Ukraine.

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,344
Who's that?

71
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,417
His wife.

72
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,082
Dominika.

73
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,185
House, you survived prison.

74
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,356
And you Atlantic City.

75
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,732
Where they also had gangs and
pruno, but slightly less recidivism.

76
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,237
I start Ukrainian
food truck business.

77
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:35,366
After gambling, win, lose,
everybody likes a little knish.

78
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,569
You're here

79
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,387
and I seem to remember
throwing out a bunch of

80
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,744
certified letters
from Immigration.

81
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,091
I'm assuming
there's a connection.

82
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,050
Our green card
interview is in four days.

83
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,747
They come to the apartment.
They ask questions about marriage,

84
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:51,917
vacations, family history, what
side of the bed each sleep on.

85
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,991
We've never taken a vacation, I
don't like your family, and on top.

86
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,795
I hear Kiev is lovely
at this time of year.

87
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,836
And your mother, who may or may
not be dead for all I know, misses you.

88
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:08,000
Can it be that genius doctor is afraid to
take on a silly government apparatchik?

89
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,812
I would say more not interested
than afraid, but why quibble?

90
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:14,938
Then I go to plan B.

91
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,686
Make you an offer
that cannot be refused.

92
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,432
How long have you
been doing seminars?

93
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,290
The marriage counseling,
just the past couple of years.

94
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,089
Before that I did
corporate coaching.

95
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,995
Can't imagine the same
advice works for both audiences.

96
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,823
Guess you shifted
with the market.

97
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,460
There's nothing cynical
about my husband. He and I...

98
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,629
It's okay. I get it.

99
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,769
What guy thinks men
should be more like women?

100
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,373
A macho jerk who got a big
wake-up call courtesy of three drunks

101
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,140
who beat the crap out of me
outside a sports bar in Milwaukee.

102
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:50,116
I'm guessing that explains the
broken wrist in your medical history.

103
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,779
Those morons did me
the biggest favor of my life.

104
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,050
I realized I'd
sacrificed my health

105
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:59,888
because I couldn't back down
from an argument over football.

106
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,696
Meeting Marlene was the
final piece in the puzzle.

107
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,129
She changed my career, my diet.

108
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,190
She gave me a whole
new direction in life.

109
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:13,330
We'll need to know exactly how
you changed your diet and when.

110
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,140
Need my apartment key back.

111
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,976
If you're breaking up with me,
can we at least talk about it first?

112
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,573
Maybe if you weren't
all nag and no shag...

113
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,149
I don't sleep with married men.

114
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,087
I'll get a copy made. You're
an ex-con. If you get caught

115
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,889
perjuring yourself to Homeland
Security, you'll end up back in jail.

116
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,363
That'd be troubling if there was the
slightest chance that we'd get caught.

117
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,791
You barely know each other
and you've got about five minutes

118
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,360
to remake yourselves into
a convincing married couple.

119
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,371
And why?

120
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,408
Dominika gets her green
card. What's in this for you?

121
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,444
This is what men do for the
women they pretend to love.

122
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,444
Also she's paying me
30,000 bucks once we pass.

123
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,040
Apparently, knishes
sell like hotcakes.

124
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,586
Lab results.

125
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,565
Afraid you're gonna have
to finish your nag later.

126
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,524
I said I think
it's stupid, right?

127
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,893
Then I think I'm done.

128
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:13,261
D-dimer came back normal.
Rules out pulmonary embolism.

129
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,131
And our patient's a true believer
about the follies of masculinity.

130
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,967
He underwent a spiritual
overhaul three years ago.

131
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,734
He also went off
gluten and red meat.

132
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,242
Unfortunately, that doesn't
explain any of his symptoms.

133
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,370
One of those
points is not absurd.

134
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,756
What's absurd about
a change of heart?

135
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,272
What this guy believes is
making him a better person.

136
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,112
He's going against
his baser instincts.

137
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,083
Base, meaning foundational,

138
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,987
meaning things we're
biologically programmed to do.

139
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:40,493
Yeah, it's perfectly natural
that he stopped doing that stuff.

140
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:44,325
That's the kind of lapse that could take
you out of the running for team leader.

141
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,991
I feel surprisingly
okay with that.

142
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,096
It comes with a 50
buck-a-week raise.

143
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,434
I'm in.

144
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,808
You don't want to do that. You
might need your dignity later in life.

145
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,572
You didn't.

146
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,323
And she could be on her
way to living the dream

147
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,647
unless the rest of you
nut up and give her...

148
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,945
This spiritual overhaul.

149
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,322
Did it come after a
physical overhaul?

150
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,257
A major injury of some kind?

151
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,351
Bar fight.

152
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:19,627
But there's no way a broken wrist
explains... Adams, come with me.

153
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,759
You, too.

154
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,999
You guys get a
copy of that made.

155
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,979
Did those dudes bend
your ball-sack like Beckham?

156
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,282
Three years ago. The bar fight.

157
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,875
This is Dr. House.
He has a theory.

158
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,946
Dr. Adams, would you mind?

159
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,323
I asked you a question. I
assume you know the answer.

160
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,899
Yeah. I took a couple of
serious knees to the groin.

161
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,162
But what...

162
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,966
What has gotten into me?

163
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,806
Dr. Chase.

164
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,402
Just pick it up.

165
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,737
Do you know what's
wrong with me?

166
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,509
Nothing that the Golden Girls couldn't
have handled in 23 hilarious minutes.

167
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,212
You had a hot flash.

168
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,355
Those guys kicked your guys
hard enough to do lasting damage.

169
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:23,052
You didn't even look when presented
with two reasonably attractive tuchi.

170
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,029
Yeah, I said it.

171
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,396
I was listening to my doctor.

172
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,992
People generally listen with their
ears, leaving their eyes free to wander.

173
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,672
I'm guessing that your testosterone
level is just below Bieber.

174
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,741
Do a blood test to confirm,
then start hormone replacement.

175
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,239
It's no wonder that you
think women are so great.

176
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,678
You've basically been
one for the last three years.

177
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,929
Tests confirmed House was right.

178
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,785
Low testosterone
explains all your symptoms.

179
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,016
They should go away
with replacement therapy.

180
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,889
We're gonna give
you a fairly high dose.

181
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,037
Over time, your personal
physician may reduce it a little.

182
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,221
Just need you to turn around.

183
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,256
Will the shots
increase his libido?

184
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,527
Are you worried about that?

185
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,899
No.

186
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,970
Have you been
unsatisfied? No. No, it's just...

187
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,375
It's usually me
that initiates things.

188
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:17,978
Sometimes I think maybe
you aren't that attracted to me.

189
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,177
Are you crazy?

190
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,579
With these injections, you will
see an increase in sex drive.

191
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,851
Great. Yeah.

192
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,132
All done. Okay.

193
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,133
Something's wrong.

194
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,533
I think I peed myself.

195
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,008
Is that from the testosterone?

196
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,945
Couldn't be. I don't think
you're going home just yet.

197
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,184
It's not a plumbing problem.
Means it's probably neurological.

198
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,654
And?

199
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,224
And name Dominika's
three brothers.

200
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,563
Volodymyr, Oleksiy and...

201
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,833
The low testosterone is
off the table as a symptom.

202
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,320
Guy got his nuts cracked three years ago.
Don't need to look much further than that.

203
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,711
So his hose just
happens to spring a leak

204
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:25,547
at the same time he's in the hospital
for a totally unrelated problem?

205
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,814
Fjodor. It's Fedir.

206
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,016
If low testosterone means I
can't get sick with something else,

207
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,059
then punch me in
the junk right now.

208
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,492
I would if it weren't redundant.

209
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,861
Is Fedir the one
who married Mykola?

210
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,698
Mykola is Dominika's uncle.

211
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,829
How is it you can retain every
detail of our habits and personal lives

212
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,736
and none of this?

213
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,502
I find it hard to remember
things I don't give a crap about.

214
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,546
Ergo, Dominika has one
brother, and his name is Al.

215
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:56,276
Maybe the testicular damage
set the stage for something worse.

216
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,410
Multiple sclerosis causes incontinence
and progresses faster in men with low T.

217
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,544
Way to stay on point.

218
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,833
It's that kind of leadership that's
putting you at the head of the pack.

219
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,088
There is no pack.
She's the only applicant.

220
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,856
Well, that's settled, then.

221
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,762
Have your underlings do an LP

222
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:16,563
and get a cranio-spinal MRI to
check for plaques associated with MS.

223
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,970
I will go tell Foreman
about your promotion.

224
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,336
Wait. Wait.

225
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,109
So nobody cares
about the job until I apply

226
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,412
and suddenly it's the last limited
edition lightsaber at Comicon?

227
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,783
Just seems like it should go
to someone with more seniority.

228
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:34,912
Meaning you.

229
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,422
I said more, not most.

230
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,081
Meaning you or Taub.

231
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,753
House is a dictator. Second-in-command
is a meaningless position.

232
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,490
Doesn't look meaningless
on my resume.

233
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,656
It doesn't have to
be meaningless at all.

234
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,257
The right person could
turn it into something,

235
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,030
get the department
running smoothly.

236
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,162
I wonder who that
right person could be.

237
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,934
House is the head
of the department.

238
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:57,307
It's only fair that a woman should
hold the other position of authority.

239
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,711
Yeah, let's go affirmative action on
this, because then I'll definitely win.

240
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:05,046
This is what House wants. Wind us up
and watch us fight over an empty title.

241
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,350
Which would make us extra stupid
because of what we've just been through.

242
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,187
We should let him choose
whoever he wants and move on.

243
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,058
So if these proteins are in my
spinal fluid, that means I have MS.

244
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,159
The proteins may indicate MS.
There's no one definitive test.

245
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,569
That's why Dr. House
ordered an MRI as well.

246
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,670
This is anesthetic.

247
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,701
It's a scary diagnosis,

248
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,245
but advances are being made.

249
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,214
Several drugs
approved just this year.

250
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,527
To be honest, at the moment
I'm feeling a little more worried

251
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,213
about the
testosterone injections.

252
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,312
It's making me feel different.

253
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,913
Kind of amped.

254
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:50,095
I went through this big life
change, and it felt really meaningful,

255
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,595
but what if it was
all just chemistry?

256
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,338
Loss of testosterone
could have been a factor.

257
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,238
But think of it as a catalyst.

258
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,001
It got you to re-evaluate.
Now you know what's important.

259
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,546
You can choose
to hold on to that.

260
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,841
Right?

261
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,243
Certainly worth trying.

262
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,350
Deep breath, stay very still.

263
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,352
Just tell House to drop
the whole team leader thing.

264
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,915
That's the only
way it'll go away.

265
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,961
I don't think it's
such a bad idea.

266
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,562
A little more structure in
your department couldn't hurt.

267
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,264
Yeah, House is doing this
because of his great love of structure,

268
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,827
not because he wants
us to turn on each other.

269
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,668
So, don't do that.

270
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:39,108
It makes sense to have someone in
there with a little more accountability.

271
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,306
As long as it's not Adams.

272
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:45,749
She sees the whole thing as an opportunity
to remake the department in her image.

273
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,117
Or Park, for obvious reasons.

274
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:53,016
And Taub's got the
kids. He's pretty busy.

275
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,756
Are you seriously angling for
a job that you mocked as fake

276
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,128
the whole time I had
it? I don't want the job.

277
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,663
You just don't want
anyone else to have it.

278
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,928
This'll be great.

279
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,004
Your grandmother
is kind of sexy.

280
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,304
This is Taras Shevchenko,
the greatest Ukrainian poet.

281
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,309
Is he the guy behind <i>There Once
Was a Man From Kremenchuk?</i>

282
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,814
Help me move coffee table.

283
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,524
Well, then, where
will we have coffee?

284
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,354
And by coffee, I mean scotch.

285
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,396
Coffee and booze are artificial
high. For me, high is in exercise.

286
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:46,177
Dance-aerobics. Fun
and good for the butt.

287
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,015
Amy Grant?

288
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:02,852
I know, but there's a hot girl jumping
up and down in my living room, so...

289
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,399
Aww!

290
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:13,328
You have a limited amount of time
to learn a ton of uninteresting facts.

291
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,500
Welcome to my wheelhouse.

292
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,434
You brought a protractor?

293
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,279
You never know when you
might need to make a pie chart.

294
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:27,411
Looks like someone is currying
favor for the team leader position.

295
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,744
Yes.

296
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,919
We'll be using a basic alphabet
technique with a mnemonic multiplier.

297
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,660
In high school, they called
me the Bookie Monster.

298
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,564
Pop quiz.

299
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,658
Where did you get
the candlesticks?

300
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,293
On three. One, two, three.

301
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,427
Morocco. Denver.

302
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,181
Drink up. It's gonna
be a long night.

303
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,070
You really think this guy's gonna
Hulk out once the hormones kick in?

304
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,285
Some male lizards do
push-ups to attract mates.

305
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,102
When scientists gave
them extra testosterone,

306
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,754
they did push-ups
until they died.

307
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,961
Same drive you took advantage of

308
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,864
to get Chase to carry a box of
files down to your car yesterday.

309
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,532
Periventricular and subcortical
white matter are clean.

310
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:23,599
So you're saying masculinity
is ingrained and irrational.

311
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,036
I'm saying it's
pointless to try...

312
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:30,139
By extension, you're also saying
femininity is enlightened and rational.

313
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,117
It's the way we should all be.
Guys just aren't capable of it.

314
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,221
Brain stem and cord are clean.

315
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,989
<i>Is it okay if I scratch my nose?</i>

316
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:44,720
Go ahead.

317
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,624
I guess he doesn't have MS.

318
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,861
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

319
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,201
Is it your hand?
No, it's my eyes.

320
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,171
I'm seeing double.

321
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,375
Smile. It's your honeymoon.

322
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,761
So, what causes double vision
on top of all the other symptoms?

323
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,182
It's not a brain tumor or we
would've seen it on the scans.

324
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,425
Eye exam didn't offer
anything conclusive.

325
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,860
Let's do some winter shots.

326
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,226
Wardrobe change.

327
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,465
Thyroid eye disease in
conjunction with Graves.

328
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,972
Thyroid level's normal.

329
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,705
Check it out.

330
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:34,944
Simpson traded this in exchange for
me helping out on some of my days off.

331
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:39,277
Quite the display of
initiative and leadership.

332
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,413
But you're way too smart to
fall for a blatant bribe like that.

333
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,652
Or a blatant flaunting
of cleavage like those.

334
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,625
What happened to not
letting House get to you?

335
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:52,825
You're like lemmings marching off
the cliff of competitive humiliation.

336
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,763
All I'm doing is my job.

337
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,167
House has indicated that
he considers me attractive.

338
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,465
There's nothing wrong with me
using my strengths to my advantage.

339
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,499
With an argument like that, maybe you
should just drop down to your knees and...

340
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,545
I mean, unless that's
not your strength.

341
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,640
Big hug, big man.
It's cold out here.

342
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,785
At the risk of derailing this
very productive photo shoot

343
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,790
and bickering session,

344
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,519
what about myasthenia gravis?

345
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,890
Extra-ocular muscle
weakness leads to double vision,

346
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,294
atonic bladder
leads to incontinence.

347
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,357
Could've been triggered
when his T got really low.

348
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,238
Ooh, little one.
He'd be a good pick.

349
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:35,868
Smooth.

350
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,307
You let the rest
of them compete,

351
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,378
tear each other to pieces,
then you swoop in with the save.

352
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,677
Start the patient on
IVIG and plasmapheresis.

353
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,377
Can you handle that, please?

354
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,916
- I need a minute.
- Make it quick.

355
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,747
We're due in Memphis.

356
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,260
You think you want
this, but it's a bad idea.

357
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,235
I was gonna go Dollywood, but
I'm not sure I can pull off that wig.

358
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:09,899
Everybody was playing nice, and in
your world, nice doesn't solve cases.

359
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,912
But after what happened, a
little bonding is a good thing.

360
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,440
We still have
ideas, we still argue.

361
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,351
Maybe it could work better
if we appreciate each other.

362
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,357
That's impressive. You said that whole
thing without once moving your lips.

363
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,417
The ones you're not moving.

364
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:35,297
I get it. I won't play along
with your stupid games,

365
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,529
so I'm no longer a man. Clever.

366
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,004
Actually, you won't play
along with my stupid games

367
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,665
because you're no longer a man.

368
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,306
Still clever, though. Studies
have shown that raising kids

369
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,812
lowers testosterone
levels in men.

370
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,745
The more involved you
are, the lower it gets.

371
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,980
Right, having kids
has neutered me.

372
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,788
Or maybe it's helped
me finally grow up.

373
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,298
How are you feeling?

374
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,630
As long as I keep my
eyes closed, pretty good.

375
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:12,263
Really good, actually.
I've got energy,

376
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:15,638
I feel confident, clear.

377
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,177
Testosterone does
tend to perk you up.

378
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,839
Hey, hon, I brought
you a burger. Really?

379
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,041
You're in the hospital.
Eat whatever you want.

380
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,142
You are the best wife ever.

381
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:32,020
I'm not just saying that because of
how great your ass looks in those jeans.

382
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,615
I'm sorry, that was a little...

383
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,126
No, it's okay.

384
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,789
A girl likes to know she's
appreciated. Come here.

385
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:44,795
So, I think we should talk to Leading
Lights about seminars and DVDs.

386
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,362
You sure? You were
worried about the commitment.

387
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,793
Yeah, there's no point being
in business with them halfway.

388
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,668
You okay with that?

389
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,476
It's good to finally
have a decision.

390
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,140
Okay.

391
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:02,415
Fedir is the brother she
worries about the most,

392
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,547
ever since Luba passed.

393
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:09,862
Sorry, this was the closest we
could find to the cold, soulless offices

394
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,453
of a government bureaucracy.

395
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,556
If you're not using
your office, I will.

396
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,693
Does Dominika still communicate
with her high school friends?

397
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:21,536
Vasyly, yes, Oksana, no.
Not since she kissed Pavlo.

398
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,838
'Cause that bitch knew
that Dominika liked him.

399
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:30,876
Wrong. Oksana is
a slut, dead to me.

400
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,884
The right answer
is the wrong answer.

401
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:36,387
No husband would pay that much
attention to his wife's friend dramas.

402
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,423
Haven't you been
divorced three times?

403
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,662
In between those
divorces, I was married,

404
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,255
non-fraudulently,

405
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,593
for 12 years total,

406
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,727
which is 12 years longer
than anyone in this room.

407
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,034
Move.

408
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,344
So are you going for
this team leader thing?

409
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,442
Probably.

410
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:11,081
You deserve it. You have
way more experience than me.

411
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,385
You're giving up?

412
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,690
I wish. I still have a
lot of med school debt.

413
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,754
And my parents need
help with their mortgage.

414
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,459
So, I could kind
of use the money.

415
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,095
As of an hour ago, I'm just
seeing one of everything.

416
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:30,199
Looks like you guys were
right about... We'll be right back.

417
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,603
"I could use the money"?

418
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,390
You want to game me,
you've gotta do better than that.

419
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,524
Chase... You
want to be a leader,

420
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,393
you have to know how to
manipulate. You can't just spill...

421
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,410
I think the whites of
his eyes were yellow.

422
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,652
Everything okay?

423
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,989
Jaundice.

424
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,658
There's something
wrong with your liver.

425
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:02,738
Liver function tests confirm his
enzymes are totally out of whack.

426
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,674
So much for myasthenia gravis.

427
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,804
Can we hurry this up? I have a
government to defraud at noon.

428
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,457
If you need to
leave, you should.

429
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,916
I'm fairly confident our
patient's got sarcoidosis.

430
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,976
Wow, you said that
with so much authority.

431
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,647
Did anyone else get chills?

432
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,723
Just until I realized
our patient has

433
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,850
no sign of parenchymal
lung abnormalities,

434
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,723
which makes
sarcoidosis a long shot.

435
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,389
And bookkeeping isn't gonna
get you any farther than the boobs.

436
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,600
Though in fairness, the boobs
were really, really helping.

437
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,294
I still think it's
myasthenia gravis.

438
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,064
Did you miss the recap? We
treated for that, the liver tanked.

439
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,265
But his vision got better.

440
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,234
The liver problems
could be a sign of celiac.

441
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,220
He's been back on gluten
since he's been in the hospital.

442
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,284
Yesterday he had a burger.

443
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:43,107
That would've kicked his celiac
into gear, causing the liver problems.

444
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,852
So your theory is that he
has two unrelated diseases.

445
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,944
And he's already
got low testosterone.

446
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:52,150
I seem to remember something
about House hating coincidences.

447
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,281
It's true.

448
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,955
I think it's Lyme disease. One
single disease named Lyme.

449
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,120
Without a rash?

450
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,927
10% of cases
present without a rash.

451
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,964
Lyme disease it is. Start
the patient on antibiotics.

452
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:10,671
I have to get home before
my fake wife gets real annoyed.

453
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,377
Something bothering you?

454
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:20,612
I asked the nurse for an extra
pillow. That was half an hour ago.

455
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,655
Sorry, things can
get pretty hectic.

456
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,452
It's a pillow. I mean,
how hard can a pillow...

457
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,394
Listen to me, I'm being a jerk.

458
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,694
Testosterone can give you a shorter
temper even when you're not sick.

459
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,962
You noticed and adjusted.
That's a good thing.

460
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,133
Hey.

461
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,231
Just got a call from our lawyer.

462
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:45,072
You changed our
counter to Leading Lights?

463
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:48,204
You deserve proper billing and
a salary bump in the second term.

464
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,806
We talked about this. We decided it
wasn't worth potentially blowing the deal.

465
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,409
It'll be fine.

466
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,054
I've got to get some work done.

467
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,995
These are such pretty
flowers you buy for me.

468
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,703
Every Friday from
Japanese florist,

469
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,763
on corner of Edison and Conway.
There's just one more thing.

470
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,537
With this ring,

471
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,243
I thee wedded.

472
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,568
You left it here when you
skipped town with your boyfriend.

473
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,520
You kept the rings?

474
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,523
Actually, I tried to trade them to
a hooker for unspecified favors.

475
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,059
But it turns out she
doesn't accept zinc.

476
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,821
Like modern fairy tale.

477
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,739
Dr. and Mrs. Gregory
House? Yeah.

478
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,244
Nate Weinmann, U.S. Immigration.

479
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,181
Welcome to our home.

480
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,589
Give him time.

481
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,459
When I was 14, there was
a girl I wanted to impress.

482
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,198
So I jumped off the roof of
her house. Broke my ankle.

483
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,872
Joe's basically going
through puberty.

484
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,275
It'll take him a
while to adjust.

485
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,815
I tracked down a video from one of
Joe's business coaching seminars

486
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,411
from before I knew him.

487
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,617
<i>I'm hearing a lot about
the value of compromise.</i>

488
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:42,889
<i>But we don't live on Sesame
Street. We live in the real world,</i>

489
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,089
<i>the business world.</i>

490
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,499
<i>If you're not a
winner, you're a loser.</i>

491
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,827
<i>If you aren't
comfortable with that,</i>

492
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,630
<i>go open a pottery studio.</i>

493
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:59,972
I never would have gone
out with the guy in this video.

494
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,909
Do you remember the
last time she visited Vasyl?

495
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,489
Uh... Let me see.
That would be August?

496
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:16,187
No, no, July.

497
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:19,265
I remember. It was right
after our half anniversary

498
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,766
and I forgot to put
a gift in her suitcase.

499
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,598
And I never heard
the end of that one.

500
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,166
House specialty.

501
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,604
I made up this pun.

502
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,481
Thank you.

503
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,677
Honey, why do you do this to me?
You know I'm watching my weight.

504
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:45,383
Then maybe you stop eating cheese in front
of open fridge in middle of the night.

505
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,957
This is delicious. Thank you.

506
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,256
So, everything
looks good in here.

507
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,301
I'm just gonna step out and
get a corroborating interview

508
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,099
from one of the
neighbors. Neighbors?

509
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:03,666
It's middle of the day, I
think everybody is at work.

510
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,820
Yeah, then they're at work.
I just got a form to check off,

511
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,110
and you will be on your
way to permanent status.

512
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,692
Excuse me, sir. Do
you have a minute?

513
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,314
How can I help you?

514
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,559
Do you know Dr. and Mrs. House?

515
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:30,362
Of course. They've been my
neighbors about two years now.

516
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,493
Lovely couple.

517
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,997
I see them almost every night.

518
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,370
They seem always to be together.

519
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,094
Great. Thanks for your help.

520
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,199
Cheerio.

521
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,336
Hey, what are you
doing? That's my door.

522
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,343
Handing out menus
for a new Chinese place.

523
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:55,757
You're that guy that plays noisy video
games with House on Saturday nights.

524
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,831
There's a simple explanation.

525
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,240
Be at my office
tomorrow at 10:00.

526
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,058
The patient's shown
zero improvement.

527
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,287
Because he's only been
on the antibiotics overnight.

528
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,727
Or because he doesn't
have Lyme disease.

529
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,597
Where are you?
HOUSE: <i>Just chilling</i>

530
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,533
<i>at U.S. Citizenship
and Immigration,</i>

531
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,229
<i>waiting on my fraud interview
with my wife and my attorney.</i>

532
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,128
No big. House.

533
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,703
Hang up.

534
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,135
I still think it's myasthenia
gravis plus celiac.

535
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,110
His change in diet
has to be significant.

536
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,444
We just need to do an
intestinal biopsy to confirm.

537
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,986
With his low platelet count, a biopsy
puts him at risk for an abdominal bleed,

538
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,645
which puts him at risk of death.

539
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,506
Either you're done or you're
walking in there without a lawyer.

540
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,027
I know, it sounds like a phone,

541
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:12,697
but it's a timer. To remind
me to pee before our meeting.

542
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:20,537
Hello, old chap.

543
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,247
You need to save yourself.

544
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,246
<i>I was up last night, trying to
find another angle, but I can't.</i>

545
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,942
Tell Immigration you
were in love with Dominika,

546
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,133
but your marriage fell apart. And that's
why you haven't been living together.

547
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,922
She'll be deported. Permanently.

548
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:39,488
House, I know you like Dominika, you
have fun with her, but you got caught.

549
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,123
There's no getting out of this.

550
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,003
<i>The best you can hope for is
that you don't go back to jail.</i>

551
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:54,012
Tell my team to skip the biopsy
and give the antibiotics more time.

552
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,581
They're ready for us.

553
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,086
I drew a line in the sand and I
won. We should be celebrating.

554
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:07,490
Do you need a few minutes?
I'd rather keep getting better.

555
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,992
That's just it.

556
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,258
You won. You made a demand
that could have blown up the deal

557
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,630
and you never even asked me.
The deal didn't blow up, they caved.

558
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,694
Joe, you say it in your seminars.
Process matters just as much as results.

559
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:24,368
Are you seriously busting my chops
because I made one little move without you?

560
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,001
How about stepping aside

561
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,445
and letting me be the man in
this relationship for a change?

562
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,814
I really can't talk
to you right now.

563
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,358
I don't know why I said that.

564
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,460
Just, I got so angry.

565
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,165
Hopefully after this dose,

566
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,795
you'll start to feel better
and we can get you home.

567
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,574
But I'd like to do
one more test.

568
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,972
The testimony of one
angry, near-sighted neighbor

569
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,294
shouldn't outweigh all other
evidence. Photos, utility bills...

570
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,810
Yes. Because your clients
would never fake anything.

571
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:12,483
We acknowledge the neighbor thing
was a mistake, but that doesn't mean

572
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,836
that all the other documentation
should just be thrown out.

573
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,661
Look, look, I get that it's your job to
act like there's a case here, but shut up.

574
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:26,338
USCIS will be denying Ms.
Patrova's green card application.

575
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,374
You'll be referred to Immigration
Court for deportation proceedings.

576
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:32,900
And we're gonna inform your
parole officer about evidence of fraud.

577
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,445
So, unless anybody has
anything else to add...

578
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,888
Please, I am begging, do
not send him back to jail.

579
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,569
Maybe we have not lived
together all these months...

580
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,513
Mrs. House, I have to
advise you not to continue.

581
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,691
This man and I, did
we marry for love?

582
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:58,635
No. But this past week,
we have a lot of fun,

583
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:01,639
working really hard to fool
U.S. government. Right?

584
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,971
Don't answer that.
Way ahead of you.

585
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,067
It was fake,

586
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,879
but it felt real.

587
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:11,314
Maybe because it become real.

588
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,418
This man.

589
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,945
My husband.

590
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:22,818
I want to stay with him, but if I cannot,
please send me away and let him be free.

591
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,989
I love him.

592
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,408
I didn't buy a word you said.

593
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:51,914
But a judge might.

594
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,264
I'm gonna let you stay.

595
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:07,505
But for the next six months,
I'm gonna hold on to this file.

596
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:11,043
And our investigators are gonna show up
unannounced at 6:00 a.m., 11:00 at night,

597
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,187
and they better find the two
of you sitting on the couch,

598
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,807
watching <i>NCIS,</i> eating ice
cream from the same spoon.

599
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:22,377
Or both of you will be sent to places
far less pleasant than New Jersey.

600
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,400
What you just said in there...

601
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,809
Don't worry. I am much too
smart to be falling in love with you.

602
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,974
I will be needing
extra shelf in bathroom.

603
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:04,324
Abdominal biopsy showed flattened villi.
Looks like you were right about celiac.

604
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:08,925
You do remember Chase got
stabbed doing a test House didn't order.

605
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:11,507
Good comparison, since both
patients were tweaked on steroids.

606
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:15,200
You only did this to score
points over Chase and Park.

607
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,936
We were right. I proved it
and the patient didn't bleed out.

608
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,443
Why are you being
a jerk about this?

609
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,412
Let's go see if House is back.

610
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,209
Patient's having
trouble breathing.

611
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:28,249
So much for celiac.

612
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,022
His breathing is stabilized,

613
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:39,792
but his lung function is at
60% and his liver is tanking.

614
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:42,891
And he has major symptoms of
celiac without actually having celiac.

615
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,629
Could be Whipple's.

616
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,103
Doesn't explain
the incontinence.

617
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,106
Intestinal lymphoma?

618
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,267
Doesn't explain
the double vision.

619
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,641
Any time you want to jump in.

620
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,278
Is dance-aerobics even a thing?

621
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,582
I hear it's good for the butt.

622
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,628
What about a
parasitic infection?

623
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,730
Strongyloides is known to
damage the small intestine...

624
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,354
In this country he's about as
likely to get that as win Powerball.

625
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,621
Someone does win
Powerball. Every week.

626
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,661
The patient went to Puerto
Rico a few months ago.

627
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,560
One of the few places in the
U.S. you can pick up strongyloides.

628
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,755
Treatment is ivermectin.

629
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:18,395
We give that to someone with liver
problems, he could have seizures, or worse.

630
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:26,338
Do it.

631
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,275
<i>I'm hearing a lot about
the value of compromise.</i>

632
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:37,781
<i>But we don't live on Sesame
Street. We live in the real...</i>

633
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:43,591
I was wondering if maybe we
overlooked a symptom, or something.

634
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:49,591
Makes perfect sense if you're the
patient, and pantywaist is the symptom.

635
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,003
Adams and I both thought
the patient could have celiac,

636
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:58,941
but only she was willing to go out
on a limb and run the test. I gave up.

637
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,344
Now you're in here watching
a motivational speech.

638
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,945
Even your attempt to get
your balls back lacks balls.

639
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:09,112
<i>World, the business world.</i>

640
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,289
<i>If you're not a
winner, you're a loser.</i>

641
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:14,417
His voice, it's
lower than it is now.

642
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,462
If only there was a good reason for
a professional speaker to be hoarse.

643
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,856
<i>Go open a pottery studio.</i>

644
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,364
Good point.

645
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,302
It's not a good point.
It's a decent point.

646
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,864
You're doing it again.

647
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,035
You got any other videos,
other seminars? A couple.

648
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,774
<i>When you see a weakness,
that's a time for strength.</i>

649
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:40,182
<i>A lot of people say, "I feel bad about
it." The other guy made a mistake...</i>

650
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,379
You bailed too early.

651
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,353
Now I get all the credit.

652
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,686
<i>That kind of thinking
is what makes you...</i>

653
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:55,859
Chronic hoarseness is a symptom
of a condition called silent thyroiditis.

654
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,329
But I'm not hoarse.

655
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:00,668
Exactly. But you
were, three years ago.

656
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,465
Silent thyroiditis
comes and goes.

657
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,339
And it, in turn, is a symptom

658
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,006
of Polyglandular
Autoimmune syndrome, type 3.

659
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,879
Which makes this
is a really bad idea.

660
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,154
PAS-3 attacks the body's
own endocrine system,

661
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,656
moving from gland to gland.

662
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,416
<i>It started in the thyroid, then,</i>

663
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,894
<i>probably helped along
by your low testosterone,</i>

664
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,665
<i>moved on to the gut.</i> TAUB:
<i>Where it caused celiac disease,</i>

665
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,812
or it would've, if you
weren't on a gluten-free diet.

666
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:31,934
I was right.

667
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,698
This is incredibly relevant.

668
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:37,401
Eventually PAS-3
attacked your thymus gland.

669
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,774
You developed myasthenia
gravis, which landed you in here.

670
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:44,043
Then you started eating gluten,
which only made things worse.

671
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,481
So, am I gonna be okay?

672
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,561
We'll treat the various
conditions with high-dose steroids.

673
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,419
Assuming they
respond, you'll be fine.

674
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,046
And the testosterone?

675
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,895
Kicked in the nuts
is kicked in the nuts.

676
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:07,899
Over the past week, you have
all had good moments and bad.

677
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:11,334
No one candidate has prevailed.

678
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:17,173
So now we embark upon a
contest of medical strength,

679
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,945
stamina and skill.

680
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,195
Can we just get this over with?

681
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:24,951
If the competitor representing Australia
would like to take a point deduction,

682
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,082
he should by all
means continue yapping.

683
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,619
Your glee is on the verge of
making this not worth it for any of us.

684
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,194
Can I at least light the torch?

685
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,056
Hurry.

686
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:46,540
I declare open the games of the
number one number two competition.

687
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,876
<i>Je déclare ouvert...</i>

688
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,476
All right. Ready, set, suture!

689
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:01,782
T-time.

690
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:04,055
What happens if I don't take it?

691
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,324
Or at least, go to
a much lower dose.

692
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:07,551
Are you having side effects?

693
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:08,998
No, I feel great.

694
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,466
Faster, clearer.

695
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,599
More like myself.

696
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,173
But my marriage and my career,

697
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:19,472
they're both built on me
being somebody else.

698
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,638
Low testosterone can cause
depression and problems sleeping.

699
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:26,946
It's also been linked to conditions
such as osteoporosis and diabetes.

700
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,786
It will make your life
harder and more dangerous,

701
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,415
on top of all the
meds you'll be taking.

702
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,594
I'll take that risk.

703
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,964
I'm a better man without it.

704
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:05,457
Well, this certainly has brought
more structure to the department.

705
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:10,826
Really, I'm just excited
for the wheelchair race.

706
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,828
You were smart not to enter.

707
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,834
Never in, never lose.

708
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,502
And since you no
longer have stones...

709
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,368
I'll split the 50
a week with you.

710
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,471
Deal.

711
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:12,718
Honey, I'm home!
