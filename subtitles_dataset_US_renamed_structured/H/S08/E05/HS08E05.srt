00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,153
<i>Good afternoon, Cedarville!</i>

2
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,995
<i>It is my distinct
honor to present</i>

3
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,065
<i>our annual community
service award</i>

4
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,692
<i>to one of our most
outstanding citizens.</i>

5
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:39,873
<i>Now, many of you may
recognize him as Coach Bob</i>

6
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>of our champion
Little League team.</i>

7
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,410
<i>And some of you may know him</i>

8
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,174
<i>as the treasurer of our
Harvest Scholarship Fund.</i>

9
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,608
<i>But I know that all of
you know him as the guy</i>

10
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,743
<i>that owns the only
gas station in town.</i>

11
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,792
<i>Bob Harris, get on up here
with that beautiful family of yours.</i>

12
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,889
<i>Bob Harris, folks!</i>

13
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:08,396
<i>Bob, your community
activism, charity work</i>

14
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:12,606
<i>and character represent the
finest Cedarville has to offer.</i>

15
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,733
<i>Please accept this
on behalf of all of us</i>

16
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,002
<i>and know that we love you.</i>

17
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,668
Are you all right?

18
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,478
Bob?

19
00:01:58,552 --> 00:01:59,850
You're crushing me.

20
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,352
Wake up!

21
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,133
I think you're having a heart
attack. I'm gonna call the ambulance.

22
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,093
No. Just drive
me to the hospital.

23
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,222
As the new Dean of Medicine,
I'd like to personally welcome

24
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,706
all of our new employees and ask

25
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,254
why the hell do you
want to come back?

26
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,809
Tired of surfing.

27
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,437
He hasn't changed.

28
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:04,245
And neither has the job, right?
We still get to do crazy crap?

29
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,979
Save people's lives
instead of just their noses?

30
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,421
About that, about
the crazy stuff...

31
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,788
Here we go. He's
gone from ally to enemy.

32
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,451
He has no choice.

33
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,291
He's the boss now.

34
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,421
He has to be professional.

35
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,932
Has to base his decisions on
what's best for the entire hospital.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,120
We can't take it personally.

37
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,545
Couldn't have
said it better myself.

38
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,569
You did.

39
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,431
I'm just reading the
notes on your desk.

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,532
He also wants us to spy for him.

41
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,070
Not spy. I'm trying to
keep House out of prison.

42
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,358
To do that, I need to know
what he's doing and planning.

43
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,406
Spy. Spy.

44
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,486
Come on, guys.

45
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,946
Look, I am your boss, you do
have to treat me appropriately,

46
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,219
but it doesn't have to
be awkward and weird.

47
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,603
Outside of work, I still
consider us all friends.

48
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,839
I'm glad you feel that way,
because I do have a favor to ask.

49
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,674
I told House I couldn't
come back until next week.

50
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,964
He said he understood
completely and that I was fired, so...

51
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,970
Since I have my kids for the
next two days, I need a babysitter.

52
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,835
No.

53
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,718
Male patient went into V-fib, but
shows no signs of heart disease

54
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,312
or any other symptoms
for that matter.

55
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,723
What was he doing when his
heart decided to do the mambo?

56
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,795
He said he was at work.

57
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,659
You're late.

58
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,347
According to my
calendar, I'm a week early.

59
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,430
Beard's a nice touch.

60
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,237
Lets everyone know that
you're not a teenage girl.

61
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,944
Now, you two make a cute couple.

62
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,006
And you two...

63
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,346
It's not important.

64
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,551
Dr. Park.

65
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,126
You're a lot taller
than I thought you'd be.

66
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,871
And I look forward to
working with you, as well.

67
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,330
He's lying. Not just
Taub, the patient.

68
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:01,164
These abrasions on his
knees, they're minty fresh.

69
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,497
They're about 10 hours old.

70
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:03,935
He got them
playing flag football.

71
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,405
He said he got them
playing flag football.

72
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,033
I'm sure that's true, if flag
is a euphemism for "penis"

73
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,407
and football is a euphemism
for "entering a vagina".

74
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,643
Why lie about it?
Everybody lies.

75
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,413
Speaking of which, how
are your two baby girls?

76
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,816
Wow, twins. Congratulations.

77
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,051
Awkward.

78
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,852
He knocked up two different
women at the same time.

79
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,235
At least he thinks he did. Did
you have the DNA tested yet?

80
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,436
Why would I? They
look just like me.

81
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,519
But they will grow.

82
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,406
Find out what else
he's lying about.

83
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,774
Do an exercise
test, see if you can

84
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,109
get him to go back
into V-fib again.

85
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,466
But we could end up
causing another cardiac arrest.

86
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,733
Hopefully, then we'll
know what set it off.

87
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,917
He means, it's better to do it
here where we can revive him

88
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,375
than have it happen
somewhere else.

89
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,470
The prodigal son has returned.

90
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,891
Now if you'll excuse
me, I have to go

91
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,747
slaughter a fatted
calf for lunch.

92
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,750
I told you, I was sitting at my
desk when the attack happened.

93
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,937
These rug burns
are from last night.

94
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,728
We think you were having sex, but
memory loss could also be a symptom.

95
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,931
Maybe we should ask your wife?

96
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,066
Don't.

97
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:15,836
I did something stupid last
night, but it was a one-time thing.

98
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:18,401
You have no idea
how bad I feel about it.

99
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,637
Your guilt is between
you and your wife,

100
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,476
we just need to
know what happened.

101
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,047
I was having sex at a motel

102
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,916
when I started to
feel light-headed.

103
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,084
Next thing I knew, I
was lying on my back,

104
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,327
I could barely breathe.

105
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,491
Is everything all right?

106
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,259
We'd like to perform
an exercise test.

107
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,827
Recreate the stress that may
have caused his symptoms.

108
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,801
He was sitting at his desk.

109
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,181
It's his heart we're
worried about.

110
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,730
The test will monitor its rhythm

111
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,432
so we can check
for any abnormalities.

112
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,944
I spent a month in solitary. You
don't think I can keep this up all day?

113
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,989
I have a headache. Could
you just lower your voice?

114
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,090
Chase and Taub are back!

115
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,394
You want me to pick
up an ice cream cake?

116
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,132
I also think that Taub

117
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,368
has brought his little Taubettes
into work with him today.

118
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,534
And why would he do that?

119
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,354
Because I didn't give him
time to do anything else.

120
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,498
So then I started wondering,

121
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,141
"Who'd be sappy enough
to watch them for him?"

122
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,582
They're not here.

123
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,850
What?

124
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,549
I just came for a
chat with a friend.

125
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,288
What's that I smell, friend?

126
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,658
I understand your confusion.

127
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,994
I was eating a
baby for lunch and...

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,400
I have a massive migraine.

129
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,170
Will you, please, just go away?

130
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,376
You should probably
lie down to rest.

131
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,944
Yeah, I was trying to.

132
00:07:58,845 --> 00:07:59,845
Oh...

133
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,977
There is one more thing.

134
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,425
He's in too good of shape.

135
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,728
We need to get him to the
point he was at last night.

136
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,531
Don't look at me,
but if you want to.

137
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,763
Cute,

138
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,971
but I didn't mean
physical stress.

139
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,753
Don't you guys think
this is irresponsible?

140
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:34,339
It's like you getting two women
pregnant at the same time.

141
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,646
I just mean the part about
the odds of it happening.

142
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,961
They had to be incredibly high.

143
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,216
And if we induce V-fib,

144
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,061
odds say that we'll
be able to revive him,

145
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,749
but there's always
a chance we can't.

146
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:49,194
It's extreme and reckless.
That's House. You get used to it.

147
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,321
Or I fire you.

148
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,331
Look what I found.

149
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,031
Kiddie-winkies. I wonder
who they belong to.

150
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,431
Give me my kids.

151
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,697
No, I genuinely wonder
who they belong to.

152
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,901
I need a DNA sample.

153
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,342
I'm not letting you
DNA test my kids.

154
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,573
I already did. This
swab's for you.

155
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,643
Fine, if you don't
mind paying a fortune

156
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,880
in child support for
some other guy's kids?

157
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,820
No skin cells off my cheek.

158
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,587
His heart rate's
finally elevating.

159
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,326
Dr. Chase said you had
something to tell me?

160
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,870
We were talking about how you
got the abrasions on your knees.

161
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,699
The flag football game?

162
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,767
Oh, um...

163
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,313
Yeah, honey, I'm gonna
need you to let the guys know

164
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,306
I'm not gonna be able
to play on Saturday.

165
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,569
The whole town knows
that you're in the hospital.

166
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,768
I wouldn't worry about it.

167
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,430
That's not what you
wanted to tell her.

168
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,206
You said the
game wasn't typical.

169
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,646
Something happened
that you were upset about.

170
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,686
I don't understand.
What are you...

171
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,152
I don't... I don't feel very...

172
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,222
What's happening?

173
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,360
It's not his heart. <i>I know.</i>

174
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,958
<i>He's having a seizure.</i>

175
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,016
There wasn't any
abnormal electrical activity

176
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,318
in his EKG when
the seizure occurred.

177
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,916
It wasn't caused by V-fib.

178
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,106
We still can't rule it out.

179
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,061
His EKG from the
E.R. documented it.

180
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,598
Myocarditis?

181
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,462
Viral infection weakening
the wall muscles.

182
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,133
We'd need to biopsy
his heart to confirm.

183
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,535
Myocarditis wouldn't
cause a seizure.

184
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,266
Could be genetic.
Brugada syndrome?

185
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,637
Oh, my God.

186
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,246
Two prodigal sons.
Come on, let's hug it out.

187
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,815
You really like
the idea or you just

188
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,439
wanna grab some
hair for a DNA test?

189
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,745
It's a stupid idea.

190
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,151
We would have seen
evidence of Brugada in the EKG.

191
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,711
You know, this is...

192
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,691
It's just messing with my feng
shui here. What about over there?

193
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,789
A pheochromocytoma?

194
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:07,493
Excess adrenaline can cause
heart problems and seizures.

195
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,000
Boring. I'm sorry.

196
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,936
I thought I was here to treat
the patients, not entertain you.

197
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,166
Would it hurt to do both?

198
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,308
This is much better.

199
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,547
I said it was boring, I
didn't say it was wrong.

200
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,638
So I'm right?

201
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,148
Nope, you're wrong.
Photic epilepsy.

202
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,830
It's equally boring, but it has the
advantage of possibly being right.

203
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,049
Give him an EEG to confirm.

204
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,934
If you ever hear me mention
anything about wanting kids,

205
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,531
please feel free to
punch me in the liver.

206
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,008
Why?

207
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,474
Like Satan's alarm clock.

208
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,961
What's House up to?

209
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,262
He hasn't asked me for anything,

210
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,530
he's been incredibly
well behaved,

211
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,852
he's doing his clinic hours.

212
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,322
That is a sign of concern.

213
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,687
You know him as well as I do.

214
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,832
He needs to constantly
establish he's the alpha dog.

215
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,988
He's got his team back,
he's got his office back,

216
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,225
he's got everything he needs.

217
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,333
You really believe
that? He's content?

218
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,135
I don't want to let House
sabotage himself by sabotaging me.

219
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,266
And I need your guidance
and your trust to do that.

220
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,538
No, no, no.

221
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,603
Cuddy had a problem with
House, she came to me.

222
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,808
Wanted to vent, me.
How did that turn out?

223
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:34,547
You have a problem with House, deal
with it, or find someone else who can.

224
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,427
We're sorry about earlier, but
we needed to provoke a reaction.

225
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,495
It worked.

226
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,955
I can barely look her
in the eyes anymore.

227
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,968
I'd want my husband
to tell me the truth.

228
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,068
Sure.

229
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,903
You'll feel better,
and she'll feel what?

230
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,406
Devastated,
betrayed, heartbroken.

231
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,752
You really want
to do that to her?

232
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,938
No.

233
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,243
But I can't live like this.

234
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,241
But she can.

235
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,441
All set.

236
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,416
All right, we need you to
sit back and try to relax.

237
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,757
Just look at the light.

238
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,861
What exactly are they
building back there?

239
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,272
A dream. The EEG didn't show

240
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,933
any abnormal brain activity.

241
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,340
He doesn't have photic epilepsy.

242
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,379
I know, because he has
a pheochromocytoma.

243
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,445
You said I was wrong.

244
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,640
You were wrong not
to rule out epilepsy first.

245
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,216
That only takes
a couple of hours.

246
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,328
Finding a tumor that's flushing
adrenaline through his system

247
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,445
is gonna take all night.

248
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,748
Monitor his brain activity,

249
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,381
start a continuous urine test
and blood draws every two hours.

250
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:48,019
I can't, I have my kids. Wilson's
leaving in, like, 15 minutes.

251
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,204
Chase and Adams
can do the tests.

252
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,252
Thank you.

253
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,905
For the massage bed.

254
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,907
You and Park are checking the
motel he was bumping uglies at

255
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,772
for environmental factors.

256
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,154
He couldn't find a
babysitter. Get over it.

257
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,692
You're gonna get us killed.

258
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,454
She thinks I'm a
prostitute on her turf.

259
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,290
Showing weakness
is what gets you killed.

260
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,807
Why would she think
you're a prostitute?

261
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,925
I'm in a dump with a
guy almost twice my age.

262
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,193
What else is she gonna think?

263
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,094
How old do you think I am?

264
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,045
So who cheated on you?

265
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,356
We just met.

266
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,036
Don't you think it's a little early
to be dragging up our baggage

267
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,926
in front of each other?

268
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,997
Who says I have baggage?

269
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:02,664
I know when House went
to prison, you quit medicine.

270
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,363
You don't do that, unless...

271
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,132
I didn't quit, I
took a vacation.

272
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,105
I knew when he got
out, I'd get my job back.

273
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,110
House didn't even know
he was coming back.

274
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,501
I had faith.

275
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,412
Now that has baggage
stamped all over it.

276
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,545
Seizure activity?

277
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,181
No, one of the
sensors came loose.

278
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,691
I'll fix it.

279
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,327
<i>What is it?</i>

280
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,202
Not a pheochromocytoma.

281
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,470
Our patient now has
a mass in his neck

282
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,879
and his body temp's been
rising over the last three hours.

283
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,348
Where's the construction crew?

284
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,011
Well, I'm not gonna make
them work day and night.

285
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,553
So I chose night.

286
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,755
And his urine and blood
tests didn't show any evidence

287
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,793
of an adrenaline
secreting tumor.

288
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,852
Meningitis? We can do a
lumbar puncture to confirm.

289
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,727
Sorry, I had to drop my kids
off at day care across town.

290
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,323
What'd I miss?
It's not meningitis.

291
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,232
His neck isn't stiff and
his mental status is normal.

292
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,737
He's only guessing.

293
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,237
I'm talking to Taub.

294
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,367
He can't say "my kids"
until he lets me test him.

295
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,110
So tell me about the love shack
where he cheated on his bride.

296
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,772
The quarters came in handy.

297
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,544
My kids loved the massage bed.

298
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:29,949
Lab tests show the bed
tested positive for, uh, semen,

299
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,550
vaginal secretions,
saliva and fecal matter,

300
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,891
both human and animal.

301
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,474
You probably
want to boil the kids

302
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,808
for a couple of hours
when you get home.

303
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,767
The bathroom also
tested positive for

304
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,836
five different types
of pathogenic bacteria.

305
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,065
Fusobacterium
necrophorum was one of them.

306
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,663
Yeah. How did you know?

307
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,833
The bulge in his neck.

308
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,675
The bacteria colonized
his parapharyngeal space,

309
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,011
moved into his jugular
vein causing a thrombus.

310
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,044
Lemierre's Syndrome. Treat
with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

311
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,812
Dig out the clot before it
moves to his lungs and kills him.

312
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,748
You got at least
a trillion cells.

313
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,784
You're gonna misplace
one of them eventually.

314
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,947
I have to tell
my wife the truth.

315
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,193
There's plenty of time
for that after the operation.

316
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,820
What if I die? And one day
she finds out I cheated on her.

317
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,695
I'll never be able to explain.
Never tell her how sorry I am.

318
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,633
You're increasing the odds of
that every second we waste here.

319
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,866
No, I'm not agreeing to
anything until I talk to her.

320
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,872
Daddy!

321
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,566
Hey!

322
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,176
Hey, guys.

323
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,011
Ew! Your neck
looks really gross.

324
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,713
I missed you both so much,
but I need to ask you a favor.

325
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,053
I need to talk to Mommy
alone for a second.

326
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,682
Would you mind
watching them for us?

327
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,166
Um...

328
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,105
This guy's an idiot.

329
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,613
I think he actually
has a good point.

330
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,774
What would you think if
you found out, years later,

331
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,245
your beloved dead
wife cheated on you?

332
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,470
I wouldn't believe it.

333
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,518
As long as I don't
hear it directly from her,

334
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,116
then I can hang on to
hope that it's not true.

335
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,314
But this way,

336
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,991
she has to either
dump him or forgive him.

337
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,391
Guys, get your
stuff. We're leaving.

338
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,335
I'm so sorry.

339
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,097
I'll be back.

340
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,040
I'm gonna drop our
kids off at my mother's.

341
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:10,942
Look, he made a mistake.
A stupid, horrible mistake.

342
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,578
But we'll get through this.

343
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,815
All I care about right now is
that my husband gets better.

344
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,588
Sorry about yesterday.

345
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:30,596
House was like Child Catcher
from <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</i>

346
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,071
Why is he so obsessed
with my kids being my kids?

347
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,999
Because he sees insecurity,

348
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,272
and when House senses
weakness, he pounces.

349
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,973
And because his
insecurity is the fact

350
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,741
that other people can have faith

351
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,750
and don't have the obsessive
need for physical proof.

352
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,683
Also, he started a betting pool

353
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,553
on which kid is
yours and which isn't.

354
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:05,196
An entire hospital betting
on the legitimacy of my kids.

355
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,632
It's great to be
back among friends.

356
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,225
I'm not the bad guy here.

357
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,266
I'm betting on them
both being yours.

358
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,805
I would have donated
the money to charity.

359
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:47,707
Approaching the
clot, stand by for...

360
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,979
That's not a clot.

361
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,313
It's his lymph nodes.

362
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,555
The bulge wasn't caused by pus
or blood. It's tissue inflammation.

363
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,889
How could there be
that much... Lymphoma.

364
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,787
We need to take a biopsy.

365
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,050
- Did I nick something?
- I don't know.

366
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,634
I don't see any
bleeding in here.

367
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,587
His sclera is jaundiced.
I think it's his liver.

368
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,149
It's failing.

369
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:32,288
We did a major operation for no
reason. It's not Lemierre's Syndrome.

370
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,589
We would have had to biopsy his
lymph nodes anyway to check for cancer.

371
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,959
Which it's not,
biopsy was clean.

372
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,510
We could be dealing with an
alcoholic going through withdrawal.

373
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,536
Explains his heart,
seizures and liver failing.

374
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,595
But not his swollen lymph nodes.

375
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,368
Why are we stealing
cable from here?

376
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,203
We don't even have
a TV in our office.

377
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:53,838
I'm an ex-con trying to adjust
to a world that's passed me by.

378
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,041
Stealing's all I know.

379
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,693
And the fact that I was right
about what's wrong with our patient,

380
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,652
just wrong about what.

381
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,933
He means it's not Lemierre's,
but it's still an infection,

382
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,468
which is why it's
spreading so rapidly.

383
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,519
Cultures take time and his
liver doesn't have much left.

384
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:10,995
That's why we're gonna blast him

385
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,564
with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

386
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,261
The blast will fry what's left of
his liver. The cure will kill him.

387
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,008
Not if we get him a
liver transplant first

388
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,717
and then treat him
with the broad-spectrum.

389
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,765
And old team for the win.

390
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,208
Not that I'm keeping score.

391
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:28,111
It's more of a grid where I assign
numerical values that determine

392
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:32,276
who gets raises, vacation
time and my respect.

393
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,557
We have him on the donor list for
a liver, but these things take time.

394
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,220
So he could die
before he gets one?

395
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:45,093
It's a possibility, but
we have another option.

396
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,861
We can do a partial liver
transplant from a living donor.

397
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,363
I'll do it. CHASE:
If you're a match,

398
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,166
but to increase our
odds, we'd like to

399
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,034
get your friends and
family tested, as well.

400
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,274
Is it safe?

401
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,210
It's a major surgery.

402
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,906
Donor spends a
week in the hospital

403
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,914
and up to three months
convalescing at home.

404
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,916
I can't ask someone
to do that for me.

405
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,162
There are hundreds of people
who would do that for you.

406
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,451
Because they don't
know the real me.

407
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,953
You are a good man
who made a mistake.

408
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,895
Then I have to tell them first.

409
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,325
I have to live with this, too.

410
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:27,438
I know. And I'm sorry,

411
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,965
but this is the only
way that I can do this.

412
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,251
Before I ask any of you to sacrifice
three months of your life for me,

413
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,380
I have a confession.

414
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,521
I had an affair.

415
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,192
I cheated on Denise.

416
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,194
I wouldn't blame
anyone if you decide...

417
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,599
I forgive him.

418
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,038
That should be
enough for all of us.

419
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,971
Thank you so much
for coming here...

420
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,871
There's more.

421
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,414
Larry, that new transmission
I put in your truck,

422
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,851
you didn't need it.

423
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,416
Joe, same thing with
the engine rebuild.

424
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,792
In fact, I cheated most
of you here tonight.

425
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:02,193
Half the time you bring
your cars into my garage,

426
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,668
there's nothing wrong with them.

427
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,501
I've been ripping
you all off for years.

428
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:15,071
I also took $10,000 from
the Harvest Scholarship Fund

429
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,840
and I lost it gambling.

430
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,252
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,884
I'm not the man
you thought I was.

432
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,400
That went over well.

433
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,837
Out of the two donors
who didn't walk out,

434
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,240
both were negative
for a potential match.

435
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,088
Telling the truth may
have just killed this guy.

436
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,637
I told him to tell
his wife he cheated,

437
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,683
not confess every sin
he's ever committed.

438
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,461
If everybody did that, we'd never
find a donor for anyone again.

439
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,725
Everybody doesn't lie, cheat
or steal from their friends.

440
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,086
Yeah, they do.

441
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,857
Maybe not as much as this guy,

442
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,136
but if people told
nothing but the truth,

443
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,960
the world would probably
burn down over night.

444
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,727
Some people think
it's burning now.

445
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,791
Maybe if everybody didn't lie...

446
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,995
Aww, that is cute.

447
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,030
I'm talking about your breasts.

448
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:17,198
They always get perky when
you're being painfully earnest.

449
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,000
Truth.

450
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,709
It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

451
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,850
More truth, I only noticed
because Chase was staring at them.

452
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,762
He'd never admit it because
he doesn't want to offend you.

453
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,049
Same reason he'd never tell you

454
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,532
that he's thought about
having sex with you.

455
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,333
Although, to be fair,
every man you've ever met

456
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,223
has thought about
having sex with you.

457
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,625
They'll lie, because
if you knew,

458
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,924
you probably wouldn't
want to have sex with them.

459
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:42,058
And that's just some of
the lies from the last minute.

460
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,563
And here's a bigger one.

461
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,729
You already know this,

462
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,667
but you pretend you don't
because it makes you feel civilized.

463
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,171
Most people find it
easier to ignore the truth.

464
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,606
Ask Taub.

465
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,046
Our patient can't wait for a
transplant that's never gonna come.

466
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,018
We need to get
reckless and extreme.

467
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,951
CT his liver, find the
damaged area and cut it out.

468
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,489
Hopefully what's
left will be enough

469
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,289
so we can start treatment
with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

470
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,992
I'm sorry the first time I had
both of you together, I had to work.

471
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,105
But Daddy's boss is
what we call a jackass.

472
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,675
It's okay. Stay right there.

473
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,251
I'm also sorry

474
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:38,483
for what I'm about to do

475
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:46,723
because nothing will ever
change how I feel about you guys.

476
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,877
But Daddy is weak
and needs to know.

477
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:09,110
Okay. I'm just gonna
put this right here, okay?

478
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,164
It's 3:30 in the morning.

479
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,235
Why are you still here?

480
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,532
House is here.

481
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:27,015
And apparently
prepping for an operation

482
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,359
that will probably
kill a patient.

483
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,451
I wouldn't be doing this if I
thought there was another way.

484
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,239
There is. He needs a transplant.

485
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,473
You have one lying around?

486
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,106
'Cause he'll be dead if he doesn't
get one in the next few hours.

487
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,847
That falls under natural causes.

488
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,384
If you kill him,
we're looking at...

489
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,478
Dead is dead.

490
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,181
Not as far as our
lawyers are concerned.

491
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,381
I'm not being a dick.

492
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:50,019
This is a real issue and I have to
worry about the big picture now.

493
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,128
I don't.

494
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,090
I'll be doing what you
would have done a year ago.

495
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,831
I'll be in surgery.

496
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:00,329
Chase? You need
to check this out.

497
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,800
This is his CT scan of
his liver from 10 hours ago.

498
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,271
This is from now.

499
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,507
It's healing itself?

500
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,457
When I left the room,
he was telling her about

501
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,993
the strippers from
his bachelor party.

502
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,155
Liver function has improved 30%.

503
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,961
It buys us a few extra days
before he'll need a transplant.

504
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,559
Interesting question is,
"Why is it regenerating?"

505
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,404
And scene.

506
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,473
Now we're back to
boring reality, reality.

507
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,381
His liver was in shock before.

508
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:49,114
He's been having an allergic
reaction since he got here.

509
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,132
It would explain why his
symptoms appeared so rapidly.

510
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,333
And maybe it's
starting to go away.

511
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,402
We need to run a scratch
test to find out what set it off.

512
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,917
Or who.

513
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,792
This all started when
he cheated on his wife.

514
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,657
He's allergic to a person?

515
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,031
Or something she's wearing.

516
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,866
Makeup, perfume,
birth control method.

517
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,898
Her Hello Kitty doll.

518
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,273
Two of you go find
her and find out what.

519
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,620
Two of you start treatment with
corticosteroids and epinephrine

520
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,636
while you run the scratch test.

521
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,851
You think I did this to him?

522
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,514
Or something you wear,
own, use or gave him.

523
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,085
I gave him a condom.
He didn't have one.

524
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,182
What kind?

525
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,771
I don't know what kind. I got it
from a health fair I was working at.

526
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:30,972
You're in the
medical profession?

527
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,574
I'm Miss Cedarville, the health
fair is one of my responsibilities.

528
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:37,000
Is another one hooking up
with 38-year-old married men?

529
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,439
I guess I'm supposed
to be the good cop.

530
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,800
I know this is tough,

531
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,311
but anything you can
remember might help save his life.

532
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:55,083
He was giving me a ride home
and he always seemed so nice.

533
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,679
And then we ended
up at the motel.

534
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,738
Now everybody's
talking about it,

535
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,157
and if they find out it was me,

536
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,230
I'm gonna lose my title
and probably my job,

537
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,562
and no one in town is ever
gonna speak to me again.

538
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,654
I made a mistake and now
it's gonna end up ruining my life.

539
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,572
Denise never wants
to see me again.

540
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,803
What did you think
was going to happen?

541
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,671
I was sick of living a lie.

542
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:26,218
Everybody loved me,
everybody looked up to me,

543
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,616
but I didn't deserve it.

544
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,711
Everybody makes mistakes.

545
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,155
They just don't usually broadcast
all of them at the same time.

546
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,093
Well, if I'm gonna die, I might
as well do it with a clean soul.

547
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,755
And if you live?

548
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,661
You didn't just burn bridges.

549
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,531
You torched, nuked and
salted the earth with them.

550
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,494
Everybody has to
pay for their sins.

551
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,936
It feels like you stuck
me with a hot poker.

552
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,370
An allergic reaction.

553
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,072
It's the swab for
wheat-based allergies.

554
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,876
I've been eating wheat my entire
life. I'm not allergic to wheat...

555
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,451
Now it feels like my
whole body's on fire.

556
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,017
This doesn't make any sense.

557
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,523
He broke out with
a rash right after

558
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,097
I tested with the
wheat allergy swab,

559
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:09,821
but none of his blood samples
shows he's allergic to it.

560
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,124
Then he's not allergic to it.

561
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,028
Could the corticosteroids
have somehow caused it?

562
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,260
I didn't hook them up yet.

563
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,029
After he broke out,
I wanted to confirm

564
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,866
it was gluten before
we dosed him.

565
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,538
Could be a latex allergy.

566
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,083
It started with a
condom and we've kept it

567
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,507
going with our
gloves and equipment.

568
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,886
He doesn't test
positive for that either.

569
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,811
None of his samples
test positive for anything.

570
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,380
Then he's allergic to something

571
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,024
not on the tests. I'll
keep looking here.

572
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,381
We'll start the steroids
and see if it clears up.

573
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,024
You have one patient
and three DNA results?

574
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,094
How else do I compare him
to other genetic disorders?

575
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,298
What's up?

576
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,364
Chase basically
called me a sellout.

577
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,410
Just because you
hung up your lab coat

578
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,478
for more money
and a bigger office?

579
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,947
I hung it up because someone
had to run this place after Cuddy left.

580
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,041
There are a lot of good
administrators out there,

581
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,210
not many good doctors.

582
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,612
More to it than you think.

583
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,655
For example, you're
looking at monkey DNA.

584
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:17,719
My analysis,

585
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,061
House took your results after he
manipulated you into providing them.

586
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,856
He's shedding his
skin like a snake.

587
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,256
If it was an allergic reaction,

588
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,604
the corticosteroids
and epinephrine

589
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,654
would have made
him better, not worse.

590
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,335
Is everyone trying
to think of an answer?

591
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,499
Or is everyone afraid to say
what they think the answer is?

592
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,705
I take it you're in
the latter category.

593
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,013
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.

594
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,315
It fits all of his
symptoms and explains

595
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,417
why he got worse
after the steroids.

596
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,180
Most medication
exacerbates the condition.

597
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,744
There's no treatment for it.

598
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:22,752
It fits.

599
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:25,720
Case closed.

600
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,228
You should go home
and get some sleep.

601
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,339
I feel like I'm in hell.

602
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,414
We can't give you too
much pain medication

603
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,350
or we'll make your
condition worse.

604
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,029
I got one final
confession to make.

605
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,590
What's left?

606
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,832
You cheated on your taxes?

607
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,833
I'm a murderer.

608
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,770
I killed my business partner.

609
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,343
I shot him in the head

610
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,281
and made it look like suicide.

611
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,748
And he was just the first.

612
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,586
You killed more?

613
00:35:58,757 --> 00:35:59,986
Three.

614
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:03,960
Or four.

615
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:14,033
Try not to kill anyone
else until I get back.

616
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:20,577
It's neurological.

617
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:24,116
There's an aneurysm in the anterior
communicating artery of his brain.

618
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,016
The area moderating impulse
control and compulsion.

619
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:30,350
As it grew larger, so
did the confessions.

620
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:31,754
Watch.

621
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,586
Bob, one of my shoes is
missing from my locker.

622
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:38,557
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

623
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,695
<i>I needed the cash and
the locker was open...</i>

624
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,667
I've never heard of a
neurological problem

625
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,704
that causes someone's
skin to fall off.

626
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,264
Because there isn't one.

627
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:59,311
The aneurysm is just another
symptom, it's not the cause.

628
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,314
We add them all
together, we get...

629
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,547
We get...

630
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:13,224
Kaw... Kawa... It's Kawasaki's
disease. It's autoimmune.

631
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,858
Yes, we knew what "Kawa" meant,

632
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,802
we just figured, since it basically
presents only in Asian children...

633
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,702
Which you might
have, by the way.

634
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,365
Which is basically
why we missed it.

635
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:24,870
Rug burns.

636
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:27,310
Certain carpet cleaning
chemicals have been linked to it.

637
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,540
Start treatment with
intravenous immunoglobulin

638
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:30,912
and monitor the aneurysm.

639
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,102
If it doesn't resolve itself,
we'll have to repair it.

640
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:36,451
Rest of you aren't
surfing enough.

641
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,194
Monkey DNA. Nice touch.

642
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,392
Really?

643
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,594
You don't think I should
have gone with rat?

644
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,694
I've been second
guessing myself all day.

645
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,535
Where are the DNA results?

646
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,768
First admit that I was right.

647
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:58,953
You manipulated
me into doing it.

648
00:37:58,977 --> 00:37:59,977
Yeah, I'll admit to that.

649
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,740
Now you admit that
it was incredibly easy,

650
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,257
because you can't
cheat an honest man.

651
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,012
I love them. I don't care if one
of them isn't biologically mine.

652
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,984
What about both?

653
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,379
It could be. I
haven't read these.

654
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,753
Now say I was right.

655
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:17,525
No. I'll admit I was
weak for a moment,

656
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,030
but I'm not doing
this, I don't care.

657
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,566
You do and I'll prove it.

658
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,835
I will shred this,
I'll call off my pool,

659
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,304
return the money and
we'll forget all about it.

660
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,468
Or we'll go to the
light box in the lab

661
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,737
and know the truth
once and for all.

662
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,983
Stop.

663
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:44,979
Let me see them.

664
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,763
Just wanted to make
sure all three were inside.

665
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,298
The mayor checked.

666
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,870
There wasn't any money
missing from the scholarship fund.

667
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:36,931
Dr. Chase told me
about your disease,

668
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,368
how it made you confess to
crimes you hadn't committed.

669
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,256
The affair with that girl,

670
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,419
is that real?

671
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,824
Honey, I...

672
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,503
would never, have
never cheated on you.

673
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,653
I knew you could
never do that to me.

674
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:27,957
I don't know how, but I knew.

675
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,676
Glad to see taking a year
off didn't dull your skill set.

676
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,940
I got lucky.

677
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,549
About the other night,

678
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:55,646
I have enough
problems with this job.

679
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,650
Second guessing my best
doctors shouldn't be one of them.

680
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,425
Why are you up here?

681
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,190
You have your own
bathroom and office now.

682
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:09,496
To shower. I haven't left
the hospital in four days.

683
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,932
Why?

684
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,663
House won't go home
and there's no way

685
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,466
I'm leaving him
here unsupervised.

686
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,774
House is screwing with you.

687
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,519
By not screwing with you.

688
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,555
He's watching TV and
drinking martinis all night.

689
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,385
Meanwhile, he's keeping you here

690
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,620
searching for a plan
that doesn't even exist.

691
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,493
How the hell did I not see that?

692
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,669
I'm glad you're back.

693
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,109
Me, too.

694
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:08,052
Either a hot tub or a sauna.

695
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,219
A hot tub would be cool.

696
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:13,395
New team, old team,

697
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:17,598
I present phase one

698
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:20,661
of operation Outer Office 2.0.

699
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,514
Nothing's changed.

700
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:36,354
Oh, everything has changed.

701
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:02,940
No.
