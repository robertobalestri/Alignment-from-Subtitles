1
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,195
<i>Pressure. I need pressure.</i>

2
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,299
<i>Give me sutures...</i>

3
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,545
<i>We need an Epi.</i>

4
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:22,885
<i>Alert trauma.</i>

5
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,608
Let the record show
that we are officially

6
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,806
convening a disciplinary hearing

7
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,716
regarding the events on February
3rd, 2012, in patient room 209.

8
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,912
Dr. House, this recording will
be transcribed and published

9
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,048
along with all supporting
documentation and rulings.

10
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,491
Do you have any questions
before we get started?

11
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,654
Yeah.

12
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,222
Who the hell are you?

13
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:44,065
I'm Walter Cofield. Chief of
Neurology, Mercy Hospital.

14
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,833
I'll be deciding
your fate today.

15
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,616
Cofield.

16
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,517
You were the Residency Director at
Hopkins before you moved to Mercy.

17
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,020
Which means it's safe to
assume that you trained Foreman.

18
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,035
Which means it's also safe
to assume that he trusts you.

19
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,721
This hearing isn't
about me, Dr. House.

20
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,205
I know you'd like
to make it about me

21
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,789
because then it
wouldn't be about you.

22
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,300
It's interesting that he picked the
old mentor to judge the new one.

23
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,633
Interesting, but not relevant.

24
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,429
The facts of this case,

25
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:22,873
on the other hand...
The facts are in the file.

26
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,378
If you have trouble reading
my handwriting, give me a call.

27
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,710
I'm going back to work.

28
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,419
If I just consider the file,
the facts aren't in your favor.

29
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,621
The facts say you
should be suspended.

30
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,054
Which, from what I understand,

31
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,644
would mean a
revocation of your parole.

32
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:01,507
The patient was a 32-year-old
high school chemistry teacher.

33
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,982
<i>He collapsed while out jogging.</i>

34
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,916
<i>He was paralyzed
in all four extremities</i>

35
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,230
<i>despite the fact
that the scans...</i>

36
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,452
show no sign of stroke
or structural lesions.

37
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,288
Did you put out an APB for a car

38
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,624
with a man-shaped
dent in the grill?

39
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,187
No broken bones,
no signs of trauma.

40
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,698
Transverse myelitis. Boring.

41
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,363
No enhancement on the MRI.

42
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,732
I just don't know what to do.

43
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:27,138
Please, you have to
help me solve this thing.

44
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,210
A little poetic license.

45
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,647
What are you doing?

46
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:41,952
Taking my vic-amins.

47
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,318
Those are Vicodin?

48
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,722
Did you have surgery recently?

49
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,453
About a decade ago.

50
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,128
My leg is no good
at judging time.

51
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,824
Were you taking
Vicodin during this case?

52
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,298
Uh...

53
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,660
Yes.

54
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,135
And during about nine
years' previous cases.

55
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,343
My process is proven.

56
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,646
Good things usually happen.
Bad things sometimes happen.

57
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,647
And when bad things happen, we
should figure out what went wrong

58
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,883
so we can learn
from it and correct it.

59
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,686
So we can assign blame.

60
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,719
Instead of recognizing that
bad things sometimes happen.

61
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,764
It was nobody's fault.

62
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,706
And then what happened?

63
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,870
Those who can, do.
Those who can't, teach.

64
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,437
Those who can't
teach, teach gym.

65
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,051
And those who can't move their
arms or legs teach us to laugh at others.

66
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,919
House actually presented
the case in that way?

67
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,513
Or are you just trying
to make him look bad?

68
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,958
Why would I be trying
to make him look bad?

69
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,756
Could be your not-so-subtle way

70
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,923
of implying this
was House's fault.

71
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,238
Given what's happened,
it's understandable

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,060
that your opinion would
color your testimony.

73
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,195
But I just want to know
what you said, what you did

74
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,604
and what you were
thinking at the time.

75
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,910
I don't think it was his fault.

76
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,071
Just tell me
your initial theory.

77
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,648
I thought the patient
had a liver problem.

78
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,982
Hepatic encephalopathy
explained why he passed out,

79
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,884
why he couldn't move his limbs.

80
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,622
But that's not the
idea House went with?

81
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,551
He thought Taub's
idea was stupid.

82
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,328
And what about your idea?

83
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,125
He thought that was stupid, too.

84
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,325
No. I meant, what was it?

85
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,302
Oh. I thought the patient had
normal pressure hydrocephalus.

86
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,499
And why did House
think that was stupid?

87
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,166
Oh, come on.

88
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,740
Unless you're an idiot, you know
why I thought Park was an idiot.

89
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,506
The patient had low
opening pressure on his LP.

90
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,776
That's what I said.

91
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,477
No, you idiot.

92
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,249
The patient had low
opening pressure on his LP.

93
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,493
Try unsquinting your eyes
and reading the labs next time.

94
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,994
Are you intentionally trying
to get me to dislike you?

95
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,961
That wasn't me.
The chair squeaked.

96
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,589
You're testifying for the record

97
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,794
that you actually used the
phrasing, "unsquint your eyes"?

98
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,446
This is not the place
to exorcise your guilt,

99
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,647
I just want to know exactly...

100
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:17,110
I actually used the phrasing
"unsquint your eyes."

101
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,314
He's hypokalemic,

102
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,925
could indicate a problem
with his heart, which would...

103
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,110
EKG was normal.

104
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,345
But, Chase,

105
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,863
a doctor who
actually takes the time

106
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,186
to read the lab
reports, has a point.

107
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,688
The guy's potassium is off.

108
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,622
Could be thyrotoxic paralysis.

109
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,821
Start him on steroids,
PTU, and beta blockers.

110
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,893
Mmm-hmm.

111
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:42,894
And how did these orange
smudges get on the patient file?

112
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,973
Seriously? That's
your follow up?

113
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,736
I eat a lot of Cheetos, I
forget to wash my hands.

114
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,476
Is my snacking really
relevant to this case?

115
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,416
Might be, if these were
actually Cheetos stains.

116
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,645
What are they?

117
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,761
Seriously, House?

118
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,521
You're blaming me?

119
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,658
You used Adams' shampoo.

120
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,560
I didn't do it.

121
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,937
<i>It was a harmless prank.</i>

122
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,043
My team is made up
of Type A personalities.

123
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,080
They need somebody to break
the tension every once in a while.

124
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,842
So this was a team
building exercise?

125
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,714
Is that what he called it?

126
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,116
It's what he implied.

127
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,881
House prefers
chaos over cohesion.

128
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,120
He believes that disagreement
and mistrust lead to better ideas.

129
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,455
He's not wrong.

130
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,593
As opposed to being right?

131
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,623
So you treated with steroids.

132
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,532
And then what
happened? They worked.

133
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,900
<i>Our patient woke up.</i>

134
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,269
Bill?

135
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,572
Can you hear me?

136
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,939
Yeah.

137
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,139
I'm thirsty.

138
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,214
That's normal. You've been
in a coma for several hours.

139
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,079
Can you tell me your name?

140
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,277
Bill. Bill Koppelman.

141
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,780
Can you tell me
what happened to me?

142
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,398
We're treating you for
an overactive thyroid.

143
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,400
We think that's why you
passed out and couldn't move.

144
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,086
Can you wiggle
your fingers for me?

145
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,491
Is he going to be okay?

146
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,259
Excuse me, but only
family members are allowed.

147
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,736
It's okay. They're my students.

148
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,431
Everyone back at school
is so worried about you.

149
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,407
Is he sick because
of the explosion?

150
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,316
What explosion? What explosion?

151
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,338
What explosion?

152
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,244
A chemistry demonstration he
was doing for his class went wrong.

153
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,960
Then why was it not
already in the patient history?

154
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,850
Because the patient
was unconscious.

155
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,952
But I'm assuming
Dr. House spoke to the wife.

156
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,822
The wife didn't know
about the explosion.

157
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,727
And I was the one
who questioned her.

158
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,854
So if there was an
oversight, it was mine.

159
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,531
Does Dr. House not attach
importance to patient histories?

160
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,536
No. He thinks they're crucial.

161
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,801
He just doesn't think being in the
same room as the patient is crucial.

162
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,207
House thinks avoiding patients

163
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,645
allows him to stay as
objective as possible.

164
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,545
He's not wrong.

165
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,722
That sounds like a very
diplomatic way of saying he's lazy.

166
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,619
That's also true.

167
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,454
Either way, I'm covered.

168
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,037
If you want an
accurate patient history,

169
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,723
don't ever talk to the patient.

170
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,388
Everybody lies.

171
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,662
Except me.

172
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,066
To you.

173
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,330
Would never do that.

174
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,530
Okay. Say you're right.

175
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,699
If you had actually been in
the room questioning the patient,

176
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,403
you could read body language,

177
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,879
you could ask
follow up questions,

178
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,348
and warn him of the
cost of lying to you.

179
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,545
Don't forget thumbscrews.

180
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,716
Can you dispute the possibility

181
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,157
that had you visited the patient
sooner, maybe talked to the wife,

182
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,870
been directed to
one of the students,

183
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,887
that this case might have
ended very differently?

184
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,997
<i>It wasn't exactly an explosion.</i>

185
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,400
It was a controlled reaction
that went a little haywire.

186
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,203
It was, too, an explosion.

187
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,838
Simon Harris filmed the whole
thing on his camera phone

188
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,243
and posted it on YouTube.

189
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,838
It got, like, over
75,000 hits already.

190
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,112
Looks like you've
gone viral, hon.

191
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,214
He had a loss of consciousness,
temporary paralysis,

192
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,953
but when I was told that
the patient coughed up blood,

193
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,225
things really started
to get interesting.

194
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,539
Your patient was doubled over
in pain and coughing up blood.

195
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,370
And you found that interesting?

196
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,407
Why, is that bad?

197
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,910
It's interesting.

198
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,113
I do this demonstration
every year.

199
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,658
But I usually have a
student aide help me set it up.

200
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:03,786
Apparently this year he
added extra hydrofluoric acid,

201
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,092
which is why it exploded.

202
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,794
The student aide was just
trying to make a viral video,

203
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,733
not hurt anyone.

204
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,634
Ended up doing both.

205
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,136
So we figured the patient
inhaled the extra large dose

206
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,505
of hydrofluoric acid, and...

207
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,009
burned his lungs, which is
why he coughed up blood.

208
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,841
If only burnt lungs explained
the passing out and paralysis.

209
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,109
The explosion does.
Check out the video again.

210
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,811
He smacked his
head against the wall.

211
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,012
If that caused swelling
in his brainstem

212
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,579
that would have led to the eventual
loss of consciousness and paralysis.

213
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,386
So we discussed
it a little longer

214
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,793
and House decided
to treat with heparin.

215
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,627
I wouldn't mind a
couple more details.

216
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,604
It was aerosolized heparin.

217
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,164
You skipped over the actual DDX,

218
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,710
and now you're
averting your eyes.

219
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,542
I'm growing more and
more curious by the moment.

220
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,546
He smacked his
head against the wall.

221
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,848
If that caused swelling
in his brainstem

222
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,153
that would have led to the eventual
loss of consciousness and paralysis.

223
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,816
Nobody move. Ugh!

224
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,293
He had on a what?

225
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,694
Gas mask.

226
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,635
The stink bomb was Chase's.

227
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,402
He was getting revenge
for the orange hair

228
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,376
and rigged it in House's office.

229
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,612
But House found it.

230
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,678
Mmm-hmm.

231
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,320
You can leave when
I have an answer.

232
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,049
Might help if we
knew the question.

233
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:40,354
How do we treat chemical
burns inside the lungs?

234
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,158
Maybe we can use a bronchoalveolar
lavage to wash them out with water.

235
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,631
Sorry, my fault, I
should have clarified.

236
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,827
How do we treat chemical
burns inside the lungs

237
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,460
without killing the patient?

238
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,506
Silver sulfadiazine works
well on chemical burns.

239
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,667
Burn cream would drown
him faster than water.

240
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,805
Well?

241
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,641
Aerosolized heparin.

242
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,675
Me likey.

243
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,218
But that's only experimental,

244
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,844
it's never actually
been used before.

245
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,012
Not true.

246
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,650
It's been used in sheep.

247
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,020
Uh-huh.

248
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,519
The guy was going downhill fast.

249
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:20,055
We needed a treatment
that was a slope changer.

250
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,158
So you busted out the
sulfur dioxide stink bomb?

251
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,230
It was a team building exercise.

252
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,431
No, it was manipulation.

253
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,184
You were pressuring your team into
coming up with unsafe medical ideas

254
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,540
just to get out of that room.

255
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,679
You say pressure, I say inspire.

256
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,843
The usual, safe ideas were not going
to work. Aerosolized heparin might.

257
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,910
And everyone else just
went along with this?

258
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:46,219
No. I told House I
thought it was a mistake.

259
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,760
And those were your exact words?

260
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,221
I think I might
have said "insane."

261
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,698
You thought it was insane
and yet you let it happen.

262
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,790
No, I...

263
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,879
If you disagree with Dr. House
on patient safety, Doctor,

264
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,201
it is your duty to speak up.

265
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,548
Otherwise, you're
equally to blame.

266
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,835
I did speak up. I tried.

267
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,637
And you failed.

268
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,145
And that's why I
went to Dr. Foreman.

269
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,609
The heparin could
cause the patient

270
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,154
to bleed into his
lungs even faster.

271
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,449
It is crazy.

272
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,287
But House doesn't do
crazy just for crazy's sake.

273
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,757
If he thinks this is the only
way to help the patient...

274
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,269
You did not tell me you
were involved in this case

275
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,633
when you asked me to do this.

276
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,636
I wasn't.

277
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,976
The heparin decision didn't have
anything to do with the outcome.

278
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,146
If signing off on everything
House does is a pattern,

279
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,646
it affects the way
House behaves,

280
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:46,015
it affects the way House's team
reacts to the way House behaves.

281
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,448
House

282
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,515
is brilliant.

283
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,284
I give him the benefit of
the doubt most of the time,

284
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,161
because I've seen
what he can do.

285
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,423
Getting House out of prison

286
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:01,491
is the biggest decision you've
made as Dean of Medicine, right?

287
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,934
And if he's suspended
as a result of this hearing,

288
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,871
he violates his parole
and he goes back.

289
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,277
And that probably leaves you
as former Dean of Medicine.

290
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,369
I suppose so.

291
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,074
You didn't choose
me to oversee this

292
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,143
because you thought
I could be objective,

293
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,053
you chose me because you
thought I'd have your back.

294
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:27,150
And I'd think twice about making
a decision that would get you fired.

295
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,291
Eric,

296
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,492
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,401
But if your
get-House-out-of-jail-free

298
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,132
experiment blows
up in your face,

299
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,203
it's not my job to
get you out of it.

300
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,690
After you'd
administered the heparin,

301
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,463
I see there was a
discharge order in the chart.

302
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,080
Yet the patient never left.

303
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,089
House ordered a
therapeutic bath first,

304
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:02,492
to wash off any residual
chemicals from the blast

305
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,522
but we wound up
finding something.

306
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,896
You have a bit of a rash.

307
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,661
Can you raise both your arms?

308
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,363
We just need to
see how far it goes.

309
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,204
You told me I was gonna be okay.

310
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,373
And now there's still
something wrong with me.

311
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,879
It probably doesn't mean
anything, but we want to make sure.

312
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,047
Of course you do.

313
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,380
I gotta get out of here. Okay?

314
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,751
Just relax.

315
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,098
Please just let
me get out of here.

316
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,122
It'll just take a minute.

317
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,568
We need to get a
good look at the rash.

318
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:37,929
The rash? That was nothing. Just
some irritation from lying in bed all day.

319
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,527
The problem was
the patient's brain.

320
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:42,863
He freaked out.

321
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,803
I gotta get out of here.

322
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,769
I gotta get out of here! Easy.

323
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,433
<i>"Freak out" is a little strong.</i>

324
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,873
In my opinion at the time, it was
the rash that was going to kill him.

325
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,072
Invasive strep.

326
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,240
Reasonable theory,
supported by the evidence.

327
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,875
The evidence
pointed to psychosis.

328
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,986
We caused it by giving him
steroids when he first came in.

329
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,950
What'd you think?

330
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,956
I thought Park and
Adams were both right.

331
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,289
But that their conclusions
were both wrong.

332
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,259
The neuro symptoms and the rash

333
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,730
were both signs of
an underlying disease.

334
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:16,333
Together with the lung,
it added up to Wegener's.

335
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:22,503
How does Dr. House handle
it when three smart doctors

336
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,134
come up with three different,
but equally valid ideas?

337
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,076
I run a diagnostic trial.

338
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,484
Start the patient on
high dose steroids.

339
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,024
Multiple birds, single stone.

340
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,755
If Taub is right, then he
can walk out of here cured.

341
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,319
If Adams is right, he will
spike a fever, get hypotensive,

342
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,161
we can treat it and he
can walk out of here cured.

343
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,535
If Park is right and he goes
all <i>Cuckoo's Nest</i> on us,

344
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,195
we can cross
"brain" off the list...

345
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,433
diagnose him, and he
can walk out of here cured.

346
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,167
Are you trying to
make this easy for me?

347
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,808
By your own admission, if
you give the patient steroids,

348
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,073
two of the three outcomes
could make him worse.

349
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,673
What's making the patient
worse was not having a diagnosis.

350
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,752
This was the
fastest way to get it.

351
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,153
It was the perfect
diagnostic moment.

352
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,855
In light of what happened,

353
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:14,155
do you still think it was the
perfect diagnostic moment?

354
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,156
Yes.

355
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,662
My theory accounted for
all the medical outcomes.

356
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,468
It did not account for the
disobedience of my own team.

357
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,205
What are you doing?

358
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,340
I think you're right
about the strep.

359
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,410
Can't hurt to biopsy the
rash while we're waiting.

360
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,348
Thanks.

361
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:48,290
At the time, it seemed
like a good idea.

362
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,459
I know this is hard.

363
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,896
But please tell me exactly
what happened next.

364
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,632
Draw up a little anesthetic.

365
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,208
Two cc's Lidocaine.

366
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,011
Get away from me!

367
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,488
Bill, you're in a
hospital. Calm down!

368
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,761
Code Gray!

369
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:31,360
So your position is that your
team's disobedience caused this?

370
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:32,598
That's not what I said.

371
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,349
You said you didn't
anticipate their defiance.

372
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,413
You implied that all would
have been fine otherwise.

373
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,938
So who do you blame?

374
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,271
Dr. Adams or Dr. Chase?

375
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,678
Or both?

376
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,714
I don't blame either one.

377
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,722
So who do you blame, Dr. House?

378
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,265
Code Gray!

379
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:05,799
Get Haloperidol.

380
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,396
Got it.

381
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,119
Oh, my God, Chase!

382
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,240
Prep the OR! Get a
gurney. Start an IV!

383
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,276
Come on.

384
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,112
Bleeder's gotta be in here.

385
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,483
Got it! Which artery?

386
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,186
It's his heart.

387
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,256
Fortunately, only the knife
tip reached the cardiac muscle.

388
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,823
Made a laceration
in the left ventricle

389
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,960
about the size of the
tip of my index finger.

390
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,828
At that moment, he
could only stay alive

391
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,340
as long as my finger
plugged the hole.

392
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,242
Hmm.

393
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,811
It could've been
me on the floor.

394
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,710
It should have been me.

395
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:21,872
It was my theory.

396
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:25,816
I held the needle in front of the
patient that set off his paranoia.

397
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,884
If you're looking for
someone to blame,

398
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,549
blame me.

399
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,689
Please continue.

400
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,824
Getting some ectopy.

401
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,526
Coming through! CHI:
Good carotid pulse.

402
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,828
Regular? CHI: No.

403
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,635
Got a PVC.

404
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,796
Gotta move it, people.

405
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,576
My diagnostic test worked.

406
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,145
It proved that the patient had
a steroid induced psychosis.

407
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,556
That's what you took
away from this situation?

408
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,913
The brain was not a symptom
of an underlying disease.

409
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,678
Your colleague was stabbed.

410
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,516
Are you telling
me you didn't care?

411
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,257
How bad is it?

412
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,325
Bad.

413
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,725
Patch.

414
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,523
Ready.

415
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:13,708
I can't take my
finger out, he'll bleed.

416
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,064
I don't think he can take it.

417
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,465
Oxygenation's 100 percent.

418
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,775
He's as ready as he's gonna be.

419
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,362
We gotta go for it.

420
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,405
On my count.

421
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,501
One, two,

422
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,506
three.

423
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,575
Suture.

424
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:33,918
Got it.

425
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,043
BP is stable.

426
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:38,118
Patch is holding.

427
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,759
What was his heart rate?

428
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,088
He doesn't have
one. He's on bypass.

429
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,132
Not Chase, the patient.

430
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,194
You're DDX'ing?

431
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,903
Park, come with
me. Taub's got this.

432
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,203
My friend is here because
you didn't listen to me.

433
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,711
I did listen to you.
Chase didn't listen to me.

434
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,815
At this point, being here
makes you feel better,

435
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,111
you're not helping
Chase or our patient.

436
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:07,946
Fine.

437
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,321
So he just walked out?

438
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,566
There really was
nothing for him to do.

439
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,701
It speaks to a
certain callousness

440
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,387
on Dr. House's
part, don't you think?

441
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,994
Who cares if House was callous?

442
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,030
Are you going to
punish callousness?

443
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,032
But you agree that empathy
is a useful quality for doctors?

444
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,226
House is not the problem.

445
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,429
Your friend got stabbed.

446
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,404
He may die from those wounds.

447
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,617
If you had been in that room,
maybe that could have been you.

448
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,921
I wouldn't have
been in the room.

449
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,972
Implicitly, you just said
that Chase was at fault.

450
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,254
We all knew a psychotic episode

451
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,380
was one of the three
possible outcomes.

452
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,381
And Chase brought
a scalpel in there.

453
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,761
He endangered Dr. Adams,
he endangered himself,

454
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,762
and he endangered the patient.

455
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,831
Thank you.

456
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,654
Lungs, rash, and now
excessive RR variability.

457
00:24:58,864 --> 00:24:59,957
Go.

458
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,733
It's a hospital. There are lots of
doctors that can take care of him.

459
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,707
And your thinking
is that only you guys

460
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:15,407
are qualified to sit in
this room, doing nothing?

461
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,314
If you're motivated by caring,

462
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,545
just bear in mind he's a
dedicated chemistry teacher

463
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,053
with a pretty wife and adoring
students and a baby on the way.

464
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,521
She's not pregnant.

465
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,923
Would it make a difference?
Because I could knock her up.

466
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:28,966
Autonomic dysregulation...

467
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,519
Shut up.

468
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,591
Can you guys keep it down?

469
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,502
You made it, bud.

470
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,539
You're in the PACU.

471
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:47,103
You've been in surgery. The
anesthesia's just wearing off.

472
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,705
Did I have an epidural?

473
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,710
No.

474
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,846
Because I can't feel my legs.

475
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,367
Dr. Chase?

476
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,331
Robert?

477
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,465
Yeah.

478
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,277
I'm Walter Cofield.

479
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,441
I'm a neurologist over at...

480
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,643
I know who you are.

481
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:28,715
Good.

482
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:36,294
You think you're up for
answering a couple of questions?

483
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:40,164
Well, it's not like I can
get up and run away.

484
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,167
Wasn't my best joke.

485
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:52,603
I'm smiling because
for the last 12 hours

486
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,842
I've been picturing
you with orange hair.

487
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,809
I dyed it back.

488
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,792
Were you angry with Dr. House?

489
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:16,669
It was a prank, it
wasn't uncommon.

490
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,929
So I've heard.

491
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,972
That doesn't mean
you couldn't get angry.

492
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,850
Might actually
contribute to that reaction.

493
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,207
Can I ask why that matters?

494
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,113
Are you trying to prove
that I was distracted,

495
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,376
that my judgment
was compromised?

496
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,614
Who do you think was at fault

497
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,119
for what happened
to you, Dr. Chase?

498
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:38,487
Again, why does it matter?

499
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,786
You're a smart doctor.

500
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,850
You know what happened
here better than anyone

501
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,452
and you've worked with
Dr. House longer than anyone.

502
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,897
And I suspect that you've spent

503
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,732
every minute since
this has happened

504
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,827
trying to answer
that very question.

505
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,868
I don't think it
was anyone's fault.

506
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:01,108
I was angry but I
wasn't distracted.

507
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,942
And I think if there's any
chance I'm gonna walk again

508
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,613
it's because
Dr. House is a genius.

509
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,216
What about warmth? Can you
feel the sheets on your skin?

510
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,850
I just said I don't
feel anything.

511
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,058
Objectivity, House.

512
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,630
What about posttraumatic
syringomyelia?

513
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,231
A syrinx formed in the
subarachnoid space,

514
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:30,785
blocking the flow of
cerebrospinal fluid.

515
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,142
That'd mean the
damage was permanent.

516
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,473
No.

517
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,575
Forget the nerves.

518
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,653
House, if it's total
paralysis he must have...

519
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,017
Not necessarily.

520
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,248
Think arteries.

521
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,516
Blood flow to his
spinal column is cut off.

522
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,991
It's a clot in the
radicular artery.

523
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,049
That could be fixable.

524
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:50,890
Prep a room for an embolectomy

525
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,040
and let's get that
thing out of there

526
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,304
before it does any more damage.

527
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,493
And if it's not a clot?

528
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,401
Then you can ask Foreman if
hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.

529
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,735
You're through the aorta.

530
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,338
There.

531
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:07,743
Sensory level is at L5, it
must be the descending branch.

532
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,178
Can I see the monitor?

533
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,743
Stop there. Shoot the dye.

534
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,056
There it is. TAUB:
Don't get too excited.

535
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:21,525
We still gotta get it out, still could
have done permanent damage.

536
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,563
Patient does not have
autonomic dysregulation.

537
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,578
There's blood in his urine
bag. Kidneys are failing.

538
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,366
House, not now. Gotta be now.

539
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,699
Foreman's transferring
our guy to Princeton General

540
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,117
as soon as there's
a bed available.

541
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,942
Says the doctors here can no
longer be objective since the stabbing.

542
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:45,584
In the middle of a procedure
that could basically save your life,

543
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:49,051
House is actually trying
to drag people away?

544
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,266
How do you work
with a guy like that?

545
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,782
He wasn't trying to
pull anybody away.

546
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,121
Everyone had already
refused to work on that case.

547
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,321
He knew the answer.

548
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,731
He wanted to check on me.
But he needed an excuse.

549
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,438
Otherwise he could
be accused of caring.

550
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,773
So your testimony is that

551
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:13,636
Dr. House's complete
lack of concern

552
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,772
is evidence of his deep concern?

553
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,955
Did you just do that?

554
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,119
What?

555
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,929
Wiggle your toes.

556
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,844
Do you feel that?

557
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,879
Congratulations.

558
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,848
It was the clot.

559
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,524
Short occlusion
time of the artery,

560
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,952
when the swelling goes down,

561
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,894
you should gain back at
least some of the function.

562
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,471
One more thing. Sorry.

563
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:18,070
You knew that your patient
was at risk for a psychotic break

564
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,510
when you brought a
scalpel within his reach.

565
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,481
Why did you ignore that risk?

566
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,515
I thought I was
right about the rash.

567
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,088
I would do it again.

568
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,827
I thought so.

569
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,159
That's it? "I thought so"?

570
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,567
What the hell does that mean?

571
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,005
You brazenly defied your boss.

572
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,047
Now that happened
either because Dr. House

573
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,742
has established that
that's okay in his world.

574
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:01,783
Or his prank war distracted you.

575
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:04,584
Or House makes medicine a game

576
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,249
and you just wanted to beat him.

577
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,187
Whatever the reason,

578
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:12,196
it boils down to the fact that
you may never walk again

579
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:17,225
because House created an
atmosphere that promotes recklessness.

580
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:42,459
This will be our last
round of questions.

581
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,260
I've spoken with Dr. Chase.

582
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,130
You know he regained movement?

583
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,762
No.

584
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,246
Are you really this indifferent

585
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,288
to the fact that
Dr. Chase is hurt?

586
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,548
Are we going off the record
because this is irrelevant

587
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,149
or are you going to hit me?

588
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,504
Why don't you go tell
the guy you're sorry...

589
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:17,928
I didn't do anything wrong.

590
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,207
It's not an admission of guilt.

591
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,132
He's your friend
and he's not well.

592
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,292
He's a co-worker.

593
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:26,532
Co-worker whom you've known
for almost 10 years who nearly died.

594
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:29,198
And who's still scared
he may not walk.

595
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,478
Are you going to have
me fired for bad manners?

596
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,484
I'm just trying to
understand you.

597
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:43,681
Why a man in your
position, with your abilities,

598
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,383
is incapable of shaking the
impulse to act like an ass.

599
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:49,461
Could we go back on the
record and get this over with?

600
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,334
Put the Vicodin away, Dr. House.

601
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,626
My leg hurts.

602
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,909
Is that supposed to be funny?

603
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,482
Two explosions.

604
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:28,857
We're not done here.

605
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,196
Hey! Hold on!

606
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:37,567
Close it up.

607
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:38,842
Take him out of there.

608
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,742
Dr. Foreman said you'd try this.

609
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,439
Said to tell you he's
no longer your patient.

610
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:47,212
Hey!

611
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,189
Wait.

612
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,926
Wait.

613
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:04,031
I have to get to my
car. I want to be...

614
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,867
Your husband has a
tumor in his lymph nodes.

615
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:08,867
You've been wrong every time.

616
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,033
Not this time.

617
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,803
<i>The explosion in the classroom</i>

618
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,141
<i>caused the cancer
cells to break open.</i>

619
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,941
<i>It's called tumor
lysis syndrome.</i>

620
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:19,314
<i>His body was flooded with an excess
of phosphates, potassium, acids,</i>

621
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,283
<i>all kinds of cancerous junk.</i>

622
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:24,131
<i>That explains the paralysis, the
bleeding, the heart and kidney issues.</i>

623
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,589
Everything.

624
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,526
What about the psychotic break?

625
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,790
Turns out we caused that.

626
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,669
This is treatable. Okay?

627
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:44,341
You have to tell the new doctors
he needs total body radiation

628
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,535
and plasmapheresis.

629
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,340
Move your cane, please.

630
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,889
Where's Cofield?

631
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,486
He said you walked out.

632
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,791
I'm walking back.
I'm not done testifying.

633
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:10,562
Apparently you were. Said
he'd have his decision tomorrow.

634
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,911
This case is a fiasco.

635
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,841
I didn't sleep last night.

636
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,218
Dr. House is
obviously brilliant.

637
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,916
Well, I think we've
heard enough.

638
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,927
But Dr. House is also a fiasco.

639
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,030
If I were to exonerate him,

640
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:24,394
condone his completely reckless,
immature, almost misanthropic behavior,

641
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,946
I would essentially
be sending a message

642
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,548
to all the other
doctors in this hospital

643
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,666
that it's okay to
act that way, and...

644
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:30,834
Sorry.

645
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,686
We're in the middle of something.
- I know.

646
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,303
I came to speak with Dr. House,

647
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,008
and when they told
me he was in here

648
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,408
I thought I should
say something.

649
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,684
I mean,

650
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,553
he wasn't the nicest
doctor I've ever met.

651
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:47,868
Well, I think we've
heard enough.

652
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,259
But he was right.

653
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,562
They found the tumor.

654
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,198
They are removing it, and
they are starting plasmapheresis.

655
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,032
They expect a full recovery.

656
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,871
He saved my husband's life.

657
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,741
Well, I guess that's it.

658
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,007
Thanks again.

659
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,426
As I was saying,

660
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,832
Dr. House's process is
dangerous and inappropriate.

661
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,841
But he is effective.

662
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,513
I've decided that I would be
doing this hospital a disservice

663
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:47,643
if I did anything to
change that process.

664
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,512
Congratulations, Dr. House.

665
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:55,993
This unfortunate stabbing
incident is officially nobody's fault.

666
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,977
Coward.

667
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:20,812
Excuse me?

668
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,854
You've got like 20
pages of notes there.

669
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,752
You were expecting to bore
us for at least half an hour.

670
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,086
You've got my
parole form in here.

671
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,795
You were going to
send me back to prison.

672
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,025
House, stop.

673
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,760
Good things usually happen,
bad things sometimes happen.

674
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,561
The fact that that
would-be widow

675
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,333
came in just in time to sob
all over your soft, mushy heart,

676
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,376
and the fact that her
husband is going to live,

677
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,068
does not change whether
or not I did the right thing.

678
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,405
How'd you get the firing
wire into the Vicodin bottle

679
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,348
without me noticing?

680
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:30,254
Why'd I even have to?

681
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,614
What was the point
of the orange hair?

682
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,987
Your hair smelled like Adams'.

683
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,957
Since there's no way you're
doing her without me knowing,

684
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,828
it means you were
just doing her shampoo.

685
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:44,093
Which means you were out
late drinking with some new girl

686
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,603
or because there is no new girl.

687
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,849
You were trying to make up
time by showering at the hospital,

688
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,433
but you were too lazy to
buy your own shampoo.

689
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,340
So I found a way to let
you know to not be late.

690
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,447
You couldn't just ask
me to stop being late?

691
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,506
What fun would that be?

692
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,847
None of this is fun, House.

693
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:16,693
They decided that
your being stabbed

694
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:20,304
was nobody's fault.

695
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,840
They're wrong.

696
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,186
I'm sorry.

697
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,152
Anything else?

698
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,661
I'm kind of busy.

699
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,165
No. That was it.

700
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,778
I've got it.
