1
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,745
The Patuxent River
Naval Air Station near DC

2
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:23,257
was commissioned in 1943
by John McCain's grandfather.

3
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,269
I'm thinking of
going hang-gliding.

4
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,785
Pax River's, like,
completely flat.

5
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:31,798
I think that's why they
tested the V-22 Osprey there.

6
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,400
I like naval stuff.

7
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,234
I like their oranges and lint.

8
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,276
What looks like kidney disease
but isn't? And where's Chase?

9
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,141
Root canal and Berger's. The
first one was regarding Chase,

10
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,374
root canal, if done correctly,
doesn't look like kidney disease.

11
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,678
Got a case for you.

12
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,046
Smells funny.

13
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,781
Patient had an idiopathic
anaphylactic reaction,

14
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,689
stumped two ER docs and an
immunologist from Johns Hopkins.

15
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,659
Patient went from asymptomatic
to fried kidneys in less than a year,

16
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,387
stumped three internists and a
department chair from Harvard.

17
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,796
Fourteen-year-old
girl, intermittent attacks.

18
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,132
Four-year-old boy,
consistently at death's door.

19
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,657
This patient died
five years ago.

20
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,414
Didn't say which side
of the door he was on.

21
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,084
The fact that he's dead
makes it more interesting.

22
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,317
Four-year-olds do
not die of Berger's.

23
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,724
I thought it was relevant.

24
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,925
Death is a consequence,
not a symptom,

25
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,195
and if it's not a
symptom, it's not relevant.

26
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,031
Shouldn't we be trying to
maximize what we can save here?

27
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,100
The 14-year-old, your
freedom, our asses...

28
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,074
Right. Save your asses.

29
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,985
She was in a car accident
when she was two.

30
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,381
She only had minor
injuries but her father died.

31
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,167
That was 12 years ago.
You think that's pertinent?

32
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,057
No, I think it's sad.

33
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:45,193
She got sick in the middle
of her 14th birthday party.

34
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,062
Which is sad and pertinent.

35
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,693
Maybe she was opening a
present that triggered the reaction.

36
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,795
Where's House? Pissing
contest with Foreman.

37
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,564
Last thing she ate
was strawberry cake

38
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,451
but allergy tests for
everything were negative.

39
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,377
You like your dentist? I'm
still going to my pediatric one.

40
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,640
What's your dentist's name?

41
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,642
Williams.

42
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,027
But what if it's not
an allergic reaction?

43
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,781
Hereditary
angioedema or systemic

44
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,683
mastocytosis could
mimic anaphylaxis.

45
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,553
You're not sure of his name?
You just saw him this morning.

46
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,888
The assistant's name is
Angie, her home number is...

47
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,088
Normal complement
studies, no skin lesions.

48
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,065
You had a manicure. This is
fresh. You weren't at the dentist.

49
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,624
Why would you lie about that?

50
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,012
To avoid having
this conversation.

51
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,996
Elevated BP. What
about pheochromocytoma?

52
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,884
Or an anaphylactoid reaction, which
could be triggered by certain opioids.

53
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,400
You've had your hair cut
three times since I've met you.

54
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,055
You can't be embarrassed
about a manicure.

55
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,570
There's got to be
a deeper reason.

56
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:34,876
Did House give you homework?

57
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,243
She's not on any meds.

58
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,694
Haven't you heard?
Everybody lies.

59
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,947
And the tox screen was clean.

60
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,712
Feel free to jump
in at any time.

61
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,353
We'll check
catecholamines for pheo

62
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,222
and run an expanded
opioid panel.

63
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,853
You see what the
patient says about

64
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,675
drug use when her
mother's out of the room.

65
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,360
No. Never.

66
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,646
Nobody's here to bust you, Iris,

67
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,639
we just need to know
if... No. I already told you.

68
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,967
I just take vitamin C sometimes.

69
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,168
What exactly were you doing
when you had your reaction?

70
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,811
Opening a birthday
present. The Magic 8-Ball.

71
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,848
The joke gift, not
the cocaine. Is that it?

72
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,250
Certain drugs could
explain her reaction.

73
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,220
What kind of drugs?

74
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,990
What kind did you have in mind?

75
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,567
Iris has always
been a moody girl,

76
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,638
and now that she's a
teenager, it's gotten worse.

77
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,971
So for the past few months, I've
been giving something to relax her.

78
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,910
Diazepam. I tell
her it's vitamin C.

79
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:42,648
Being normal is
very important to Iris.

80
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,151
She couldn't handle the
thought of being on meds.

81
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,687
Anti-anxiety medications
would explain it.

82
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:52,091
If we keep her off, she'll
be moody but healthy.

83
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,054
Or it's something else.

84
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,829
Need to DDx a patient with you.

85
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,530
I thought you had
a team for that.

86
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,837
According to
Foreman, they're only

87
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,206
for DDxing people
who are still alive.

88
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,911
You have a dead patient?

89
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,079
Bigotry is born when
we add modifiers.

90
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,581
I don't see creed, color, pulse.

91
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,451
Foreman will find out you're
taking this case and he'll bust you.

92
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,219
But you know
that, which means...

93
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,227
You want to go back to jail

94
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,095
because it's the one place

95
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,829
you're unable to indulge
your self-destructive habits.

96
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,565
Yeah. It's much more
likely that I'm taking this case

97
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,468
because I miss showering
with Cro-Magnons,

98
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,271
than I actually happen
to find it interesting.

99
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,108
Four-year-old kid.

100
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:51,278
His kidneys died, they
transfused, his lungs died, he died.

101
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,610
Have you seen
<i>Bride of the Monster?</i>

102
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,278
I just got the Ed Wood box set.

103
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,823
What if the chicken was the egg?

104
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,501
What if the lung
involvement came first?

105
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,050
I don't really care
about the movie,

106
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,752
I just don't want
to indulge your...

107
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,453
Lupus.

108
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,156
Because this is a
bad idea, House.

109
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,501
If the kid had a rash or
some circulation issue...

110
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,832
Damn!

111
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,708
Sorry. Just realized I'm late
for my anger management class.

112
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,345
Traffic, for sure.

113
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,279
- Taxes.
- Definitely taxes.

114
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,546
Spoiled grandchildren.

115
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:26,948
Platitudes.

116
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,684
Any others?

117
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,555
And I lose my temper
when someone suggests

118
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,788
that a handful of
pop-psych catchphrases

119
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,128
can control our most
seminal, intractable

120
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:42,566
and natural reaction
to a dead child.

121
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,068
Am I right, Emory?

122
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,547
I don't think Emory
wants to share right now.

123
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,448
They blew it, didn't they?
They missed your son's rash.

124
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,185
A faint one, on his cheek.

125
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,753
He didn't have a rash.

126
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,550
I think we should talk
about Lena's grandchildren.

127
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,716
They're alive.

128
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,619
Was he sensitive
to sunlight? No.

129
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,319
Greg. Cold fingers and toes?

130
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,555
No!

131
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,171
Wegener's granulomatosis.
I need to examine your son.

132
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,310
You're a bit late
for that, you ass.

133
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,473
With you and
your wife's consent,

134
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,276
we could get an
exhumation order.

135
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,949
Find out what killed him.

136
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,420
Ex-wife and you'll
never get her consent.

137
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,457
She's moved on,
new hub, new kid.

138
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,582
She wants nothing to
do with Drew's death.

139
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,854
Or me.

140
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,494
You're angry
because your kid died.

141
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,000
More than that, because
you don't have an answer.

142
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,999
People need answers.

143
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,915
He's in a crypt at
St. Jude's Cemetery.

144
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,217
You feeling any pain
or cramp in here?

145
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,384
A bit.

146
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,025
But not just there. Um...

147
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,029
Here.

148
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,930
Breast tenderness. Have you
been having regular periods, Iris?

149
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,696
Not really.

150
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,228
What is it?

151
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,892
I think we should
run a pregnancy test.

152
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:31,374
Iris isn't sexually active. She
doesn't even have a boyfriend.

153
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,276
Pregnancy would explain
all of her symptoms,

154
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,746
can even cause some
unpredictable allergic reactions.

155
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,216
How can I be pregnant if
I've never even had sex?

156
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,082
We just need to
draw a bit of blood.

157
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,992
What's the matter?

158
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,617
My arms.

159
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,863
I can't feel my arms.

160
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:03,868
At this rate, I'm gonna need
to pick out a plot for myself.

161
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,742
Thanks to your generous
donation, you have all morning.

162
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,782
More like 13 minutes.

163
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,715
Before we proceed any
further, Doctor, I'd like to inquire

164
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:17,747
as to exactly what procedure you
intend to perform on the remains.

165
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,460
You ever heard of the North American
Man Dead Boy Love Association?

166
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,467
I consider these
grounds to be a holy place

167
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,230
and I would ask you to
observe them with due decorum.

168
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,935
So you're taking bribes to plunder
graves and I need to show respect.

169
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,011
I think they got the
cause of death wrong

170
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,081
and if I find a hole in the cartilage
of his nose, right about here,

171
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,278
then it means I'm right.

172
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,758
Please be respectful.

173
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,331
I have prepared the
sarcophagus for you.

174
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,530
Thank you, Igor.

175
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,094
It's Milton.

176
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,680
You owe me a new pair of pants.

177
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,527
<i>She is pregnant. Test
came back positive.</i>

178
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:06,155
So she lost the use of her
arms and her innocence.

179
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,461
A vengeful god or...

180
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,472
<i>Cerebral tumor.</i>

181
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,632
<i>Vasculitis.</i>

182
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,900
<i>MS.</i>

183
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,749
I gather from the silence
that Chase isn't there.

184
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,548
No, I'm here. Where are you?

185
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,715
<i>"Nowhere," he said cryptically.</i>

186
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,657
<i>I assume you concur
with the diagnosis.</i>

187
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,357
Absolutely.

188
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,829
<i>Even though there
are three diagnoses.</i>

189
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:42,767
<i>And MS and vasculitis usually
get better with pregnancy.</i>

190
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,848
Yeah. I was saying I
agreed with the other one.

191
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,238
He's had his eyebrows waxed.

192
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,174
<i>I met a woman who likes
her men well-groomed.</i>

193
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,575
All over?

194
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,416
I assume from the silence
that Chase has had a Brazilian.

195
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,717
Cool. Interesting.

196
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:01,846
Ouch.

197
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,231
The question is, is this
really about a woman,

198
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,052
<i>or is it about something
more profound?</i>

199
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,036
Another question is, could the
paraesthesia be caused by an STD?

200
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,397
<i>HIV-related
mononeuritis multiplex.</i>

201
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:27,307
I gather from the silence that
either you all agree with Chase

202
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,212
or you're just staring at
his emasculated brow.

203
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:35,745
In either case, test for HIV and
do an MRI to rule out tumors.

204
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,320
And check Chase
for testosterone.

205
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,947
Bloodwork was negative for
HIV. All the money's on tumor.

206
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,686
How was the Brazilian?

207
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,788
It was fine. Hurt a bit.

208
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,220
What about House's
theory? Why'd you really do it?

209
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,369
Because I'm vain and shallow.
And you weren't before?

210
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:17,262
The girl I was seeing wasn't.
There's nothing profound here.

211
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,890
No tumor either.
It's not her brain.

212
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,605
Everything looks good.

213
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,801
What's the matter? My arms.

214
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,776
Still nothing? No.
Now they're sore.

215
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,104
The paraesthesia's gone.

216
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,327
Could the bruising be
caused by physical trauma?

217
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,919
You think she fell
out of bed repeatedly?

218
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,522
A blood disorder,
maybe thrombocytopenia?

219
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,912
A vitamin K deficiency or scurvy

220
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,296
could explain bleeding problems

221
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,269
and pregnancy
could exacerbate it.

222
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,274
Boys, do a home search,
girls, do the lab tests.

223
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,776
I'm pretty sure
that's not sexist.

224
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,868
Where've you been?

225
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,779
Picking up dry cleaning, filling
up the tank, violating the dead.

226
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,361
If you don't believe me,
call the monitoring company.

227
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,478
I did.

228
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,518
Unfortunately,
the Patuxent River

229
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,487
Naval Air Station
was GPS testing

230
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,185
and disrupted the signal

231
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,818
at the exact same 45
minutes you weren't here.

232
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,691
If I'd known I had 45
minutes of freedom,

233
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,561
I would have gone hang-gliding.

234
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:27,861
I admire the creativity.

235
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,300
But what happens when
the stunt doesn't work?

236
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,471
You think you're gonna
have to pay off a bet?

237
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,540
You think I'm gonna
triple your clinic hours?

238
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,008
I'm gonna call your PO and
you're gonna go back to jail.

239
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,897
There are Mees
lines on his fingernails,

240
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,561
so now I'm thinking
heavy metal poisoning.

241
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,556
You're an addict.
And I'm an idiot

242
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,025
for thinking that your
addictions were limited

243
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,528
to pills, anti-social
behavior and sarcasm.

244
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,725
Sorry. Vicodin repeating on me.

245
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,601
You're also addicted to puzzles.

246
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,670
You show all the
classic behaviors,

247
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,865
lying, neglecting
responsibilities,

248
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,568
and you can't stop no matter
how devastating the consequences.

249
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,803
Working on a medical case is not

250
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,072
a parole violation,
it's my job description.

251
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,581
Your job description is doing
what Foreman tells you to do.

252
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:22,212
Never mind <i>Bride of the Monster,</i>
you need to watch <i>Norma Rae.</i>

253
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,117
Before we get
started, I just want to

254
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,386
thank you all for
agreeing to relocate.

255
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,071
I had an appointment
in this part of town

256
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,739
and I obviously didn't
want to miss this meeting.

257
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,995
But thank you. I'm buying.

258
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,159
Not literally.

259
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,536
Hey, Emory, shall
we powder our noses?

260
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,939
Hey, did you know your ex-wife
still lives right behind this place?

261
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:56,078
She finishes work at 4:00,
picks up her new kid at 4:15.

262
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,283
Gives us about 20 minutes.

263
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,289
I made some calls.

264
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:05,559
It's amazing what people will
tell you if you ask rudely enough.

265
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,398
Was that table here?

266
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,806
Some kinds of pressure-treated
wood can contain arsenic.

267
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,340
We shouldn't be here.

268
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,276
We don't have a choice.

269
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,416
This is the only way I'm
gonna get your answer.

270
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,882
Does your ex leave a
spare key anywhere?

271
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:28,880
How did he look?

272
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,289
Peaceful.

273
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,662
Vitamin K deficiency's a bust.

274
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,740
Fridge has more spinach and
broccoli than a farmers' market.

275
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,073
The Brazilian, you
said it hurt a bit.

276
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,043
You've had one? More
than one. And you haven't.

277
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,140
They hurt all your bits.

278
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,644
That's my dark
secret. What's yours?

279
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,922
I had the nails and
eyebrows done but that's it.

280
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,153
I just needed to
create a distraction.

281
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,627
I met a TV producer at a dinner,

282
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,460
she asked me to appear
on their medical segment.

283
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,298
I screen tested it
yesterday and shot it today.

284
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,996
You're a TV doctor?

285
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,130
It's a one-off. When did it air?

286
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,074
Two hours ago,
otherwise I'd still be lying.

287
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,313
This is what she was opening
when she had her attack.

288
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,476
Will anyone believe
Chase is an actual doctor?

289
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,018
"Don't count on it."

290
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,468
She does have a boyfriend.

291
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,160
Love letters.

292
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,504
Porn? CHASE: The nasty kind.

293
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:59,101
Torture, rape, animals.

294
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,472
Sweet kid.

295
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,256
This is all that's left.

296
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,694
One box in the
bottom of a closet.

297
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,482
He used to wear those
stupid things all the time.

298
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:24,154
I used to have to
pretend I was scared.

299
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,782
Made in the People's
Republic of Lead Paint.

300
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,790
Back door.

301
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,428
Let's get out of here first. Need
to catch the end of our class.

302
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,343
I met him at school.

303
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,738
He was the only
boy that liked me.

304
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,382
It's a little more than like.

305
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,482
We haven't had sex.

306
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,153
Oh, come on, Iris,
you're pregnant.

307
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,721
So I'm just lying
about everything?

308
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,587
Well, you lied
about the boyfriend,

309
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:03,789
you obviously lied about
sex and this garbage.

310
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,297
They're his. He can't
keep them at his place.

311
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,899
Well, I'm glad we could
be so accommodating.

312
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,268
What else don't I know?

313
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,512
Honey.

314
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,474
What is it?

315
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,320
He came here last night,
and he told me I should leave.

316
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,626
But I didn't want
to and he got mad.

317
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,429
He hit you? Physical trauma.

318
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,110
Explains the negatives
for the blood disorders.

319
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,228
We should call the police.

320
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,794
I won't tell them anything.

321
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,469
That's ridiculous, he beat you.

322
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,139
What is it?

323
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,683
It's getting hard to see.

324
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,819
What the hell is
happening to me?

325
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,289
Rubbing alcohol, vinegar...

326
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,954
Not sure what this is.

327
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,797
Aren't there actual
medical tests?

328
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,694
Dead patients usually get
a lower standard of care.

329
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:25,142
Pink means lead, orange means
mercury and rust means arsenic.

330
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,143
What's brown mean?

331
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,042
Scotch.

332
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,716
He used to call him Deezer.

333
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,249
He couldn't say "zebra."

334
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,353
Made up his own words for
everything. We called them Drewisms.

335
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,894
How does your ex-wife do it?

336
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,197
How come she's not
angry and miserable?

337
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,012
She treated it like
it never happened.

338
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,906
She never even cried.

339
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,278
Not even at his funeral.

340
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,887
I was a mess and
she just sat there like

341
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,922
a statue.

342
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,029
We have a problem.

343
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,871
Does it limp?

344
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,968
Why do you care if he
works on two cases?

345
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,604
Because next it'll be
three cases, then four,

346
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:13,550
then animal cases and ghost
cases, then animal-ghost cases.

347
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,884
Assuming, of course, we
are talking about House.

348
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,254
You're just setting
yourself up to fail.

349
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,987
He has a lot more to lose
than I do. And he knows that.

350
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,493
He's rational.

351
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:23,787
No, he's not.

352
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,764
He's the most rational man
I've ever met. Annoyingly so.

353
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,734
He's not gonna put himself
back in jail over a dead kid.

354
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:30,895
He's an addict.

355
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:34,565
And he will put himself
back in jail over a puzzle.

356
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,902
He'll back down.

357
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,141
Halfway through the perimetry
exam, her tunnel vision went away.

358
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,411
She could see perfectly. - TIA.

359
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,554
The word "transient" is
right there in the name.

360
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,854
Ah. Here we go.

361
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,797
<i>Shazza, after giving
the pics an eye or two,</i>

362
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:05,031
<i>I can confirm that Lauren's
surgeries cost her some big bikkies.</i>

363
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,800
<i>Not only was there a gut
tuck, nose tuck, and arse tuck,</i>

364
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,140
<i>but her new fake norks
stick out like nuts on a mutt.</i>

365
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,109
The original script wasn't...

366
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,524
<i>Anyone notice Brad's</i>

367
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,760
<i>cossie fitting a little bit
snugger?</i> He's enlightening us.

368
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,195
<i>That's 'cause he's
retooled the ol' todger.</i>

369
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:23,519
<i>Let's just hope no one
cut the wrong wire, eh?</i>

370
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,387
So you just wanted
to look pretty on TV?

371
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,488
Question is, why
did he want that?

372
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:33,965
Clinic time.

373
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,139
What do you want us to do?

374
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,136
MRA for TIA.

375
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,796
ROFL.

376
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,633
Thought you only
had clinic on Tuesdays.

377
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,371
Oh, you're right.

378
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,248
Hi. I'm here for the free
flu shot. I got a call saying...

379
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,950
And I'm here to find out why
you didn't care about your first kid.

380
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,681
Losing a child, you just
breezed right through it.

381
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,300
What do you know
about my first kid?

382
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,369
Couldn't even squeeze out
a single tear at the funeral.

383
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,204
Where are you getting this?
Couldn't wait to squeeze out

384
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,163
a brand new replacement kid.

385
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,265
Damn it.

386
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,563
You had no right to say that.

387
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:12,864
I know. I deserved the slap.

388
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,667
But I was hoping that
you weren't capable of it.

389
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,573
Apathetic hyperthyroidism.

390
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,904
Could have kidney involvement, could
be genetic, definitely causes apathy.

391
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,377
I was hoping that
your lack of emotion

392
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,854
was a symptom of something you
could've passed on to your first son.

393
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,349
You know Emory.

394
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,525
We belong to the same club.

395
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,188
He wants to
relive this, I don't.

396
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,024
So I heard.

397
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,766
Emory was a wonderful man.

398
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,972
Never afraid to
show his emotions.

399
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,808
Which is great most of the
time but when Drew died,

400
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,280
it overwhelmed him.

401
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,748
I vowed I wouldn't
let that happen to me.

402
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,251
That's why you left him?

403
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,719
I left because of his eyes.

404
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,621
He had Drew's eyes.

405
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,388
Who used to babysit Drew?

406
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,258
My father, but...
His place or yours?

407
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,906
There are two types of people.

408
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,908
Those who can move
on and those who can't.

409
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,434
My father keeps up a good
front but he's just like Emory.

410
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,743
You need to leave him alone.

411
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,443
So he has two types
of people inside of him.

412
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,354
MRI was normal.

413
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,588
Yeah...

414
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,256
I found out where
your boyfriend lives.

415
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,261
When I paid him
a visit, he took off,

416
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,129
ran in front of a car.

417
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,364
You're lying.

418
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,962
He's down in the ER right now.

419
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,319
Shut up, you lying sack of crap!

420
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:56,603
Iris.

421
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,539
How do you know I'm lying?

422
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,510
How do you know that
your boyfriend is okay?

423
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,173
'Cause I'm right here, you dick.

424
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,417
Iris has dissociative
identity disorder

425
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,155
also known as multiple
personality disorder.

426
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,488
Are you saying I'm crazy?

427
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,364
It's the mind's response
to a severe trauma.

428
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,747
The person experiences something

429
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,167
that's too difficult to accept,

430
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,331
so they create alternate personalities
that don't have to accept it.

431
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,308
Some think it's quite
a natural reaction.

432
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,901
Iris hasn't had any
severe traumas.

433
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,307
The car accident.

434
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,913
I was two.

435
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,983
I don't remember anything.

436
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:42,488
These personalities that I'm
supposed to have, where are they?

437
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,750
They only come out when
you're afraid or anxious.

438
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,916
That's why House used
the hurt-boyfriend story.

439
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,018
But if there's no boyfriend,
where did the bruises come from?

440
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,592
The pregnancy?

441
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:55,067
When you say your
boyfriend hit you,

442
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,669
it means you
actually hit yourself.

443
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:03,505
And the pregnancy doesn't
take a boyfriend, just a boy.

444
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:09,448
You may not be aware of
half the things you've done.

445
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:17,747
How could this be happening to my
own daughter without me knowing it?

446
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,691
Diazepam was masking it. Taking
her off made it more apparent.

447
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,788
But I... I wasn't on...
Diazepam? What is that?

448
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,539
That's what those
vitamin pills were.

449
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,272
Iris, I'm so sorry.

450
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,473
I just thought you were moody.

451
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,551
I didn't want you to think
you needed medication.

452
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:53,592
Oh, my God, I can't
believe how stupid I've been.

453
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:58,462
We need you to help
us with something.

454
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:01,123
Different alters can have
different apparent symptoms,

455
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,737
allergies, paraesthesia, vision
loss, changes in blood pressure.

456
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,135
Do you think I'm making this up?

457
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,797
Your symptoms are real,

458
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:10,342
but some are physiological
and others are psychological.

459
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,674
So there's something
wrong with her

460
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,110
in addition to the
multiple personalities?

461
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:18,578
Yes, but we won't know
what until we access her alters

462
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,346
and compare their symptoms.

463
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,613
How do you do that?

464
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,447
Hypnosis.

465
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:27,959
Foreman's not gonna back down.

466
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,494
He's not an idiot. Yes, he is.

467
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,533
Just like you. If you keep being
stubborn, he will keep being stubborn.

468
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,398
Eventually you will
screw something up,

469
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,334
which will be bad
news for both of you

470
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:43,273
but only one of
you will be in prison.

471
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,708
It just isn't worth it, House.

472
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:58,513
Okay.

473
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,313
Uh... Yes, sir. Yes,
I know I told you

474
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,042
that I had a
chiropractor's appointment,

475
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,016
but I got a flat.

476
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,952
I know, right?

477
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,683
So, don't send out the Marines.

478
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,120
I should be back on the
road in a few minutes.

479
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,293
Okay, bye.

480
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,703
Dr. James Wilson,
county coroner.

481
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,297
I'd like to ask you about
your grandson, Drew Lemaine.

482
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,420
What did he do when he was here?

483
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,423
Where did he play?
What did he eat?

484
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,995
We watched a lot of
TV. And ate biscuits.

485
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,765
Did you give him
sidewalk chalk? No.

486
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,596
Fingerpaints? No.

487
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,101
A sandbox?

488
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,733
Like I said, we
watched a lot of TV.

489
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,471
You expecting someone?

490
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,140
What?

491
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,489
Dr. Wilson, my ass.

492
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,650
I told you to leave him
alone, you son of a bitch!

493
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,589
Temper trigger!

494
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,323
Who am I talking to now?

495
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,833
Nobody.

496
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,806
You must be somebody.

497
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,432
I'm too little.

498
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,168
Nobody sees me.

499
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,510
Nobody knows I'm here.

500
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,106
BP just went to 140 over 90.

501
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,614
What is it?

502
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,982
My arms.

503
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,520
You can't feel them?

504
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,494
It's okay, we can fix that.

505
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:51,763
Do you hurt anywhere else?

506
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,422
Not right now.

507
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,267
But you used to hurt?

508
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,329
When I eat strawberries.

509
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,241
And when I remember...

510
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,971
You remember being hurt?

511
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,783
I remember everything.

512
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,634
Baby...

513
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,239
It's going to be okay.

514
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:02,691
Iris, why didn't
you ever tell me?

515
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,466
It was my fault Daddy died.

516
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,302
Oh, no.

517
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,639
Yes, it was. I was crying
and he couldn't drive.

518
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,475
It was my fault Daddy died.

519
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,377
Oh, no. No, no, honey.

520
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,508
You were just a baby.
It wasn't your fault. No...

521
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,753
It was my fault.
I'm sorry, Mommy.

522
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,288
Poor baby.

523
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,716
I'm so sorry.

524
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,401
It wasn't a miscarriage.
Tests show she's still pregnant.

525
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,571
Okay, cross out everything
that doesn't appear in every alter.

526
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,815
When she opened
the Magic 8-Ball,

527
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,716
it triggered a switch to a
personality with a strawberry allergy.

528
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,051
Pregnancy, vaginal
bleeding and elevated BP.

529
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,454
Could be a preeclampsia.

530
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:00,968
Worst case, could be
an ectopic pregnancy.

531
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,393
We need to ultrasound.

532
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,899
Not seeing an embryo
in the fallopian tube.

533
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,198
Not seeing an embryo anywhere.

534
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,846
<i>Which idiot did
the pregnancy test?</i>

535
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,057
I did one of them. Chase
did another, Taub did a third.

536
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,243
Three tests, three positives.

537
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,409
What happened to your eye?

538
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,578
I grabbed Park's ass.

539
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,347
Exoplanets.

540
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,423
I think he said
exoplanets. Wait for it.

541
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:38,588
We can't actually see them,
but we infer their existence

542
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,857
because of the effect they
have on the star they orbit.

543
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,391
Pregnancy test only infers
an embryo's existence

544
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,027
because of elevated hCG levels.

545
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,970
Which could also be
caused by choriocarcinoma,

546
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,542
which affects the
placenta, mimics pregnancy,

547
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,543
and causes elevated
BP and vaginal bleeding.

548
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,511
Occult choriocarcinoma,
which is why

549
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,581
we didn't see it
on the ultrasound.

550
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,914
Tell all the alters
that they have cancer.

551
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,430
Mom or dad?

552
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,066
Mom, dad and mom's dad.

553
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:21,903
The good news is it made
me realize that you were right.

554
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,635
I can't drop it.

555
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,942
But now that I accept that,
I feel much less conflicted.

556
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,844
I've ruled out Wegener's,
Berger's, heavy-metal poisoning...

557
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,543
Two trains are about to collide

558
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,313
and I'm trying to
talk them out of it.

559
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,697
I still think I'm
missing something.

560
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,314
No, no. You don't
want to listen to me,

561
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,049
then I don't want
to listen to you.

562
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,683
That is so fifth grade.

563
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,385
I agree. And you know why?

564
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,435
Because I'm just as bad as you.

565
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:46,988
I knew this would
fall on deaf ears

566
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,364
but I just kept
talking and talking.

567
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,329
You're right.

568
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,303
You don't even
know what I just said.

569
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,872
That is ridiculous.

570
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:01,145
You said, "Blah, blah, blah,
deaf ears, blah, blah, blah."

571
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:04,141
Absolutely
essential information.

572
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,855
Ray! Ray!

573
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,258
Leave him alone! What
are you doing to him?

574
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:25,928
It's okay.

575
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,835
Mickey.

576
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:29,101
You? You brought him?

577
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,608
I asked him to meet me
here for a family reunion.

578
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,836
Ray!

579
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,602
Let's just get out
of here, okay?

580
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:35,941
I know what killed your son.

581
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,925
You don't get it, do you? I
don't care what killed him!

582
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,349
It's called Alport syndrome.

583
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:42,179
It's a genetic condition
characterized by kidney failure,

584
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:45,382
bronchial myomas,
Mees lines and deafness.

585
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,118
Idiot, Drew wasn't deaf.

586
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,391
Son of a bitch! Get
away from them!

587
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,990
House. House!

588
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,392
It's a genetic condition.

589
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,455
Shut up! Genetic.

590
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:00,932
Your father has the
gene and so do you.

591
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,972
It was Grandpa's slight deafness
that gave the game away.

592
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,272
You're apparently asymptomatic,

593
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,712
but you still passed the
gene on to your children.

594
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,108
Plural.

595
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,779
You're lying.

596
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:27,722
He has high frequency hearing
impairment and so did Drew.

597
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,927
That's why Drew
made up his own words,

598
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,095
'cause he couldn't
hear properly.

599
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,637
It's okay. Now that
we know what it is,

600
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,270
he'll need treatment
but he'll live.

601
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,019
You know, there are platitudes
that can help you with that.

602
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,678
I miss him, too.

603
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,083
She's responding well.

604
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,622
Cuddy threatened
him with clinic duty.

605
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,306
I thought threatening him
with jail would be different.

606
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,813
Not an irrational thought.

607
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,144
I'm still sending him back.

608
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,014
He saved two lives.

609
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,250
Which means it's too
late for me to back down.

610
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:34,784
It's no longer my choice.

611
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,624
It's just me telling him he
can get away with anything.

612
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,667
I have to send him to prison.

613
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:53,844
Your job is to keep
this machine running.

614
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:58,679
It's your choice to make House
a useful tool or a monkey wrench.

615
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,309
Cuddy's way didn't fail.

616
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:04,982
Because she didn't try to
control House, she managed him.

617
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:11,489
And she knew better than
anybody what a tool he could be.

618
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,556
What would Cuddy have done?

619
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,896
Ten clinic hours.

620
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,935
Cuddy's not here anymore.

621
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,840
You've got 30.
