1
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,441
How long has your daughter
had trouble breathing?

2
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,209
About a week now.

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,172
The best dads wait two or more.

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,307
Yeah, no. It's not
like it's serious.

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,479
I checked online and
it's asthma or something.

6
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,489
"Or something" is
the number one killer

7
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,558
of teens with no medical degree.

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,503
When was the last time
he took you to see a doctor?

9
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,257
Uh... Like five months ago.

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,763
We went to a clinic in
Trenton. I had strep throat.

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,766
Remember the antibiotic
they gave you? Is it neomycin?

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,335
Amoxicillin.

13
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,566
So, about the inhaler
for my asthma, I was...

14
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:42,699
Sorry.

15
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,405
Hospital policy
specifically prohibits me

16
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,708
from giving meds to
unrelated homeless people

17
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,221
pretending to be
father and daughter.

18
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,052
Your pants are a size too short,

19
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,429
so either you grew
several of inches

20
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,649
or you grabbed the closest
size in the thrift store.

21
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,214
And only you have
dimples, which are adorable,

22
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,420
but they're also an X-linked
dominant genetic trait.

23
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,673
Which actually
doesn't prove anything.

24
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,723
The fact that she didn't
burst into tears tells me

25
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,700
that you never thought
he was your dad.

26
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:09,626
Let's get out of here.

27
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,250
Since you're the brains of the
operation, you might want to stick around.

28
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,072
What, so I can get
busted by Social Services?

29
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:19,272
No. So you can stop
bleeding out of your ear.

30
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,816
It's usually a sign
of a skull fracture.

31
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,510
Someone been using
your head as a soccer ball?

32
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,853
No. As much as I'd like
to take your word for it,

33
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,089
I have no interest in
taking your word for it.

34
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,119
No tenderness. No pain.

35
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,589
Right. Looks like you're telling
the truth about something.

36
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:45,366
The ear canal is fine.

37
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,269
And you don't have a fever.

38
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,770
Pay the man. He's
late for a trashcan fire.

39
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,458
Would you tell me what's
going on? What's wrong with me?

40
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,121
I have no idea.

41
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,298
Why did you ask to meet us
30 miles away from the hospital?

42
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,365
Because I can.

43
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,839
Also, Chris Christie's blog says

44
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,210
the pancakes here are the best.

45
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,715
So, what do we got
on this 18-year-old

46
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,528
with the ear bleed and
the breathing problems?

47
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,455
CT confirms no skull fracture. And
looking at her confirms she's not 18.

48
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,191
Yes, she is.
Says so in the file.

49
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,727
We can't treat an underage
patient without a guardian.

50
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,108
We need to call Social Services.

51
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,895
I cut a deal with the patient.

52
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,823
We don't call, she doesn't bolt.

53
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,064
Whatever age, living on the street
makes her vulnerable to malnutrition,

54
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,229
drug use, HIV...

55
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,548
All things which could
explain her symptoms.

56
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:30,010
No sign of malnutrition, tox screen's
clear, STD panel was negative

57
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,171
and is that Foreman?

58
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,841
Oh, my goodness, it is.

59
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,749
Hi, Dean Foreman!

60
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,665
Are you not gonna introduce
us because we're married?

61
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,759
No, wait, that's her.

62
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,862
She's a pharmaceutical rep,
and this is a working breakfast.

63
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,431
In a restaurant that's nowhere
near your home or the hospital?

64
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,035
Chris Christie
recommends the pancakes.

65
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,083
Squamous cell middle ear tumor
could've caused the ear bleed,

66
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,029
paraneoplastic reaction
caused the breathing problems.

67
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,419
Middle ear looks
completely normal.

68
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,166
But there is thickening in the
lining of the wall of the third ventricle.

69
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,681
Could be a sign of
cerebral infection.

70
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,203
It would explain
the lack of fever.

71
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,856
Pneumococcus is pretty common
among the homeless population.

72
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,540
We should find out if
she's been vaccinated.

73
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,693
Sure. Ask her and when she
refuses to tell you anything,

74
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,363
start her on ceftriaxone
for pneumococcus.

75
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,633
And if she says she
has been vaccinated?

76
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,419
Then don't believe her and start
her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.

77
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,709
How about we don't believe she's
gonna bolt and we call Social Services.

78
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,140
While I'm in the
little boys' room,

79
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,514
you can pretend I'm
seriously considering that idea.

80
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,712
The bathroom's that way.

81
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,750
Pretty sure there's
one in the hospital.

82
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,125
When I was your age, I ran away.

83
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,256
Lived on my own.

84
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,802
At the time, it seemed...

85
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:03,936
Let me guess,

86
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:08,271
life with mom and dad was kind
of a drag so you just ran away,

87
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,572
lived with friends
and partied with guys

88
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,941
that you knew your
parents would hate,

89
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,778
and then when you got tired of
being a rebel, you just went home.

90
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,344
Being homeless
isn't a vacation for me,

91
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,252
and I'm not acting out.

92
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,954
My life at home sucked,
so I got the hell out of there.

93
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,826
There are other options
besides living on the streets.

94
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,490
Right. Like group homes,
where you're packed in

95
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,467
with as many messed-up,
delinquent kids as possible,

96
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,847
foster parents, who only take
you in because you're a meal ticket.

97
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,670
I can think of easier ways
to make 175 bucks a week.

98
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,285
No, you're right. I
really should roll the dice

99
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,473
and hope for a pair that don't
ruin my life the way that my mom...

100
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,036
Get your hands off my stuff!

101
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,207
This stuff might tell us
more about why you're sick.

102
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,944
A history textbook?
You go to school?

103
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,816
I don't plan on being
homeless forever.

104
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,317
Hello, good sir.

105
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:04,387
My brother the general here
gots the green apple quick step.

106
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,028
One of us is in the
wrong time zone.

107
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,198
And if it's me, I need
to talk to a stockbroker

108
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,869
and anyone from the
Kennedy family. In that order.

109
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,606
He got the runs
and we do need him

110
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,374
up and at 'em for
battle tomorrow.

111
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,883
It's hardly authentic,
coming to a newfangled clinic,

112
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,715
especially with a Yankee doctor.

113
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,916
Sir, are you
questioning my resolve?

114
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,721
Yes. And your sanity.

115
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,825
I'm multi-tasking.

116
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,422
General, do not light out.

117
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,931
We swore that we would
see the elephant together.

118
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,106
Far be it from me to come between
two nut jobs and their elephant.

119
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,215
I could add some mercury if you
want to make it more authentic.

120
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,688
The Confederacy thanks you, Doc.

121
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,068
I got House's phone, deleted
all photos of you and Anita.

122
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:19,896
I owe you.

123
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,636
An affair? Never knew
you were such a tramp.

124
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,040
Neither did I.

125
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,603
Anita, she's fun, smart,

126
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,707
not looking for anything
serious. It's pretty perfect.

127
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,380
Except for the gnawing
guilt about the husband,

128
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,922
the lies she must
be telling him.

129
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,322
But not guilty enough
to stop seeing her.

130
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:41,486
She's smoking hot. And it's not
his job to protect her marriage.

131
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,006
Aren't you supposed
to be pointing a finger

132
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,521
at your own life as
a cautionary tale?

133
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,534
If not for cheating, I
might still have a wife

134
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,196
but I wouldn't have
Sophie and Sophia.

135
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:55,402
Which means I wouldn't be
preparing for their visit this week

136
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,412
by child-locking all my
cabinets, padding table corners

137
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,610
and getting rid of
every single magazine.

138
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,710
You could probably just hide
the porn in your underwear drawer.

139
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:10,245
The magazines go away
so I won't ignore my children.

140
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,887
I know I have to
pay attention to them,

141
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,756
I want to pay attention to them.

142
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,321
But they're just so

143
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,592
boring.

144
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,902
Did you learn anything
at Jane Doe's school?

145
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,454
<i>They did a bunch of vaccinations,
including pneumococcus.</i>

146
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,276
<i>Take her off the ceftriaxone.</i>

147
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,746
So we're back to square none.

148
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,838
<i>Not exactly.</i>

149
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,918
The name she registered
under seems to be fake,

150
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,816
but the address is
a foreclosed house.

151
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,487
We'll let you know what we find.

152
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,993
Plenty of food, water.

153
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,251
And beer.

154
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,024
She eats well, goes to
school, makes good grades.

155
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,650
She's a homeless girl who's
captain of the volleyball team.

156
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,395
How can you be okay with this?

157
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,868
Your mom sends you
to work with snacks.

158
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,632
I want and need parents.

159
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,937
Jane Doe is
flourishing without them.

160
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,202
Maybe.

161
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,476
But this mold definitely is.

162
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,479
<i>You went to my school?</i>

163
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,260
Now that they know
they'll report me.

164
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,378
I can't go back there.

165
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,456
You may have a fungal
infection, you need that medicine.

166
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,618
Fluconazole, right?
I'll get it at a clinic.

167
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,794
I can't feel my legs!

168
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,264
Is that the infection?

169
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,229
I don't think so.

170
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:34,470
So, what causes an ear bleed,

171
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,169
breathing problems

172
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,212
and our runaway's
inability to run away?

173
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,791
Fungal infection's
off the table.

174
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,147
What about transverse myelitis?

175
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,344
Not with normal
posterior column function.

176
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,419
I've been waiting to
do this for months. Pull!

177
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,994
Sights seem to be off on this.

178
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,223
We didn't call Social
Services before

179
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,172
because we didn't want
the patient to take off.

180
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,932
Now she can't. There's
no reason for us not to call.

181
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,769
How about the reason that there's
no reason. This is working fine for me.

182
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,200
Pull!

183
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,147
That one clearly
took evasive action.

184
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,888
You want to protect
her, because you think

185
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,694
she's fine on her own,
outside the system...

186
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,654
Does anyone have a position
on our patient's medical condition?

187
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,223
Could be endocarditis
with septic emboli.

188
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,314
Pull!

189
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,461
I'd turn around and shoot
you, but apparently I'd miss.

190
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,429
There's no murmurs,
no Osler nodes.

191
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,470
You've never done
this before, have you?

192
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,593
No, I have not.

193
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,764
But all the time I had my ankle
monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't.

194
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,576
Vasculitis fits.

195
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,012
Start treatment with steroids.

196
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,848
If she's lucky, she'll
be free to flee again.

197
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,748
Not once I call Social Services.

198
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,344
I'm not giving up.

199
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,113
You wanna bet?

200
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,190
One shot, one birdie.

201
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,090
You hit, you make the call.
You miss, never mention it again.

202
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,656
No. Why would I agree?

203
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:08,498
Because your only other
option is you call and I fire you.

204
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,747
Pull!

205
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,079
She responding
to corticosteroids?

206
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,196
Looks like it.

207
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,337
And Social Services.

208
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,904
I thought for sure there'd
be some yelling or profanity,

209
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,103
possible bloodletting.

210
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,009
She's tired of living
on the streets after all.

211
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,846
I'll bet House regrets...

212
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,888
Could he know I'm
good with a gun?

213
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,256
I don't know how, but...

214
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,296
Hiring a hooker to pretend
to be a social worker?

215
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,957
She took a bet that
she knew she'd win.

216
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,068
Frankly, I feel violated.

217
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,297
What happened to the
social worker I called?

218
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,431
Apparently someone identifying
themselves as Dr. Pujols called

219
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,806
and said the patient ran off.

220
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,909
Come on, Poo-holes.

221
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,917
I've informed Social
Services of the mistake

222
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,595
and given Jane Doe's
description to the cops.

223
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,762
They'll track down the parents.

224
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,049
Thank you.

225
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,489
I'll leave you and
Dr. Pujols alone.

226
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,311
You should have told me you were
treating an underage clinic patient.

227
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,225
I was giving you
the gift of deniability.

228
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,456
Now I'm giving you the
gift of additional clinic hours.

229
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,427
No, you're not.

230
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,600
You've got nothing on me.

231
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,399
Check your phone.

232
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,605
My phone?

233
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,976
Right, I guess I did have
some pictures on that.

234
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:04,143
But I also have these.

235
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,952
Here's the two of you
kissing over dinner.

236
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,650
Busting a move at a nightclub.

237
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,326
Is that your hand near
her nether regions?

238
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,761
Thanks again for taking
out the ankle bracelet.

239
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,442
I'm not gonna let you
blackmail me, House.

240
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,845
Of course not. There's no way
your selling out your integrity

241
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,270
would let me compromise
your job in any major way

242
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,603
over some tawdry bit of gossip.

243
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,206
But what about
compromising it in a minor way,

244
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,680
reduced clinic hours,
unlimited Internet porn budget.

245
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,115
That makes much more sense than

246
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,618
the nuclear option of
ruining both our lives.

247
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,786
You can keep
these. I got copies.

248
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:58,364
God, how I've missed the sweet
smell of sticking it to the man.

249
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,565
Adams is right. You're
protecting this girl.

250
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,675
Oh, no, I was wrong.

251
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,678
That's the stench of moralizing.

252
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:09,113
I'm protecting myself from
meddling bureaucrats and parents.

253
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,342
You admire this girl.

254
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,716
She had a horrible home life
so she went out on her own.

255
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,049
She's your road not taken.

256
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,955
I've always dreamed of living in
an abandoned house with mold.

257
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,357
House, all I'm accusing you of is
having a connection with a patient.

258
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,451
This is a good thing.

259
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,620
It's not a good thing,
'cause it's not a thing.

260
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,133
It is a thing, which you'll prove
when her parents show up,

261
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,430
and you start
protecting her from them.

262
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:41,139
The sound I make is "moo."

263
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:46,084
And the sound I make is "quack."

264
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,443
Moo!

265
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,519
The sound is quack.

266
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,279
Quack, quack.

267
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,489
Quack, quack, quack.

268
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,187
I'm an ass.

269
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,927
On the plus side, I can now
program my DVR from my phone.

270
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,993
They are kind of boring.

271
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,230
All kids. Not just yours.

272
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:39,532
Very helpful.

273
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,602
You need to log more hours.

274
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,109
Eventually you'll pass
boredom, get to bonding.

275
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:47,045
Like Stockholm syndrome.

276
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,843
I heard the nurses talking. You
called Social Services for real.

277
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,669
Because you shouldn't
be living on your own.

278
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,982
Right. Better my mom should
use me as a punching bag.

279
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,480
If your mom abused
you, Social Services

280
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,321
won't let you go home with her.

281
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,036
Have I mentioned I
don't trust the system?

282
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,420
We don't know if you're better
yet. You can't just take off.

283
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,666
Uh... Can we help you?

284
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,861
I'm Adele Brown from
Social Services, and this...

285
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,030
I'm Ellen Rogers,
Callie's mother.

286
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,698
You haven't been
that for two years.

287
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,638
I promise, things
are different...

288
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,373
Wow, two sentences in and
you're already making promises.

289
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,416
Okay. Maybe we need to take a
minute here and give Callie some space.

290
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,281
No, I don't need a minute.
I need her out of my life.

291
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,378
Is she okay? I will
be once you just...

292
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,482
Oh, my God!

293
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,825
We need help in here!

294
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,328
Go!

295
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,162
You bet 100 bucks
on a turtle race?

296
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,065
I paid Mr. Chips 5
bucks to take a dive.

297
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,077
The bleeding stopped on its own.

298
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,081
She got worse after being on
steroids, so autoimmune is out.

299
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,302
Diagnosis depends on whether
the blood was coming from

300
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,252
the sinuses, lungs or her guts.

301
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,090
Mr. Chips looks
like he wants it.

302
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,921
100 bucks says he'll
make soup out of Franklin.

303
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:09,652
You're on.

304
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,889
How'd the mom seem to you?

305
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,025
If you're asking if she looks like
someone who beat her kid, you're a moron.

306
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,962
Move your ass, Mr. Chips!

307
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,981
You should have seen her
face when mom walked in.

308
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,355
Callie hates her. I
don't think she's lying.

309
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,428
Because people never
lie about people they hate.

310
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,359
Big sinus bleed could be
sinusitis and a bleeding disorder.

311
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,775
She didn't complain
about a headache.

312
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,496
If the bleeding is in her gut,
could be Zollinger-Ellison.

313
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:53,869
Acid reflux causes asthma, and the acid
erodes the stomach, causing the bleeding.

314
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,640
Yes!

315
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:01,037
Franklin rules.
Mr. Chips drools.

316
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:05,111
Mr. Chips' owner only feeds
him on apples and bananas.

317
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,846
Nowhere near enough
Vitamin A. Pay up.

318
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,551
Do an upper endoscopy
to confirm Zollinger-Ellison.

319
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,716
After mommy dearest
has given her permission.

320
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,124
Ellen shouldn't have consent
if she beat her daughter.

321
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,193
Doesn't matter if she
beat her daughter.

322
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,993
Only matters if Social Services
says she beat her daughter.

323
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,129
Good thing you
made it all official.

324
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,341
Will the endoscopy be painful?

325
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,138
Is that an issue?

326
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,512
It's a medical procedure,
there will be some discomfort.

327
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,743
I never meant to
hurt my daughter.

328
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,312
And yet, you hit her.

329
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,546
She told you that?

330
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,086
And now you're
gonna tell me you didn't.

331
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,021
I'm a drug addict.

332
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,323
And I've been a lousy mom.

333
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,600
Especially since
my husband died.

334
00:18:55,935 --> 00:19:01,374
He was closer to Callie than I
was, and I missed him so much.

335
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,575
And it was too hard,

336
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:08,341
and taking oxy just
made things easier.

337
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,546
Right up until it made
me lose my daughter.

338
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,355
I hurt Callie a lot.

339
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:22,960
But one of the only things that I can
feel okay about is that I never hit her.

340
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:37,734
Didn't peg you as the midday fun
kind of guy. So glad I was wrong.

341
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,379
Mmm...

342
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,816
Unfortunately, that's
not why we're here.

343
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,653
Remember that guy from
the restaurant yesterday?

344
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,090
Mmm-hmm.

345
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,294
He's got pictures of us. He's
threatening to show your husband.

346
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,230
I thought you said that guy
was one of your best doctors.

347
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,767
Yeah. Not one of my best people.

348
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,762
We've got to stop
seeing each other.

349
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,603
Not necessarily.

350
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,933
I told my husband about you.

351
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,004
What? Why?

352
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,374
He was saying
that things had been

353
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,109
better lately between him and I,

354
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,279
that I was happier.

355
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,846
I said that I was, and
that you were the reason.

356
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,484
And he was okay with that?

357
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,725
Not initially. It was a
pretty tough conversation.

358
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,460
Neither of us is ready to
give up on the marriage,

359
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,002
and I am not ready
to give up this.

360
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,066
You don't have to
feel so guilty anymore.

361
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,824
You didn't need
to shoot yourself.

362
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,092
I could have given
you a Section 8.

363
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,206
We've hit the
drills pretty hard,

364
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,825
and by the fourth round, my
hand went numb. The gun slipped.

365
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,697
And I only had
blanks in it but...

366
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:12,796
It's funny how nearly shooting your
toe off cured that speech impediment.

367
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:16,968
Ha! Yeah. Sorry about
that. Sheldon's a progressive.

368
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,238
Compared to who? Rupert Murdoch?

369
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:23,612
Progressives are reenactors
who strive for complete authenticity.

370
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:26,515
They never drop
character while in uniform.

371
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,611
Whereas you just
dabble in crazy?

372
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,457
Sheldon and I had a
big falling out years ago.

373
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,394
We only really started talking
again because of the reenactments.

374
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,262
They gave me my brother back.

375
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,596
That's a very moving story.

376
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,421
Be a lot more affecting
if you hadn't bonded

377
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,803
over something so
completely idiotic.

378
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,604
Your mom didn't
hit you, did she?

379
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,581
No.

380
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,984
Then why did you lie about it?

381
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:05,054
Because I wanted
to get out of here.

382
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,125
People understand getting hit
more than what my mom does.

383
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,595
Tell me, maybe I'll understand.

384
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,060
I was the mom.

385
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:23,173
She couldn't keep a job,
spent all her money on pills.

386
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,641
I had to get a job.

387
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:28,908
Double shifts just to keep the
power on, keep food in the house.

388
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,910
I couldn't tell you how
many times she nearly OD'd

389
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,146
and I had to clean her
up and put her in bed.

390
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:40,058
So I decided if I was
gonna be the grown-up,

391
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,627
I'd rather do it
on my own terms.

392
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,002
Your mom knows she messed up.

393
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,302
She's determined
not to do it again.

394
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,637
Yeah.

395
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,834
And she'll feel that way

396
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,039
right up until
things get too tough

397
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,342
and she has to
start using again.

398
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,590
Do you think people can change?

399
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,120
No.

400
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:20,189
But I don't think that's gonna change
your opinion because people don't change.

401
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,127
Stop.

402
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,406
Is that an ulcer? Yeah, it is.

403
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,117
But we haven't
reached the stomach yet,

404
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,541
I'm still high in the esophagus.

405
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,469
Means it's not
Zollinger-Ellison.

406
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:34,970
Ulcer's bleeding.

407
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,081
We need to lavage before
she drowns in her own blood.

408
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,267
We cauterized the ulcer,
stopped the bleeding.

409
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,102
Compromised immune
system from living on the street

410
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,560
could make her
susceptible to HPV.

411
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,153
HPV was covered on the
STD panel, she's negative.

412
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,323
What if she didn't get
this from being homeless?

413
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,609
What if she got it from her mom?

414
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,898
I'm assuming you're thinking
something genetic because...

415
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,267
I'm thinking addiction.

416
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,264
Alcohol-induced esophagitis.

417
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,706
Explains esophageal ulcers
and her other symptoms.

418
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,002
If only it would explain
why we've never

419
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,978
seen her drunk,
drinking or detoxing.

420
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,612
Her blood pressure's been
elevated. Could be the DTs.

421
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,082
It's been mildly elevated.

422
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,110
Mildly elevated BP could put
her at risk for a berry aneurysm.

423
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:19,090
Weak blood vessel in the brain
gets pounded on by elevated BP,

424
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,627
causes it to
expand and contract,

425
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,920
causes the symptoms
to come and go.

426
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,158
CT didn't show any
signs of an aneurysm.

427
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,699
Did I mention come and go?

428
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,632
As much as your
presence may cause

429
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,634
objects to become
engorged with blood,

430
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,673
sometimes aneurysms
just aren't in the mood.

431
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,298
Alcoholism and berry
aneurysm are both valid theories.

432
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,353
I think we should discuss this
with the patient and her mom.

433
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:39,936
Why? We've
discussed it right here.

434
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:43,278
Tell them she needs a cerebral
angiogram to locate the aneurysm,

435
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,147
surgery to repair.

436
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,187
Brain surgery? When?

437
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,225
We've booked the OR
for an hour from now.

438
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,352
And Dr. House is sure
that's what she has?

439
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:57,760
He's confident in the diagnosis.

440
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,696
It's consistent with
all of her symptoms.

441
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,160
But you don't buy it.

442
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:06,061
No.

443
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,668
I think your symptoms are
the result of alcohol abuse.

444
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,236
But I'm not an alcoholic.

445
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,314
You came to the hospital
with beer in your pocket,

446
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:16,825
we found more
alcohol at your house...

447
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,545
Yeah, I use booze as payment.

448
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,448
I have an occasional
beer with my friends.

449
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,545
That doesn't mean
I have a problem.

450
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,588
I want the surgery.

451
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,254
Actually, it's your
mom's decision.

452
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,764
I'm not an addict.

453
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,705
That's what I always said to
you, Callie, but I had a problem.

454
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:43,709
I'm nothing like you.

455
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,711
Tell them to do the surgery.

456
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,287
I need a few minutes to think.

457
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:04,862
The patient asked
me what I thought.

458
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,230
I pay you to think
inside this room.

459
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,097
Outside this room,
I pay you to parrot.

460
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,966
It's her choice. She
has the right to know.

461
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,062
It's a medical choice
that you turned into

462
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,231
an extension of your
baggage and hers.

463
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,140
You told the mom
something you want to believe

464
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,253
because you don't
want to believe that

465
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,439
this girl might be
doing fine parent-free.

466
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,290
Which also happens to be
what the mom wants to believe...

467
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,626
You think she wants to feel
responsible for her daughter's illness?

468
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,676
That woman sees everything
to do with her daughter

469
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,687
through guilt-colored glasses.

470
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,586
It's all her fault.

471
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,025
House,

472
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:44,370
don't bully her, she's
overwhelmed enough.

473
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,748
It's nothing compared
to how she's gonna feel

474
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,867
when her daughter dies from the
aneurysm she decided not to treat.

475
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,359
You must be Dr. House.

476
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,989
I save my appearances

477
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:18,527
for when parents are on the brink
of doing something incredibly stupid.

478
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,867
Your daughter has a berry
aneurysm, she needs surgery.

479
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,743
What she does not need is you
making this or any other decision.

480
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,180
I can't just leave
this up to her.

481
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,344
Then leave it up to me.

482
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,217
And just leave.

483
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,320
I'm not gonna
abandon my daughter.

484
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,351
She hates you.

485
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,567
It's actually not
such a big deal.

486
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,191
Plenty of kids
hate their parents.

487
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:53,762
What makes it a big deal
is that she should hate you.

488
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,502
Playing the biology card doesn't
change anything except where she lives.

489
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,680
Your daughter's
better off without you,

490
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,877
so let her be better
off without you.

491
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,220
I'm gonna do the surgery.

492
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,852
I'll take the fallout
from Social Services.

493
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,081
Dr. House.

494
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,691
My daughter's care is my choice.

495
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,186
And so is this.

496
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,156
Treat her for alcoholism.

497
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,763
Peek-a-boo!

498
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:03,366
Why would Anita tell her
husband about our affair?

499
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,273
Probably just got sick of lying.

500
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:09,372
Look at it this way, now the sex
is both commitment and guilt-free.

501
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,474
And men love
commitment-free sex.

502
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,212
Yes, they do. Oh, yes, they do.

503
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,283
They're gonna
find out eventually.

504
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,851
Peek-a-boo.

505
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,156
Peek-a-boo.

506
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,974
How do you keep doing
the same thing over and over

507
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,398
with the same
level of enthusiasm?

508
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,131
First off, be a decent,
empathetic person.

509
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,480
This is what you
said you wanted,

510
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,515
but you're actually more upset
now that the husband knows.

511
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,474
Because I'm hurting
him. You always were.

512
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,636
But he didn't know that. Which
means he wasn't really hurt.

513
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,004
Yeah, I know it's
a rationalization,

514
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,983
but it went a long way to making me
feel a little less guilty about seeing her.

515
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,543
Looks like you're gonna
need a bigger rationalization.

516
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,854
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.

517
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,488
Social Services report
came in on your mom.

518
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,656
Let me guess, she
passed with flying colors.

519
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,929
She always does.

520
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,564
I think she might
make it this time.

521
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:10,338
House left a bottle of
Vicodin to see if she'd steal it.

522
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,339
She gave it back.

523
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,375
You could at least let
her sleep in the room.

524
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,114
She could have listened
to me about my drinking.

525
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,452
Even if you are right about it,
why take your word over mine?

526
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,788
I'm her daughter.

527
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:31,625
Because she's your mom.

528
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,393
And for the first time
she's acting like it.

529
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,057
It's a little late for that.

530
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,042
Good night.

531
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,253
Morning.

532
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,160
I heard you went
head-to-head with the mom.

533
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,526
Not for your reasons.

534
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,711
You're protecting the girl.

535
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:09,098
I'm protecting my diagnosis.

536
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,602
And you tested her, to see if
you could get her back on drugs

537
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,780
and out of her daughter's life.

538
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:16,206
That was to show Adams that
mommy dearest hadn't changed.

539
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,676
I'm taking a principled
stand against idealism.

540
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:22,304
Your patient's stable?

541
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:26,045
Maybe Adams was right.
The illness is alcohol related.

542
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:29,019
I hope so considering that's
what we're treating her for.

543
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:32,956
You hope you're wrong
for the sake of the patient.

544
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:38,827
I hope that I'm right, but the
aneurysm bursts without killing her.

545
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,361
Call me a softie.

546
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:46,503
Or the mom agrees to an
autopsy so I can prove it.

547
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,972
Your patients love you
because you're empathetic.

548
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,984
I also have kind eyes.
Why are you here?

549
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,179
But you don't love
all of your patients.

550
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:05,681
Of course not.

551
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,885
I'll bet some of them bore you.

552
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:10,656
Dull people get cancer
too. Why are you here?

553
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:14,325
But you fake an interest in
them because you need to, right?

554
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,096
And if you do it long
enough, it becomes real?

555
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:21,298
Well, no, because
the interest isn't fake.

556
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,703
Really?

557
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,301
Because you realize
they're not dull,

558
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,971
it was just your
misinterpretation of them.

559
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,447
I just haven't found a way
to make them interesting yet.

560
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:36,554
It's all about common ground. You
find one thing you both like or hate.

561
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,557
John Woo movies,
romance novels, kale.

562
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,230
Sometimes the best way
to connect with someone

563
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,892
is stop thinking about
them and focus on yourself.

564
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,494
What is this about?

565
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,404
Not everything has an agenda.

566
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,737
See ya.

567
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,693
I told him because it
was the right thing to do.

568
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,173
Right.

569
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,343
This doesn't change
anything between us.

570
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,445
It sort of does for me.

571
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:13,768
You want to stop
seeing each other?

572
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:14,792
No.

573
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:22,964
But I was thinking, maybe you
could tell your husband that we did.

574
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,134
And then go back to sneaking
around behind his back?

575
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:28,463
Yes.

576
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:30,939
Why would you want to do that?

577
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,668
I don't know.

578
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:38,111
This just feels wrong.

579
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,684
I think I'm gonna go.

580
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,437
Oh, God!

581
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,343
We thought it
was the salt pork...

582
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,878
But all the menfolk
been eating it

583
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,380
and we're the
only ones that sick.

584
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,294
Which one of you is
the cheap bastard?

585
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,491
Your uniforms are not wool.
They're polyester, cheap polyester.

586
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,300
Which gets processed with a
heavy metal called antimony.

587
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,135
You wear badly
processed polyester

588
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,072
all day and night
for days and nights,

589
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:40,643
and you get antimony poisoning
which causes your diarrhea

590
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:43,079
and your numbness in your hands

591
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,647
and your collective vomiting.

592
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,816
Polyester uniforms?

593
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,412
I was being authentic.

594
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,048
With polyester uniforms?

595
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:54,716
Confederacy gave men $21

596
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,704
every six months for
uniforms... You poisoned us both.

597
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:57,855
At least I have principles.

598
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,276
Because they
don't cost anything.

599
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:02,529
Brother against brother.
Now that is authentic.

600
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,881
I know you don't want me here,

601
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,017
but they had banana
muffins downstairs.

602
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,950
Reminded me of
our St. Pete's trip.

603
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,026
Remember?

604
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,697
We used to walk and get some
every morning at that bakery.

605
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,567
I guess.

606
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,242
Were you high on that trip?

607
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,948
Not when we were together.

608
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,994
I used to wait until
you went to bed.

609
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,126
You can stay,

610
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,328
if you want.

611
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,636
Okay.

612
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,709
Mmm. It's not bad.

613
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,515
What's happening?

614
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:36,918
Is this from the
alcohol treatment?

615
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,957
I was wrong. The berry
aneurysm must have just burst.

616
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,028
Temporal lobes are
clear. Parietal clear.

617
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,366
Get me a micro-vascular clip
tray as well as the occlusion.

618
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,595
<i>Check the ventricles.</i>

619
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,702
Ventricles are clear, too.

620
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,606
<i>Aneurysm must've
leaked instead of burst.</i>

621
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,041
<i>Inject the dye.</i>

622
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:12,556
Posterior cerebral clear. Vertebral
clear. Circle of Willis also clear.

623
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,857
She doesn't have
a berry aneurysm.

624
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,975
Her BP is dropping.
Start her on pressors.

625
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,342
Get her BP up before her
organs start shutting down.

626
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,210
<i>Adams. With me.</i>

627
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,893
The pressors will only
give us a couple hours, max.

628
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,682
What causes breathing issues,
bleeding issues, paralysis,

629
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,188
loss of consciousness?

630
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,684
What are we missing?

631
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,068
That's everything bad that's
happened. What about the good stuff?

632
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,254
You mean, like, we
should be more optimistic?

633
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:45,468
She got a little better
when we put her on steroids,

634
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,725
which can attack tumor cells.

635
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:47,890
Maybe she has cancer.

636
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,231
No hypercalcaemia, no
elevated blood proteins.

637
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,148
She and her mom mentioned a trip
they took to Florida a couple of years ago.

638
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,107
What about dengue
fever? Cholera?

639
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,961
Great ideas. If dengue
fever or cholera laid

640
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,510
in wait for two years
before suddenly...

641
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,423
Did your biological daughter
go swimming in Florida?

642
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:18,825
In a lake, or a pond,
or an everglade?

643
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,929
Yeah, there's a canal
near my mother's house.

644
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,627
Do you know what's
wrong with her?

645
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,805
Family vacations kill.

646
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,471
Come with me. Don't
want to explain this twice.

647
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,007
You're letting in the flies.
And she needs an LVAD.

648
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,174
No, she doesn't.

649
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,781
Your daughter has ascariasis.

650
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:48,259
It's a disease caused by a
parasitic worm found in feces.

651
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,261
Animals used the
canal as a potty,

652
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,820
and the eggs from the feces
ended up in Callie's intestine

653
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,695
when she went swimming.

654
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,930
Where they hung out, quietly and
asymptomatically biding their time.

655
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,472
<i>Until somewhere along the
way, they got knocked loose,</i>

656
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,940
<i>maybe a dive in
volleyball practice,</i>

657
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,373
or maybe she slipped on
her way into a soup kitchen.

658
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,447
<i>But once they hatched, the
worms got to work on her lungs,</i>

659
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,312
<i>her ear, and the
nerves in her legs.</i>

660
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,715
<i>The worms got agitated
by the steroids we gave her,</i>

661
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,344
<i>which started them on their
journey to the esophagus.</i>

662
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,787
And, ultimately, to the heart.

663
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,386
A few pills of mebendazole,
and she'll be fine.

664
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,136
She's feeling much
better, walking on her own.

665
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,406
Getting along with her mother?

666
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,306
As long as I keep
bringing her muffins.

667
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,075
Did someone come
take her for a test?

668
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:19,878
Callie agrees with you.

669
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,216
That people don't change.

670
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,223
She said when her mom slips
again, she didn't want to be there.

671
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,555
She'd rather remember
her like she is now.

672
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,861
Smart girl.

673
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,131
You got the ending you wanted.

674
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,362
Because I was only looking to
solve the case, not their lives.

675
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,565
I don't care if the people who
work for me are screwed up,

676
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,738
in fact I even encourage it,

677
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:47,575
but absolution, do
that on your own time.

678
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,140
Or not at all.

679
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,651
'Cause clearly you suck at it.

680
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,187
This is Aaron Rodgers.

681
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,956
Wow, 127 quarterback rating.

682
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,521
Do you know what sound he makes?

683
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,430
Okay. Oy!

684
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:50,941
Um...

685
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:56,213
This is Terrell Owens.

686
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,476
People call him T.O.

687
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,829
Do you know what sound he makes?

688
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,791
This is Mark Sanchez.

689
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,888
Do you know what sound
people make about him?

690
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,129
Working late?

691
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:24,999
Husband have her tonight?

692
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,506
And every night.

693
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,076
She broke it off.

694
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,682
It's for the best.

695
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,186
I'm not really an
affair guy after all.

696
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,086
Sure you are, buddy.

697
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,322
You just lost interest once
it stopped being an affair.

698
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,224
That's why you're relieved.

699
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,819
But don't worry, it's
not gonna end here.

700
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,833
You'll just have to get your
adrenaline fix somewhere else.

701
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,664
When that doesn't do it anymore,

702
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:52,600
you'll just escalate
things somehow.

703
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,874
At least that's
what I've been told.

704
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,203
I'm not like you, House.

705
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,246
True. No limp.
