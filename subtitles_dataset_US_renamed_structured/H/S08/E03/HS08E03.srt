1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:04,629
If you don't know how to use a
computer, we will teach you here.

2
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:07,572
Most jobs require at least
basic word processing skills.

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,304
We try to get you up
to 50 words per minute.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,245
We also have a course in how
to talk to someone in an interview.

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,840
Stuff like what
employers are looking for,

6
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,476
how to turn negatives
into positives.

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,763
We can also provide clothes
for the interview if you need them.

8
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,586
People donate shoes
and suits all the time.

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,457
What if I had a
history with drugs?

10
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,959
That is nothing
to be ashamed of.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,908
Many of our clients have
struggled with addiction,

12
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:35,130
and if you want to get
clean, we'll help you do that.

13
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,693
And what if I have a kid?

14
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:38,931
No one to help you?

15
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:43,501
If I need someone to watch her
while I'm in a class or on an interview,

16
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,702
could you help with that?

17
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,212
We do not provide child care.

18
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,648
Actually, it's something
that comes up often.

19
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,808
I would love to
be able to do it.

20
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,854
I just don't have the resources.

21
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:56,480
But it's definitely
on the wish list.

22
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:02,125
Okay. Okay, uh,
thank you. I'll be back.

23
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,640
I have to take this.

24
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,895
Yes, please come back.
We'll get you started.

25
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,169
It was nice to meet
you, Benjamin.

26
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,829
Hey, Oscar.

27
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,231
Ugh! That is too bad.

28
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,310
Did they tell you why?

29
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,744
Yeah.

30
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,143
Mmm-hmm.

31
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,782
Well, look, you know what?
Sometimes you just don't get the job.

32
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,417
Oscar, I've got
to call you back.

33
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,288
Uh...

34
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,093
Uh, uh...

35
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,035
Benjamin! Benjamin, wait.

36
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,939
Oh, my God.

37
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,423
Somebody call an ambulance!

38
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,548
Why am I watching
you cut your hair?

39
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,991
If I do it at home, I'm the
one who has to clean it up.

40
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:18,192
I was referring less to where
it's happening and more to why.

41
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,199
New life, new look.

42
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,895
Does that mean you
like your new life?

43
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,997
If you're asking
if your job is safe,

44
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,067
that depends on what you have
to say about the file you're holding.

45
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,544
It doesn't seem
like much of a case.

46
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,512
Although, I'm sure I'm wrong.

47
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,573
You are. Tell me why.

48
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,152
Guy collapsed after
being on his feet for hours

49
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,712
on a hot day without
breakfast, so that's really weird.

50
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:47,420
ER found nothing wrong, then I
decided I should test his wallet.

51
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,553
He's rich? That's why
we're taking the case?

52
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:50,961
No, we're taking
the case because

53
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,057
no one knows
what's wrong with him.

54
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,725
And he's rich.

55
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,406
Dr. Adams.

56
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,541
Give her the file.

57
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,167
This is my only copy.

58
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,241
My MO depends
upon the use of a team.

59
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,545
Definitionally, that involves
more than one person,

60
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,915
so I really have no choice.

61
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,112
Give her the file. You
can't afford a team.

62
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,013
Adams is free.

63
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,923
And I'm referring both to her
availability and her price tag.

64
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,555
New girl meet newer
girl, and vice versa.

65
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,189
You said we were
meeting for coffee.

66
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,667
Well, when someone
asks if you want coffee,

67
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,931
they obviously don't
just mean coffee.

68
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,899
Wait. Did you think I
was referring to sex?

69
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,705
Would you shut the
blinds on your way out?

70
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,803
I thought you were
referring to talking.

71
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,744
Talking about medicine.

72
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,579
Specifically, as it refers to the
guy whose name is on the file

73
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,642
she still hasn't handed you.

74
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,621
I'm not working, House. I'm in the
process of looking for a paying job.

75
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,215
And in the meantime, there's
no way a do-gooder like you

76
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,056
isn't volunteering
all over town,

77
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,323
ladling kittens, spaying soup.

78
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,660
There's a free
clinic in Trenton.

79
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,367
Well, think of this
as today's free clinic.

80
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,300
Only with fewer
bums with herpes.

81
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,838
I don't think we actually
have much of a case.

82
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,272
I think it's just dehydration.

83
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,587
What happened the
last time another doctor

84
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,102
told you I was
wrong about a case?

85
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,614
I lost my job.

86
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,680
But you saved a life.

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,654
Is an ultrasound really necessary?
I'm feeling much better now.

88
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,715
A sudden collapse at
your age can indicate

89
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,454
a deterioration in
the heart muscle,

90
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,690
a pretty serious condition.

91
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,322
It could also just
be dehydration.

92
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,664
Next time, you could probably
drop the undercover act.

93
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:40,130
I walk in in a suit, and they're
gonna put their best foot forward.

94
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,176
Also I don't own a suit.

95
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,535
You give away millions,
and you don't own a suit?

96
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,136
I gave those away too.

97
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,873
One day I was writing a
check to my landscaper,

98
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,509
and it suddenly hit me,

99
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:55,750
$6,000 to take out plants
and put in different plants

100
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,984
so I can look at them.

101
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,254
Shouldn't I use that money
to do something important?

102
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,660
And by money, you
mean all your money.

103
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,028
I started with $10 million,

104
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:09,593
and then I couldn't think of
a reason not to give 20 or 40.

105
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,674
I figure I can live
on $25,000 a year.

106
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:18,705
One room apartment, bus pass,
thrift stores, bare necessities.

107
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,270
I still have my
software company.

108
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,545
And when I make more,
I'll give that away too.

109
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,450
He's nuts. He's generous.

110
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,446
There's a neurological issue.
He's getting rid of everything.

111
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,185
His echocardiogram was
negative for cardiomyopathy.

112
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,558
Head CT showed no signs
of stroke or hemorrhage.

113
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,028
He has one pair of pants!

114
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,860
Most people with
his kind of money

115
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,901
are commissioning oil
paintings of their Yorkshire terrier.

116
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,233
Benjamin is sacrificing his
own comfort to help others.

117
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,536
That's 'cause helping others
is his Yorkie oil painting.

118
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,906
That's good, not sick.

119
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,706
That's naive and sick.

120
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,056
You really want to improve
things, you do it through policy.

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,743
This guy empties his
pockets, what really changes?

122
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,877
That's right. All those babies
with AIDS, they're just using us.

123
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,815
My parents had $800 between
them when they got here.

124
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,620
They scraped and borrowed
so we could go to good schools.

125
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,093
And I worked my ass off.
No one gave me a handout.

126
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,255
It makes me work harder.

127
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,089
Rebuttal.

128
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,294
What's your evil plan?

129
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,927
I object to your cynicism.

130
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,995
It's been earned.
That's what I object to.

131
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,540
New Dean of Medicine has
an ethical obligation to come in

132
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,940
with a completely open
mind about all employees,

133
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,139
thus letting me blithely run
roughshod for at least four weeks.

134
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,711
My theory is that you're
running a battery of tests

135
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,546
to convince him that
you've saved his life,

136
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,696
and then con him into funding
you to hire back your team.

137
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,211
What? Your old team?

138
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,025
What? This is your new reality.

139
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,320
You've got your office,
you've got neighbors,

140
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,055
you've got one
employee, one volunteer

141
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,030
until she finds actual paid
work or gets sick of you.

142
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,999
I talked to Chase and Taub.
They're willing to come back.

143
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,403
What about Thirteen?

144
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:55,032
Not a good choice. She's not a
long-term, because she has no long-term.

145
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,036
Not taking your calls?

146
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,839
She will.

147
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,404
Discharge the patient.

148
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,916
Unexplained loss of consciousness
could be cardiomyopathy,

149
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,078
global anoxia,
subarachnoid hemorrhage...

150
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,884
Dehydration. He was given
fluids, and he got better.

151
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,400
And I'm sure your tests
have come up negative,

152
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,325
or you'd have
shut me up already.

153
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,554
Which means he goes home.

154
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,222
There is a symptom.

155
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,358
Extreme altruism.

156
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,604
You've got two choices, House.

157
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,801
You can recognize
that your patient is just

158
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,038
a very nice, healthy
guy and send him home.

159
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,707
Or you can consider
altruism a symptom,

160
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,341
in which case, you
cannot take his money.

161
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,551
Send him home.

162
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,594
And check with admitting for
the net worth of all new patients.

163
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,068
I'm not coming back, House.

164
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,410
Technically, you're
back right now.

165
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,910
I need you to stop calling me.

166
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,886
The first 17 messages
were cute, but...

167
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,218
I'm putting the
band back together.

168
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,417
Interesting that you've
never showed up at my place,

169
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,118
what with your
love of annoying me

170
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,061
and your inability to
take no for an answer.

171
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,529
I'm guessing ankle monitor.

172
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:32,261
Guilty as charged. Literally.

173
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,466
I'm not a doctor
any more, House.

174
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,569
The job went away
but not the profession.

175
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,715
You look healthy,
so that's not it.

176
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,382
You met a boy or a girl,

177
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,322
fallen in love, wanna be happy.

178
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,418
You've decided to enjoy
what time you have left.

179
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,897
You're going to Thailand.

180
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,260
Girl. And Mýkonos.

181
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,829
Turns out I like boring.

182
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,000
No, you want to like boring.

183
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,386
But if you actually
liked boring,

184
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,988
you would have figured that out
in fifth grade when you were bored.

185
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,243
Please, stop calling me.

186
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,083
No.

187
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,487
You showed up to tell me that
you don't want to hear from me.

188
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,924
That's a mixed signal.

189
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,259
And I'm gonna choose to listen to
your actions rather than your words,

190
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,628
'cause they're more honest.

191
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,139
I'm a little confused.

192
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,471
The test is designed to
determine if your nerves are...

193
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,512
No, I meant you're running
a test and discharging me?

194
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,979
Was I dehydrated or not?

195
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,983
I think so. But out of an
abundance of caution,

196
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,645
my colleague has taken it
upon herself to do one more test.

197
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,313
All right.

198
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,852
You scare me a little.

199
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,361
Why?

200
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:07,559
I've been considering applying
to Doctors Without Borders,

201
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,067
going overseas awhile,

202
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,799
and that seems like a
huge sacrifice, but you...

203
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,307
You don't scare her.
You make her feel guilty.

204
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,037
You like your
life the way it is.

205
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,047
Most people give the
minimum they have to give,

206
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,639
so they can enjoy
what they have left.

207
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,653
I guess my minimum
is just higher than most.

208
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,485
Complete recruitment
and interference pattern.

209
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,253
His leg muscles are fine.

210
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,554
I feel, uh, funny.

211
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,391
Where? My chest.

212
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,364
You're tachycardic. Your
heart's beating too fast.

213
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,058
Unbelievable.

214
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,770
Patient got tachycardic to 185.

215
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,575
We pushed 18
milligrams adenosine.

216
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,809
There's definitely
something wrong with him.

217
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,012
Which is awesome. Now,
there's something to cure,

218
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,452
which means there's
something to be

219
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,389
disproportionately
financially grateful for.

220
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,755
Morning. Got you coffee.

221
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,021
Thanks.

222
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,188
Arrhythmia could easily
have caused the collapse

223
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,394
that landed Father Teresa
here in the first place.

224
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,662
Oh, it's fine. Keep it.

225
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,261
We looked at his
heart yesterday.

226
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,068
Didn't see any
structural abnormalities.

227
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,869
I'm thinking occult
long QT syndrome?

228
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,941
What about Whipple's?

229
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,588
If it was Whipple's, there'd be some
kind of neurological involvement.

230
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,047
You don't think defying
human nature is neurological?

231
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,015
Racing heart, medical condition.

232
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,915
Bleeding heart,
stupid condition.

233
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,662
Are you saying that
because you believe it,

234
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,281
or because it's in your
financial best interests

235
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,984
to think his generosity
isn't just temporary?

236
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,586
I'm told that some
people are just nice.

237
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,187
I'm trying to
embrace that wisdom.

238
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,257
Benjamin's been taking allergy
medication the last few weeks.

239
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,700
Long QT syndrome can
be medication-induced.

240
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,265
Flush him with saline. Get
rid of the antihistamines.

241
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,273
Then do an EKG.

242
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,366
No, wait. I'll do the flushing.

243
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,407
And take the damn two dollars.

244
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,913
She hasn't even
sipped the coffee.

245
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,051
I just got so angry, you know?

246
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,681
So I made a terrible mistake,

247
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,591
and now, I'm trying
to start my life over.

248
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,753
To help people the
way I always wanted.

249
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,600
But my department got
defunded, and it's my fault.

250
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,366
I just can't stand to think of all
those patients going untreated

251
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,773
because I don't have the
resources to do my best work.

252
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,706
How about I help you out?

253
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,715
How do you mean?

254
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,578
I'll give a million dollars as
an endowment to the hospital

255
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,881
earmarked for Diagnostics.

256
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,882
Wow.

257
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:50,627
I'm an opportunistic ex-con who
just gave you a two-minute sob story

258
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,858
as step three in my master plan,

259
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,266
and you've offered
me a million dollars.

260
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,803
Which was step 17.

261
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:00,965
Is that bad?

262
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,768
Ethics are not my strong suit.

263
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,909
Hypothetical.

264
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:14,545
If I'm offered oral sex from a
sexaholic, do I have to decline?

265
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:18,449
Don't answer yet. Saying
"no" will cause both of us pain.

266
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,288
Saying "yes" will cause
both of us pleasure.

267
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,791
You can't take sex
from a sexaholic,

268
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,921
you can't give
booze to an alcoholic,

269
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,488
and you can't take
this guy's money.

270
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,467
I could be wrong about the
symptom. I'm wrong all the time.

271
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:33,438
Taking money from a sick
person is ethically suspect at best.

272
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,738
What is this? Canada? All we
do is take money from sick people.

273
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,868
We work for it.

274
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:38,944
I'm working.

275
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,705
How much?

276
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:42,774
$20.

277
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,217
Well, what if it was?
It's the same principle.

278
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,421
$20, a million,
what's the difference?

279
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,185
Actually, the difference is
pretty much a million dollars.

280
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,317
He came up with
the figure, not me.

281
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:00,363
Crap. Got a patient with
end-stage renal disease.

282
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,230
Her heart can't
support dialysis.

283
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,327
She needs a transplant but...

284
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,373
You tuned out as soon as it
stopped being about you, didn't you?

285
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,998
What? I got to go.

286
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,101
It's all moot. The patient
probably has long QT.

287
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:15,114
He's probably just a
really, really decent person.

288
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,410
They exist, right?

289
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,145
You can't take the money, House.

290
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,483
Is long QT bad?

291
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,517
It's a tough thing to control.

292
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,288
Is there someone
you want me to call?

293
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,163
There's someone
I would like to call.

294
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,796
She's the same person
who won't take my calls.

295
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,402
My wife.

296
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,336
When I started giving
away the money,

297
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,638
I hoped she'd want
to do it with me.

298
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,578
She didn't.

299
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,073
I miss them.

300
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,916
I have two little boys.

301
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,590
Having a family doesn't exempt
me from social responsibility.

302
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,752
But family comes first.

303
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:02,955
But should it?

304
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,389
I know that sounds weird.

305
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,933
But if someone
is related to you,

306
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,060
does that empirically
make them more special,

307
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,762
more deserving than anyone else?

308
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,502
Yes, it gives you
a responsibility.

309
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:18,409
My boys have a roof over
their heads. They're not starving.

310
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,912
I pay court-ordered
child support.

311
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,748
And frankly, it's
more than they need.

312
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,423
I love them more than anything.

313
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,585
I can't justify buying video
games and private schools

314
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,858
when other people's
children are starving.

315
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,563
I hope one day
they'll understand that.

316
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,203
Your hands are trembling.

317
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,671
Is it the electrodes?

318
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,139
Are you in pain?

319
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,767
No. What's happening?

320
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,903
I'm not sure, but it's not
what we thought it was.

321
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:01,918
So arrhythmia,
fainting, muscle tremors.

322
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,616
Plus unfortunately,
mental changes.

323
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,926
I still don't think
it's neurological.

324
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,124
God bless you.

325
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,066
He lost his wife and kids, 'cause
he couldn't stop giving money away.

326
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:20,266
He lost his wife, because she
couldn't accept not being filthy rich.

327
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,103
She's not drinking
the coffee either.

328
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:26,543
Drink it, don't drink it. The point
is I gave it to you, so we're even.

329
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:32,579
Even? It was a gift, an insignificant
token. There was nothing owed.

330
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,245
That was the whole point.

331
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,815
Why?

332
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,150
"Why?"

333
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,554
Yeah. Why?

334
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,755
She's the crazy one.

335
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:45,130
So a guy gives everything
away to strangers, sane.

336
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,656
Girl who doesn't want
anything from strangers, crazy?

337
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,100
You're not a stranger.

338
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,161
And your perverse
view of the world is

339
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,173
making you force a
neurological component

340
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,764
onto an obviously
cardiological...

341
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,833
Your parents didn't
love you enough,

342
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,845
so you need to
prove your superiority.

343
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,280
Or they loved you too much, so
you need to prove your humility.

344
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:07,613
Or it's just rich guilt. I'm
betting on the last one.

345
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,889
There's a whole list of drugs that
could have caused his symptoms.

346
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,688
I doubt the guy would
spend money on drugs

347
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,786
when there are orphans
out there without cable.

348
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,388
Anyway, he'd be getting
better right now, not worse.

349
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,024
Could be polyarteritis nodosa.

350
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,228
That comes with a rash.

351
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,464
Echovirus.

352
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,019
Virus, virus, virus...

353
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,569
Fits his physical symptoms.

354
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,977
And could, but doesn't necessarily,
cause personality changes.

355
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,475
Works for everyone?

356
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,049
Start him on antivirals.

357
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,412
And, Adams, when you treat,

358
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,356
and he gets better and doesn't
give Bob Cratchit Christmas Day off,

359
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,485
you owe me a coffee.

360
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,795
Click the third
tab from the left

361
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,027
and find a box that
says "previous entry."

362
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,729
<i>You get a drop-down
menu that's sorted</i>

363
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,930
<i>by patient name and department.</i>

364
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,836
Thank you. I
appreciate your help.

365
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,584
You're gonna read too
much into this, aren't you?

366
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,008
No. Not at all.

367
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,354
We're going to
fundamentally disagree

368
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:08,109
about what it means to read
too much into this, aren't we?

369
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,842
Yes, absolutely.

370
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,013
Look, I thought about what you
said, and I realized you were right.

371
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,180
Great. See you tomorrow morning.

372
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,587
No, you won't.

373
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:21,223
Afternoon? I can't think
of another interpretation.

374
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,730
Shut up. Look, I'm not sure
what you were trying to achieve.

375
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,425
I'm never quite
sure, but you were

376
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,297
actually a friend to
me when I needed it.

377
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,303
<i>I don't want to come
back to work for you.</i>

378
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,798
But I was wrong to try
to push you out of my life.

379
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,641
Everything has gone blue.

380
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,372
<i>That's not supposed
to happen, right?</i>

381
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,576
Stay there. I'm coming.

382
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,744
No, you don't have to do that.

383
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,414
Although if you did come, maybe
you could swing by the Hunan Palace

384
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,856
and get some Lo Mein
and a Szechuan Beef.

385
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,860
That is six miles out of my way.

386
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,954
Okay, then, I guess I'll just get
something from the hospital cafeteria,

387
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:01,398
which is where I get all of my
meals since I can't go anywhere.

388
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,299
Fine. I'll get the food.

389
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,394
<i>You're a peach.</i>

390
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,373
I started the last
round of pleconaril.

391
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,877
Can you do me a favor?

392
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,582
A favor?

393
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,051
You want me to return these?

394
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:26,615
Give them to someone? Wear
them while you masturbate?

395
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,186
I want you to have them.

396
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,295
That's not a favor.

397
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:36,426
It was a two-for-one sale. I couldn't
resist. I need to justify buying them.

398
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,095
They're $120.

399
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:42,141
My car's in the shop. I'm
short on cash this month.

400
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,971
I can't pay you back.

401
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,638
The first pair were
$120. These were free.

402
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,275
You do know I punched the
last person that pissed me off?

403
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,145
Was it Santa?

404
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,235
What's your patient's status?

405
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,639
Better. We're discharging him.

406
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,834
Good.

407
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,574
Hey, hey. Why do you care?

408
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,411
Specifically. Although, I'm
curious about a general answer too.

409
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,684
Your guy just signed up to donate a
kidney to my patient with renal failure.

410
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,924
Did he meet your
patient with renal failure?

411
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:38,328
No. He heard the nurses talking
about her, that she was short on time.

412
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,361
I was wrong.

413
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,597
Don't say that. House,
she really needs this kidney.

414
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,800
He's not better. His
mental status is declining.

415
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:52,709
Or he's doing an amazing
thing for another human being.

416
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,807
I thought it was an
ethical no-brainer

417
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,678
that we can't take
stuff from sick people.

418
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,480
I changed my mind.

419
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,892
He's still sick.

420
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,293
His symptoms have gone away.

421
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:14,458
Not all of them. Offering an
organ to a stranger is a symptom.

422
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,628
A couple dozen people a year
make undirected kidney donations.

423
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,400
How many of them are also in the
process of pauperizing themselves?

424
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,907
If the guy threw himself on
a grenade, he'd be a hero.

425
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,908
If it saves a life, who cares?

426
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,038
You do. Yesterday when you
made the exact opposite argument.

427
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,080
If there's even a
chance I'm right,

428
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,862
it'd be dangerous to give
his kidney to someone else.

429
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:38,290
More dangerous than complete
renal failure? My patient needs this now.

430
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,990
Why do you want to
give away your kidney?

431
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,580
There are 70,000
people in this country

432
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,172
on the active waiting
list for a kidney,

433
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,436
and less than 10,000 dead
people a year to give them one.

434
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,730
Yeah, if only we could kill
60,000 more people a year,

435
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,100
all would be golden.

436
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,262
I'll give you your money.

437
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,296
See? Crazy.

438
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,068
Being a live donor has risks.

439
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,737
I looked it up. The risk is one in
4,000. I could die during surgery.

440
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,747
Which means if I don't donate,

441
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,374
I'm valuing my life at
4,000 times someone else's.

442
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,343
It's not like I want
to be cut open

443
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,411
and have a part of me taken out,

444
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,754
but I've got two, and this woman
has none. She'll die without it.

445
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,386
Perfectly logical.

446
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,588
People with mental
deficiency can be logical.

447
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,824
Just like sane
people can be illogical.

448
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,412
This kidney thing is the only
evidence you have that he's sick.

449
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,572
I'm going to let him be a donor.

450
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,910
Dr. House, it's not a symptom.

451
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,892
Come back after you're
convinced that I'm healthy,

452
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,748
and I will give you your money.

453
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,280
No, you won't.

454
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,927
We have time for one more
test before we move him.

455
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,121
What test?

456
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,630
Whatever test will prove
that it wasn't echovirus...

457
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,462
Virus, virus... And he's
not cured, obviously.

458
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,628
I've been saying all along
this could be Whipple's.

459
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:01,799
Causes arrhythmia,
tremor and mental changes.

460
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:04,503
Bad idea. There's no joint pain.

461
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,610
Where's Adams?

462
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:06,838
We thought the case was over.

463
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,007
She has a job interview.

464
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,420
Why is she here?

465
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,886
Because I called her.

466
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,014
Bigger question
is why that worked.

467
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,703
I'm here because I have time,
and you have a crisis and...

468
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,423
We're too busy
for rationalizations.

469
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,089
Patient made a big
downgrade in his personal life.

470
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,871
He's probably not
eating all that healthy.

471
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,663
Magnesium deficiency?

472
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,663
Wait until they take him
back to his room, draw blood,

473
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,935
and do an expanded
electrolyte profile.

474
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,567
No, he hasn't had anxiety
or any trouble sleeping.

475
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,888
I think it's Whipple's disease.

476
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,074
Bad idea. He doesn't
have joint pain.

477
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,207
Joint pain is common
but not definitive.

478
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:46,115
Whipple's explains
all of his symptoms

479
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,949
including the
personality change.

480
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,612
And it would
respond to antibiotics,

481
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,208
which is why he
started to feel better,

482
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,776
which doesn't mean
he's not still sick.

483
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,924
You were right. Counts for
nothing if you can't defend it.

484
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,225
Book a procedure room,
do an upper endoscopy,

485
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,859
and run a PCR
test for Whipple's.

486
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,036
Guilt.

487
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,105
You feel guilty about leaving.

488
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,576
Yes, I think that little of
you and that much of me.

489
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,805
You're nothing without me.

490
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,279
Not leaving me,
leaving humanity.

491
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:20,251
I'm going with my
girlfriend, the woman I love.

492
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,085
To have fun.

493
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,000
You're trying to
make me feel guilty,

494
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,652
because you're
saving lives here.

495
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,320
I think that's great. I'm
proud to have been a part of it.

496
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:33,627
But now, I just
want to be happy.

497
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,166
Well, no one's
unhappy in Greece.

498
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,474
It just appeared in
the last few weeks.

499
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,601
He's having trouble
holding a pencil in school.

500
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,344
Does it itch?

501
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,714
Get anything different lately,

502
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:53,309
new baseball glove, new kitten?

503
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,539
The neighbors put in a pool,

504
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,589
so he's been spending
a lot of time over there.

505
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,783
But if it were
something in the water

506
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,952
it would be
everywhere, wouldn't it?

507
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:06,863
It is in the water.

508
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,126
He's allergic to chlorine?

509
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,791
No.

510
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,868
He's allergic to Summer Lilac.

511
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,033
That's my lotion,
and it's not in the pool.

512
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,612
No, it's on the
palms of his hands.

513
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,540
In the pool, is the
neighbor's daughter

514
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,049
or the neighbor's hot wife.

515
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,959
Here's some lube.

516
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,890
Sorry. Too late
for your eyesight.

517
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,476
Endoscopy didn't reveal any
lesions in the small intestine.

518
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,034
I'm running the PCR test now.

519
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:59,376
I found it in my office.
Appears to be a gift.

520
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,716
That can't be good.

521
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,879
Damn it.

522
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,388
You got her the job interview.

523
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,393
And that was supposed to be
the end of it. I don't take charity.

524
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,258
Good for you, you loon.

525
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,558
I don't like owing
people things.

526
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,929
So either you're so insecure

527
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,400
that you feel like you need to
always have the upper hand,

528
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,996
or you're so arrogant that the
notion of a favor is insulting to you.

529
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:24,266
Or it's your family, some
kind of immigrant pride thing.

530
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,442
I'm betting on the last one.

531
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:31,574
I just don't like it. It
makes me feel icky.

532
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,879
That's the reason? Ickiness?

533
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,649
You never even
tried to analyze this?

534
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:39,123
That's even crazier
than the gift thing.

535
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,888
House. There's no
sign of tropheryma DNA.

536
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,288
It's not Whipple's.

537
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,129
We did what we could.

538
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,774
You sure you want to do this?

539
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,713
Relax. This is gonna
make me very happy.

540
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:22,696
Dr. Simpson, heart rate's
140, and pressure's dropping.

541
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,112
Get him adenosine, stat.

542
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:26,731
Patient's unstable.
Surgery's off.

543
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,472
Arrhythmia's back. He's on
heparin and stable for now,

544
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,673
but this could put him at
risk for stroke or embolism.

545
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,340
Maybe he got bit by a spider.

546
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,885
The symptoms can take
up to three days to manifest.

547
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,317
He'd have localized pain.

548
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,410
LCDD.

549
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,727
Almost always hits the kidneys.

550
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,925
Ah, Dr. Foreman,
perhaps you can help us.

551
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,957
I can't decide
whether to take out an

552
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,395
I-told-you-so ad in the
<i>New England Journal,</i>

553
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,865
or stay classy and just
spray-paint it on your car.

554
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,163
You're off the case.

555
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,829
That seems like an overreaction.

556
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,704
You dosed him. You couldn't
stand losing him as a patient,

557
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,385
so you faked a symptom
to prove yourself right.

558
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,502
That's idiotic.

559
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,074
Sorry. HOUSE: Don't apologize.

560
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,877
I don't know if
you're power-crazed

561
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,714
or paranoid, but I
know she's right.

562
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,614
Two lives are in
the balance here.

563
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:19,089
House, I worked for you for seven
years. I know how you operate.

564
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:22,218
So when I see symptoms magically
show up right when you need them...

565
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,974
And I was your
boss for seven years,

566
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:27,124
and I know what a suspicious,
micromanaging hard-ass you are.

567
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:32,137
Why would I do this now, knowing
you can send me right back to jail?

568
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,261
What did you give him?

569
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,567
Nothing.

570
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,802
You can't prove otherwise.

571
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,072
So why don't you do
the smart thing here?

572
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:44,412
You're off the case. You no
longer have access to this patient.

573
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:48,547
You can't let him do this.

574
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,085
He's the boss.

575
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:53,987
And he's right.

576
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,799
I assume you dosed the patient

577
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,569
because you're really certain
he has a neurological condition.

578
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,135
I assume you're interpreting my
actions in the best possible light

579
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:15,486
because you didn't get the job.

580
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,115
What's with you and Park?

581
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,312
Nothing.

582
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,085
I expect my people
to lie better than that.

583
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,324
Either you're getting her gifts

584
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,191
because you want
her to like you,

585
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,854
in which case, I don't like you.

586
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,865
Or you're getting her
gifts to screw with her,

587
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:39,131
in which case, I will be teaching
you my secret homie handshake.

588
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,341
I just... I thought
it was interesting

589
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,809
she couldn't accept that coffee,

590
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,972
and I wanted to see
how deep it went.

591
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,071
But now?

592
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,242
Oh, now, I just wanna win.

593
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,586
What was in the box?

594
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,317
Gift certificate. The spa.

595
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,694
That's not going to do it. You're
up against a lifetime of training.

596
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,074
If you wanna win,
you've got to do

597
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:07,828
something she can't
possibly reciprocate.

598
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,769
You've got to push her
neuroses to the point

599
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:14,238
where even she
thinks that she's crazy.

600
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:29,211
One more favor, and I promise
I'll leave you alone forever.

601
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,778
Or I'm lying.

602
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:33,758
Either way, it's more interesting
than whatever you're doing now.

603
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,629
Can I help you?

604
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,965
I'm his wife.

605
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,768
We're separated.

606
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:52,868
I heard he was sick. I
just wanted to see him.

607
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,742
He's giving a kidney to
someone he's never met?

608
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,647
He wants to, yeah.

609
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,718
I know he's talked about you.

610
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,554
He's been alone all this time.

611
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,617
I'm sure it would mean
a lot to him to see you.

612
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,357
I wanted to spend
my life with him,

613
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:20,796
but I need to feel like he loves
me more than other people.

614
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,704
Like he loves our kids more.

615
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,602
Maybe that's selfish.

616
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,376
I should go.

617
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,563
Was that my wife?

618
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,065
I don't know.

619
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,963
Are you the guy,
the kidney donor?

620
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:58,700
There was a problem,
but I'm gonna try again.

621
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,512
Um...

622
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,605
To give it to the same lady?

623
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:04,877
She needs it.

624
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,849
Okay. Never mind.

625
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,012
Wait.

626
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,713
What do you want?

627
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,887
Uh, it's nothing. It's just...

628
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:24,329
I have polycystic kidney
disease, and I need a transplant,

629
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,893
and they say I don't
have much time.

630
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,633
So when I heard that
you were willing, I just...

631
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,233
But I'm glad it's
going to someone.

632
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:35,705
I'll give it to you.

633
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:42,149
But you already promised
it to someone else.

634
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,246
I have another one.

635
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,815
Saving one life is good,
saving two is better.

636
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,355
You give away two
kidneys, and you die.

637
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:53,091
I could live on
dialysis for years.

638
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,064
Yes, and then you die.

639
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:59,501
And then I could donate
my other organs, heart, lungs.

640
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,908
I could save four
or five more lives.

641
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,854
Foreman's going to
need a diagnostician.

642
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,592
This guy is crazy.

643
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,468
Arrhythmia, muscle tremors,
and yes, mental changes.

644
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:38,454
If his heart doesn't rupture, he's
liable to rip it out and give it away.

645
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,608
You know, the
down vibe in here is

646
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,444
totally ruining my
<i>Charlie's Angels</i> fantasy.

647
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,616
And that haircut
isn't helping, either.

648
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,712
Seems like Graves disease
or some other thyroid issue.

649
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,452
Is she on the team
now, like, forever?

650
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:59,328
His thyroid levels were within
normal range when he was admitted.

651
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,623
Could be Coxsackie B virus.

652
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,963
No pericarditis.

653
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:05,401
What about porphyria? It's
a little weird without the rash,

654
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,983
but it fits all of his
other symptoms.

655
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,433
And if it's acute
intermittent porphyria,

656
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,507
that would explain why his
symptoms keep recurring.

657
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,943
Unlikely, but it's
possible. What else?

658
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,647
I said, "What else?"

659
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:24,582
Oh, for crying out loud.

660
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,331
There, that's better.
Now, what else?

661
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,909
Well, if there's nothing
better than possible,

662
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,077
then possible gets
upgraded to probable.

663
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:55,884
I'll start him on hematin.

664
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,252
No, I'll go.

665
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,030
So what's the answer?

666
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:10,694
Are you now on the
team, like, forever?

667
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,532
I don't know.

668
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,266
Because I was thinking
of ordering t-shirts.

669
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,833
I don't know, House. I mean,
what am I supposed to do?

670
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:23,543
I trained to be a doctor. I know
how to take someone's pain away,

671
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,810
how to make a stopped
heart beat again.

672
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:30,550
We've brought people's
kids back, their husbands.

673
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,651
So guilt?

674
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:37,958
Yes, you were right.
You're always right. I just...

675
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,959
I have the skills
to help people.

676
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:47,131
Is it okay for me to walk away from
that because I wanna just have fun?

677
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,133
Obviously not.

678
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,016
How's your patient?

679
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,749
She died a few hours ago.

680
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,731
Thirteen's back.

681
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,929
No department, no money,

682
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,702
and somehow, you manage
to con her into hanging around.

683
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,368
I have a gift.

684
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,442
What?

685
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,778
It was a con.

686
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,779
The patient was faking?

687
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,784
No, I was.

688
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:46,396
I brought him in here under false
pretenses just to get his money.

689
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:49,428
I ordered a bunch of random
tests to keep him here.

690
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:54,029
One of them was a head
CT which uses iodine contrast.

691
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,471
You think he's
allergic to iodine?

692
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,265
No. Again.

693
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,276
Just don't interrupt me.

694
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:02,609
Thirteen was right.
This is a thyroid issue.

695
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,709
He has Plummer's disease.

696
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:16,057
He has a nodule in his thyroid.
It produces excess hormone.

697
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,859
<i>Not enough to test abnormal, just
more than his brain was used to.</i>

698
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,264
<i>Just enough to make
him irrationally generous,</i>

699
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,427
<i>make him vulnerable
to overheating.</i>

700
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,402
<i>Then you pumped
his body full of iodine</i>

701
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,064
<i>and kicked him
into thyrotoxicosis.</i>

702
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,301
<i>I said don't interrupt.</i>

703
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:34,368
<i>But yes, you're right. We take
out the nodule. He'll be fine.</i>

704
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:50,960
Two days, one surgery.

705
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,129
I now accept that
you are all better.

706
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,191
Where's my money?

707
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,566
You made me sick.

708
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:03,631
You were already sick. I just
made you much, much worse.

709
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,903
Seriously, the money.

710
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,507
You're not giving
it to me, are you?

711
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:18,016
When you're facing death,
some things come into focus...

712
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,514
My wife...

713
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,584
You love your family.
You want them back.

714
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:27,027
Your altruism was
always a symptom.

715
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,927
No, it wasn't.
I'm still gonna...

716
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,596
Give less? How much less?

717
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,910
Just enough to spoil your kids?

718
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,133
No.

719
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,334
But they need it more
than people with TB

720
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,468
or children in
Indonesia with no eyes?

721
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,813
Diagnosticians
with hearts of gold?

722
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,782
I don't want to give you
money because you're an ass.

723
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,484
I was an ass last week.

724
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:55,987
I love my family. I
want to be with them.

725
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,521
That doesn't make
me a bad person.

726
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,824
No.

727
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,366
It makes you a healthy person.

728
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,107
My mechanic called. Said
the work's been paid for.

729
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,151
You mentioned your
car was in the shop.

730
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,687
That's $4,500.

731
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:27,720
Smile and say thank
you, or I get you GPS.

732
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,289
You win.

733
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,194
Thank you.

734
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:52,143
Your car's getting fixed.
You were right. She went for it.

735
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,246
Good work.

736
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:59,749
Need a lift tomorrow?
Your car's still in the shop.

737
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,826
I don't take charity.

738
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,327
I'm just glad it's over.

739
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,991
Nothing is ever over.

740
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,687
Thirteen.

741
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,948
Need a minute.

742
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,792
You're fired.

743
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,000
Now what? House, I'm starving...

744
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,401
I'm not joking.

745
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:48,998
You're fired. Don't
come in tomorrow.

746
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,097
House...

747
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,037
I can work with people
who've got nowhere else to go,

748
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,671
people who've got
something to prove,

749
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:57,579
people who just get
off on weird cases.

750
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,879
Who I can't work with
is someone who's here

751
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,750
so she doesn't have to feel bad.

752
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,317
You're trying to save me.

753
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:11,885
Yes, I think that little of
you and that much of me.

754
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:25,270
Okay.

755
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,980
Bye, House.
