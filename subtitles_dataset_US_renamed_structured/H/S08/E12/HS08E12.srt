1
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,073
You're bleeding
through your bandage.

2
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:18,377
Good morning.

3
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,187
Don't we need to
get you to a doctor?

4
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,919
I am a doctor. That
didn't come up last night?

5
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,085
We didn't do a lot of talking.

6
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,711
I'm good.

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,253
You never told me what
caused your accident.

8
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,122
I was stabbed by a patient.

9
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,098
That'll teach me to overbill.

10
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,634
If she likes crippled guys, I'm
free for the next six minutes.

11
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:43,864
What do you want?

12
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,537
Forty-five year-old
truck driver.

13
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,905
Recurrent seizures, no
metabolic or structural...

14
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,307
Does this look like a good time?

15
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,505
Sort of. At least as
good as the other

16
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,058
12 times that I've
called and paged you

17
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,175
in the last three weeks.

18
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,594
Those times, I
just didn't feel like

19
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,177
talking to you. Kinda like now.

20
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,513
I'd apologize again,
but I'm still waiting

21
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,716
for you to accept the first one.

22
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,760
You do work for me. I am entitled
to ask when you're coming back.

23
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,227
I don't know when
I'm coming back.

24
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,729
I don't know if I'm coming back.

25
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,230
Got a problem
with that? Fire me.

26
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,444
It's good to see
you in the hospital.

27
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,146
As a patient, if
not as a doctor.

28
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,717
Believe me, I'd rather be
the guy with the clipboard.

29
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,055
How you doing?

30
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,566
Arrhythmias are gone, fine
motor control's improving.

31
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,899
Not what I meant.

32
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,706
If you need to talk to
someone, a professional...

33
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,903
I'm fine.

34
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,493
Fine enough to get back to work?

35
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,228
You don't have
to work for House,

36
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,118
but you do owe
me 20 clinic hours.

37
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,122
What? Getting knifed
doesn't buy me an extension?

38
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,956
Buys you whatever you
need. But I know you.

39
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,859
If all you do is
physical therapy,

40
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,828
and your nighttime
version of it,

41
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,994
you'll lose your mind faster than
you regain those fine motor skills.

42
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:12,753
I have this terrible pain in my left
shoulder. It came out of nowhere.

43
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,947
And nothing seems to help.

44
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,496
Any other symptoms? Chest
pain? Light-headedness?

45
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,463
No, none at all.

46
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,172
What were you doing
when the pain came on?

47
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,163
Just sitting and praying.

48
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,880
She'd been helping to
make the altar breads

49
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,770
that morning, but no
hard physical work,

50
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,535
or repetitive motion.

51
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,370
Couple of possibilities.

52
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,944
You have enlarged
lymph nodes, so

53
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,811
I'd like to start by
ruling out breast cancer.

54
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,612
And I do mean rule
out. It's probably nothing.

55
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,246
I'm gonna do a
quick breast exam.

56
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,254
Do you mind stepping
out for a moment?

57
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,381
Not at all.

58
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,243
That was so I could ask
about the second possibility.

59
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:03,064
Left-sided pain means it could be
angina, which is made worse by stress.

60
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,036
Might not be a
coincidence that the pain

61
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,506
started on the verge
of a major life change.

62
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,408
How did you know?

63
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,076
Blue veil means
you're a postulant,

64
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,809
haven't taken your vows yet.

65
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,540
Brown vestments
means you're Carmelites,

66
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,312
cloistered nuns, which
explains the chaperone.

67
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,323
You're about to withdraw
from the world for good.

68
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,721
I was a seminarian.

69
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,590
Who obviously
didn't take his vows.

70
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,520
Cassock made my ass look fat.

71
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,164
Do you mind unbuttoning your
shirt and lying down for me?

72
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,567
Okay.

73
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,404
I have had second
thoughts. I'm kind of a wreck.

74
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,405
A life of perpetual enclosure
and almost complete silence?

75
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,126
If you weren't
wrestling with this,

76
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,018
I'd say there's something
really wrong with you.

77
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,893
I'm going to admit you.

78
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,440
There's a little mass here,
and I'd like to get it checked out.

79
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,633
It's just a benign fat
deposit, her imaging's clean.

80
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:11,967
Stress test, too. It's not angina.
So why the shoulder pain?

81
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:16,237
Is it possible that
she hurt her shoulder?

82
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,743
Thanks a lot.

83
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,878
I didn't tell him.

84
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,937
You were cagey about
where you were going,

85
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,073
and Chase has been
cagey in general.

86
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,311
Good chance I'd find the
two of you in the same cage,

87
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,210
so I had Park follow you.

88
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,554
How are you feeling?

89
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,988
Better.

90
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,583
Heard your arm's healing nicely.

91
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,891
Good to see you on your feet.

92
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,292
Patient's a nun?

93
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,763
Were you turning back to your
long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?

94
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,168
She was next up in the clinic.
And I don't want your help.

95
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,400
You got stabbed, you blame me.

96
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,372
But what did you learn about me

97
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,968
that you hadn't known for years?

98
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,170
Maybe I was an idiot
before, and I'm not one now.

99
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,011
Or maybe the reverse is true.

100
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,076
Thanks for all your help.

101
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,089
Your soul sister is
having a fungal infection

102
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,256
from the unprocessed
wheat in the altar breads.

103
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,768
Explains the shoulder pain
and the jumbo lymph nodes.

104
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,805
Thanks for all my help.

105
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,383
I'm sorry I led House to you.

106
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,313
It's part of the job.

107
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,753
Maybe we could get a
meal after work tonight

108
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,290
if you want some companionship.

109
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,387
You asking me out on a date?

110
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:46,190
No. I just... I guess
that sounded...

111
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:52,802
Must be scary to be back.
All those knives and needles,

112
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,967
infected blood and tissue
everywhere you look.

113
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,313
Just thought you might need
someone to talk to about it.

114
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,575
Just knowing you're there
for me is enough. Thanks.

115
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,525
Ever surf Kirra Point?

116
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,660
Obviously you're Australian.

117
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:22,092
I've surfed all over the Gold
Coast. Don't tell me you have.

118
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:26,162
The closest I got was
Waimea Bay. I grew up on Maui.

119
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,675
If you don't mind me asking,
why are you becoming a nun?

120
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,344
You're asking because I surf?

121
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,478
Well, I know that Jesus
walked on water, but...

122
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,614
Plus the average postulant's
a lot younger than you.

123
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,691
What were you doing before this?

124
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,284
Not much of anything.
Worked as a nanny,

125
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,829
moved around a lot,
bunch of failed relationships.

126
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:54,825
And then what? God spoke
to you? You heard the calling?

127
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,168
Something like that.

128
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,238
Does there have to be some
dramatic moment where the skies part?

129
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,503
Usually, yeah.

130
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,605
Is that what happened to you
when you entered the seminary?

131
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,684
Mom drank, Dad worked,
they stuck me in Catholic school.

132
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,953
Priests and nuns were
the closest I had to family.

133
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,470
Turned out that wasn't much of
a reason to join the priesthood.

134
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,156
Is that why you left?

135
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,598
Something like that.

136
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,033
I think I may throw up.

137
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,184
What's wrong with me?

138
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,584
Not a fungal infection.

139
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,301
You're probably wondering,
why the soda balloons.

140
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,769
I'm not.

141
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,535
Well, I'll tell you.
You're not the only one

142
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,303
whose life spiraled
out of control

143
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,843
when you got
knifed in the ventricle.

144
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,139
Taub has decided...

145
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,473
I need help with my patient.

146
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,277
She's vomiting. That's
not from a fungal infection.

147
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,560
So what are you
planning to do now

148
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,761
that you're not working for me?

149
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,310
I have no idea.

150
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,885
Almost dying's been
clarifying. I can do anything.

151
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,927
You can do anything,
so you come back to

152
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,258
the same building you
worked in for years?

153
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,996
Guess you can cross
that off your bucket list.

154
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,863
Can we get to my
patient sometime soon?

155
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,802
As soon as you admit that
you're a confused mess, sure.

156
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,430
You'll help me.
Because even though

157
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,850
you don't find my
case interesting,

158
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,900
you find my interest
in it interesting.

159
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:49,345
When you put it that way...
Ascending cholangitis.

160
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,013
Missed me!

161
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,421
It can't be, bilirubin's normal.

162
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,717
Clinical signs can show
up days before lab signs.

163
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,067
This is great, we should
make this a regular thing.

164
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,499
She can't feel her foot at all.

165
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,603
What does this mean?

166
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,413
Means I've gotta spend more
time consulting with a colleague.

167
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,455
His 17-ketosteroid levels
are low. How can he be...

168
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,258
He tried to tongue-kiss
Park when you were closer.

169
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,326
Think his sexuality's normal?

170
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,029
I need more help. My patient
has a new symptom, ischemic foot.

171
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,901
Get the lecture out of your system,
so we can talk about my case.

172
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,068
Let me start with an allegory...

173
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,083
Okay, I'm curious...

174
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,624
Your overreaction
to your stabbing is

175
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,249
to blame me even
as you're drawn to me.

176
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,889
Taub's is to take moronic
self-defense classes

177
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,900
that won't defend
him against anything.

178
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,630
Krav Maga. Which
helped me block your shot,

179
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,376
and will continue to
help me defend myself

180
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,184
in a building full of
drugged-up strangers.

181
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,675
Taub has to accept that
by instinct and genetics,

182
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,574
he is a coward,
who's better off running

183
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,544
and hiding at the
first sign of danger.

184
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,310
I've already fended off six
of your blitzkriegs in a row.

185
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,547
And the seventh? And
the eighth? And the nth?

186
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,485
If you get him, what's
that gonna prove?

187
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,319
That unexpected things happen.

188
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,521
By definition, no class can
teach you to expect them.

189
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,153
Which is why Taub
is idiotic to study them,

190
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,721
and you're idiotic to attach
any significance to them.

191
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,366
Blood clot.

192
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,799
Her D-dimer's normal.

193
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,298
On the other hand...

194
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,405
What if he's right about the
blockage, but wrong about the cause?

195
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,043
Vasospasm.

196
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,284
Explain everything
but the lymph nodes...

197
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,572
Any minor infection
could have caused those.

198
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,180
Calcium channel
blocker to treat.

199
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,326
Are you okay?

200
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,066
I almost got you killed by
bringing a scalpel into that room.

201
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,869
I could feel better about
that. You saved my life, too.

202
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,340
I think the ledger's clear.

203
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,114
But how can you
not be traumatized?

204
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,217
Can't change what happened.

205
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,249
I can only make better
choices from here.

206
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,846
So you're Zen about it, but won't
let go of your anger toward House.

207
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,527
I'm seeing a trauma counselor.
I think you should, too.

208
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,933
I'm okay. Just knowing
you're there for me is enough.

209
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,042
The convent lets you have this?

210
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,445
I borrowed it from
one of the nurses.

211
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,311
I'm still on temporary vows.

212
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,784
It may be the last time I
hear Eminem for a while.

213
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:18,218
You're using an iPod, but I've
never seen you use rosary beads.

214
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,629
What day did Jesus die?

215
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:30,067
I know, one gospel says Passover,
another says the day before.

216
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,664
How many times did the cock
crow before Peter's third denial?

217
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,469
Once or twice?

218
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,304
You can't argue away my faith.

219
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,404
Why? Because it's so strong
even plain contradictions...

220
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,143
Because it's not that strong.

221
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,779
I'm not saying I
don't have faith.

222
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,821
I just haven't felt
the calling yet.

223
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,155
No one joins the clergy
without having an epiphany.

224
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,695
Like God's love is
speaking to you directly.

225
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:02,091
It's the silence, the
contemplation, the order.

226
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,496
I need them.

227
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,673
I'm hoping everything
else will come later.

228
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:15,047
That's not an answer. If you
want silence, you can get earplugs.

229
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,710
I tried the outside
world. It wasn't enough.

230
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,318
Have you been married? No.

231
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,288
No kids? You never
found a career?

232
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,882
Doesn't sound like the
outside world got much of a try.

233
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,796
What you're headed
towards now...

234
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,693
Fourteen hours a
day in silent prayer,

235
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,025
never having a family,

236
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,295
never touching
another human being...

237
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,863
Just because that's what
you'd miss the most...

238
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,137
The nurses talk.

239
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,347
Nothing's wrong with having fun.

240
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,077
They said you were almost
killed three weeks ago.

241
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,985
You go right back to fun?

242
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,582
Is that why you want to be a
nun? Someone broke your heart?

243
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,223
No.

244
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,727
I'm just looking for
something more.

245
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,566
So am I.

246
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,584
I'm late for work in the clinic.

247
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,730
Really? George Washingbaum?

248
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,132
He was a character
in the <i>Flintsteins.</i>

249
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,002
Just hiding out till House
leaves the cafeteria.

250
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,683
Those self-defense classes,

251
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,465
you think they're making
any kind of difference?

252
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,324
Not as much as
House's surprise attacks.

253
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,426
He thinks three steps
ahead, so I do, too.

254
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,093
Which is why you should accept his
apology and come back on the team.

255
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,997
He's annoying, he's maddening,
but he makes us all better.

256
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,870
Note to self.

257
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,806
Foot color's good,
arterial pulse is good,

258
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,447
capillary refill's good.

259
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,109
And her shoulder
pain's all gone.

260
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,114
Looks like you're
ready to go home.

261
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,952
I'll get the car and
meet you out front.

262
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:46,357
I'd say I'm in the book, but not the
one you'll be reading from now on.

263
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:58,301
Six years ago, I was
a nanny in Honolulu.

264
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,109
For this beautiful
two-year-old boy.

265
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:07,519
I loved him, probably spent more
time with him than his own parents.

266
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:13,292
One day, I was in the park,
talking with another nanny.

267
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,420
He wandered out of the
sandbox, into the street,

268
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,799
into the path of a moving car.

269
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,796
That could've
happened to anyone.

270
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,531
I don't think so.

271
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,436
And even if it did,
they'd blame themselves

272
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,342
for the rest of
their lives, too.

273
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,005
You shouldn't.

274
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,380
And you shouldn't run from
what can still be a good life.

275
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,912
I'm running to God.

276
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,916
After what happened to you,
don't you want to remake your life?

277
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,258
Not by hiding myself away.

278
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,027
I hope it works out for you.

279
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,564
It is gonna be hard,

280
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,703
not touching anyone.

281
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:53,817
Who knew Mother Inferior
was a smokin' hottie?

282
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,895
No wonder you're
playing handsies with her.

283
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,997
You think I'm hitting on a nun?

284
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,430
Angry at God, or I
just need a challenge?

285
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,897
Or you're terrified of intimacy,

286
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,799
which is why
you're a serial slut,

287
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:08,568
but right now you're grasping
at an emotional life raft.

288
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,133
Ideally, someone for whom
intimacy's not an option.

289
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,889
That actually makes
sense, which I can't say

290
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,438
about anything else
you've been doing.

291
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,483
I'm not emotionally
involved with her.

292
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,916
And much as I'd love to
hear you contradict me,

293
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,715
I have a 7:30
appointment to explore

294
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,779
my intimacy issues at La Scala.

295
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,418
I'm talking to this agent,
he's a bit of a sleaze,

296
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,622
but he's really excited
about representing me.

297
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,927
Although he can't take on
any new clients right now,

298
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,763
he's trying to get me an audition
for one of those online soaps.

299
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,201
Have you ever
watched one of those?

300
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,033
Am I boring you?

301
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,372
Unfortunately, yeah. Sorry.

302
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,027
Hi.

303
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,432
You're not supposed
to be here. Or anywhere.

304
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,875
You were right, I
was running away.

305
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,186
Oh, now you're shy.

306
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,351
It's brighter in the morning.

307
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:19,269
So, are we gonna spend the
rest of eternity in a lake of fire

308
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,069
while pointy-tailed demons
poke at us with sticks?

309
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,109
This is a little scary for me.

310
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:34,485
I had a whole life planned, not
that I wasn't struggling with it...

311
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,716
And then I met you.

312
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,256
Don't worry, I know you're
not the relationship type.

313
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,764
I'm not not the relationship
type. I was married once.

314
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,796
Relax. You're fine.

315
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,168
So what's next for you?

316
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,666
I have to find a place to live,

317
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,179
get my old job back...

318
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:04,007
I'm sure I'll feel
guilty, start doubting...

319
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,896
Well, as long as
you keep dealing with

320
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,647
your doubts in the
same way, then...

321
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,123
Moira?

322
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,492
I'm sorry, did you
say something?

323
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,498
Your neck... What?

324
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,561
Are your ears ringing?

325
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,929
Yeah.

326
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,363
What does that mean?

327
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,870
Let me get you back to
the hospital right away.

328
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,220
The artery that's bringing blood

329
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,712
to your brain,
it's coming apart.

330
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,048
It means you could stroke. I've
paged a team of our best doctors.

331
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,118
I don't have to cough as much.

332
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,784
It's clotted up.

333
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,720
Is that bad? We're almost there.

334
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,054
Get me her O2 level.

335
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,622
What are you doing?

336
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,608
I want to make sure I can
position her wrist properly.

337
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,191
For what? ABG.

338
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,133
I don't need an ABG,
just get a pulse ox.

339
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,968
I'll do it, grab a
consent form. Go.

340
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,143
We need to operate
right now, okay?

341
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,744
Good. To operate.

342
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,509
Can you repeat this? "No
ifs, ands or buts about it."

343
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,484
No about it, and no ifs...

344
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,218
Get her into OR 11.

345
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,628
Carotid dissection,
four-inch pulsatile mass

346
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,496
in her neck, and
some Broca's aphasia.

347
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,477
There's gotta be a clot
keeping her from bleeding out.

348
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,501
Pulse?

349
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,367
Bounding, four-plus.
It was a three-plus

350
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,997
twenty minutes ago.

351
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,773
Twenty?

352
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,036
I thought she just got here.

353
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,914
That blood looks pretty
dry. Cut yourself shaving?

354
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,250
You know, that can
happen when the nun

355
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,287
you woke up with
coughs blood on you.

356
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,856
You slept with a nun?

357
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,892
Forget nun, you
slept with a patient?

358
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,587
Former. To both.

359
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,892
Internal neck trauma?
That's impressive.

360
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,862
It's happened to me
a few times. Up high.

361
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,427
Dr. Chase.

362
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:09,273
The clot's broken. Bring
her in and pack her nose.

363
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,855
We're gonna need
number three Vicryls.

364
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,744
We're gonna fix this.

365
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,122
You're not going
to operate on her?

366
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,774
Kapur and Carlyle
are unavailable,

367
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,941
Reilly's done far fewer
dissections than I have.

368
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,128
He's also slept with her far
fewer times than you have.

369
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,313
Your judgment's compromised.

370
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,282
I spent the night with her, doesn't
change how I make an incision.

371
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,688
Tell him.

372
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,259
Do the surgery.

373
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,973
You're trying to
score points with him

374
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,329
at the risk of a patient's life.

375
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:35,765
He's the better surgeon.

376
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,304
Vascular clamp. You're not
going to put her on bypass?

377
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:42,687
It'd take a half hour to set up.

378
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,085
You clamp now,
she could stroke out.

379
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,442
She's already got
neurological symptoms.

380
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,623
We wait 30 minutes, she'll
definitely have brain damage.

381
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,014
You're trying to make sure
she's either perfect or dead.

382
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,846
She's not going to
die. If I get this done

383
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,749
in five minutes,
she won't stroke out.

384
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,083
You don't know that you will.

385
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,989
And you can't know because
you can't think clearly about her.

386
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,252
Vascular clamp.

387
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:13,464
Occlusion time,
9:46, 23 seconds.

388
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,303
Vascular scissors.

389
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,200
We're over five minutes.

390
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,972
Ultrasound.

391
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,554
Good flow. Lighten
the anesthesia.

392
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,634
You're not going to
close the wound first?

393
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:07,658
No.

394
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,070
Can you hear me?

395
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:31,906
Repeat this. "No
ifs, ands or buts."

396
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,119
"No ifs, ands or buts."

397
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,425
I'm sorry about before.

398
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,430
You're scared, aren't you?

399
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,094
That's why you
wanted companionship.

400
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,399
It's why you cried out
when House shot at Taub.

401
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,539
What exactly are you scared of?

402
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,177
A needle stick? Some
other nut pulling a scalpel?

403
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,844
I'm scared of everything.

404
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:06,579
It sucks that there was a
stabbing, but you'll get over it.

405
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,111
Like you have?

406
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,955
You weren't even
there. I know. I...

407
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,891
I left the room,
it was pure luck...

408
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,895
I was in the room.
That was pure luck, too.

409
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:25,098
I get that you're scared and
guilty. You're still a doctor.

410
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,435
I don't have time to
teach you to act like one.

411
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,139
We removed the
artery, found nodules.

412
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:36,979
Could mean lupus.

413
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,110
Negative ANA.
Where are you going?

414
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,756
Great thing about assigning
Taub fraudulent lab work

415
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,724
is you know exactly
where he's gonna end up.

416
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:50,388
Great thing about assigning
Taub obviously fraudulent lab work

417
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,897
is you get to watch his
inner paranoiac at work.

418
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,402
And then,

419
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,573
two to the head.

420
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,078
Can we talk about my patient?

421
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,680
Quite a journey.

422
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,681
Starts with a surgical
tool in your heart,

423
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,684
and ends with a
surgeon's tool in a nun.

424
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,843
What's the plan?
The plan's to cure her.

425
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,954
If it's not meaningless sex, kinda
screams out for an end-game.

426
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:23,792
You're the dog that's chasing the
Popemobile. You sure you want...

427
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:26,723
Oh, my God.

428
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,033
Taub is interrogating
the janitor.

429
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,435
He must think that I
hired him to attack.

430
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,805
Actually, why didn't I do that?

431
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:42,444
Plaques could be
confused for nodules.

432
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,346
Which would mean... Syphilis?

433
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,015
Explains the shoulder
and foot involvement.

434
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,655
Hope you practiced
immaculate contraception.

435
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,829
Lock and load.

436
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,299
Boo-yah!

437
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,002
Boo-yah to you, too.

438
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,736
But I hadn't had sex in years.

439
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,209
Tertiary syphilis
means you've had

440
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:14,711
the disease for
at least that long.

441
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,178
Does that mean you also have it?

442
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,582
Probably not
contagious at this point.

443
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,517
Can it cause hallucinations?

444
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,725
It's unlikely. Why?

445
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:35,197
While I was on the operating
table, it didn't feel like a dream,

446
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:39,728
I saw the boy who
I was caring for,

447
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:41,832
the one who died.

448
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,937
He walked right up to me.

449
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,043
What did he say?

450
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,209
He just held my hand.

451
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,846
It was like he forgave me.

452
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,256
Do you think that's crazy?

453
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:04,794
I think it should give you
solace, help you to move on.

454
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,699
You slept with your patient?

455
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,736
You're off the case.

456
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,440
I saved her from brain damage.

457
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,292
You think my judgment's
the least bit compromised?

458
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:27,047
She's still sick. If
she dies, we'll be

459
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,985
in the middle of a
brand new investigation.

460
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,716
This is about you
covering your own ass?

461
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,355
I gave you time, leeway,

462
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,737
and you decided to do
whatever the hell you wanted.

463
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,457
House can dance
all over the rules,

464
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,395
gets me knifed,
and he gets a pass.

465
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,223
I break a rule,
no one gets hurt,

466
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,925
but you kick me off my own case?

467
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,601
Unfortunately, yes.

468
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,610
I'm sorry. I took
that scalpel for you.

469
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,340
That's why I did this.

470
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,141
Three weeks ago, you never
would have slept with a patient.

471
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,810
And you never would
have operated on her after.

472
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:04,918
You need help.

473
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,483
I need to get away from House and
everything that reminds me of him.

474
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,030
By breaking the rules, not
caring what anyone else thinks?

475
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,661
You're gonna get away
from him by turning into him?

476
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,333
It hurts.

477
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,488
Right upper quadrant,
pain and distension.

478
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,926
What's wrong with my stomach?

479
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,550
Nothing. This is your liver.

480
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,698
The liver failure could be
from intraoperative hypotension.

481
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,296
Checked the anesthesia sheet,
pressure was fine throughout.

482
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,373
Thrombus?

483
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:59,171
That voice in the hall that
none of us have any reason

484
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:02,112
to be listening to is,
not surprisingly, wrong.

485
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,707
Abdominal ultrasound
was negative.

486
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,512
Then we have to
assume liver failure's

487
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,679
just another symptom
of whatever she's got.

488
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:12,214
Trousseau's syndrome could
send clots, cause the ischemic foot,

489
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,691
add the enlarged lymph
node, macrocytosis...

490
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,694
Disseminated T-cell lymphoma.

491
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:18,791
Wilson said it wasn't cancer.

492
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,890
Wilson says it's
not breast cancer.

493
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,525
Sarcoidosis.

494
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:24,702
Normal ACE level.

495
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,203
Highly insensitive for sarcoid.

496
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,772
Negative chest X-rays aren't.

497
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,034
Then we've gotta biopsy.

498
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,599
Yeah, Foreman's clearly wrong.

499
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,872
You're clearly not
grasping at straws,

500
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,039
because you're clearly
not emotionally involved.

501
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,513
I know you want to
believe this is something

502
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,247
we can cure.
It's not. I'm sorry.

503
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,859
How soon will they
know if it's cancer?

504
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,597
Within hours.

505
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,036
And if it is?

506
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,139
There's always chemo.

507
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,469
You say that like
it's not gonna work.

508
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,245
It could extend your life.

509
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,348
Years?

510
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,585
I'll be here as
much as you need.

511
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,823
You still never told me
why you left the seminary.

512
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,727
Mary Knoller.

513
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,432
Wife of the groundskeeper.

514
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,934
He caught me with
her, got me with a rake.

515
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,469
Those scars on my ass
you may have noticed...

516
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,580
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

517
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,312
Because it was so shallow.

518
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,947
I wasn't exactly wrestling
with great theological questions.

519
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,255
I don't believe that.

520
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,759
You don't sleep with
the groundskeeper's wife,

521
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:59,162
not unless you're struggling
with whether you belong there.

522
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:07,496
I always wanted to believe.
Would've made my life a lot easier.

523
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,033
It never took.

524
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,501
Doesn't

525
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,303
mean

526
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,480
it's too late.

527
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,416
Are you having trouble
talking, like before?

528
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,986
I can get the words out...

529
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,291
Just feels heavy when I do.

530
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,753
Where?

531
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:32,594
Wherever my chewing muscles are.

532
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,331
I'll be right back.

533
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,067
House finally got you?

534
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:43,607
He tried, but... I gotta go.

535
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,109
You should have
seen it, it was perfect.

536
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,839
She has jaw claudication.

537
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,284
If you only heard claudication
and carotid dissection...

538
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,946
I'd say giant cell arteritis,

539
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,285
and I'd tell your former
teammates to put her on steroids.

540
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,187
She's gonna live.

541
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,355
Yeah.

542
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,259
And then what?

543
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,553
They say my liver
function's better,

544
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,322
that I can get out of here soon.

545
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,305
And when you do, I want to
take you to Puerto Escondido.

546
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,405
Mexico?

547
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,608
The Mexican Pipeline.

548
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,952
Early May is when the
surf really picks up, but...

549
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,251
What's wrong?

550
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,628
I spoke to the prioress...

551
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,655
You're going back?

552
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,863
I felt the calling.

553
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,993
When you saw the boy?

554
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:48,671
I felt God's love, his grace. I've
been waiting my entire life for that.

555
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,002
It's not real.

556
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:53,237
I know you didn't feel anything
when you almost died. I did.

557
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:57,806
You felt oxygen deprivation, you
felt your brain releasing noradrenaline.

558
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,782
You didn't say that before.

559
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:03,278
I wanted you to
move on with your life.

560
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,256
I wanted to reassure you.
I wanted you to feel better.

561
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,453
And now you don't?

562
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,352
Now...

563
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:13,924
I think I love you.

564
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,881
"Noradrenaline and Near-Death
Experiences." Oh, dear.

565
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,075
You saw God?

566
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:36,321
She did. She wants to
go back to the monastery.

567
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,879
And now you're preparing
a PowerPoint presentation

568
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,119
to keep her in your
garden of earthly delights.

569
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,025
You're an idiot.

570
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,494
Because I've found
someone I love?

571
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,463
Because you're an idiot.

572
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,695
At least you two
have that in common.

573
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,795
Her feelings are based on a chemical
process. They're gonna wear off.

574
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,074
You just slept with her, your
brain is exploding with oxytocin.

575
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,854
You think that's gonna
last through the ages?

576
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,074
She's throwing away her
life because of blind faith.

577
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,307
So are you.

578
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:07,075
She's found something she
wants to build her life around.

579
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,679
It's a total illusion, but
apparently she'll take

580
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,031
a little ignorance
with her bliss.

581
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,580
And you want to take that away.

582
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,125
How many times have you
thrown the truth in people's faces?

583
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,922
Because it's the
truth. Not because

584
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,791
we're gonna live
happily ever after.

585
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,864
Either your relationship
just blows up

586
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,300
like every other
non-magical romance,

587
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,201
or she stays with
you but blames you for

588
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,298
stripping all the
meaning out of her life.

589
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,634
This has nothing
to do with the truth.

590
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:35,213
You don't like that
I'm reassessing my life,

591
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,815
that I want to
change it, that I can.

592
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,977
Anyone can screw up a life. I
never said that wasn't possible.

593
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,077
You're incapable of
human connection,

594
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:45,247
so you want everyone
to be like you.

595
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,551
If I wanted you to be like me,

596
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:57,232
I would be urging you to make
a stupid, stubborn decision

597
00:38:57,302 --> 00:39:00,170
that blows up your life and
leaves you lonely and miserable.

598
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,081
You reassess your life
when you've made mistakes.

599
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,515
You didn't. You
just got stabbed.

600
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,542
Don't look at the book.

601
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,047
I haven't done a jugular
line since my residency,

602
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,380
I don't want to
needle the carotid.

603
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,080
What's the first step?

604
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,124
Palpate the SCM. Where?

605
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:31,056
Middle third of the neck.

606
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,622
I'm happy I knew you.

607
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,996
So am I.

608
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,010
Robert.

609
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,213
Twenty-four-year-old
water treatment worker

610
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:26,211
with pyrexia and double vision.

611
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:28,545
A mystery.

612
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,411
How'd he get sick
working in a sewer?

613
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,509
Ed Norton was the
picture of health.

614
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:49,425
Abscess?

615
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,927
Would have seen it on the MRI.

616
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,198
Diphtheria paralyzing
the ocular muscles?

617
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:57,032
No, paralysis was
first. Aneurysm?
