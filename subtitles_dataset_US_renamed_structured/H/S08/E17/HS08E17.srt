1
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,605
Keep breathing. Nice and slow.

2
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:16,610
Now, the first couple shots will show you
if the sights are off or the barrel's bent.

3
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,447
Let me make this
real easy for you.

4
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,045
The sights are off,
and the barrel's bent.

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,487
Mmm... You're off to
the left about an inch.

6
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:31,293
That's it. Shoot
around the star, not at it.

7
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,129
Yes! Yes! You did it!

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,365
I didn't.

9
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,532
You just won your
girlfriend a teddy bear.

10
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,806
Cool. Which one do
you think she'd like best?

11
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:52,817
And then Thursday night, this
physicist is giving a lecture in Brooklyn.

12
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,050
It's about time travel and
the grandfather paradox.

13
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,421
I don't know if you're
busy... Okay, Henry. Henry.

14
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,625
Um...

15
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,290
Can we talk for a second? Yeah.

16
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,231
I'm really happy that we've
been hanging out so much.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,232
Yeah, I like you, too.

18
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,835
Can you put down the bear?

19
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,309
Henry.

20
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,672
What?

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,874
I can't.

22
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,320
I know.

23
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,219
You have a girlfriend.

24
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:34,191
It's just she never seems to
want to do anything with you.

25
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,564
Are you crying?

26
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:41,267
No, I have allergies. I
must just be, like, tearing up.

27
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,667
Henry, I think that's blood.

28
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,172
What? I...

29
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:29,240
Thirty-five year old male cries
blood, and he's not Vampire Bill. Go.

30
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,110
Should we ask? Nope.

31
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:34,611
What, her?

32
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:40,121
Yeah. My favorite companion
is retiring from companning.

33
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,892
So I'm interviewing
her replacements.

34
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:46,422
Thank you, Butter Scotch.

35
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,967
Is that a family name?

36
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,435
How long are you gonna be
using the office for sex games?

37
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,369
Just so I can plan my day.

38
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,307
Sex? At work? I'm not a savage.

39
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,904
I asked for a cappuccino.
That's what this is.

40
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:06,446
No, cappuccino's got a nice, stiff
foam on it. This is wetter than... Oh...

41
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,889
Almost slipped there.

42
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,585
Well, thank you, Ms. Scotch,
but poor foaming's a deal breaker.

43
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,820
Could you ask the next
candidate to come in?

44
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:19,127
Initial exam showed no sign of
trauma or subconjunctival hemorrhage.

45
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:23,328
Lymphocytosis? ALC's in the normal
range, but it's in the high end of normal.

46
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,633
Please take a seat, Fawn.

47
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,073
And tell me what's your
favorite Woody Allen movie?

48
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,670
<i>Annie Hall.</i>

49
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,125
You're interviewing hookers but
not going to talk to them about sex?

50
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,414
Sex is a given. They're hookers.

51
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,350
Defend your choice.

52
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:41,979
It's the most popular.

53
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,251
Oh, so close.

54
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,260
We would have accepted
"Diane Keaton looks great in suits."

55
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,095
Or, "It's a trenchant
commentary on today's mores."

56
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,599
Or, "I needed the eggs."
Thanks for your interest.

57
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,269
To get the gig, a call girl...

58
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:02,168
Sorry, "call woman" needs a combination
of skills that I find useful/entertaining

59
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,302
for the remaining 57
minutes of the hour I pay for.

60
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,315
Lymphocytosis works. Maybe we
should take another look at the blood.

61
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,851
Could also be cavernous
sinus thrombosis.

62
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,796
Clot builds up pressure
at the base of the brain.

63
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,949
Re-run the patient's blood panel
and get a CT venogram of his head.

64
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,424
See which one of you is right.

65
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,427
How are you with
small appliance repair?

66
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,798
This cavernous sinus
thing, is it dangerous?

67
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:32,030
If Henry's got it, we can treat
with a combo of drugs and surgery.

68
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,764
The success rate is over 70%.

69
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,434
Do you want me to call
Amy again? No, it's fine.

70
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,273
Amy's his girlfriend.

71
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,014
I'm the neighbor. I did leave
a message at their number.

72
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,948
Do you want to try her cell? You'll
be here for a few more hours at least.

73
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,287
She doesn't have one.
She worries about radiation.

74
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,224
I could stop by on my way home.

75
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,885
She knows who I am, right?

76
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,521
You don't need to, but thanks.

77
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,823
Good luck. Okay.

78
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,372
Have you ever paid for sex?

79
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,036
Every guy who's ever seen a
Merchant Ivory movie has paid for sex.

80
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:17,011
No. It just seems too
demeaning to women.

81
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,053
Given the things you've done
to women, that seems arbitrary.

82
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,023
You're Chi Park,
right? Who's asking?

83
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,855
You called about my
guitar flyer. You're Micah.

84
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:33,224
This guy's selling a 1974 Gibson
SG Standard in tobacco for $1,250.

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,337
Yeah, actually, I came in to
tell you I already sold it. Sorry.

86
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,873
Oh, uh... Thanks anyway.

87
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,746
Blood panel results seem
pretty much the same as before.

88
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,511
And that guy likes you.

89
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,986
Maybe we should check for diabetes.
Could weaken conjunctival vessels.

90
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,181
And shut up.

91
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,747
If I'm wrong, then why
is he coming back?

92
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,486
My band is rehearsing tomorrow night.
You should come by and jam with us.

93
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,659
That sounds fun.
I'll think about it.

94
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,327
Great. Call me.

95
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,240
Park has a boyfriend.

96
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,240
I'll break your face.

97
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,142
This is the talent portion
of the interview. Okay.

98
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,951
You like cards,
but you can juggle.

99
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,184
I fail to see how this
would be a benefit to you.

100
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,251
What if I'm busy?

101
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,762
You got anything else? Sure.

102
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,426
CT showed no clots
or malformations.

103
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,130
Park and Taub ruled out
lymphocytosis and diabetes.

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,641
Well, since you have
nothing of relevance to report,

105
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,574
I assume that you're here to
toss your panties in the ring.

106
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,581
Patient's got a mysterious
girlfriend he really wants to see.

107
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,313
She's unreachable by phone, and
the neighbor's never even seen her.

108
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,217
What do you think? He's gay.

109
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:09,225
I think he's a junkie. The girlfriend
is a fix. If the guy's inhaling glue...

110
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,457
Can you repair a blender?

111
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,758
Can you bite me?

112
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,800
Go search the patient's home.

113
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:21,936
Well, thank you, ladies. I've seen
a lot of very talented candidates.

114
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,034
Got a tough decision
in the next few days.

115
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,144
This is the part I hate.

116
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,797
Well, it's not
exactly a crack den.

117
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,336
Doesn't exactly look like
a woman lives here either.

118
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,902
"To Amy. I love you."

119
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,969
Okay, she exists. Doesn't
mean he's not a drug addict.

120
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,613
It's good you're
playing it cool with

121
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:03,292
House. Once he gets
a rise out of someone...

122
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,218
I'm not crazy about the
whole hooker thing, but I get it.

123
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,984
Other than the fact that it's
exploitative and dangerous for women,

124
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,158
you get what you need without
any of the emotional baggage.

125
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,023
You're not seeing
anyone, I take it?

126
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:19,031
I've been volunteering at the
Trenton Free Clinic. Keeps me busy.

127
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,427
You volunteer every
night and every weekend?

128
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,797
No time to grab dinner?

129
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,034
What's more important?
Making small talk over ravioli

130
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,302
or helping people
who are less fortunate?

131
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,673
By that rationale, none of
us should ever eat again.

132
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,044
Well, let's just say I'm
not hungry right now.

133
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,310
Oh, God.

134
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,187
I don't think she's breathing.

135
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,120
You think she OD'd?

136
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,156
That or he killed her. Pulse?

137
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,993
No. I'll call the coroner.

138
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,626
I don't think that's
going to be necessary.

139
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,036
This one works
in financial district.

140
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,236
She can get tips. Give
you leg up in market.

141
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,141
What is Fudgey Gonzalez?

142
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:11,875
Ah. Imagine a Vanilla
Gonzalez from the other side.

143
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,425
I'm about to make a decision, but there's
still time for you to sneak under the wire.

144
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,931
My favorite Woody Allen
movie is <i>Melinda and Melinda.</i>

145
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:32,100
<i>Our patient is not a junkie,
but he does have a girlfriend.</i>

146
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,945
I call her my girlfriend,
because people understand that.

147
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,416
If I explained it, they'd
just think I was a weirdo.

148
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,111
We're not here to
judge anyone's fetish.

149
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,189
I'm not a pervert.

150
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,260
It's not like I'm more
attracted to dolls than humans.

151
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,055
So you don't have sex with her?

152
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,960
It's not just about that.

153
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,397
Does the doll talk to you?

154
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,364
I know she's not a real person.

155
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,407
In a lot of ways, she's
better than a person.

156
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:12,310
I can tell her things, and she won't
argue with me or make fun of me.

157
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,711
I come home every night, and
I know she'll be there waiting.

158
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,410
So is your toaster.

159
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,753
No one in the world has an
emotional attachment to a toaster.

160
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:28,158
But a lot of people are willing to
spend $7,000 on women like Amy.

161
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,188
Have you ever tried an actual...

162
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:36,998
Yeah, I'm 35. I've been in relationships.
Just none of them fulfilled me.

163
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,267
And one day, I saw
this website, and...

164
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,637
Maybe the perfect woman
is out there somewhere,

165
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:48,705
but it's not worth going through
what it would take to find her.

166
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,008
Amy makes me happy.

167
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,116
You're sweating.
It's sort of hot in here.

168
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,319
Not that hot.

169
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,459
Bleeding plus two new
symptoms, fever and neurological.

170
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:08,332
I'm not sure about that last
one. I think he's just weird.

171
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:11,302
He wasn't hallucinating. He
didn't have a thought disorder.

172
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,164
You don't think it's
disordered to talk to...

173
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,574
It's not all that different from
talking to your cat or a teddy bear.

174
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,874
You don't have sex with
your cat or teddy bear.

175
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,311
If you did, you'd probably
talk to them more.

176
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,752
Guy loves an imaginary being
who's never going to respond to him.

177
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,915
He's no crazier than
millions of churchgoers.

178
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,425
You think anything off about
any patient is a symptom.

179
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,988
This guy buys flowers, real flowers,
for a piece of plastic in a dress.

180
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,227
You know what's really crazy?

181
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:46,034
Living with a human being.
Someone with opinions and feelings

182
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,904
who gets mad just because you wanna take
salsa classes with them one night a week.

183
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,773
One night.

184
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,346
He's just running away.

185
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,110
He hangs out with a doll. He
never needs to fear rejection.

186
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,742
It's sad. HOUSE: You do
understand the irony here.

187
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,843
Every person in this
room has a sex doll.

188
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,554
At least the patient has the
stones to be honest about it.

189
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,489
Ooh! A metaphor.

190
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,460
What you didn't foresee is
that I actually do have a sex doll.

191
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,020
Your doll is your kids. Yours is
your parents. Yours is your charity.

192
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,727
They're all excuses for
not being in a relationship.

193
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,230
He's not wrong. And you...

194
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,465
I have meaningless sex
with random strangers.

195
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,684
Thanks for the insight, but
I stopped that months ago.

196
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,576
I actually had a
relationship. With a patient.

197
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,311
You just date whoever
happens to cross your path.

198
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,848
My dating is getting in
the way of my dating?

199
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,594
You don't go looking
for the right person.

200
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,062
You just shack up with
whoever's in the room.

201
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,579
And then you get surprised and/or
divorced when it doesn't work out.

202
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,585
I'm surprised you haven't
asked Adams out yet.

203
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,461
Uh...

204
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,957
For your information,
I've got a date tonight.

205
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,829
I'll be jamming with a
cute guy and his band.

206
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,110
You'll bail. TAUB: He's right.

207
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,831
The obvious solution is for me to
hand my kids over to your parents.

208
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,633
Can we stop trying
to argue the premise

209
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,800
and move on to figuring out
why it is you're all social morons?

210
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,877
You do understand
the irony here.

211
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,446
You're mocking us for
avoiding relationships,

212
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,539
but you can't handle
losing your doll.

213
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,053
You're spending all this time and
energy interviewing for a new one.

214
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,355
You're right. That is stupid.

215
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,222
What about the patient?

216
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,692
Dude's banging a sex doll,

217
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,326
a festering cesspool of bodily
fluids and associated bacteria.

218
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,428
Swab her out and
find out which one.

219
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,505
I need you.

220
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:33,310
Please don't quit. You're the only
hooker I know who can tune a piano.

221
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,847
If it's about the money, then I
can up you to three nights a week.

222
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,579
I'm getting married, House.

223
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,414
His name's Harris. He's
a certified accountant.

224
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,326
He loves schlocky horror
movies, and he just moved in.

225
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,588
We're very happy.

226
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,500
Well, you're happy.
Yeah, you're happy,

227
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,094
because he doesn't know
about your employment history.

228
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,399
He knows.

229
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,270
We've talked about it, and
he accepts me for who I am.

230
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,003
No. He's...

231
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:09,439
If he accepted who you were, he would
not be making you give up your career.

232
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,213
Women need their own
identities, their own livelihoods.

233
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,882
Otherwise, why was I
smoking all those Virginia Slims?

234
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,917
I know this is weird for you.

235
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,893
But you need to figure
out a way to be okay with it.

236
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,496
I'll miss you, too.

237
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,593
I feel like the
stirrups are overkill.

238
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,758
I've never done a pelvic on a doll
before. I'm unfamiliar with the protocol.

239
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,965
I'm pretty skeeved out
right now. I'm not gonna lie.

240
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,335
What House said back there...
House says a lot of things.

241
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,431
I don't just date
whoever shows up.

242
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:13,310
I mean, I did meet women in the
hospital, but they weren't just flings.

243
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,814
Basically, you're explaining
why you're not gonna ask me out.

244
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,213
That's not what I was...

245
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,048
Did you want me to ask you out?

246
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:27,025
Yeah. I told Park to tell Taub to
tell House to pass you that note.

247
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,496
It's completely clean in there.

248
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,123
He said he had just bathed her.

249
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:41,231
Adams, there's a swelling
beneath the skin, a three-inch mass.

250
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,708
Is it part of the
doll's skeleton?

251
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,079
It feels like a tumor.

252
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,096
CT showed an air-filled
mass in the doll's abdomen.

253
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,176
It's probably just a
chemical reaction.

254
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,692
Henry left her too close to
a heating pipe or something.

255
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,397
This guy brushes her
hair every morning,

256
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,733
brings home movies for
them to watch together.

257
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,435
You think he tosses her in a
broom closet at the end of each day?

258
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,944
More likely than it
getting stomach cancer.

259
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,672
How about clostridium?

260
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,206
Bacteria got trapped in an
airtight cavity, produced gas.

261
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,219
Doesn't explain the
neurological issue.

262
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:31,246
We can explain that the same
way we explain the tooth fairy.

263
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,658
Oh...

264
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,590
I get to play Solomon.

265
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,525
Cut the doll open.

266
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,517
We can't just destroy the patient's
property. That thing cost seven grand.

267
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,698
Exactly. Ask him for consent.

268
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,468
If he says yes, then we
get to go hunting bacteria.

269
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,062
If he says no, there's no need,

270
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,734
'cause he's crazy, and
we need a different theory.

271
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,404
See you. Gotta
go build a temple.

272
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,439
Okay.

273
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,947
You're sure?

274
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,619
It won't be able to
heal when we're done.

275
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,824
But you think she could tell
you what's wrong with me.

276
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,016
Yes.

277
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,127
Okay.

278
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,776
Should we take her
to the procedure room?

279
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:27,280
It's not a "her," which means
we can do this anywhere.

280
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,818
Adams.

281
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,385
You can know something's
not real and still love it.

282
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,201
I think the procedure
room might be better for this.

283
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,013
You are a horrible person.

284
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,577
All I need is to break up one marriage.
You've broken up three of your own.

285
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,247
You're like the Stephen
Hawking of killing relationships.

286
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,688
Actually, no, Stephen Hawking
is the Stephen Hawking of...

287
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,920
Okay, I have work to do.

288
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,386
Your computer is off.

289
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,657
Sorry, I can't hear
you over my stereo.

290
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,759
Why do you assume that
marriage is better than hooking?

291
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,714
We don't know anything about
the guy. He could be a serial killer.

292
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,367
Even if that were true,
it would still be a tossup.

293
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,240
What kind of guy
marries a hooker?

294
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,074
Someone who hires hookers.

295
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:37,010
And someone who hires hookers
is not exactly the monogamous type.

296
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,143
If we expose him as a
cheater... You're a coward.

297
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:44,053
Would a coward fight to the end to save
a damsel in soon-to-be-proved distress?

298
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,252
Absolutely. If what he's
afraid of is other damsels.

299
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,955
Your last relationship failed so
miserably, you ended up in jail.

300
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,964
Now you're clinging
to this hooker

301
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,900
when there are about three billion other
women out there who aren't call girls.

302
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,935
Some of whom are
attractive and intelligent.

303
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:03,272
One of whom is living in your
apartment and is married to you.

304
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,905
You're right.

305
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,742
Why am I asking you for help?

306
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,186
You shouldn't sleep with Chase.

307
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,258
Oh, thank God, you
got here just in time.

308
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,430
What do you have against him?

309
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,764
Nothing. But House has a
way of getting in people's heads.

310
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,498
Just like last week when he was
prying into your relationship with Chase?

311
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,336
It was silly then,
and it's silly now.

312
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,768
Why was it silly then?

313
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,613
I'm not 5' 9" with
curves and flowing hair,

314
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,117
so it's impossible for me to get
it on with a good-looking guy?

315
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,343
Wow. Do you resent me?

316
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,481
You're the quirky,
hard-working sophomore,

317
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,457
and I'm the evil
cheerleader who steals boys?

318
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,724
If you're not getting
any, it's not my fault.

319
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,795
Should we get the one with
the panda on it or the bird?

320
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,994
Good choice.

321
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:10,166
Pandas eat only bamboo.
They know nothing about cereal.

322
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,744
Your little girl is adorable.

323
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,580
Thanks. She keeps me very busy.

324
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,847
You and her mom
must be very proud.

325
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,823
Her mother died in childbirth.

326
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,891
Amy!

327
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,101
How'd it go?

328
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,435
We're growing cultures now,

329
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,964
but she looked clean, and
there was no telltale smell.

330
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:20,342
I'm guessing the lump was just an
air bubble that got trapped in the mold.

331
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:21,981
You bandaged her up.

332
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:26,583
I threw in some stitches, too. Just
wanted to make her look her best.

333
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,655
Do you want me to
put her in her chair?

334
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,986
Henry.

335
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,085
Call a code!

336
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,164
Are you looking at the apartment
with those or the transit of Mercury?

337
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,641
If night comes, you
will be thanking me.

338
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,268
They are seeking heat.

339
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,371
He's an accountant. How late
do you think he's gonna party?

340
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,813
I brought jar to pee in.

341
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,663
Yeah. JESSICA: <i>We heard
crackles in Henry's lungs.</i>

342
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,519
We diuresed him, but
he still needs oxygen.

343
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,658
Echo shows normal heart function.
Could be high output failure from anemia.

344
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,955
Hematocrit was rock normal.

345
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,328
<i>- What is this, mushroom?
- Say mushroom, charge two dollars.</i>

346
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,229
Say truffle,
charge five dollars.

347
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,462
Is that the man who
wants to marry hooker?

348
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,334
Probably. But he's
not the one we're after.

349
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,704
Should we ask? Nope.

350
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,244
Oh! How rude of
me not to situate you.

351
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,347
I'm doing Emily a favor.

352
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,748
<i>We're gonna track her fiancé
until Dominika can seduce</i>

353
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,821
and expose him as the
lying cheater I need him to be.

354
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,049
I'm guessing she
didn't ask for this favor.

355
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:40,691
You know, the noblest gifts are
the ones we give anonymously.

356
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,318
Crackles are non-specific.

357
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,927
<i>Hypoxia plus bleeding could
indicate DIC or some other...</i>

358
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,556
No neurological symptoms?

359
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,999
<i>I knew your bleeding heart
would bring you around.</i>

360
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,038
<i>Too bad it's also taking
you off the market,</i>

361
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,663
and by market, I mean Chase.

362
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:59,869
<i>Come on, buck up, Chase.
There's always Park. Unless...</i>

363
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,781
How did band practice go? Great.

364
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,578
<i>Does it look like
she's lying?</i> Kind of.

365
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:09,219
Popo needed a ride to the
doctor, and my mother couldn't, so...

366
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,883
You're terrified of dating,

367
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:15,189
because a previous
relationship ended

368
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,525
because your latent rage made
you vicious in arguments, or...

369
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,328
<i>Or reincarnation.</i>

370
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,867
<i>In a past life she was Anne
Boleyn.</i> HOUSE: <i>Interesting.</i>

371
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,700
Taub feels confident enough
to turn the spotlight on himself.

372
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,571
<i>It's almost as if he
wants me to ask...</i>

373
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,039
- What's her name?
<i>- Wendy Jacobson.</i>

374
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:36,412
Thirty three, Brown grad, family therapist.
- <i>Nice choice.</i>

375
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,279
Since you've got two
families to therapize.

376
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:41,013
First date, we didn't
discuss everything important.

377
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,055
It was just a one-night stand.

378
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,282
You're wrong. I
actually like her.

379
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,222
I'm gonna see her
again. Mazel tov.

380
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:53,096
Great relationships often start with
snap decisions aimed at proving me wrong.

381
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,464
Air bubble in the doll could
mean the silicone is degrading.

382
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,369
<i>If he inhaled some
particles...</i> Silicone deposition.

383
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,103
That could work. Start
him on plasmapheresis.

384
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,112
Now, turning to Adams,
my theory is tripartite.

385
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,051
Wanna hear my thesis?
It's kind of interesting.

386
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,055
No man comes out.

387
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:22,220
But old naked lady in 3-C is
eating a whole block of cheese.

388
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:26,089
Will this hurt? No, might
feel a little cold, though.

389
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,226
Crap. MOLLY: Hey.

390
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,670
I only have a second, but I
went to that time travel lecture.

391
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,574
Whoa.

392
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,770
That is awesome.

393
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,817
What is it?

394
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:51,190
It's so... Ugh... Realistic.

395
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,751
And it's all bandaged up.

396
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,030
Is it one of those
CPR things? No.

397
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,101
We're starting a
procedure, a little privacy...

398
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,829
No, no. It's good
that she's here.

399
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,973
Molly.

400
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,676
I would like you to meet Amy.

401
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,706
What?

402
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,007
I'm serious.

403
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,850
I know it seems
a little strange,

404
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,586
but she means a lot to me.

405
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:32,029
I gotta get back to work.

406
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,496
You just got here. Sit down.

407
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,138
Yeah, but I said that
I only had a second.

408
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,042
Enjoy the handouts.

409
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,126
Whoa.

410
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,332
Listen, I have to
admit something.

411
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,672
Okay.

412
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,739
Her mom isn't dead.

413
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,382
We're separated.

414
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,251
You're the first person
I've asked out since then.

415
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,724
I'm not used to
explaining. I panicked.

416
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,759
Which I regret, because now
that I've gotten to know you,

417
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,158
I like you.

418
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:46,770
It was a really
stupid lie. I'm sorry.

419
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,175
Was that a different baby?

420
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,704
No.

421
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,541
That was a different baby.

422
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,065
It's nice having you here.

423
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,871
I wish you could come
over and get in bed with me.

424
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:33,713
Like this?

425
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,380
You're talking.

426
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,854
That's not all I can do.

427
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:58,532
Amy, there are doctors... Shh...

428
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,075
I don't know.

429
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,307
Just put your hands on me.

430
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:19,997
It hurts.

431
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,474
Ah!

432
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,574
Pushing lorazepam.

433
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:40,613
If it wasn't neurological
before, it sure is now.

434
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,414
Right upper
quadrant's distended.

435
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,252
He's hallucinating
because his liver is failing.

436
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,261
Elevated transaminases
confirm liver failure.

437
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,476
We'll have to put him on the
transplant list in a couple of days.

438
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,867
It's clearly not the
silicone. Could be vasculitis.

439
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,495
Serologies were negative.

440
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,608
Yeah. If you want Adams to hear,

441
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,839
you might wanna not stand
so conspicuously far away.

442
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,038
I'm making coffee.

443
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,115
And sometimes I date co-workers.
Like everyone else on the planet.

444
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,780
Hepatic fibrosis. If it damaged his
platelets, it'd explain the bleeding.

445
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,551
Unexpected. I actually thought
you might agree with my theory.

446
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,388
Because that would
mean nothing's your fault.

447
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,792
You fell into relationships based
on proximity. Of course they'd fail.

448
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:28,332
But I guess I was wrong. You picked
perfect women. You just screwed it up.

449
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:33,466
How about all five of us sleep
together and the $7,000 sex doll?

450
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,700
It'll solve all of our
hang-ups. $7,000?

451
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:40,404
Adams suggests that we all sleep
together, and your issue is high prices.

452
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,032
Pretty sure she was joking.
- Yes.

453
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,278
I'm 99% sure that you're right,
but I would never forgive myself...

454
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,320
Those dolls are only $5,000. He
must have had it customized somehow.

455
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,850
Oh, like you didn't
check the website.

456
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,728
Guess we don't need to ask
how your dating life is going.

457
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,058
I was curious.

458
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,209
Hepatic fibrosis wouldn't
cause difficulty breathing.

459
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:04,726
It would if liver failure
opened pulmonary AV shunts.

460
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,603
Fibrosis fits. Start
the patient on steroids.

461
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:09,807
And find out how
he pimped his ride.

462
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:14,040
Why? Because I
don't know the answer.

463
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:26,881
Hey.

464
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,688
Foosball? Can't.

465
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,662
Marriage to destroy. Okay.

466
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,994
"Okay," as in passive-aggressive
reverse psychology?

467
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,230
Or as in depressed resignation?

468
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,371
"Okay," as in I changed my mind.

469
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:44,936
Expand.

470
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,912
It's morally reprehensible
and bound to fail,

471
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,074
but in a weird way, it's a step
forward, this thing with Emily.

472
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,914
Contract. It's real
without being real.

473
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,716
It's a long term relationship
that can't actually hurt you.

474
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:00,850
It's a stepping stone. It
means you want more.

475
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:06,129
So passive-aggressive
reverse psychology. Got it.

476
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,436
Try not to come
on too strong, okay.

477
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,768
Just get to know him
a little. Ease into it.

478
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,243
Why would I ease?

479
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,746
True, you could just walk up and
stick your hand down his pants,

480
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,408
but I've heard
there's a middle step.

481
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,419
Men want to have sex.

482
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,783
Not with crazy people.

483
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,325
Well, yes, a lot with crazy
people, but not that kind of crazy.

484
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,905
Well, yeah, that
kind of crazy, but...

485
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,996
They don't care how
crazy if she looks like me.

486
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,758
Okay. Easing.

487
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,839
<i>Hi. Hey.</i>

488
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,671
<i>I'm Jennifer, new to
Marketing Department.</i>

489
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:55,339
<i>Harris. Accounts
receivable. Interesting.</i>

490
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,575
<i>Do you want to get out
of here and have sex?</i>

491
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,948
<i>Sure.</i>

492
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,987
<i>You know, I've got 45 minutes
left on my lunch break. Mmm-hmm.</i>

493
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,319
<i>Where do you want to go?</i>

494
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:11,089
Off to a place where men don't
cheat on the women they love.

495
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:13,688
You're not invited, obviously.

496
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,531
Cheating? What are
you talking about?

497
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,831
Well, I hope you're speaking out of
some deep kind of moral relativism.

498
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,000
Because if... Who
are you people?

499
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,709
You're not Emily's fiancé.

500
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,946
Emily's my sister.

501
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,890
We called the company
that made Amy.

502
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:43,920
They said they modeled her
after some photos you sent them.

503
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,058
Who is she?

504
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,339
We met last Christmas.
She's a yoga instructor.

505
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:03,576
Totally different from me. She
loved Chopin, hated Indian food.

506
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:11,213
She changed my
entire life for 17 weeks.

507
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:18,922
My husband cheated on me.

508
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,895
With a girl he met on the plane
coming back from our honeymoon.

509
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,509
It's not easy to get
past things like that.

510
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:42,911
She wasn't unfaithful. She
didn't betray me. She just...

511
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,616
Just wasn't in love with me.

512
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,635
I know Amy's not going
to break your heart,

513
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,837
but she's also not
going to change your life.

514
00:34:08,113 --> 00:34:09,604
That light's bright.

515
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,411
Sorry. What's happening to me?

516
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,586
Is your neck stiff? Yeah.

517
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,119
I think you have meningitis.

518
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:27,458
I'm not leaving the
business. I'm just leaving you.

519
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,632
I didn't want you to feel bad.

520
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,237
So, let me get this straight.

521
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:36,605
I'm being dumped by a hooker
who's worried about my feelings.

522
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,338
You're married. Half
your clients are married.

523
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,935
And you're a hooker.

524
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,471
My other guys sneak around.

525
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,677
But you'll take me into the bedroom
while your wife's in the next room.

526
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,953
That's just mean.

527
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,818
Oh, thank God.

528
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,051
The marriage, it's a sham.

529
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,452
The only real thing about it is the Green
Card she's gonna get at the end of it.

530
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,993
So, if you wanna get
the meter running...

531
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,894
It's still mean.

532
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,832
It's not a marriage.
It's a felony.

533
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,014
I've seen how she looks
at you when you're together.

534
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,035
Trust me, she likes you.

535
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,239
And I've seen how
you look at her.

536
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,916
<i>Fever's up to 105. He's
not responding to meds.</i>

537
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,857
At this rate, he'll be dead by
the time we get the cultures back.

538
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,956
Spinal fluid was full of white cells.
Meningitis could be carcinomatous.

539
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,693
Cytology showed nothing.

540
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,203
An amoebic infection would
cause fever and meningitis.

541
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,206
But not liver failure. It
could if he had a clot.

542
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,708
How would amoebas get
past his cribriform plate?

543
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,143
He went swimming in a
frozen lake in New Jersey?

544
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,050
Adams said his ex-girlfriend
was a yoga instructor.

545
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,144
Maybe he sprained his chakras.

546
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:57,913
Yoga nuts are way more likely
to be into alternative medicine.

547
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,754
He had this weird little
teapot in his house.

548
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:03,487
What was it like?

549
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:07,562
I don't know. Little,
weird, teapot-ish.

550
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,405
Was it like that? Yeah.

551
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,741
You think he drank some
sort of toxic herbal tea?

552
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:25,282
Yes, if by tea you
mean salted tap water,

553
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,748
and by drank you mean
poured up his nose.

554
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,184
His girlfriend didn't just
leave him with a broken heart.

555
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,914
She left him with a neti pot.

556
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:37,427
It's an Indian method of clearing
the sinuses during allergy season,

557
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,929
also known as now.

558
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:42,764
<i>With distilled water, it can
act as a snot-flushing system.</i>

559
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,599
<i>With tap water, it can act as
an amoeba-delivery system</i>

560
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,105
to the fluids around the brain.

561
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,970
Start him on metronidazole.

562
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,445
If he's lucky, he'll get to see his
plastic children walk down the aisle.

563
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,313
My neck feels much better.

564
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,551
Your fever's gone, and your liver
function's almost back to normal.

565
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,092
You should be able
to go home soon.

566
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,890
I'm going to have some
hospital bills to pay.

567
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,932
I don't suppose used sex
dolls go for anything online?

568
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,164
Dr. Adams?

569
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,603
Can I get your email?

570
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,706
What for?

571
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,677
I just thought maybe we
could see each other again.

572
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,075
I can't.

573
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,381
No, I know it's a
professionalism thing,

574
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,719
but you won't be my
doctor when I get out of here.

575
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,056
It's not that.
It's... What is it?

576
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:43,959
You said I should
change my life.

577
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,861
You were talking about
yourself, too. I know you were.

578
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,561
Henry. I think you
should ask Molly out.

579
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,070
I should have known
this would happen.

580
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:03,377
You're a good guy, Henry.
You deserve more than a doll.

581
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:09,653
Promise me you'll keep trying.

582
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,053
Okay.

583
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,370
Date tonight? No.

584
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,405
So she can't deal. There's
someone out there who can.

585
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,977
You just got to find her.

586
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:36,104
I'd love to prove
House wrong, but...

587
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,917
I ruined my marriage,
broke two people's hearts,

588
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:45,150
had two kids who are always gonna wonder
why I didn't love their mommy enough.

589
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:49,086
It's better if I just
focus on what I do have.

590
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,489
Give that band guy a call.

591
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,829
I'm not that good at guitar.

592
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,801
Or flirting or small talk?

593
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:08,172
I'm not as pretty as Adams. I have
stuffy clothes, and I hate my hair.

594
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:11,580
Adams works 80 hours a
week fixing bunions on hobos,

595
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,983
because she can't face
getting to know someone new.

596
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,389
Trust me, you find a boyfriend,
she'll be the jealous one.

597
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,260
See you tomorrow.

598
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:31,235
Do you

599
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:36,368
want to get a drink?

600
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,039
To annoy Park? Or
to prove House wrong?

601
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,311
Oh, I...

602
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:45,281
It's just I think it's
time for a change.

603
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,887
I don't really think that's a
good idea for me right now.

604
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,393
House has a way of
getting in people's heads.

605
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,600
Yeah. Yeah.

606
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,442
No, Mom. I'm still at work.

607
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:21,548
I'll be home in a couple
of hours. Love you, too.

608
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:36,562
Ready? One, two, three, four.

609
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,709
I fixed blender.

610
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,778
So I see.

611
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,920
I had fun seducing
hooker's fake fiancé.

612
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,613
Sorry it didn't work.

613
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:10,423
Yeah. I thought I'd take a break
from the whole hooker thing.

614
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:16,801
I think maybe you need
milkshake. Is pistachio.

615
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:34,074
Well, I'm going to go to
bed. See you tomorrow.
