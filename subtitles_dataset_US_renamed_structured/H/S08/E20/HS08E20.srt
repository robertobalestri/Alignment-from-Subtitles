1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:03,431
Clear!

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,496
Charging. Clear!

3
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,375
Okay, I'm calling it.

4
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:22,386
Time of death, 8:32.

5
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,730
Hello, Diana. Shall we?

6
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,171
LV tear's within a zone
of fresh tissue necrosis,

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,739
implicating recent myocardial
infarction as the instigating event.

8
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:01,420
Unfortunately, the medical
records show that Dr. Penza

9
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,422
never suspected heart disease,

10
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,927
instead, giving steroids for an
erroneous diagnosis of asthma,

11
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,826
thereby causing the fatal tear.

12
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,474
I suggest these findings
warrant further investigation

13
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,763
into Dr. Penza's standard
of care for this patient,

14
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:19,296
making this my third such recommendation
regarding Dr. Penza this year.

15
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,440
Concluding autopsy with
examination of the brain.

16
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,781
Dr. Treiber?

17
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,125
I'm cold.

18
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,430
Yes, it's mine.

19
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,036
And, yes, I know
that I can't drive stick.

20
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,571
And, no, I don't care that I
parked in a handicap spot.

21
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:05,544
"Staring death in the face has
changed my life." What a cliché.

22
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,110
The cliché is to lead
a more meaningful life.

23
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,775
I've taken a holy vow to
lead a less meaningful one.

24
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,819
I've spent my
life caring, giving,

25
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,252
and searching for the profound.

26
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:19,316
Now it's time for selfishness,
indifference, and embracing the shallow.

27
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,667
Your scan's in three days.

28
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,570
Tell me this isn't
just you killing time

29
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,237
until you find out if your
cancer's gonna kill it for you?

30
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:42,407
I just paid $75,000 for a
ridiculously impractical car,

31
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,451
the depth of shallowness.

32
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:48,649
And tomorrow, I'm driving it to
Cleveland to meet my boyhood crush.

33
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,351
The years have not been
kind to David Cassidy.

34
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:56,694
Julie Christie, <i>Doctor Zhivago,
Shampoo.</i> I was precocious.

35
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,828
She's opening some kind of
charity animal clinic, or something.

36
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:04,598
I'm neglecting my patients
to fulfill a silly fantasy.

37
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,334
Textbook selfishness
and indifference.

38
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,637
Or you've made
sure that your patients

39
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,804
are well covered,
the car is a rental,

40
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,975
and while waiting to get Julie
Christie's autograph, you'll adopt a puppy.

41
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,986
I don't even care whether
you believe me or not.

42
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,524
Indifference.

43
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,520
He tried to cut
open his own skull.

44
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,556
Head CT and tox
screen were clean.

45
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,690
Interesting.

46
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:37,303
Cotard delusion. Also known
as Walking Corpse Syndrome.

47
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,599
A disconnect in the amygdala

48
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,504
convinces you that
you're secretly dead.

49
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,568
Case solved, rendering it...

50
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,373
What's the past
tense of "interesting"?

51
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,480
No prior history
of mental illness,

52
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:51,040
and before you say it was caused by
antivirals, I've already ruled that out.

53
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,882
Plus Cotard's doesn't explain
the paresthesia in his hand.

54
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:59,157
Also, Treiber won't let
any other doctor near him.

55
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,528
He trusts your work.

56
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,688
Treiber's the patient?

57
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,757
What's the future
tense of "interesting"?

58
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,205
How's Wilson doing? Wilson's
scan is at the end of the week.

59
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,702
If his kickass chemo
shrunk the tumor

60
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,870
to an operable size, he'll live.

61
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,880
If it didn't, he'll die.

62
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,543
That must be very hard. Is
there anything we can do?

63
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,053
Other than the prayer
circle, what is there?

64
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,918
Patient's AST is high.

65
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,835
Psychosis could be
brought on by liver failure.

66
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:33,883
Maybe Hep C?

67
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,520
Bilirubin and serum
protein levels were normal.

68
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,293
It doesn't explain the tingly
hand or why Chase hates him.

69
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,368
I don't hate him, he hates me.

70
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,369
He hates all doctors.
And it's mutual.

71
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,200
He only hates the
ones that screw up.

72
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,040
And you.

73
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,203
And they only hate Treiber
because he finds their mistakes.

74
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,804
Mistakes are a wee bit
easier to find on a dead patient.

75
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,906
A distinction he fails
to recognize. He's a rat.

76
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,110
Who makes the
hospital a safer place

77
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,450
by keeping doctors
accountable and focused.

78
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,799
What if he got something
from a cadaver?

79
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:04,823
He handles a lot of them.

80
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,621
You suggesting we DDx them all?

81
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,662
No, just his last one.

82
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,992
She had bad knees.

83
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,757
If she used dimethyl
sulfoxide for joint pain,

84
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,962
current from the defibrillator could've
converted it to dimethyl sulfate.

85
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,437
When Treiber cut into her,
her blood released toxic fumes.

86
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,065
Everyone in the
basement would be sick.

87
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,377
Well, gas would've
dissipated quickly.

88
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,877
His lungs are fine.

89
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,607
Blood clots make more sense.

90
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,842
One in his hand
explains the paresthesia,

91
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,442
one in his carotid explains
the psychotic episode.

92
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,320
You two look for toxic exposure.

93
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,288
Adams, you can
help Chase ultrasound

94
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,417
his evil nemesis for evil clots.

95
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,662
I know House doesn't
like seeing his patients,

96
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,667
but doesn't a fellow
doctor rate an exception?

97
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,632
Psychosis appears
to be intermittent.

98
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,330
Just snapped out of
it long enough to ask

99
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,996
if House actually
ordered this test.

100
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,835
Don't worry, we're simply
carrying out his direct orders.

101
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,376
Right, I forgot. That's
what you were hired to do.

102
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,614
Which is fine. His
diagnostic error metric is .17,

103
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,945
compared to the
hospital average of .32.

104
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,180
You actually think you can
quantify the value of every doctor?

105
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,310
Someone should.

106
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,198
And since I'm the only
one who sees everything...

107
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,192
Right. You were hired to diagnose
people after they're already dead.

108
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,719
No sign of stenosis or clots.

109
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,228
Every doctor, every diagnosis,

110
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,962
every treatment, every result.

111
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,329
It's pretty impressive.

112
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,530
It's pretty Orwellian.

113
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,799
All written in his secret code.

114
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,671
He has to keep it confidential.

115
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,301
Just like the
Wannsee Conference?

116
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,903
The Big Brother metaphor
wasn't pointed enough for you?

117
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,447
You had to throw in Hitler?

118
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,249
A couple years ago, he
noticed a link in child deaths,

119
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,911
and it's completely changed
hospital policies on...

120
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,218
I get it, Treiber is nerd king.

121
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,885
The more people we kill,
the more lives he saves.

122
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:51,694
Test is negative for dimethyl
sulfate. Her blood is not toxic.

123
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,394
Then we should look for toxic
exposures from something else.

124
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,962
You really think the hospital is
idiotic enough to issue toxic supplies?

125
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,098
Have you seen his tools?

126
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,672
Treiber doesn't always
use "hospital issue".

127
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,110
Then he's the idiot?

128
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,808
No, but I don't want to explain
that assumption to House.

129
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,112
Found something.
Found something.

130
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,540
Thought we'd
make it a road trip.

131
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,353
'80s music, junk food, beer.

132
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,865
I have a dental appointment.

133
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,798
That I'm going to make now.

134
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,593
Ah... I'll let you drive.

135
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,294
Not worth listening
to you whine about

136
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,891
your feelings and
fears for three days.

137
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,932
It's not gonna happen.
I've taken a vow.

138
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,375
People don't change.
You're a person.

139
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,504
Ergo, pass.

140
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,510
Yes, that's why I brought
this. 20ccs of propofol.

141
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,678
You can accompany me willingly,
or I will, when you least expect it,

142
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,689
inject the contents of this
vial into your bloodstream.

143
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:54,356
The fall might result in a
concussion, or fractures,

144
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,520
or you might get lucky,

145
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,689
and simply wake up somewhere
near Allentown with a nasty headache.

146
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,758
The choice is yours, and
in case you've forgotten,

147
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,325
I am indifferent.

148
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,002
We leave tomorrow
morning at 8:00 a.m.

149
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,638
No clots.

150
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,804
No gas.

151
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,145
But we found enough of this
to reanimate the entire morgue.

152
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,684
He's jacked on caffeine.

153
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,378
Stimulant psychosis.

154
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,118
How many times do I
have to solve this case?

155
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,315
So all we have to do is hydrate
and observe him for 24 hours?

156
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,190
Why don't you tell him it was your
idea? He might warm up to you.

157
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,789
If you get an ear in the
mail, it's probably mine.

158
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,761
My Abdomen! It's my abdomen!

159
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,774
It's just the effects of
withdrawal. The pain is normal.

160
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,675
No. No, this isn't right.

161
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,345
Abdominal pain and
distension means

162
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,355
we were wrong about
stimulant psychosis.

163
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,424
They could be
coexistent problems.

164
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,118
He might just
have an obstruction.

165
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,026
You know what House
says about coincidences.

166
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,292
I didn't feel any masses when I
examined him, and no bowel sounds.

167
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,689
Where's House?

168
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:07,859
He hasn't come in yet.

169
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,664
And neither has Wilson. I've
already tried him three times.

170
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,035
Here we go again.

171
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,298
Diabetes could cause nerve
damage in his hand and gut, and...

172
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,402
Except his glucose
levels are normal

173
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,003
and he probably would've
mentioned he was a diabetic.

174
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,480
What about ulcerative colitis?

175
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,826
Earlier attacks
caused thrombosis...

176
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,045
We already looked for clots,

177
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,711
and there was no
blood in his stool.

178
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:32,824
Try him again.

179
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,853
And Wilson's.

180
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,354
Wherever they are, they
don't want to be disturbed.

181
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,193
If we take 78,

182
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:19,706
we can do the Sweet Treats
& Salty Eats Snack Food Trail.

183
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,635
My trip, my itinerary.

184
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,937
We have to cover 300 miles today

185
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,409
to be there with plenty of time

186
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,640
to catch Julie by 4:00 tomorrow.

187
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,581
And that thing I said about
letting you drive? I lied.

188
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,289
What?

189
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,615
I'm impressed.

190
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,961
Not by that, but by your real
effort to maintain the façade.

191
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,396
It's been almost an hour and there's
been no mention of the elephant in the car.

192
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,994
Well, I declined
the elephant option.

193
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,632
Uh-huh.

194
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,474
In three days, you're gonna
find out if you live or die.

195
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,509
You don't want to talk about it?

196
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,103
No, but obviously you do.

197
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,172
So we're gonna talk about
it, but because I want to?

198
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,979
I am neither talking about it

199
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,781
nor talking about
not talking about it.

200
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,413
You are hard-wired
to talk about it.

201
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,458
It's how you cope,
it's who you are.

202
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:15,518
Yeah, well, from now
on, I am not me. I'm...

203
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,257
I'm Kyle Calloway.

204
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,367
I thought your porn
name was Rusty Packard.

205
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,928
Kyle is roguish, carefree, and
shares no qualities with James Wilson.

206
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,701
Can Kyle drive stick?

207
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,825
Treiber won't let us do
anything without House.

208
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,981
House just took
himself off the case.

209
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,134
You said no bowel sounds
when you examined him.

210
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,184
No, like "diminished",
or "none at all"? None.

211
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,604
You think it's an
intussusception?

212
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,188
If it is, it could mean
cancer's behind everything.

213
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,541
Let's get a plain
film of his abdomen.

214
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,295
Treiber will refuse
any procedure

215
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,801
that wasn't ordered by House.

216
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,530
Only if he knows it wasn't.

217
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:01,005
You want to lie to a guy whose
favorite pastime is getting doctors fired?

218
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,509
We're adults with
advanced medical training,

219
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,204
not children left
alone with scissors.

220
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:06,804
It's one X-ray.

221
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,482
If we had a phone, we could've
found somewhere a little less charming.

222
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,302
If we had a phone,
you'd be making calls,

223
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,659
downloading porn and
playing <i>Angry Birds.</i>

224
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,863
This trip is about me,
and I like this place.

225
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,197
It's not about you not
wanting me to have a phone.

226
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,360
You're weak.

227
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,527
You knew that you'd backslide

228
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,869
and spend your time
talking to teary ex-wives,

229
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,940
and your parents.

230
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,670
Trying to make them feel
better about you being sick.

231
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,772
Bacon burger with fries
looks awful. I'll have that.

232
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,380
I'll have The Big One.

233
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,552
You sure? It's $79.

234
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,251
Unless I finish it in an
hour, in which case, it's free.

235
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,560
It's an 80 ounce steak.

236
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,629
I'm hungry.

237
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,298
And an iced tea, please.

238
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,697
Big One's up!

239
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,530
This place doesn't
take credit cards.

240
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,406
My meal is going to be free,

241
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:14,709
and I'm going to be
inducted into the Wall of Pain.

242
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,217
Hello, Kyle.

243
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,948
No! Belly film was normal.

244
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,492
No sign of an intussusception
or any other obstruction.

245
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,652
House says it's there?

246
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,555
Sometimes House is wrong.

247
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,225
Run my bowel.

248
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,393
That's serious surgery. General
anesthesia, long recovery...

249
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,598
We can do a contrast
enema if you need more proof.

250
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,574
I have drawers filled with
people who had clean scans.

251
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,420
I know how easy it
is to miss something

252
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,504
unless you use your
own hands and eyes.

253
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,513
Run my bowel. We'll let
House know how you feel.

254
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:52,085
How I feel is twisted
in white, hot agony.

255
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,763
His orders were to look
for an intussusception.

256
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,621
Until you actually do that,
I refuse any other tests.

257
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,220
Fine.

258
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,091
No, not fine!

259
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,526
We need to talk... And I
want you to do the surgery.

260
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,462
Statistically, you're the
best surgeon in the hospital.

261
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,672
Kyle! Kyle!

262
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,107
Come on, you got this!

263
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,969
You got this! Come on!

264
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,274
Twenty five seconds.

265
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,611
You got this!

266
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,049
Come on! Home stretch,
Kyle! Home stretch!

267
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,052
Fifteen seconds!

268
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,121
Kyle! Kyle! Kyle! Kyle!

269
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,486
No, don't chew! Just swallow!

270
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,800
Just keep the meat down.
- Six...

271
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,020
five, four... ALL: Five, four...

272
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:38,063
For the love of God,
swallow! three, two, one!

273
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,359
Time!

274
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,230
Yes! Yes!

275
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,401
Yes! Oh, you
magnificent bastard.

276
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,677
Smile!

277
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,485
It still counts, though, right?

278
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,325
No hard feelings, right?

279
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,480
You'll find out
when you wake up.

280
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,868
If you really think
I'm a good doctor,

281
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,496
why do you treat
me like an idiot?

282
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,908
It's not because
you lack talent.

283
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,704
It's because you've wasted it.

284
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,805
Did you know I applied to be a fellow
with House the same year as you?

285
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
No.

286
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:31,945
I quit my other program,

287
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:35,182
relocated, broke
up with my girlfriend.

288
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,422
Then your father made a call
and, suddenly, you had the spot.

289
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,735
That was almost 10 years ago.

290
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,003
Do you know what I could've done

291
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,723
after even three
years with House?

292
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,421
Gone to the CDC, WHO,

293
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,500
started a diagnostics
department some place

294
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,127
they'd never even
heard of such a thing.

295
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,768
You've been given everything.

296
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,468
Looks, talent, my future.

297
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,044
Nine years later,

298
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,574
look what you've done with it.

299
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,591
Ugh!

300
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,697
Must be nice to be puking
for the old-fashioned reasons.

301
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,838
I'm glad I did it.

302
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,750
You see those people
out there cheering for me?

303
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,833
I was a hero.

304
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:34,639
For one fleeting moment,
for an incredibly stupid reason,

305
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,049
for a bunch of morons
I'll never see again.

306
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:43,619
God, it felt good.

307
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,019
And now if you'll excuse me,

308
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,162
I think I've made
room for dessert.

309
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,997
How long do you think
you'll work for House?

310
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,943
As long as he lets me.

311
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:13,111
When House was in prison, you
worked at Mercy, in plastics, right?

312
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,145
Know what I did? Surfed.

313
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,555
For nine months. Yes.

314
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,184
And if I didn't have two
daughters and alimony,

315
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,694
I might have done the same.

316
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,526
A fellowship's supposed to
train you to stand on your own.

317
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,029
Foreman's dean of the hospital,

318
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,466
Cameron's head of
emergency medicine in Chicago.

319
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,401
And Kutner and Amber are dead,

320
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,565
and Thirteen's having sweet
Sapphic sex on some island.

321
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,701
Look at this, in
his small intestine.

322
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,140
Is it an intussusception?

323
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:42,981
No.

324
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,009
Guess Treiber was right.

325
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,499
He hasn't checked his voicemail.

326
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,650
Or his email.

327
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:55,820
It's been almost 24 hours, shouldn't
we call Foreman, or the police?

328
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,488
I think this makes
him a fugitive.

329
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,088
We don't have to tell anyone.

330
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,864
Treiber's symptoms
started in his frontal lobe

331
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,211
and moved through
his nervous system.

332
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,703
Hands, bowels, muscles.

333
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,999
Intermittent porphyria.

334
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,349
He's in the middle of an attack.

335
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,584
The longer we wait to treat with
haemin, the more damage it causes.

336
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,203
The longer we wait to tell him
House isn't running the case,

337
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,907
the more damage
that causes. It's fraud.

338
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,539
It's only an issue
if we're wrong.

339
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,776
It's more than one X-ray,

340
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,182
more than exploratory
surgery even.

341
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,078
This is a drug that will
damage him if you're wrong.

342
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,589
Same principle.

343
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,364
I want a threesome.

344
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,307
Shouldn't we try
a twosome first?

345
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,845
Two women. Oh.

346
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,778
I know they're
probably overrated,

347
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,079
and I'll probably be
gravely disappointed,

348
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,413
but I want one anyway.

349
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,052
No, you don't.

350
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,486
Well, Kyle wants one.

351
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,616
Kyle's only one day old. He
doesn't know what he wants.

352
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,355
I don't want to think
about consequences.

353
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,953
I don't want to think about...

354
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:09,268
I don't want to think about
anything, I just wanna do.

355
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,010
Okay. I need you to do
exactly what I tell you.

356
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,310
Yeah, yeah.

357
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,352
Porphyria?

358
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,285
I know the anesthesia
makes it hard to focus,

359
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,324
but we need to start
you on haemin right away.

360
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:40,023
House believes very
strongly this is the right call.

361
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,336
Okay.

362
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,142
This thing is peeling.

363
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,549
Well, that is the
cost of cowardice.

364
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,052
Should've gone
for the real thing.

365
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,951
I feel like I'm cheating.

366
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,321
"A", it is only cheating
if you don't have cancer,

367
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,691
and "B", it's Wednesday
afternoon. Pickings are slim.

368
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,490
And more importantly, sober.

369
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,997
The cancer cut is the surest
way to the pity-pooty party.

370
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,737
One down, one to go.

371
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,497
What? Wait, wait, what?

372
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,574
She said yes? To a threesome?

373
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,577
She's empathetic.

374
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,872
She's a hooker.
Gave me a cancer rate.

375
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,816
No, I have never
paid for sex in my life.

376
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,320
You still haven't.
It's my treat.

377
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,350
It's either that or you find
two very open-minded women

378
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,154
to fall in love with
you in the next hour.

379
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,932
Bartender seems nice.

380
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:51,734
She seems female.

381
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:54,932
Want something to eat?

382
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,742
My friend is dying of cancer.

383
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:00,569
God, you poor thing.

384
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,914
It took my mother two years ago.

385
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,184
But you can't give up hope.

386
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:13,082
He's pretty much resigned.
Just wants to go out with a bang.

387
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,025
And another pun, what
time do you get off?

388
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,897
Pleural effusions.
It's not porphyria.

389
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,918
We're gonna need
to put in a chest tube.

390
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:30,942
I want Dr. House.

391
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,070
We'll tell him exactly...
I wanna talk to him!

392
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,812
I want House! Where is House?

393
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,917
Where is he? Where's House?

394
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:42,978
We don't know.

395
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,366
You didn't have
to sleep out here.

396
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,477
Four's a crowd.

397
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,071
Apparently they
left a long time ago.

398
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:13,577
So, how was it? Was the
amateur as good as the pro?

399
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:19,587
It was confusing,
perfunctory, and a bit sad.

400
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,716
Never mind.

401
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,261
And exactly what I needed.

402
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,396
Thank you.

403
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,165
You feel like buying
me breakfast?

404
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,197
One of them stole my wallet.

405
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,653
You're lucky he's
not pressing charges.

406
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,612
Porphyria was a legitimate call.

407
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,608
Until the pleural effusions.

408
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,826
We've done everything House
would have if he'd been here.

409
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,850
You lied to a patient.

410
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,385
Treiber's condition
is declining rapidly.

411
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,766
He's agreed to let
me take over the case.

412
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,990
Dr. Chase will have no
further contact with the patient.

413
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,592
Fine. I didn't say
you were off the case!

414
00:24:58,931 --> 00:24:59,931
Sit down.

415
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,134
I ordered a cardiac MRI,

416
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,297
enlargement of the left ventricle
suggests an infiltrative disease.

417
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,404
It's sarcoidosis.

418
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,818
We could start him
on corticosteroids

419
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,276
and do a cardiac
biopsy to confirm.

420
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,638
I disagree.

421
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:13,788
I was wrong about the porphyria,

422
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,678
but I wasn't wrong
about the nervous system.

423
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,410
It's a prion disease.

424
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,294
That's why his symptoms
have progressed so rapidly.

425
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,310
It's possible he was
exposed and didn't know it.

426
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,322
Brains are often stored and not
tested until weeks after autopsy.

427
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,301
Treiber's too good to not
take the right precautions.

428
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,453
Maybe the problem is
he thinks the same thing.

429
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,060
His job's built on the premise
that doctors make mistakes.

430
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,189
That includes him.

431
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,942
We should do a brain
biopsy. In his condition?

432
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,559
Then we biopsy the
brains in the morgue.

433
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,778
Find the one that exposed him.

434
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:37,912
It's a needle in a haystack.

435
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:38,960
There's four of us.

436
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,215
Come on, we can
at least start him

437
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,867
on amphotericin
to halt the progress

438
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,184
while you do your heart biopsy.

439
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,144
No, we can't. Amphotericin plus
the contrast dye for the biopsy

440
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,113
would overwhelm his kidneys.
We have to choose one or the other.

441
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,878
Biopsy his heart.

442
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,393
Wallets go in the
minibar freezer.

443
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:08,365
If there's no minibar, the toilet
tank. I've got exactly $20 left.

444
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:12,631
I'm sorry, I wasn't familiar
with hooker protocol.

445
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:13,848
We could use your credit cards.

446
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,740
No, we won't. I'm
still on probation.

447
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:19,539
Leaving the state without
permission will really P.O. my P.O.

448
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:20,704
Doesn't matter.

449
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,649
We can't even afford
gas to get home.

450
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,309
And we're three
hours behind schedule.

451
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,320
We have enough
gas to get to Julie.

452
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,821
I don't care about
anything else.

453
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,559
What this time?

454
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,554
Just wondering how
long this can last.

455
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,875
You're still hoping that I'm
gonna wake up and admit

456
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,891
that Kyle Calloway is
just some lame excuse

457
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,568
to have some naughty
thrills, aren't you?

458
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,932
I'm actually hoping you won't.

459
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:48,999
I like Kyle.

460
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,750
Oh, come on!

461
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,682
Whoo!

462
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,631
Whoa! Whoa!

463
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,058
House!

464
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,602
You okay?

465
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,465
My leg still hurts.

466
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,273
Come on!

467
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,311
We got 20 bucks to go 11 miles.

468
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,358
Why aren't you
answering your pages?

469
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,765
I'm busy.

470
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,494
The biopsy showed
fibrosis in his cardiac muscle.

471
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,531
So it's not a prion disease.

472
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,302
It means Foreman was wrong, too.

473
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,470
He wants everyone to
meet in his office to DDx.

474
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,474
So he can tell us
all it's an infection?

475
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,679
Interesting, or maybe you should
consider not being such a baby.

476
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,983
My first instinct was an
exposure from a corpse.

477
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,187
Treiber spends
all his time here.

478
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,594
If it's not toxic
gas, or prions,

479
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,341
then it has to be something
else. He's not perfect.

480
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,834
Are you trying to cure
him or discredit him?

481
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,338
Treiber can only see me as
"Not House", Foreman, too.

482
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,230
And they're not wrong.

483
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,104
So you're not coming upstairs?

484
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:53,078
No. And when this
case is over, I'm quitting.

485
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,788
He's not quitting.

486
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,522
He already called
other hospitals.

487
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,029
Treiber did get under his skin.

488
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,463
He'll get over it.

489
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,796
Fibrosis has to be a
response to an infection.

490
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,266
Chase said you'd say that.

491
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,763
We'll test the biopsy
samples for viruses,

492
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,740
and start him on anti-virals.

493
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,686
You're not even
going to talk to Chase?

494
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,941
He didn't leave after he
got stabbed in the heart.

495
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,071
I think we're okay.

496
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:25,145
Either you're right, and
your friend is just really upset,

497
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,652
or you're wrong, and he's
come at this calmly and rationally,

498
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,553
and you're about to lose a
good doctor. Either way...

499
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:56,310
This is Oubliette, Ohio.
Buses don't run here after 1968.

500
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,776
Ina said there's a
bus every 15 minutes.

501
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,250
Ina is living in
Alzheimersville.

502
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,920
Been here at least half an hour.

503
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,823
Where are you going, Ina?

504
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,020
Naples, Florida.

505
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:13,428
Ben and I have a beautiful
three-bedroom condo, all on the one floor.

506
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,100
You're waiting for
a bus to Naples?

507
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:20,603
Comes every 15 minutes. Ben'll
be wondering where his dinner is.

508
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,041
Cab.

509
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,306
Whoa! Cab!

510
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,881
20 bucks, 11 miles. Come on!

511
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Come on, let's go.

512
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:38,699
Julie is gonna be at the clinic

513
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,158
for another 45 minutes,
we can make this!

514
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,659
She thinks she's in Florida.

515
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,164
Okay. Bring her with.

516
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,299
I'm waiting for the bus.

517
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,565
Bus isn't coming, Ina.

518
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,897
But this cab is going to Naples.

519
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,467
Ben'll be getting
awfully hungry. House.

520
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:00,904
We'll tell the cabbie
to call the cops.

521
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,845
They'll come pick her
up. Take care of her.

522
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,813
Then I'll stay with
her until they do.

523
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,097
Goodbye, Kyle.

524
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,073
Bus comes every 15 minutes.

525
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,673
Oh, shut up.

526
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,755
Find anything?

527
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,283
Not yet.

528
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,422
Running tests for MRSA.

529
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,358
You've got everybody
worried about you quitting.

530
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,112
You here as my
boss or my friend?

531
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,256
If I was here as your boss,
you'd be suspended by now.

532
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,075
I've learnt a lot here.

533
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,703
Enough to run my own team.

534
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:10,948
It's time I moved on.

535
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16,885
Unfortunately, that's how I felt
last year, and the year before that.

536
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,255
Maybe there's a
reason you haven't left.

537
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,891
You need structure and support.

538
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,933
Somebody else calling the shots.

539
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,101
You didn't come down
here as my boss or my friend.

540
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,608
You came down as House.

541
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,077
You're trying to insult me
into making a decision?

542
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,083
We've both seen it work.

543
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,588
Either you rise to the
challenge and quit,

544
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,157
or you stay

545
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,326
as a team member.

546
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,927
Dr. Treiber! Dr. Treiber!

547
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,303
He stopped responding when
I was changing his IV bag.

548
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,674
Peter, open your eyes.

549
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,542
Coma.

550
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,353
Treiber's comatose.

551
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,553
All brains on deck.

552
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,661
Where should we start?
We think you might be right.

553
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:33,491
I'm not.

554
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:35,710
You couldn't have
gone through all of these.

555
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:36,895
Don't have to.

556
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,630
Treiber's reports are thorough to
a fault, his methods are fastidious.

557
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,101
The answer isn't down here.

558
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,078
Treiber didn't miss
anything, we did.

559
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,445
So what? Psychosis,
abdominal pain,

560
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,177
pleural effusions,
enlarged heart, coma.

561
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,581
Autoimmune, maybe
Goodpasture's. Kidneys are fine.

562
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,019
Vasculitis? No fever.

563
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,167
Lymphoma? Would've
seen it on the heart biopsy.

564
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,815
Soap. It's the soap.

565
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:20,744
I blew it.

566
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,515
Oh, God, here it comes.

567
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,080
As always. All I wanted
was some meaningless fun,

568
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,950
and I couldn't even
last three days.

569
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,116
Sound asleep! I'm sleep talking.

570
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,018
I had the chance to
fulfill a lifelong dream.

571
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:40,224
I swear I will jump out of this
moving bus if you don't shut up.

572
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:44,292
But instead, I sat with a sad,
old woman for an hour and a half

573
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,031
who forgot I existed three
seconds after she left.

574
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,704
And the stupidest thing?

575
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,367
I never even had a
crush on Julie Christie.

576
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,875
In 12th grade, I was madly
in love with Melanie Robbins

577
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,978
who happened to look exactly
like Julie Christie in <i>Doctor Zhivago.</i>

578
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,388
And she really liked me.

579
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,718
We played spades every lunch
period in Mr. Charlton's classroom.

580
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,397
But, of course, there
was this other guy.

581
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,930
A great guy, very popular.

582
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:19,368
He had a car, he had
a band, a moustache...

583
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,402
Kyle Calloway.

584
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,250
I assumed that...

585
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:35,481
I hoped that we would go
to the senior prom together.

586
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,488
But she asked me for a favor.

587
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:46,664
She asked if I minded if she went
with him. She asked me if I minded.

588
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,133
And I said I didn't.

589
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,065
And that was it.

590
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,768
And I just did it again.

591
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,578
I let it go, like I
let everything go.

592
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,477
And here I am,
sitting on this bus,

593
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,516
with tickets I bought
with my watch,

594
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,915
heading back home,

595
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,453
so a CT scan can decide my fate.

596
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,321
I don't want to go back, House.

597
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,202
I just...

598
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,173
I just want to keep being Kyle.

599
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:40,318
Kyle would've ditched that sad,
old woman from the bus stop.

600
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,880
He probably would've
ditched me, too.

601
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,894
I can live without Kyle.

602
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:03,407
Sno Ball?

603
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,382
Guess this isn't heaven.

604
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,080
We found out who screwed up.

605
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,719
You.

606
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,485
It was your industrial
strength antibacterial soap.

607
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,022
The additional triclosan
does two things well.

608
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:31,092
Kills MRSA, and makes
your thyroid look stupid.

609
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,329
It thinks the triclosan is a real
hormone and closes up shop.

610
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:38,374
Excessive use over time,
combined with excessive use of this,

611
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,173
led to hyperthyroidism,

612
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:43,044
which went undiagnosed
until it presented with psychosis.

613
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,208
When the ER put
you on sedatives,

614
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,343
it kicked you into
myxedema crisis.

615
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,082
Don't know that I ever
would have thought of that.

616
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,188
House taught us
to look for irony.

617
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,889
Hey.

618
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,432
This wasn't House.

619
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,389
My locker key.

620
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,916
I'll give you your own team.

621
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:31,895
Thanks.

622
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,760
But it's time to step
out of the shadow.

623
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,239
It's about time.

624
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,110
Any news?

625
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,145
Not yet.

626
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,147
You come here so I
can talk you out of it?

627
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,316
I came to say thank you.

628
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:42,493
It's been fun.

629
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:44,968
"Fun"?

630
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:51,342
Sounded pithier than, "We've
shared a variety of situations".

631
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,046
<i>Let me know about Wilson.</i>

632
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,869
<i>Why did you let him go?</i>

633
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,029
Legal loophole, 13th amendment.

634
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,129
Abraham Lincoln may
have looked great in that hat,

635
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,697
but his labor policies...

636
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:35,585
<i>House?</i>
