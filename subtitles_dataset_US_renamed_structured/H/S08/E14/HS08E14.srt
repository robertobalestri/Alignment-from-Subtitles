1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:03,433
I'm telling you, Will, you
got a real winner here.

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,031
She's just gonna love it.

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,539
Stacy? Box her up.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,243
Just the box.

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,972
I'm sure it's prettier
than the paper.

6
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,652
One tiny rock.

7
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,996
So many other cool things I
could have bought for myself.

8
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:29,620
Sam, Stacy, it's been a
pleasure being ripped off by you.

9
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,332
Such a nice boy.

10
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,802
Too bad he's a handicap.

11
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,851
Excuse me.

12
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,263
Thank you.

13
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,966
Just calm down.

14
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,111
Kid's a blind diabetic.

15
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,975
He's hyperglycemic hyperosmolar.

16
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,780
Which is what we thought

17
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,606
until his blood tests showed a
controlled sugar level and no ketones.

18
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,290
Could be caused by drug abuse.

19
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,950
His tox screens were clean.

20
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,392
<i>You lying sack of crap.</i>

21
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,191
I have them right in front me.

22
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,763
Not you. This time.

23
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,566
My former BFF.

24
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,762
He's S.M.I.T.B.A.W.S.

25
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,703
<i>Stabbing me in the
back as we speak.</i>

26
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:55,799
Where exactly are you?

27
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,477
If anyone should happen to ask,

28
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,580
I'm at an out-of-state medical
conference till further notice.

29
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,943
Why would any...
And don't really care.

30
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,542
Auditory hallucinations and disorientation
could be signs of schizophrenia.

31
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,820
They did a psych consult.
Mental status is normal.

32
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,414
A seizure?
Noise-induced epilepsy.

33
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,789
The sound of rush hour
traffic could have set it off.

34
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,260
Run an EEG,

35
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,422
and blast his brain with
harmonics to find out.

36
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,562
Also, if anyone should
further happen to ask,

37
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,762
I spent the whole
of last year in Africa

38
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,995
<i>with Doctors Without Boundaries.</i>

39
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:26,129
Who are you hiding from?

40
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,973
Evil.

41
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,107
Where's House?

42
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,650
Uh... He's at an out-of-state
medical conference.

43
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,656
In Baltimore, I think.

44
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,029
Nice to meet you.
I'm Blythe. His mother.

45
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,785
Do you want me to pick up
the Braille writer and laptop

46
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,277
from your apartment?

47
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,937
I don't plan on
being here that long.

48
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,878
I didn't eat lunch yesterday.
I probably just fainted.

49
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,814
Or had an epileptic seizure.

50
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,880
Which is only one
possibility. I'm Dr. Chase.

51
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,480
We'd like to discuss your
case with you privately.

52
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,702
I'm his girlfriend. Is it
all right if I stay for this?

53
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,525
Melissa can stay, and I've never
had a seizure before in my life.

54
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,225
They can be mild, like a loss of
concentration or a muscle tremor.

55
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:30,327
A lot of times a family member
notices before the patient does.

56
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,635
I'm Dr. Park, by the
way. I'm 5'2", Asian,

57
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,006
and I'm totally cool with it
if you want to feel my face.

58
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,409
Blind people only
do that in movies.

59
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,506
But you sound nice,
so if you want me to...

60
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,377
Her point was you may not have
realized you were having a seizure,

61
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,011
but maybe your girlfriend has.

62
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,579
No.

63
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,988
But I haven't seen him
for the last five months.

64
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,555
We were on a break.

65
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,961
Like Rachel and Ross on <i>Friends.</i>

66
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,331
Never seen the show
myself, but I hear it's good.

67
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,864
That joke usually
kills my blind friends.

68
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,065
Will, this is serious.

69
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,042
No, it's not, since I
don't have epilepsy.

70
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,908
I have to pay attention to every
signal my body sends or receives

71
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,981
or I end up taking a dirt nap.

72
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,017
You don't think I'd know
if I was having seizures?

73
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,657
It was probably
just low blood sugar.

74
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,325
If that's true, then you shouldn't
have a problem passing our test.

75
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,156
How is he, James? Really.

76
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,496
He's better than I've
seen him in a long time.

77
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,156
Is he happy?

78
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,033
It's okay.

79
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,767
He's always been
a complicated child.

80
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,766
Were you in the
hospital recently?

81
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,173
Nothing serious. I just had a
few moles removed yesterday.

82
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,440
I forgot I even had it on.

83
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:54,517
Look, if Greg happens to get
back early from the conference,

84
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:59,026
I'm staying at a hotel in
town for the next three days.

85
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,295
I would like him to call me.

86
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,394
I will pass it on.

87
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,465
Thank you.

88
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,971
Do you think that they would
mind if I got a refill for the road?

89
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,902
Not at all. Good.

90
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:41,826
Not seeing any seizure activity in
response to low frequency sounds.

91
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,836
I'm starting him on mid-range.

92
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,396
Have you seen his
girlfriend? Extremely hot.

93
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,572
Blind people can't have
attractive girlfriends?

94
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:51,737
Not my point.

95
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:55,282
He actually convinced her to go
for the whole relationship break thing.

96
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,941
How do you know
it wasn't her idea?

97
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,815
Because she's back with him.

98
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,345
Women suggest a break
when they want to break up.

99
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,654
Men do it because they want to have sex
with other women before they settle down.

100
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,784
They're a little young to
get married, don't you think?

101
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,023
I was their age when I did.

102
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,199
I see your point.

103
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,593
He's seizing.

104
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,828
The sound frequency's
at 300 hertz.

105
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,504
It's not a seizure.

106
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,872
He's not spiking on his EEG.

107
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,977
And not moving air. I think
he's choking on something.

108
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,181
Blood, but I don't
see any blockage.

109
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,982
Help me move him.

110
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,189
Just relax and breathe.

111
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,238
What are these?

112
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,545
Three teeth detached from his
jaw bone and lodged in his throat.

113
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,213
He almost choked
to death on them.

114
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:14,417
Environmental? Could be heavy
metal poisoning or radiation exposure.

115
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,189
Then he wouldn't
be the only one.

116
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,942
He's an accountant who works on
the same floor with 50 other people.

117
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,764
Maybe his girlfriend
poisoned him.

118
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,335
House usually thinks
that's a good guess.

119
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,841
And she's gotta be pissed
off and have low self-esteem.

120
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,736
Why else would she give him a
free pass to pork other women?

121
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,989
<i>Because he's handicapped.</i>

122
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,893
<i>Women feel sorry for
us. This cane is tail-bait.</i>

123
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,851
Where are you now?

124
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,545
You expect an actual
answer this time?

125
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,851
<i>Hi, guys. Was wondering
if House's mother left yet.</i>

126
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,200
<i>He won't let me
go to our house...</i>

127
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,168
<i>It's not environmental.
It's periodontitis.</i>

128
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,558
An oral infection
doesn't explain

129
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,788
his disorientation and
auditory hallucinations.

130
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,930
<i>They're laughing 'cause they know
diabetes exacerbates the condition.</i>

131
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,196
It could progress to
a systemic disease.

132
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,465
The bacteria spread
and affect other organs.

133
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,541
<i>Like his brain. Start him on
broad-spectrum antibiotics</i>

134
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,042
<i>and book him an
appointment with a periodontist.</i>

135
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,544
He has fake children now, too?

136
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,643
You think I'm not good
enough for your mother.

137
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,551
Not in front of the kids, honey.

138
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:26,127
Add a couple of flies, toss in a dead
goat or two and we might have a winner.

139
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,100
Is she gone? Yeah.

140
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,665
We really need to talk.

141
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,569
Okay.

142
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,903
Crayons down. Line up
if you want to get paid.

143
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,317
It's the only time I ever
successfully lied to my mom.

144
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,183
Is with elaborate
preparations and props.

145
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,019
Hey, hey, hey.

146
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,156
I said no Transformers, slick.

147
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,298
Stay here until
the coast is clear.

148
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,699
Fine.

149
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,010
But you sleep on couch tonight.

150
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,134
You're sleeping with her now?

151
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,334
Just in case an INS guy
comes in through the window.

152
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,902
Yeah, she didn't buy it either.

153
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,914
You need to talk to your mother.

154
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:15,981
When I'm ready.

155
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,574
I still need to get
a fake passport,

156
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,619
doctored photos,
maybe a case of AIDS.

157
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:20,710
She's sick, House.

158
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,558
Did she say that?

159
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,821
She was wearing a
hospital admission bracelet

160
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,216
and carrying around a book
on dealing with terminal cancer.

161
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,066
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:43,174
She's staying at the Grand
for the next three days.

163
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,420
The antibiotics will stop the
infection from spreading further.

164
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,406
And I'll spare you the lecture you'll
get from the periodontist tomorrow,

165
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,431
but you need to practice
better oral hygiene.

166
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,033
So, are you guys saying this is happening
because, what, I didn't floss enough?

167
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:13,767
Probably didn't help, but diabetics
are prone to this type of infection.

168
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,002
Half the time he doesn't even bother
getting undressed before he goes to bed.

169
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,255
I can only imagine how many times
you've skipped brushing your teeth

170
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,838
since we...

171
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,443
Sorry.

172
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,083
I don't mean to
lecture you, babe.

173
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:31,388
But I guess you're right. Look,
you haven't eaten anything all day.

174
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,450
Why don't you go
grab a bite? I'll be fine.

175
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,564
All right. I'll see you
in an hour, okay?

176
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,700
Not if I see you first.

177
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,036
I was wondering if I could
ask you guys for a favor.

178
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,873
I really need my
laptop and Braille writer

179
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,642
and I can't ask Melissa
to get them for me.

180
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,716
Why not? Because

181
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,909
I want you to put
this someplace safe.

182
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,755
It's beautiful.

183
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,457
People always say
diamonds are beautiful.

184
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,087
But to me they just feel cold
and have really sharp edges.

185
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:15,226
I guess convincing her to
take a break was a good thing.

186
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,963
The break was her idea.

187
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,863
Melissa's the only
girl I've ever dated.

188
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,907
She wanted me to be sure
before we took the next step.

189
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,404
Wow.

190
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,769
Yeah.

191
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,781
What are you doing?

192
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,948
We're here. We might
as well search the place

193
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,515
in case we're wrong
about periodontitis.

194
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,489
What are you doing?

195
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,033
We're here. Might as well eat.

196
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,262
You're stealing food
from a blind man?

197
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,033
We're doing him a
favor, he owes me.

198
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,107
I take it from your
low self-esteem theory,

199
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,043
you have some experience
with relationship breaks.

200
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,182
What happened?

201
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,285
He talked me into it,

202
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,022
then slept with
three of my friends,

203
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,626
then dumped my ass.

204
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,659
College boyfriend.

205
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,627
I thought he was
the love of my life.

206
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,057
Then why agree to a break?

207
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,829
My self-esteem wasn't
as high back then.

208
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,503
No one's is.

209
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,907
Ugh!

210
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:28,998
Sugar free.

211
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,576
Disgusting.

212
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,811
I'll check the bathroom. You
keep checking the snacks.

213
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,270
Greg?

214
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:07,575
Sorry I didn't call first. I just
flew back from my conference.

215
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,473
This really isn't...

216
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,575
I need your medical records,

217
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,244
and the name of
your primary physician.

218
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,417
You remember Mr. Bell?

219
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,085
If I didn't, I will now.

220
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,023
You're not dying.

221
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,895
I may have misled James

222
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,802
by letting him see
a book on cancer.

223
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:36,364
We did however have some
expectations that you might call first.

224
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:37,800
Yeah.

225
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,815
This isn't how I
envisioned you finding out.

226
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,311
Mr. Bell and I, we're...

227
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,787
Having sex? Got it.

228
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,391
Getting married. Also.

229
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,450
We wanted you to
be the first to know.

230
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,494
I need 10 milligrams
of benzodiazepine.

231
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,467
Help me hold him down.

232
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,309
I'm putting epilepsy
back on the table.

233
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,896
And I'm taking it off because it
doesn't explain losing his teeth.

234
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,981
The kid's diabetic. The periodontitis
could be real but completely unrelated.

235
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,922
A coincidence? You
buying that, House?

236
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,926
Until I hear something
that takes my mind off

237
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,531
the Jurassic schlong that I was
traumatized by this afternoon.

238
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,626
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

239
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,333
Illegal drugs.
Some kind of acid.

240
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,404
His tox screens were clean.

241
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,600
His apartment wasn't.

242
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:43,999
We didn't find any drugs.

243
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,046
Then why am I completely
tripping balls right now?

244
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,817
I am seriously
freaking out here, guys.

245
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,511
Can't you tell?

246
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,366
You pretty much look
the same you always do.

247
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,382
Take your glasses off.

248
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,623
Pupils dilated.

249
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,362
Pulse elevated.

250
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,070
Hallucinating?

251
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,470
I think so.

252
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,873
Because he's a rabbit.

253
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:33,423
Oh! I get it. Because
she's his wife.

254
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:37,156
They flirt a lot.
I've seen things.

255
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,935
And Taub. Taub is either

256
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,710
a tooth fairy or Rainbow Brite.

257
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,548
And you?

258
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,687
You're just House.

259
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,454
She ate ice cream and gummy
bears at the patient's apartment.

260
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,358
One of them must
have been dosed with it.

261
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,589
Go back and find the drugs.

262
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,255
You two find out
where he bought them

263
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,301
and then MRI his brain, check
for infections, masses and plaques.

264
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,901
Am I gonna die?

265
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,404
We'll get back to you on that.

266
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,978
I've been blind since birth.

267
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,744
I thought maybe if I tried
LSD, I might, you know...

268
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,746
Colors, a shape.

269
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,725
I just wanted to see something.

270
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,884
How many times?

271
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,116
Maybe five or six.

272
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,021
We need to know where you bought
it so we can find out what was in it.

273
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,764
My girlfriend gave it to me.

274
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,161
I'll find her.

275
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,291
No. Don't.

276
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,996
It wasn't Melissa.

277
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,905
I met someone else.

278
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,240
When were you planning
on telling her that?

279
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,281
Before or after you
ask her to marry you?

280
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,907
The ring isn't for her.

281
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,779
We were on a break.

282
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,450
She wanted me to see what
else was out there and I did.

283
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,921
I was gonna tell
her the other night,

284
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,687
but I ended up here instead.

285
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,022
We just need to talk to the
one who supplied the drugs.

286
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,688
She's on vacation
with her parents.

287
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,597
This is her cell.

288
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,359
I don't want her to know I'm in
the hospital. She'll only freak out.

289
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,836
That's very considerate of you.

290
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,332
You think this is easy for me?

291
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,172
I know I have to tell Melissa.

292
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:32,607
Then what's stopping you?

293
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,038
She's still one of
my best friends.

294
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,445
And I don't want
to be alone in here.

295
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,821
You seen your mother yet?

296
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,158
She's not dying.

297
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,731
She was having
sex with my father.

298
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,732
Ignore her. She's on acid.

299
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,203
Your father's dead, House.

300
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,243
Not the dead dad,
the biological dad.

301
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,869
The one I pointed out to you
at the fake father's funeral.

302
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,140
Huh!

303
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:11,707
Are you sure?

304
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,883
Your only evidence is that
birthmark you saw when you were 12.

305
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,382
Well, now I've seen two.

306
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,655
The good news is, I won't
technically be a bastard much longer.

307
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,325
We're gonna be
one big crappy family.

308
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,096
Well, that's great news.

309
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:36,402
Your mother won't be alone anymore
and you can finally get to know the guy.

310
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,069
Yes. That is one option.

311
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,745
Are you saying you're
not even curious?

312
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,215
You want to know what I think?

313
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,194
I think you know the
answer to that question.

314
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,277
You avoid your mother

315
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,254
because she's the one person
whose opinion you actually care about.

316
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,858
If that was true, you'd have
every reason to shut up.

317
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,757
I avoid my mother
because she's boring.

318
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,694
That's why you've been so
open and honest about prison

319
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,391
and marrying a
complete stranger.

320
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,728
Even if I care what she thinks,

321
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,235
why would I care what
some sperm donor does?

322
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,464
You read the guy's
book about three times.

323
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,804
Years ago and it took three times
because it was so badly written.

324
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,208
Oh! I get it.

325
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,238
The second birthmark
was on his penis, right?

326
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,647
The kid's a dick.

327
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,197
You've been working
for House for months

328
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,487
and just now realized that
disabled people can also be dicks?

329
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,989
What he's doing now
to that girl isn't fair.

330
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,722
The break was her idea.

331
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,899
And now she thinks
they're back together.

332
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:37,062
He's a scared, sick blind kid
who doesn't want to be alone.

333
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,663
You really don't get that?

334
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,406
I do. But...

335
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,278
What is it?

336
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,004
Not good news for him. Or Park.

337
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,749
Where's Park?

338
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,524
Wilson's babysitting her.

339
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,463
Talking about the fact that she
could have permanent brain damage

340
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,433
might bum her
trip out a little bit.

341
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,365
Dark spot doesn't necessarily
equal brain damage.

342
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,204
It could be a congenital malformation
connected with his blindness or a tumor.

343
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,469
A clot.

344
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,546
Exactly. We need to do
another scan, then inject dye...

345
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,978
I said a clot,

346
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,509
not or a clot.

347
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,781
It's a clot. Cerebral
venous sinus thrombosis.

348
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:29,965
That'd be good news for Park,

349
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,867
but I've never seen one
present this large before.

350
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,484
It fits. When it was smaller,

351
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,186
it caused his initial
disorientation and hallucinations.

352
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,161
As it grew larger, the seizures.

353
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,291
If left untreated, it leads to
cerebral edema and death,

354
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,029
but what causes
that and tooth loss?

355
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,639
Any hyper-coagulable
state. Lupus?

356
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,642
I counter your lupus
with Behcet's syndrome.

357
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,804
No. He doesn't have any
of the earlier symptoms,

358
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,043
color blindness,
abnormal visual fields or...

359
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:04,156
We've been ignoring his
eyes because he's blind.

360
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,995
If he wasn't before,
he would be by now.

361
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,826
Confirm with an eye exam and start
treatment with heparin for the clot.

362
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,993
Interferon and steroids
for the Behcet's.

363
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,269
Give me back my teeth!

364
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,101
Park, listen. Park!

365
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,402
You're a tooth thief!

366
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,403
No, no, no, stop it! Stop it!

367
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,012
Back on the couch!

368
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,571
What are you doing
to this poor girl?

369
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,188
It's not what it
looks like. She's...

370
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,245
She's tripping on acid.

371
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:40,554
Good Lord, man. That's
no way to treat a bad trip.

372
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,753
Put the chair down. You'll end
up hurting the poor wee thing.

373
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,798
Hello, darling.

374
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,260
I'm Thomas and this beautiful
creature here is Blythe.

375
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,236
Is there anything we
can do to help you?

376
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,740
That rabbit stole my teeth.

377
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,104
Of course, he did. But
I'll tell you what he's done.

378
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,408
He's put them back again and
they're twice as nice as they used to be.

379
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,914
You can feel them if you like.

380
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,881
See?

381
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,387
Now why don't we sit
on this nice, comfy couch,

382
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,484
have a nice cool drink and talk
all about it? Would you like that?

383
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,765
He's had some experience with
things like this back in the day.

384
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,065
As I recall, both of us.

385
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,663
Ah! Not the time
or the place, dear.

386
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,743
See? There you go.

387
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,018
There's no way that
guy's related to you.

388
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:50,622
There's fresh scarring and swelling
in both fundi and a bleed on the left.

389
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:51,823
House was right.

390
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,359
It's Behcet's syndrome.

391
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,296
Give it to me straight, Doc.

392
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,700
Am I ever gonna see again?

393
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,869
That's a little out
of our jurisdiction.

394
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,561
We need to wrap a dressing
over your eyes to keep the light out.

395
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,303
Not really a problem for me.

396
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,879
You might not see it
but your tissue does.

397
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,006
It'll also help
with the swelling.

398
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,177
I'll leave you in
Dr. Adams' capable hands.

399
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,053
You think I'm an ass, don't you?

400
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,992
I can tell by your breathing.

401
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,400
Either you're angry or fat.

402
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,229
I think it's unfair that
you're leading on a woman

403
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,741
who obviously loves
and cares about you.

404
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,605
I love and care about her, too,

405
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:42,075
but we just don't work
together as a couple.

406
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,576
You need to tell her that.

407
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,049
I'm going to,

408
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,685
but I just want to
do it the right way.

409
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,555
I don't want her to hate me.

410
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,353
When she finds out you bought an
engagement ring for another woman,

411
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,225
that option is out the window.

412
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,730
It was going to be for her.

413
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,956
What changed?

414
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,035
She told me we
were going on a break.

415
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,394
I didn't even get
a say in the matter.

416
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,906
She wanted you to be
sure about your relationship.

417
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,704
I can see how that
would be annoying.

418
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,105
I think I liked it better when
you were just breathing angrily.

419
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,418
She still sees me as the same
sheltered blind geek she met in college.

420
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:27,585
Most of the time she acts more
like my mother than my girlfriend.

421
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:32,495
I asked her to marry me. She tells
me I need to date somebody else first?

422
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,332
I'd rather she just dumped me.

423
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,392
At least that I can understand.

424
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,801
So you were hurt so much you had
to marry the next woman you met?

425
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,999
Julie doesn't see me as I was,

426
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,471
but for who I am now.

427
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:49,412
She trusts me to make my own
decisions and to help her with hers.

428
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,277
For the first time in my life,

429
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:56,782
I have somebody who needs me
instead of the other way around.

430
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:10,194
She finally fell asleep. I think
she'll be fine in a couple of hours.

431
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:14,006
How do you know about
handling a bad acid trip?

432
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,802
Friends in your gardening
club been experimenting again?

433
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,939
I was young once.

434
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:28,184
A little scrapbook that
Thomas threw together.

435
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:31,553
He even has a couple of
pictures of you as a child.

436
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,621
I've known Greg almost
since he was born.

437
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,456
His father and I
were like brothers.

438
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,893
I was a Navy
chaplain in those days.

439
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,130
I left the service
in the late '60s.

440
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:44,795
I don't think his dad ever
forgave me for protesting the war.

441
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,135
Of course, if he knew
I got Blythe involved...

442
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,002
You protested the war? When?

443
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,338
You were a child. I didn't share
my entire schedule with you.

444
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:55,572
We knew if we told you, you'd
tell him and he'd kill us both.

445
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,980
He was a Marine. That
was the ultimate betrayal.

446
00:26:58,417 --> 00:26:59,817
Penultimate.

447
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,078
Sweetheart, I think we
need to get back to the hotel.

448
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,815
Wilson, it's been
a real pleasure.

449
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,022
You're right.

450
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,764
Much too formal.

451
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,130
Come here, lad.

452
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,864
We're practically family now.

453
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,768
We'll see you boys tonight.

454
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,374
8:00 sharp. Good.

455
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,645
I invited them out to dinner.

456
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,812
Told them it was your idea.

457
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,749
Straw.

458
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,827
I know we agreed that whatever
happened on break would stay on break

459
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,300
and I don't expect
you to talk about yours.

460
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:54,001
I just want you to know
that there was no one else.

461
00:27:56,975 --> 00:28:00,605
I missed you so much I barely
even saw my own friends.

462
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,773
I'm just so glad
it's finally over.

463
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,308
Are you okay?

464
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,856
What's happening to him?

465
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,466
Is he gonna be okay?

466
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,269
I'm gonna need to discuss
that with my colleagues.

467
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,174
We have to talk. No,

468
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,939
you need to rest.

469
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,845
I have to tell you

470
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,662
about what happened
on the break.

471
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:41,896
Later, you just
lie back and relax.

472
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,014
Stop it, Melissa.

473
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,849
Just stop telling me what I need

474
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,955
and listen for once, okay?

475
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,463
How are you feeling?

476
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,905
Embarrassed.

477
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:06,138
I'm still not sure what was
real or what I hallucinated.

478
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,479
Did you try to kiss me?

479
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,539
What about you?

480
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,046
He's stabilized for the moment.

481
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,774
Coughing up blood? That
doesn't really change anything.

482
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,655
Hemoptysis is a
symptom of Behcet's.

483
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:22,003
Except our treatment should
make him better not worse.

484
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,586
It could be doing both.

485
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,888
Our treatment breaks down his
clot in his head like it's supposed to,

486
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:30,868
except a piece broke off and traveled
to one of his arteries in his lungs.

487
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,928
If anything, we need
to increase the heparin

488
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:35,270
to prevent further
clots from forming.

489
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,684
We do that and he
starts hemorrhaging,

490
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,186
we won't be able
to stop the bleeding.

491
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,409
We don't do that, the next clot
causes a heart attack or a stroke.

492
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,675
Park's way, he at least
has a shot at living.

493
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:48,085
CT his lungs to
confirm and up the dose.

494
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,260
She's young and hot.

495
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,885
She'll bounce back.

496
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,760
82 pounds.

497
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,863
How much weight I put on when
my break ended the same way.

498
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,601
People were calling
me Park-ing-lot.

499
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,071
Mmm.

500
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,274
Almost 9:00. I think your
boy's gonna stand us up.

501
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,716
No, no. He'll be here.

502
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:23,378
He practically walked
in on us having sex.

503
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,487
God, if I saw my mother doing
that, I'd claw my own eyes out.

504
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:32,053
Of course, she was nowhere
near as attractive as you.

505
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,622
Horribly fat, as
a matter of fact.

506
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,327
Mother.

507
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,865
Guy sleeping with my mother.

508
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,866
This is Dominika. My wife.

509
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,469
It's so nice to be meeting you.

510
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,709
Gregory tells me that you
were born in Richmond, Virginia,

511
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,307
and your father was a tailor
who stole from his clients.

512
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:59,284
James has persuaded me of the value
of openness and honesty in relationships.

513
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,466
We see people with
disabilities all the time.

514
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,833
But seeing and understanding
aren't always the same thing.

515
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,020
Are you talking to me or
writing a Facebook post?

516
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,845
I'm saying we should have picked up
on the degeneration in his eyes sooner.

517
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:26,507
We ignored them because we assumed
they weren't even part of the equation.

518
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,652
I also realized, intellectually,

519
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:33,590
I may understand what it means
to be disabled, but emotionally?

520
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:34,716
I didn't have a clue.

521
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,760
Apparently, his
girlfriend didn't either.

522
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:39,331
So you're back on his side?

523
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,593
It's not a side,
it's a perspective.

524
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,397
He just wants to be treated like
an adult. Make his own decisions.

525
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,666
I may not agree
with all of them,

526
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,232
but how the hell
can I judge him?

527
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,240
I'm sure that's exactly
what disabled people want.

528
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,247
To be treated like
completely foreign entities,

529
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:59,715
incapable of being
judged and understood.

530
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,881
Park was right about the clot.

531
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,361
Hopefully, the anticoagulants
keep it from killing him.

532
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:13,129
So, she gets the
couch on the odd nights,

533
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,893
and I get the bed on evens.

534
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,299
In exchange for
a federal felony,

535
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,531
she gets a green card
and I get a live-in maid.

536
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,905
Good for you.

537
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,072
The immigration policy in
this country is a travesty.

538
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,910
It forces people to lie just
so nice people can stay here.

539
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,314
Thank you.

540
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,116
Dad.

541
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,148
I'm grateful you approve.

542
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:44,763
You should also know that
I was not in Africa last year.

543
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,854
You were in jail.

544
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,796
I've been reading the Princeton
Police blotter ever since you moved here.

545
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,776
And I'm afraid I haven't
been truthful with you either.

546
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,044
And I've wanted to tell
you this for a very long time.

547
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,110
Thomas and I...

548
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,853
We got married two months
after your father passed away.

549
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:12,923
Uh-huh.

550
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,857
You understand, we
didn't want you to think

551
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,452
we were disrespecting
the memory of your father.

552
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,861
And is there another secret
that you want to share with me?

553
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:34,077
There's nothing you think
might be relevant to my life?

554
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,238
Like what?

555
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,517
I don't know. Just
off the top of my head,

556
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,348
something like I
DNA-tested my dad

557
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,522
and found that he was
not my biological father.

558
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,222
You are.

559
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,758
That's impossible.

560
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:48,985
People lie.

561
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,585
Birthmarks don't.

562
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,996
Oh, my God!

563
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,907
You told me he was a preemie.

564
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,575
This bloody lunatic is my son?

565
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,110
He's not a lunatic.

566
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,457
All those years, you could've
told me, I could've done things.

567
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,882
I could've made a
difference in the boy's life.

568
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,761
I think we should all
just calm down and...

569
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,153
Look at him sitting there!
A pill-popping sociopath.

570
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,883
If you wanted to
screw up his life,

571
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,550
you couldn't have
done it better.

572
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,718
He's got you there, Mom.

573
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,920
He's one of the most
well-respected doctors in the world.

574
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,998
He's saved more lives
than you can count.

575
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,992
Now you apologize to him,

576
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,300
or I swear you will never
see me again, Thomas.

577
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,637
I can't deal with this anymore.

578
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,437
He's my son?

579
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,742
I'm gonna have a bloody breath
of fresh air. That's what I'm doing.

580
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,756
So, who's for dessert?

581
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,860
Somebody help me!

582
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:04,663
Will, it's Dr. Adams and Dr. Chase.
We just need to know where...

583
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,135
My eyes! My eyes!

584
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,364
Feels like it's on fire!

585
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,481
It's not Behcet's. It doesn't
necrotize tissue like this.

586
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,613
I think it's
streptococcus pyogenes.

587
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,953
Except we've already treated
him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

588
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,187
It shouldn't be spreading,
it should be dying.

589
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,389
It just means
it's drug resistant.

590
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,467
We need to remove what's left of
his eyes before gangrene sets in.

591
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:39,231
It's something that looks and
acts like a bacteria, but isn't one.

592
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,033
Could be viral. No, it couldn't.

593
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,507
No evidence of viral markers
in the necrotized tissue.

594
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,544
Let me see that image you took
last night of the clot in his lung.

595
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,160
That's not a piece of
the clot from his brain.

596
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,853
That's the point of infection.

597
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,166
Mucormycosis.

598
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,900
He breathed in the spores.

599
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:12,094
Must be growing and
spreading ever since.

600
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,899
A fungal infection
spreading this fast?

601
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,702
Kid's a diabetic. He already has
a compromised immune system.

602
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:19,745
He's right. This sample from
his eyes is crawling with it.

603
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,210
Treat him with amphotericin B.

604
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:25,745
We treated him with gentamicin
when we thought it was bacterial.

605
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,751
Which means the dose of
amphotericin B we'll need to cure him

606
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,023
will probably leave him deaf.

607
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:35,956
Sorry, stopped listening after you
said, "The dose we'll need to cure him."

608
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,904
Blind and deaf?

609
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,308
I'd rather be dead.

610
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,042
You will be.

611
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,081
I can live with that.

612
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,253
You never did get my humor.

613
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:11,127
There's a chance your hearing
won't be completely gone.

614
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,661
How much of a chance?

615
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:22,066
A small one, but a chance.

616
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,174
I'm refusing treatment.

617
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,313
You don't know how hard
things are already for me.

618
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,120
I can't handle any more.

619
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,666
I can't.

620
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,100
Oh! Hi.

621
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,311
I'm here to apologize.

622
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:05,544
I could have handled the
news with more aplomb.

623
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:09,616
I have a son.

624
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,221
That's great news!

625
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,817
What else did
she tell you to say?

626
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:17,986
You're not a lunatic,
you're not a mistake.

627
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,528
I never liked your
friend, my father.

628
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,068
He could be a bit
intense at times.

629
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,231
But unlike you,

630
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,538
I did respect him.

631
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,038
Do you respect your mother?

632
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,544
Well, we do have that in
common. And we all love her.

633
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,724
So we don't have
much choice, do we?

634
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,093
Son, see you at dinner.

635
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,242
Will, it's me.

636
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:19,090
Let me guess.

637
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:23,558
The doctor who thinks I'm an ass
wants you to convince me to live?

638
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:25,923
Yes.

639
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,728
It won't work.

640
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:34,929
I know.

641
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:37,999
So I won't.

642
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,114
Wow. You're that angry.

643
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,779
I've made enough
decisions for you.

644
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,618
This is your life.

645
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,821
Why did you come back?

646
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,656
Because I love you.

647
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:07,800
And I want to be with
you for as long as I can.

648
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,373
Melissa, I'm so scared.

649
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:16,979
Me, too.

650
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,783
I'll always love you.

651
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,492
Even if I was deaf?

652
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,854
Even if anything.

653
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:54,809
Is it working?

654
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,480
He's still very ill,

655
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,923
but if he keeps responding the
way he has been, he should be fine.

656
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,889
And his hearing?

657
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,525
It's gone.

658
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,499
We don't know yet
if it'll be permanent.

659
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:20,268
Melissa, is that you?

660
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:24,110
We've been squeezing his
hand once for yes, twice for no.

661
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,955
Can I ask you something?

662
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,251
I'll completely understand
if you squeeze no.

663
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,096
Will you marry me?

664
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,775
Don't leave me hanging now.

665
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:58,075
Yes.

666
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:01,152
Yes! Of course, yes!

667
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,043
I heard that.

668
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,754
You said yes, right?

669
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,291
You said yes.

670
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,631
How long are you gonna
wait until you tell me?

671
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:22,774
I thought we already
had the Santa Claus talk.

672
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,272
You don't think I saw you steal
Thomas' fork from the restaurant?

673
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,412
Why would I do that?

674
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,913
For his DNA.

675
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,575
That's...

676
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:33,912
That's...

677
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,652
Very observant of you.

678
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,815
See, you are more
me than you pretend.

679
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:43,686
You had to know for
sure. So you needed proof.

680
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:49,292
And the fact that you haven't
told me can only mean...

681
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:53,630
He isn't your father either.

682
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,874
I'm sorry.

683
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:07,814
You know what that means?

684
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,715
Your mom's a slut?

685
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:11,282
That.

686
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,987
And she's not as boring
as I thought she was.
