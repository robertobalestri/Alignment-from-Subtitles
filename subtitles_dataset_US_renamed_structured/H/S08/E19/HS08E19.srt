1
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,442
Three, two, one!

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,702
Ah!

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,808
Whoo!

4
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,746
What do you want to do next?

5
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,053
Uh...

6
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,212
Swings?

7
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,459
Okay. Crawl tube?

8
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,194
Nah. Nah?

9
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,464
Well, I think we're running
out of options, honey.

10
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,558
I want to go on
the merry-go-round.

11
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,263
The... Again?

12
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,899
But this time all by myself.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,868
Oh...

14
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,733
I don't know, jelly bean.

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,780
Daddy, I'm six. I'm
not a baby anymore.

16
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,211
Please?

17
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,154
Thank you.

18
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,955
You ready? Uh-huh.

19
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:00,390
All right. Come here.

20
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,756
I'll take Beary.

21
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,761
Now, you promise you're
not going to tell Mommy, right?

22
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,274
She'll kick my
butt if she finds out.

23
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,827
Pinky swear.

24
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,105
All right. Go get 'em.

25
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:21,781
Remember to hold on tight.
- I will!

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Stop the ride!

27
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,211
Emily!

28
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,152
Emily! Where are you!

29
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,553
Em?

30
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,057
Emily?

31
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,060
Emily?

32
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,728
Emily, where are you, honey?

33
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,003
Emily? Emily?

34
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,771
Honey?

35
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,113
Help me!

36
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,078
Is that our precious
little bundle of tumor?

37
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,386
They grow up so
fast, don't they?

38
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,725
How do you think? How
did you know I was here?

39
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,097
Foreman.

40
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,099
Actually, that would have
been easier. No, I followed you.

41
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,932
It didn't occur to you
that that might mean

42
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,995
I don't want you involved
in my cancer treatment.

43
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,404
I'm not here as a doctor.

44
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,466
I'm here as a towering
pillar of strength.

45
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,167
Be a pillar in the parking lot.

46
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,335
No.

47
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,006
How many times have I
told you I wanted to be alone

48
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,084
and you've made
yourself a pain in the ass?

49
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,243
I owe you.

50
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,452
My word, not a word.

51
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,523
Realizing I'm most likely
going to regret this, all right.

52
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,509
What are you doing?

53
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,981
My best friend has
cancer. Cut me some slack.

54
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,778
Also, it's spring break.

55
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,251
I'm on vacation.

56
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,817
Although looking
at you now, I can tell

57
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,156
that the wet t-shirt contest
is probably going to suck.

58
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,830
House taking time
off is a bad sign.

59
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,693
"A bad sign."

60
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,700
You think the apocalypse is coming
because House wants to be there for Wilson?

61
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,797
Yes.

62
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,807
You're new.

63
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,109
We've got a case.

64
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,643
Six-year-old with a nose bleed

65
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:21,085
and breathing problems. She
was born with a rare mutation of A-T.

66
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:24,918
Emily has a unique variant
on both of her ATM genes.

67
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,722
Her disorder mimics A-T,
but not all of the symptoms.

68
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,553
This is Dr. Elizabeth Lawson.

69
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,556
She's a developmental
geneticist attached to JHU

70
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,157
and an expert on
the girl's condition.

71
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,397
Elizabeth Lawson.

72
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,571
Emily Lawson.

73
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,075
I'm here as a
doctor, not a mother.

74
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,617
Nose bleeds and breathing
problems are common symptoms

75
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,585
of ataxia telangiectasia.

76
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,130
We could just be seeing
the natural progression of...

77
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,147
It's not. A-T patients have a
life expectancy of 20 years.

78
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,249
Emily is only six.
It's something else.

79
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:03,826
I examined her lungs two days
ago. They're functioning normally.

80
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,908
It says she fell off a
carousel. Head trauma could...

81
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,925
If the diagnosis was easy,
I wouldn't need you people.

82
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,965
I'm here because according
to Eric, you're the best.

83
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,041
We are.

84
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,006
Have you considered
Wegener's granulomatosis?

85
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,510
It's a good fit.

86
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,145
But she can't have x-rays.

87
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,686
A-T makes her hypersensitive
to ionizing radiation.

88
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,188
I'll get her prepped for an MRI.

89
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,023
She knows more about her daughter's
genetic condition than any of you.

90
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,566
She'll be an asset.

91
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,730
Or she won't, Eric.

92
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,173
This isn't a request. Use her.

93
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,671
The tumor's spread to
the surrounding tissue.

94
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,479
We're gonna have to shrink it
before we remove it surgically.

95
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,646
I'm more interested in exactly
how you plan to do that, Mike.

96
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,246
We start conservative.

97
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,325
Daily radiation
treatments for three weeks.

98
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,226
And if it doesn't shrink enough
after that, we'll add the chemo...

99
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,662
And if it hasn't shrunk
enough after that, I'm dead.

100
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,571
Look, you have over a 75% chance
that the radiation alone is enough. Relax.

101
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,247
We've caught this in time.

102
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,939
Catching it in time would have been before
it invaded the tissue around my thymus.

103
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,277
I want the radiation and
the chemo concurrently.

104
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,377
Why stress your immune
system unnecessarily?

105
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,783
Let's just go with
my plan. Okay?

106
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,446
The radiation first and... I'm
gonna get a second opinion.

107
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,216
Are you serious?

108
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,192
Look, I've seen you recommend
this exact treatment dozens of times.

109
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,592
We're done here.

110
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,527
I'll look for a doctor
with some actual balls.

111
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,675
Hey, you need to
talk to your friend.

112
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,933
He's embarrassing himself.

113
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,098
A doctor should be able
to handle his own illness

114
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,540
with a little bit more
dignity. I agree with Wilson.

115
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,237
My recommended
treatment is sound.

116
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,212
No, I meant about
the ball-less part.

117
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,942
Explains the office.

118
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,529
It was a merry-go-round.

119
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,454
She's a kid, Liz.
We were having fun.

120
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,114
You should try it sometime. Fun?

121
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,920
She's six, not you. You
know she has balance issues.

122
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,757
I know that she's...

123
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,222
This is Emily's father, Simon.

124
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,901
He was with her when
the symptoms occurred.

125
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,130
I had her all week.
She was fine.

126
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:28,238
We could come back. No need.
Patient's ready for transport.

127
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,308
Wake up, sleepy head.

128
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,911
I saw it in the gift shop. I
know how much you like them.

129
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,484
Thanks.

130
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,584
They're going to take
you for an MRI now.

131
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,495
It means "magic
really cool images."

132
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,663
I thought it stood for
magnetic resonance imaging.

133
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,262
We've spent a lot
of time in hospitals.

134
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,369
B-9.

135
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,844
Hit. And I hate you.

136
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,354
I'm done.

137
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,021
I sunk your battleship? No.

138
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,822
But I think I'm going to puke.

139
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,227
Good. Now that you're
sufficiently buzzed,

140
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,462
what was the reason behind
you freaking out on Kondo?

141
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,797
You scared? In denial?

142
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:33,636
I know you get confused any time
someone thinks that you're wrong.

143
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:37,006
But it's not considered freaking out
for a patient to ask for a second opinion.

144
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,346
Okay, well, here it
is. Kondo was right.

145
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,881
You should be in
radiology right now.

146
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,346
Well done. You've kept your
word for almost two hours.

147
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,822
Every day you wait, our pal,
Tumie, is growing larger in your chest.

148
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,090
You want to live, stop screwing
around and do something about it.

149
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,985
Good idea.

150
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:00,932
I think I'll start with spending
spring break on my own.

151
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,365
How are you feeling
in there, Emily?

152
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,603
<i>Good, I guess.</i>

153
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,237
Something wrong?

154
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,872
<i>I was only pretending
to be asleep.</i>

155
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,543
<i>You think that's dishonest?</i>

156
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,783
That's...

157
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,222
My daughters do that, too,

158
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,693
but they know that sometimes when it
seems like mommy and daddy are fighting,

159
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,697
it's really only because
they're worried about you.

160
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,397
<i>And does your wife
ever want a divorce?</i>

161
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,471
No. Everything's fine at home.

162
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,441
Hold still now. No more talking.

163
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,847
What do you think of her mother?

164
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,151
She called her
daughter "the patient."

165
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,913
If my kids were born
with an expiration date,

166
00:10:58,858 --> 00:10:59,858
I don't...

167
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Where does it hurt?

168
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,100
I want my daddy!
Where's my daddy?

169
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,214
We were able to restore
circulation to her hands and feet

170
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,114
before any permanent
damage set in.

171
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,676
Primary Raynaud's?

172
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,381
The cold inside the MRI
room could have set it off.

173
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,458
Stress can also
precipitate the condition.

174
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,423
She's shown no
evidence of cold sensitivity

175
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:35,325
and she has no problems
with MRI machines.

176
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,694
There are other kinds of stress.

177
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,962
She heard you and
your husband fighting.

178
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:45,401
Unfortunately, she's heard a lot
worse than that before. It's not stress.

179
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,667
Could be secondary Raynaud's.

180
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,285
Lupus is consistent
with Emily's symptoms.

181
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,553
Her lymph nodes aren't enlarged

182
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:54,309
and she has shown no
signs of immune activation.

183
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,377
It could be heavy
metal poisoning.

184
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,749
From what? The carousel?

185
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,201
She was only on it for a minute.

186
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,420
Simon moved into an old
apartment building three weeks ago.

187
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,593
I'm sure he has no idea
what the insulation's made of,

188
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,494
what kind of paint.

189
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,702
He's a good father, but when
it comes to Emily's health...

190
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,538
I'm gonna get his keys and
check for environmentals.

191
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,629
Lupus is a better fit.

192
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,437
I don't mean to pull rank
here, but I am her mother.

193
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,910
I thought you said you
were here as a doctor.

194
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,943
And as a doctor, I need
parental consent. See above.

195
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,708
While I'm gone, please
start her on chelation therapy.

196
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,049
She's the mother.

197
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,653
So let's treat her
like any other mother.

198
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,762
I think we just hit the
environmental mother lode.

199
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,634
Funny she never mentioned
an entire basement

200
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,403
full of dangerous
chemicals and drugs.

201
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,109
You think she'd even
let Emily down here?

202
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,607
Yeah.

203
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,513
And apparently a lot.

204
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,794
You ever heard of LEX-2?

205
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,189
I've read about it.

206
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,832
It's an experimental
aminoglycoside antibiotic.

207
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,430
Supposedly it can override
DNA errors in the ATM gene.

208
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,173
Doesn't mean she's
giving it to her daughter.

209
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,942
Anyone studying A-T
would be researching it.

210
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,442
How?

211
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,549
You see any lab rats down here?

212
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,056
The only cage I
see is right there.

213
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,695
Go away. I have a headache.

214
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,600
We don't have to have sex.

215
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,911
Sometimes it's nice
just to cuddle and talk.

216
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,942
Me first.

217
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,080
You don't want a second opinion.

218
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,210
You're already on your fifth.

219
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,687
You have Evans at
Mercy, Shaw at County,

220
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,383
Foster at Johns Hopkins.

221
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,758
Every one of them has
given you the same advice.

222
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,226
You're nuts.

223
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,955
You don't just want chemo.

224
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,258
You want a dose so high

225
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,895
there's a one-in-three
chance it will kill you outright.

226
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,032
The question is,

227
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,476
why didn't you tell me?

228
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,076
Because you knew I'd stop you.

229
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,215
Which means you've already
found someone insane enough

230
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,420
or desperate enough

231
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,321
to give you what amounts
to a death dose of chemicals.

232
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,587
But who would be that stupid?

233
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,556
I'm thinking that
the "who" is you.

234
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,085
Where exactly were you
planning on killing yourself?

235
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,284
'Cause I don't think Foreman
is going to let you do it here.

236
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,323
My place. I've been
stockpiling equipment.

237
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,989
No. No! Stop.

238
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,373
I'm still healthy,

239
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:47,175
why not go the extreme route now when
there's a better chance of surviving it?

240
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,713
Statistically,

241
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,378
this treatment has about the same
chance of killing you as the thymoma does.

242
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,213
But a hell of a lot faster.

243
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,366
Nancy Wells. Cervical
cancer, 70% survival rate.

244
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,833
Died November 6,
1998.64 years old.

245
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:20,707
Bernie Jones, melanoma,
89% survival rate.

246
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,840
October 10, 1999. He was 52.

247
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,923
John Taylor. Thyroid,

248
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,551
96% survival rate.

249
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,057
I promised him he'd be fine.

250
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,092
Eight years old.

251
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:50,068
I am not going to die slowly in a
hospital bed under fluorescent lighting

252
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,510
with people stopping by to
gawk and lie about how I look.

253
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,573
Even a small chance of that
happening is too big a chance for me.

254
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,584
You're an idiot.

255
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,490
And the odds say
you're going to die.

256
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,139
We'll do it at my place.

257
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,510
The only environmental factors we
think caused your daughter's illness

258
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,832
are the ones you
shot her full of.

259
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:37,880
I tested the drug.

260
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,256
This is what I did for
a living for 10 years.

261
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,795
She's your child,
not a guinea pig.

262
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,657
I tested it first.

263
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,730
On myself.

264
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,927
And in six months I didn't
document any adverse effects.

265
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,770
A trial of one is
basically irrelevant.

266
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,173
Respiratory infections
are common with A-T.

267
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,978
With Emily's mutation, they are
deadly and they get worse every year.

268
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,681
LEX-2 won't be approved
for at least the next five years.

269
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,486
Emily, on the other hand,
wouldn't have survived the winter.

270
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,521
What was I supposed to do?

271
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,531
There's a reason for FDA requirements.
A study at Jackson Memorial...

272
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,301
I know about Gaines' research.
He's publishing next month.

273
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,706
Was. I just spoke to him.

274
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:34,280
His team just linked the use of
LEX-2 to renal failure in mice and rats.

275
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,780
She needs an ultrasound-guided
renal biopsy to check the damage.

276
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,984
Hopefully, it's reversible.

277
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,925
To stupidity.

278
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,920
Not quite done.

279
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,057
To muscle aches, spasms.

280
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,227
To your joints feeling like
they've been ripped out

281
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,168
and replaced with
shards of broken glass.

282
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,183
Should I be writing
any of this down?

283
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,869
Your stomach fills with bile.

284
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,062
When you vomit it feels like

285
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,013
someone's forcing a white hot hammer
down your esophagus, tearing your flesh.

286
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,209
Blood's dripping down
the back of your throat,

287
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,845
choking and gagging you with the
slick, coppery taste of burnt pennies.

288
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,522
I am an oncologist, I know...

289
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,388
If you did, we
wouldn't be sitting here.

290
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,889
Day two.

291
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,523
Your white blood cells are gone,
opening up your system to attack.

292
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,088
Your temperature skyrockets.

293
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,125
One second, your
skin feels like it's on

294
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:04,295
fire, the next second,
it's entombed in ice.

295
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,202
Every pain sensor in your
body is firing at the same time

296
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,370
until agony isn't even
a word or a concept.

297
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,105
It's your only reality.

298
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,940
You hallucinate.

299
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,776
You dream of death.

300
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,141
And then the race begins.

301
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,751
Can your body claw
its way back in time

302
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:25,917
before the hostile organisms and
parasites claim you permanently?

303
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,922
Win, you live. Lose, you die.

304
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,871
Now, what are we
doing here, Wilson?

305
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,786
Kidney number one looks good,

306
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,792
which means we'll probably
take the biopsy from two.

307
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,665
Hey. You're doing great.

308
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,058
Brave as always.

309
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,462
Pretty cool, eh?

310
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,072
Wanna try?

311
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,410
What's wrong?

312
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,038
My chest hurts.

313
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,983
Definitely not her kidneys.

314
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:40,226
I promise this'll taste just as good
coming up as it did going down.

315
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,704
If things go wrong, I
just want you to know...

316
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:55,180
If you're going to say that you've
always been secretly gay for me,

317
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,807
everyone always
just kind of assumed it.

318
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,919
I just want you to know

319
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,588
that I appreciate
the risk you're taking.

320
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,885
Pumping a human being full of
lethal chemicals in your living room.

321
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:12,796
If I die, it probably won't go over
well with your probation officer.

322
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,026
That's not going to be an issue.

323
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,433
I'm glad at least
one of us is confident.

324
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,697
Not me.

325
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:23,972
I've already identified a couple of spots
to dump your body if this goes south.

326
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,103
I've always
enjoyed Trinity Park.

327
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,910
It does have a nice
access to the lake.

328
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,585
Muscle spasms already?
No. It's nothing really.

329
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:38,485
Good news.

330
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:42,151
Takes most people two
bags to get to that stage.

331
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,422
You're way ahead of schedule.

332
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,301
You'll think it's stupid.

333
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,841
That hasn't stopped you before.

334
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,609
I just always thought

335
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:04,275
when I got old or sick I'd have
a wife or kids to look after me.

336
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:10,348
And in this scenario, are
your loving wife and kids

337
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,985
holding the life-support cord

338
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,989
or are they thumbing
through your will?

339
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,930
I'm in it, right?

340
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,167
You have everything
you need right here.

341
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,831
We both do.

342
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:31,809
Painkiller,

343
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,005
industrial strength,

344
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,014
level awesome.

345
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,853
We're on vacation.

346
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,624
That is nice.

347
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,895
Her kidneys are fine.

348
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,435
I don't think we're looking at
side effects from the LEX-2.

349
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,606
She's prone to respiratory
infection. Pneumonia?

350
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,946
No persistent cough,
chills, or excess sweating.

351
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,294
What about a pulmonary embolism?

352
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,878
Fits coughing up blood,
but a clot? From what?

353
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,747
Bruising from when
she fell off the carousel.

354
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:20,223
Contusion damages a
deep vein, causes a clot.

355
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:21,954
Piece breaks off,
travels to her lungs.

356
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,053
We need to get
her on heparin now.

357
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,327
Another embolism could
cause a heart attack or a stroke.

358
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,361
What's wrong? Is it Emily?

359
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:33,395
Sort of.

360
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,636
You can't do this.

361
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,337
I'm taking her to Mercy.

362
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,221
Everything you people have
done has just made her worse.

363
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,023
You don't have the right.
We have joint custody.

364
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,459
Where was my right when you were
treating our daughter like a lab rat?

365
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,523
She'd be dead if I hadn't.

366
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,149
Stop it.

367
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,727
Your daughter
deserves better than this.

368
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,025
It's okay, sweetie.

369
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,998
Mommy and I are just
going to talk. Okay?

370
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,499
Wanna get some candy?

371
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,734
We believe Emily
has a clot in her lungs.

372
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,106
If you leave now, she could die before
her new doctors are even up to speed.

373
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,606
What, from her A-T?

374
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,946
From the fall off the carousel.

375
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,858
Now can we just stop blaming each
other and do the right thing here?

376
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,785
What, you're really
going to equate the two?

377
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:40,064
No. You were giving her two minutes
of fun. I was trying to save her life.

378
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,040
What's her best friend's name?

379
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,787
What's the name of
her favorite teacher?

380
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,771
Why did she hate that
stuffed animal you gave her?

381
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:52,574
She's been having nightmares
about penguins all month.

382
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,551
What's her blood type?

383
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,964
Rh factor? Her serum
immunoglobulin levels?

384
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,466
I don't care. Those are letters
and numbers. That's not her.

385
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:12,800
What about the variant in her E14
ATM intergenic promoter region?

386
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,742
'Cause that's what's
killing our daughter.

387
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:21,307
Unless I can find a
way to reactivate it.

388
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,683
Just make her better.

389
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,515
You don't look too good, mister.

390
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:14,699
How did you get in here?

391
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,129
The door.

392
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,830
Are you, like,
sick or something?

393
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,664
Where's House?

394
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,239
Where are your parents?

395
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:30,214
I know you.

396
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,648
You live in the building, right?

397
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,080
What's your name?
You don't remember?

398
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:40,886
House.

399
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,606
You promised me I'd go
home again, Dr. Wilson.

400
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,208
You said it wasn't my fault.

401
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,341
It wasn't, John.

402
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,252
If I didn't do nothing
wrong, why did I die?

403
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,946
I don't know.

404
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,921
I shouldn't have done this.

405
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,529
Am I dead?

406
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,977
Not yet. Not yet.

407
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,046
It just feels that way.

408
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:36,614
Are you okay?

409
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,083
Apart from the pain,
vomiting, diarrhea and cramps?

410
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,468
I worked six months in a
research lab after med school.

411
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,273
You get so focused.

412
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,640
Once I didn't eat for two days.

413
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:09,472
It's easy to forget
what actually matters.

414
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,573
I didn't.

415
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,278
Yeah, it sucks I got
her the wrong doll but...

416
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,220
Good news.

417
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,716
Emily's lungs
are clear. No clot.

418
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,388
And bad news. We still don't
know what's happening to her.

419
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:28,127
Whatever it is, there's liver
involvement. Her eyes are jaundiced.

420
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,167
Her liver is failing.

421
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,465
We found a blockage
in her hepatic vein

422
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,567
which is restricting
blood flow to her liver.

423
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:41,122
Polycythemia vera? JESSICA:
Her red blood counts are normal.

424
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,275
Could be some sort of
connective tissue disorder.

425
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,681
What if...

426
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,681
What if we're just seeing the
end result of her condition?

427
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,625
She's unique.

428
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,591
One screwed up
gene from each of us...

429
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,797
Let's stick with our process.

430
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,834
I shouldn't be here.

431
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,348
What are we missing?

432
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,144
Advanced Lyme disease?

433
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,050
Would have seen it in the
blood. He said "advanced."

434
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,165
We wouldn't pick it up in her blood if it's
in her organs and nervous system now.

435
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,533
It fits everything
but the nose bleed.

436
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:28,891
But why is it attacking
now, all at once?

437
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,519
What's changed?

438
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,788
Elizabeth has.

439
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,631
She stopped giving
Emily the LEX-2.

440
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,533
It's an aminoglycoside
antibiotic.

441
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:40,401
It's what was keeping
the Lyme in check.

442
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,032
We need to start
her on amoxicillin.

443
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,829
You lied.

444
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,430
It doesn't taste
better coming back up.

445
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:18,066
Here's another
one. You look good.

446
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,411
What's the white
blood cell count?

447
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,710
It's down to 1,000.
Still dropping.

448
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,187
I need more morphine. We're out.

449
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,431
You've been using my
personal supply of pain killers

450
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:44,730
for the last eight hours.

451
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:48,463
You have enough for both of us?

452
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,542
I've got enough stashed
around here for a minion.

453
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,486
Just remember they're a gift,

454
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,425
so it's rude to keep
throwing them up.

455
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,157
Found that out with those
candlesticks you got me.

456
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,444
We think it's Lyme.

457
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:03,038
I would have seen signs of that.

458
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,117
Not if the LEX-2 was
keeping it in check.

459
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,946
We live in the city,
we don't have pets.

460
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,386
She's never even
been in the woods.

461
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,980
Yes, I have.

462
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,484
With Daddy.

463
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,831
I should have told you, but I
know how you feel about it.

464
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,368
I grew up hunting with my dad.

465
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,960
I wanted to share it with
my daughter at least once.

466
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,632
We only took pictures.
You don't need to be mad.

467
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,937
Maybe we should step outside.
- No.

468
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,005
We can't protect
her from everything.

469
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,383
I assume you'll need a
lumbar puncture to confirm.

470
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,077
You lost a contact?

471
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,346
Going to the little boy's room.

472
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,253
They're called adult
diapers for a reason.

473
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,684
Use it. I did.

474
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,469
And if you think I'm
gonna let you change me...

475
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,052
It's okay. I'm a doctor.

476
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,426
Hey, just leave me alone!

477
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,099
It's pathetic.

478
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,901
I'm pathetic.

479
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:44,581
An oncologist with cancer. Of all
the things that could be killing me...

480
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:48,347
It's like the universe is giving
me the big middle finger.

481
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,289
The universe doesn't
care. Why me?

482
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,442
I was always telling my
patients not to torture themselves

483
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,867
because there's no answer.

484
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,062
Sound advice.

485
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,570
It's cruel advice.

486
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,632
They were just trying to make
sense of what was happening to them

487
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,740
and I'm there telling
them not to bother?

488
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:18,144
I should've spent my
life being more like you.

489
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:22,983
I should've been a manipulative,
self-centered, narcissistic ass

490
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,718
who brought misery to
everything and everyone in his life.

491
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,492
You'd still have cancer.

492
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,830
Yeah. But at least I'd
feel like I deserved it.

493
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:46,267
Do you think my parents
will get back together?

494
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,749
I don't know.

495
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,452
I'm sure they love
each other but...

496
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,283
They only fight about me.

497
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,619
That's because
they care so much.

498
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:05,496
So, maybe when I die,
they'll get back together.

499
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:15,834
Emily, what's wrong?
I can't move my arm.

500
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,841
Keep your arms up for me.

501
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,718
What's happening to
her? She's having a stroke.

502
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:40,026
Okay, your heart rate's up, BP's
tanking. White blood count's at 500.

503
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,459
We have to go to
the hospital now. No.

504
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,696
I don't have the equipment
or the meds to handle this.

505
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,295
No! Win or lose.

506
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,136
Win or lose. That was the deal.

507
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,802
That was the deal
when there was an "or."

508
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,740
You can't win this.

509
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,504
No. No.

510
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,380
I'd rather die here,

511
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,550
not in an ambulance.

512
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,251
Not in the hospital.
I can't... Please.

513
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,551
You can't do that to me.

514
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,230
House,

515
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:20,529
please promise me that
you won't do that to me.

516
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,240
Promise me.

517
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,207
Okay, I promise.

518
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:44,024
Stroke, a blockage
in her hepatic vein,

519
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,396
coughing blood, trouble
breathing and Raynaud's.

520
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,297
If we hadn't
already ruled it out,

521
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,801
it sounds like textbook
pulmonary embolism.

522
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,930
What mimics a clot, but
isn't a clot? Fungal infection?

523
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,941
Her CSF was clean. No
bacterial or fungal markers.

524
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,237
Anyone tried calling House?

525
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,455
He's not picking up. CHI: Or
returning messages or texts.

526
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,999
We're on our own here. So just
give me some theories we can use.

527
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,618
Hematologic malignancies.

528
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,382
A-T patients are more
prone to that form of cancer.

529
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:14,085
You think cancer would
present and kill her in three days?

530
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,890
Not cancer,

531
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,430
but a tumor could
act like a clot.

532
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,795
An atrial myxoma.

533
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,436
<i>A primary heart tumor.</i>

534
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,105
<i>The swinging
motion of the myxoma</i>

535
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:29,772
<i>intermittently blocked the flow
of blood through the right atrium.</i>

536
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:34,273
<i>Inflow blockage stagnated the hepatic vein,
which clotted and caused liver failure.</i>

537
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,744
<i>Outflow blockage caused the
Raynaud's phenomenon and stroke.</i>

538
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,251
<i>Pieces of the tumor broke
off and lodged in the lungs,</i>

539
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,311
<i>causing Emily's breathing
problems and the coughing blood.</i>

540
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:47,956
We'll remove the tumor surgically and
hopefully the biopsy reveals it's benign.

541
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,364
You really look like crap.

542
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,964
Been fighting a cold lately.

543
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,433
Seven to 10 days for
the swelling to go down,

544
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,205
then we rescan and
schedule the surgery.

545
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:59,662
I seem to recall I said
some things to you...

546
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,892
You talked a lot.

547
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,034
I stopped listening after you
confessed your fear of dolphins.

548
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,139
Can we just tone down the bromance
a few notches? My leg is killing me.

549
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,202
One last favor?

550
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:20,645
I'd like to actually make it
to the bathroom this time.

551
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:39,667
I thought you said you
had plenty of Vicodin.

552
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,865
Everybody lies.

553
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,672
So the way I felt, you feel
that, what? Most of the time?

554
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:52,076
It really does suck being you,
doesn't it? At least I don't have cancer.

555
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,364
The tumor was benign.

556
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,297
And we were able
to remove all of it.

557
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,927
Does this mean I'm
not sick anymore?

558
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,740
No.

559
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,566
Honey,

560
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:22,309
the tumor didn't cause
your genetic condition.

561
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,712
You're still sick.

562
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,947
But we never let that
stop us before, right?

563
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,715
So what do you want to
do when we get out of here?

564
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,260
You been to the
aquarium? It's pretty cool.

565
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,126
Can we go, Daddy? You bet.

566
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,666
Me too? Can she come with us?

567
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,170
You know Mommy never has to ask.

568
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,815
I'll see you at lunch.
