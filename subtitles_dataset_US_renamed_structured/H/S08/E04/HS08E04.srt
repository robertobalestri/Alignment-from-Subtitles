1
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,303
Nice tie.

2
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,419
Are you at least gonna
call the cops this time?

3
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,514
Oh. Then they might stop.

4
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:03,154
Just when they're
beginning to capture my eyes.

5
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,526
Come on, Dad.
Let Rodrigo do this.

6
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,862
Your arthritis is obviously...

7
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,026
I can pick up my own lawn.

8
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,499
You know, if you wanted,
you could put an end to all this.

9
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,802
Of course. There are other
ways to save the company.

10
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:18,137
I'm only moving it to China
because I'm craving egg foo yung.

11
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,992
You know, I just got off the
phone with some investors.

12
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,042
Yes, and they want
a controlling interest?

13
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,684
We get to stay
here with the people

14
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,655
who've been so
loyal to this company.

15
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,351
Everyone keeps their jobs.

16
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:36,054
It's been a family business for 120
years. There's no way I'm letting...

17
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,825
What's wrong?

18
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:48,967
Dad?

19
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,669
Dad?

20
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,922
I need you to drive
me to a doctor.

21
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,326
This would totally suck.

22
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:22,205
Patient's visited China a lot
recently. What about the JBE virus?

23
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,853
Why don't you check
his vaccination record

24
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,039
before you make
another stupid...

25
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,774
OMFG. 50% off cupcakes.

26
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,316
How sick is the patient?
'Cause this expires today.

27
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:36,517
Central serous retinopathy?
It's linked to type-A personalities.

28
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,922
Funduscopic exam was normal.

29
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,502
If you don't let
me read my email,

30
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:40,970
then I won't be able
to read the email

31
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,520
to the entire staff
from your ex-boss.

32
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,497
Thank you.

33
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,541
"Last month, I had an incident
involving another PPTH employee.

34
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,420
"Though I can't speak
to the details of the case,

35
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,345
"while my disciplinary
hearing is pending,

36
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,857
"I want you to know
that I have completed

37
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,441
"voluntary sexual
harassment training.

38
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,418
"And on a personal note, if my
actions caused anyone distress,

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,921
"I sincerely apologize."

40
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,556
You are so fired.

41
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,293
What? He apologized.

42
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,522
What? Because he
said he apologized?

43
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,963
He's saying he's sorry
that someone, namely you,

44
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,762
overreacted, namely
by punching him.

45
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,062
He grabbed my behind.

46
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,037
The word is it was a celebratory
slap after you completed

47
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,267
your first ever
AVM embolization.

48
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,070
He grabbed it, he
apologized for grabbing it,

49
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,738
and now he's taking classes
because he grabbed it.

50
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,643
The classes make
him sympathetic.

51
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,809
Which, in turn, makes his
unrepentant attacker evil.

52
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,784
Which, in turn, in turn,
makes you so fired.

53
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,585
100 bucks says
I won't get fired.

54
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,960
Oh, you don't want to bet me.

55
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,096
Oh, my...

56
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,627
You're fired.

57
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,496
Uh, the bet is...
But I thought...

58
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,607
after...

59
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,768
then... if only...

60
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,647
The bet's that I'll get
fired after my hearing.

61
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,651
I'll take that action, too, but
you're already a C-note in the hole.

62
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,176
You're late.

63
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,814
Considering I don't work
here, arguably, I'm early.

64
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,626
Pearl earrings?
Knee length dress?

65
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,204
It's not a very
shameful walk of shame.

66
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,628
I was at a job interview.

67
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,325
I hope it went terribly.

68
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:27,434
Thad Barton? We only
help rich white guys?

69
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,800
I am an equal
opportunity exploiter.

70
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,135
I only help those
who can help myself.

71
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,106
I have a department to re-fund.

72
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,642
Atropine poisoning.

73
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,868
He's moving his company to China

74
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,175
and his employees are
hanging him in effigy.

75
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,516
They could have moved
on to the real thing.

76
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,710
Pupils are normal.

77
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,980
Thyrotoxicosis?

78
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,514
Not a terrible idea.

79
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,958
I'm gonna go give
him PTU and TLC.

80
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,960
I have no idea what that
second one stands for.

81
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,328
Things don't seem small
anymore. They were...

82
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,104
I woke up from a nap

83
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:08,470
and everything went from
really small to really huge.

84
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,642
Well, then these giant balls of
medicine are not gonna work anymore.

85
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,175
The change actually
makes things simpler.

86
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,046
Your occipital lobe is acting
up, giving you a migraine.

87
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,620
But I don't have a headache.

88
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,053
Not all migraines
present that way.

89
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,923
It's called Alice in
Wonderland Syndrome.

90
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,124
Seriously? I never joke.

91
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,561
Good news is it's
treatable with medication.

92
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,691
Bad news is it can
make you very, very late

93
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,866
for very important dates.

94
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,464
I sometimes joke.

95
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:40,830
Thank you, Doctor.

96
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,485
Well, if you really
want to thank me...

97
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,069
My department's not
really a department

98
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,908
'cause my boss says he
doesn't have the money,

99
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,812
which provides a
nice contrast with you.

100
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,396
We're trying to find
money in our budget

101
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,651
so we don't have to move
our operations overseas.

102
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,085
I get it. Answer's no.
Shouldn't have said anything.

103
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,027
I'm just glad that the symptoms
showed up before you left for China.

104
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,575
'Cause I'm not sure
the doctors over there

105
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,364
would be so
optimistic considering...

106
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,540
What are you guys talking about?

107
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,703
Oh, just how different
the two cultures are.

108
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,244
For example, our
opinions on mental illness.

109
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,351
'Cause here, it's considered
a normal, treatable condition.

110
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,192
Is everything okay?

111
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,389
Everything's fine.

112
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,733
I could have you
checked into a facility

113
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,931
that exclusively
treats mental disorder.

114
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,700
How's that sound?

115
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,686
Whatever's gonna get him better.

116
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,339
Let's try the medication first.

117
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,446
You're hired.

118
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,591
You guys are gonna love
Doctors Chase and Taub.

119
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,563
Keep your Nazi sentiments
quiet around the little one.

120
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,427
You got the money? How?

121
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,228
Patient's a smart businessman.

122
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,066
But he's destroying
thousands of jobs.

123
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,971
Jobs are not being destroyed.
They're being relocated.

124
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,099
The fact that you see
that as inherently bad

125
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,474
means you're an
irrational patriot.

126
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,580
To put it another
way, a patriot.

127
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,444
Patriotism is natural.

128
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,608
We've always relied on
our tribes to keep us safe.

129
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,012
It's helpful for
society if its members

130
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,578
have positive feelings
about that society.

131
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,090
Iranian women? Drag
queens in Uganda?

132
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,125
Patriotism is nothing
but loyalty to real estate.

133
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,787
Real estate that's been conquered
800 times by 800 different regimes

134
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,161
with 800 different cultures.

135
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,130
But each time,
it's just the best.

136
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,071
I claim this burger in the name
of Queen Isabella of Spain.

137
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,172
I'll go check on the patient.

138
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,438
I have hepatitis C.

139
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,249
She got it from me.

140
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,556
Hey, how's my dad doing?

141
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,924
Great. His vision's
back to normal

142
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,163
and if he remains
asymptomatic through the night,

143
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,780
we'll be able to release
him in the morning.

144
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,568
Any chance that could
happen before 9:00?

145
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,885
Our stock dropped a couple points
today with the news that he's sick.

146
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,429
I would love for him to get out
of here before the market opens.

147
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,641
No offense, but I think it's
terrible your dad's closing down

148
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,812
all your American operations.

149
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,491
I don't think he's moving
the company out of greed.

150
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,254
He's moving it out of grief.

151
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,498
My mom, she died
four months ago.

152
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,633
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

153
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,993
and it's been hard for him.

154
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,402
Living in their house,
driving down the same streets.

155
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,634
I mean, he's constantly
reminded of her.

156
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,069
Dad?

157
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,557
I need an
intubation kit in here.

158
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,605
What's going on?

159
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,845
Angiography showed a
hemorrhagic site in the left lower lobe.

160
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,016
I think it could be
hyperviscosity syndrome.

161
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:23,195
Are you sure Foreman's
okay with us being in his office?

162
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,821
He's never gonna know.

163
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,434
He's actually in here right now.

164
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,435
Blood count and
protein count are normal.

165
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,370
I think it could be
hyperviscosity syndrome.

166
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,801
Sorry, but after Park
sent out her hospital-wide

167
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,843
non-apology
apology this morning,

168
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,583
I assume that plagiarism
is the new black.

169
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,204
If it makes Andrews
look sympathetic...

170
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,475
Copying him makes
you look pathetic.

171
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,479
And I will pay you not to go
to anger management classes.

172
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,646
What about another
clotting problem?

173
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,283
Factor V Leiden deficiency.

174
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,379
It's possible.

175
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,986
Adams is the one who
needs to deal with her anger.

176
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,684
Myelodysplastic syndrome.

177
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,195
I heard about your conversation
with the patient's daughter.

178
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,322
You were hostile.

179
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,391
Well, their company is making a
decision I strongly disagree with.

180
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,266
Yet you were never
anything but courteous

181
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,703
to the racists and
rapists in prison.

182
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,400
Those guys made
decisions you supported?

183
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,703
Myelodysplastic syndrome.

184
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,319
I'm guessing it has
something to do with

185
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,437
the funeral you attended
yesterday morning.

186
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,877
I was at a job interview.

187
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,882
You got to work at 9:15.

188
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,229
Closest hospital with an opening

189
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,149
in your specialty
is 45 minutes away.

190
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,312
It's not possible.
My condolences.

191
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,389
I wasn't at a funeral.

192
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:29,126
Well, that just leaves
everywhere but a job interview.

193
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,458
Get out.

194
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,059
Who goes there? Reveal yourself.

195
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,392
Now.

196
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,062
Well, we would, but
orthopedics is still

197
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,936
squatting in two
thirds of my office.

198
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:44,271
Which is weird because you
got a large check last night.

199
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,941
From a corporation that's going
through a very public belt-tightening,

200
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,277
means this donation
was given under duress.

201
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,871
Patient didn't tell
me the whole story,

202
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,619
but he did say he'd be
thrilled if we didn't cash this.

203
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,928
Got a policy review meeting in
here in five minutes. Goodbye.

204
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,095
What are you doing?

205
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,300
Holding your ass.

206
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,437
You really didn't know? House...

207
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,829
I was trying to
help you out here.

208
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,637
I figured for sure he'd
punch me in the face,

209
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,773
thus proving it's a
natural response.

210
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,048
My God, you have
superhuman discipline.

211
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,512
And glutes.

212
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,284
Get your hands off me.

213
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,654
Sorry.

214
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,458
Go.

215
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,528
Why did you do that?

216
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,233
We have a bet.

217
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,175
But he's the chair of the
disciplinary committee.

218
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,710
Forget about the bet.

219
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,837
You two really need to
do your homework on me.

220
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,849
Treat the patient with
activated protein C.

221
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,613
If he has myelodysplastic
syndrome, he'll bleed out.

222
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,383
And if he has Factor V Leiden
deficiency, he'll throw another clot.

223
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,524
Exactly. It's a conclusive test.

224
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,588
There's no actual risk.

225
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,214
As long as you're
both paying attention

226
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,927
and are both good
enough to work here.

227
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,062
I hear one of you
thinks I'm a real bastard.

228
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,297
I guess that would be me.

229
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,875
Your boss uses blackmail and
you question my professional ethics?

230
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,371
Will you be instituting worker safety
regulations in your new factories?

231
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,542
Oh, absolutely.

232
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:31,927
What about juice
boxes in the break room

233
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,317
for the children
you'll be hiring?

234
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,116
Charges of child exploitation
against American companies

235
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,952
have been blown
way out of proportion.

236
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:42,893
My 10-year-old cousin lives near
Cebu City, works at an American factory.

237
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,587
I am so sorry.

238
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,288
It's the best thing for him.

239
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,165
It sucks, but the Filipino
factories suck worse.

240
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,171
And the schools would
suck if they existed.

241
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,737
So this is the
family's best hope.

242
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,337
Are you okay?

243
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,004
Is it supposed
to itch like this?

244
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,515
Itching. Interesting.

245
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,782
Not interesting.
Already went away.

246
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,582
Doubly interesting.

247
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,257
Means we have to explain
the arrival and the departure.

248
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,822
Ooh!

249
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,650
That's real mature,
House. What do you mean?

250
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,692
It's outlandishly childish.
I custom built this puppy.

251
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,498
It's got 106 LED's,

252
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,468
each one sending
light to your eye

253
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,405
at a slightly
different wavelength.

254
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,508
Turn that off.

255
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,986
The different
wavelengths are stimulating

256
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,740
your autonomic nervous system.

257
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,811
It's making you feel like you're
on a boat in choppy waters.

258
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,485
Oh, cool.

259
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,652
You think I'm not...

260
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,521
You think I'm not gonna
go to Foreman with this?

261
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,089
You will and I'll deny it.

262
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,066
He'll believe you,
but then these two

263
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,537
believe that the policy of protecting
American jobs starts at home,

264
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,870
so they'll never
testify against me.

265
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,576
And you won't be
able to prove anything.

266
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,379
Now, if I punched him in
the face, that he could prove.

267
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,393
I remember you saying something

268
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,852
about how loyalty to
real estate was stupid.

269
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,752
This is about reclaiming
stolen property.

270
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,188
Loyalty to real estate is
stupid because loyalty is stupid.

271
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,559
First patriotism, now loyalty.

272
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,858
You hate ice cream, too?

273
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,459
French vanilla, yeah.

274
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,601
To willfully identify
yourself with something else

275
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,398
is a perversion
of self-expression.

276
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,700
I had a thought.

277
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,866
Other than the fact
that loyalty is the basis

278
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,773
of all meaningful relationships.

279
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,912
The daughter said that her mother
died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

280
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,976
What if she was misdiagnosed?

281
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,249
Dutch chocolate's not
bad. Gotta give them that.

282
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,154
Her lymphoma could have
been caused by a virus, HTLV-1,

283
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,658
which our patient contracted
through having sex with his wife.

284
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,730
In other words, loyalty
gave him cancer.

285
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,429
I like it. Start
him on radiation.

286
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,099
Chang and Eng Bunker, the most
famous conjoined twins in history.

287
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,073
2011 is the
bicentennial of their birth.

288
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,875
The best Halloween costumes are
always the ones that need an explanation.

289
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,505
What took you so long?

290
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,179
We already lost one of them.

291
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,718
You need help
with the lacerations?

292
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,062
No. I think I've got palliative.

293
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,366
Why don't you take preventative?

294
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,418
Prevent what? He got in a fight.

295
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:27,091
Which he started, which means
he's both irascible and stupid.

296
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,525
I told the drunk,
racist frat guy

297
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,029
the proper term is "conjoined
twin", not "Siamese".

298
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,527
Well, I can't comment
on the drunk or the frat,

299
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,728
but Chang and Eng
were both, in fact,

300
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,103
born in Siam and they
were, in fact, twins.

301
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,400
If your name was Richard, it'd
be okay for me to call you a dick.

302
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,254
I thought maybe
some of the tripe

303
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,746
you learnt in anger
management class

304
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,111
could help keep this guy
out of here the next time.

305
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:54,017
Sometimes, it's incredibly satisfying
to wind up and punch someone

306
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,110
who really deserves it,

307
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,865
but when you think
about the consequences...

308
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,050
Okay, let's go.

309
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,191
I thought you wanted me
to help him with his anger.

310
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,922
No. I got everything I need.

311
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,558
"Sometimes, it's incredibly
satisfying to wind up

312
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,623
"and punch someone
who deserves it."

313
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,927
Wonder what the committee's
gonna make of that.

314
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:19,538
<i>This is a waste of time. There's
no way that Robin gave me an STD.</i>

315
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:26,210
I know this is hard and I
am sorry about your wife.

316
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,182
If you'd like to talk to someone

317
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,416
we do have grief
counselors at the hospital.

318
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,717
<i>You sound like my daughter.</i>

319
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,426
<i>I miss my wife, but it's not
driving my decision making.</i>

320
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,732
You were CEO since 1988.

321
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,167
You decided to move your
company right after your wife died.

322
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,067
<i>Stands to reason that
your emotions factored in.</i>

323
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,602
My wife...

324
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,776
is the only thing
that keeps me here.

325
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,909
<i>I visit her grave once a week.</i>

326
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,155
So your daughter was wrong.

327
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,392
You just really
need a lot of money.

328
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,661
<i>You ever hear of Kongo Gumi?</i>

329
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,802
A construction company in
Japan, founded in the year 578,

330
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,999
family owned and operated,

331
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,000
building Buddhist
temples for 50 generations.

332
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,043
Went bankrupt five years ago.

333
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,847
You have any idea how
that last CEO must have felt?

334
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:41,016
<i>I'm sorry. I have to move.</i>

335
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,740
Your heart rate is speeding up.

336
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,145
Do you feel any
tightness in your chest?

337
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,229
Yes. I figured it was
from the radiation.

338
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,166
I think you're
having a heart attack.

339
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,678
Come in.

340
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,415
Dr. Wilson, I need your advice.

341
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,941
Um...

342
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,250
I bet House $100
that I wouldn't get fired

343
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,291
after my disciplinary hearing.

344
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,689
Ever since then,
he's been acting like

345
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,955
he's actually trying
to get me fired.

346
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,855
That's because he is
actually trying to get you fired.

347
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:20,723
Does he hate me?

348
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,598
Not sure that's
relevant to the equation.

349
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,728
So it's really over $100?

350
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,567
Not sure the amount is relevant.
He's fighting for his honor.

351
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,237
He'll ruin my career.

352
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,367
Not sure that's...

353
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:34,139
What if I bet him
$200 I will get fired?

354
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,774
He sees competing bets with the
same person as a disgrace to the game.

355
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,148
He'll be even more
motivated to beat you.

356
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,481
If you were me,
what would you do?

357
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,525
You have to give him something
he values more than honor.

358
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,091
And you should
update your resume.

359
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,777
EKG and troponins
were equivocal.

360
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,837
It's not even
clear if our patient

361
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,882
just had a heart
attack or what it was.

362
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,474
Let's look at segmental
wall motion abnormalities.

363
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,784
Get him an echo to confirm.
And I need $200,000.

364
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,889
His company's lost one third of
its value since he was admitted.

365
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,155
And you want to do
some insider trading?

366
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,526
I take it felonies aren't a
violation of your parole?

367
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:30,034
It's not insider trading. Just
betting on myself to solve the case.

368
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:33,300
Once we cure him, share
price goes up, I pay you back.

369
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,396
No.

370
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,908
No, you don't say "no",
you make a counteroffer.

371
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,179
I'm not loaning my boss money.

372
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,848
Fine. I'll make a
counter. $100,000?

373
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,075
$20,000?

374
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,014
I'll buy options instead of
shares. More risk, but more upside.

375
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,522
But that's as low
as I'm gonna go.

376
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,121
I could do $5,000.

377
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,489
Really? No backsies.

378
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,690
If you double your clinic hours.

379
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,265
Six a week.

380
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,659
I've seen how you
disrespect those patients.

381
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,000
So you want twice as many
of them to be disrespected?

382
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:08,872
Spend more hours with them,
you'll treat them more humanely.

383
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,212
And this time, a land war in
Russia will be a good idea.

384
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,540
Deal?

385
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,876
Here's what I'm thinking.
You went to a parole hearing

386
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,081
where one of your old
patients was denied.

387
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,689
Hence the attire,
hence the tardiness,

388
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:28,057
and most important,
hence the anger.

389
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,362
You think you can
restore the cosmic balance

390
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,295
by doing extra good here.

391
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,162
More annoyingly
by having me do it.

392
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,360
And deal.

393
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,389
Of course, you
know this means war.

394
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,329
Oh, I know.

395
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,503
I mean, you'll escalate
and then I'll retaliate,

396
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:12,969
and the cycle will continue

397
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,700
until we've both gone too far.

398
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:21,145
At which point, I'll maybe get
suspended and you'll go back to prison.

399
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,378
Happy pranking.

400
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,859
Patient had V-Tack in the
echo lab, so we cathed him,

401
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,364
but coronary
arteries were clean.

402
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:43,061
If the plumbing's fine,
check the electrical. EP study.

403
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:47,596
Nice idea. Even
has a metaphor in it.

404
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:51,601
Not worth more than my
honor, but delightful all the same.

405
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,946
I'm not going to lose.

406
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:59,051
My college roommate is the
editor of the <i>Yale Law Review.</i>

407
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,352
She's writing my
opening statement.

408
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,514
Well, then you'll be
eloquent in your loss.

409
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,690
This case boils down
to, "He said, she said."

410
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:08,091
He said, "I've been working
at this hospital for 15 years

411
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,738
"and I am taking
self-improvement classes."

412
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,993
She said, "I've been
a fellow for two months

413
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,225
"and I'm kind of weird."

414
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,925
No, he said, "I'm a drunk idiot

415
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,559
"who thinks he can
grab girls' behinds

416
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,898
"without ramifications."

417
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,033
Wait, he was drunk?
In the hospital?

418
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,334
I already told Foreman
he'd been drinking that night.

419
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:26,277
Andrews was taking sexual
harassment classes, not AA.

420
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,948
That means he didn't
get in trouble for drinking.

421
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,280
Which means that
Foreman signed off on it,

422
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,412
which means that he set
all the wheels in motion.

423
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:42,625
Forget that. Wild speculation.
Go do the EP study.

424
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,562
You already knew Andrews
was drinking that night, didn't you?

425
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:54,596
Yes.

426
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,137
I think you should
cancel my hearing.

427
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,539
I hope this isn't going
where I assume it's going.

428
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,277
You're the one who
brought Andrews in.

429
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,581
You set the wheels in motion.

430
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,623
We had a patient who was going
to die without an AVM embolization.

431
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,329
Andrews was the only
neurologist I could reach.

432
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,777
He told me he had a few glasses
of wine and that he shouldn't do it,

433
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,293
but he also said
that you were good,

434
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:28,766
and you were ready to do one
as long as you were supervised.

435
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,400
So we agreed that
he would come in,

436
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,001
but wouldn't touch the patient.

437
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,410
I can understand
the rationalization.

438
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,846
We'll see if the board agrees

439
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,441
when I tell them the
whole story at my hearing.

440
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,444
I already did.

441
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,323
I had a closed session
hearing last week.

442
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,084
The board decided to
dock me two weeks' pay.

443
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,954
Oh.

444
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:58,436
You've been working for House
for two weeks, it's already too long.

445
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,345
No sign of any electrical
abnormalities in the right atrium.

446
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,074
I'm so dead.

447
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,640
I think House set me up.

448
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:16,688
Have you sent the committee
a character reference for me?

449
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,254
I thought you don't like favors.

450
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,053
I don't like gifts. It
wouldn't be a gift,

451
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,787
it'd just be you
telling the truth.

452
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,754
I hardly know you.

453
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,796
02 sat is 89. Did we
perforate? Is he tamponading?

454
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,269
Heart rate's only 90
and neck veins are flat.

455
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,136
Then why isn't he saturating?

456
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,274
Seems healthy to me.

457
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,816
Let's release him.

458
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:49,845
My option to sell Barton
Foods at $34 is about to expire

459
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,666
'cause I thought the patient
would be better by now.

460
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,286
Instead, I am going
to lose $20,000.

461
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,522
Twenty?

462
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,292
Your five plus the
five I stole from Wilson

463
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,334
plus the 10 I got on margin.

464
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,440
You're gonna have to talk
to my bankruptcy attorney.

465
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:08,503
Unless... There is a way that
you can get your money back.

466
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,469
Give me the full $200,000.

467
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:16,707
And extrapolating. Tomorrow,
you'll owe just shy of a million dollars.

468
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,375
It's your own fault. You forced
me to go with the options.

469
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:23,047
Your damn anger issues
are screwing with my finances.

470
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,321
Regular stock this
time, nice and safe.

471
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:26,550
I'm not angry.

472
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,069
I don't know if you're trying
to make me angry, but...

473
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,688
You refuse to bet on yourself.
That means low self-esteem.

474
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,991
So if I give you $200,000,
I'll feel smart and pretty?

475
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,728
Low self-esteem
can be brought on

476
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,895
by exposure to one's relatives.

477
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:42,174
Nice clothes and anger, classic
symptoms of a family gathering.

478
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,372
You were late the other day

479
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,876
'cause you were having breakfast

480
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,277
with Grammy Adams or Cousin Itt.

481
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,849
She was nagging you
about finding a husband.

482
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,544
All right. This is
getting annoying.

483
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,519
I'll just tell you what
I was... Uh-uh-uh-uh!

484
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,187
No spoilers. They
ruin everything.

485
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,953
Pulmonology was that way.

486
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,120
Our patient's lung problem
is not a lung problem.

487
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:06,255
It's a brain problem. We're
consulting with neurology.

488
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:07,991
That's my old boss.

489
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,092
You don't actually
think this is neurological.

490
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,226
I don't know what it is.

491
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,404
But maybe I should just
accept the patient's death

492
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,169
if getting help would
lead to awkwardness.

493
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:24,580
Dr. Andrews, my associates,
Doctors Adams and Park.

494
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:29,511
Ah.

495
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,523
Nice to meet you, Dr. Adams.

496
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,692
Hello, Dr. Park.

497
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,553
You two know each other?

498
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,462
It's a small world.

499
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,629
Dr. Park, maybe you'd like to
update our esteemed colleague

500
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,898
on the condition of our patient?

501
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:55,044
Micropsia, bleeding, tachycardia
and difficulty breathing.

502
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,281
Cute butt, huh?

503
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,079
Can we go now?

504
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:05,249
What, you really want to
turn your back on this guy?

505
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,756
Sorry. Carry on.

506
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,818
Uh...

507
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:12,262
Well, it sounds like there
could be spinal cord involvement.

508
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,631
Have you considered normal
pressure hydrocephalus?

509
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:21,167
Okay. Normal pressure
hydrocephalus going once.

510
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:22,993
Normal pressure
hydrocephalus going twice...

511
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,771
It's not his spinal cord,

512
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,506
it's the wiring between
his heart and his brain.

513
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,479
Autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

514
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:33,183
We do a tilt table test, see
how his heart rate responds.

515
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:34,579
That'll confirm.

516
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,951
Well, if he has normal
pressure hydrocephalus,

517
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,820
a tilt table test could
put him in a coma.

518
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,018
Then it's a good
thing he has ADS.

519
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,028
You really believe
in this diagnosis?

520
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,674
Because if this is
just a pissing contest,

521
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,530
you're at a severe
anatomical disadvantage.

522
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,865
It's autonomic
dysregulation syndrome.

523
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,996
No, it's normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

524
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,098
Do a spinal fluid
test to confirm.

525
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,839
We're doing the tilt table.

526
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,107
That makes sense.

527
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,149
You'd rather have House
fire you than Foreman.

528
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:06,117
This bet's gotta be a test, see
if I can handle working with him.

529
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,417
I need to prove I have the
confidence to disobey him.

530
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,857
Do you have any medical
justification for your diagnosis?

531
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,621
The symptoms fit
and Andrews is a hack.

532
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,691
Do you think I'm right?

533
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,434
Let's go. No.

534
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,499
You need to go
prepare for your hearing.

535
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,150
Fifteen more
minutes, Mr. Barton.

536
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,643
A skin resurfacing
laser is missing.

537
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:43,981
And why are you
asking me about it?

538
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,285
Because you work for House.

539
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,123
What would House want
with a skin resurfacing laser?

540
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,219
I have no idea.
Have you seen it?

541
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:51,961
My feet feel hot.

542
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,556
That's completely normal.

543
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,594
No. But House has
been talking about how

544
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,796
badly he wants to
remove those prison tats.

545
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,807
It's a very expensive
machine and I'd like it back.

546
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,809
Please tell me if
you hear anything.

547
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,737
How expensive?

548
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,141
$200,000.

549
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:13,675
He took it.

550
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,412
I have no idea.

551
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,887
Park's hearing's about to start.

552
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,658
You're covering for him. I
did the same thing many times.

553
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,952
My advice to you,

554
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,622
figure out what line you
aren't willing to cross for him.

555
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,029
Because, eventually,
he'll ask you to cross it.

556
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,265
How are your feet?

557
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,672
Mr. Barton?

558
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,183
Can you hear me, Mr. Barton?

559
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,278
Oh, no.

560
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,252
We have convened the
Disciplinary Committee

561
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,659
to decide the appropriate action

562
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,561
that should be taken
against Dr. Chi Park

563
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,363
as a result of her actions
on October 7th of this year.

564
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,427
Dr. Park, do you have
an opening statement?

565
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,870
Dr. Foreman, members
of the committee,

566
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:12,172
thank you for giving me this
opportunity to speak to you today. I...

567
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:16,079
Good news. You can cancel the
hearing, because I'm firing her myself.

568
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,221
She's not yours to fire...

569
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,309
Then you guys better
fire her for insubordination.

570
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,410
She went rogue and my
patient is now in a coma.

571
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,597
I'm the one who did the test...

572
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:23,748
No. It was my idea.

573
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,881
Seriously, House?

574
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,996
At least I'm smart enough
to know what I don't know.

575
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,460
She went out of her way
to defy me, she needs...

576
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,757
Damn it, she... Just fire her!

577
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,354
My apologies.

578
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,727
My apologies, Dr. Park.

579
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,435
Dr. House's comments
will, of course,

580
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,234
have no bearing on this hearing.

581
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:44,132
Please continue.

582
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,708
I, uh...

583
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,346
I can't believe you did that.

584
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,211
Right back at you.

585
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,918
Our patient's dying.
We need theories.

586
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,081
It's gotta be normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

587
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,624
Andrews predicted the coma.

588
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,391
Yeah, but even a broken
doctor is right twice a day.

589
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,589
The patient wasn't
wet, wabbly or wacky.

590
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,131
The coma had to
be a lucky guess.

591
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,292
If you didn't
think he was right,

592
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,597
then why did you want us
to collect his spinal fluid?

593
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,934
I didn't. I wanted you
to do a tilt table test.

594
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,098
You have a wonderful
way of communicating.

595
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,870
I knew Park wanted
to do a tilt table.

596
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:21,311
If she listens to me, I waste
an hour, if she defies me,

597
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,448
then I get the test I
want and my 100 bucks.

598
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,812
Up high.

599
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,579
You're an ass.

600
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,077
You're angry.

601
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,083
Yes. Now I'm angry.

602
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,289
Let's run the test for normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

603
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:35,617
No.

604
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,092
What else would
explain our symptoms

605
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,723
and make our patient go
into a coma during that test?

606
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,562
What about hepatic
encephalopathy?

607
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,434
No. We already tested his
liver enzymes. They're normal.

608
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,506
Or his liver's so far gone, it
can't even produce enzymes.

609
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,141
That's desperate.

610
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,978
It fits the symptoms.

611
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,011
And Andrews is a hack.

612
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,181
Go biopsy to confirm, unless
you want your own hearing.

613
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,782
You'd have to hire me first.

614
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,052
So you do realize
that it is unacceptable

615
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,721
to hit someone
in the work place?

616
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,289
Yes. Completely unacceptable.

617
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,061
I wasn't thinking. I guess...

618
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,263
I mean, I guess,
technically, I was thinking.

619
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,765
It happened so
fast, I didn't... I...

620
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:26,601
It's like...

621
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:32,214
It's like it wasn't even me. I
would never do something like that.

622
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,949
Even though I did.

623
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,016
I'm sorry I'm not making
any sense right now.

624
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:45,327
I don't know. I just really
love being a doctor so much,

625
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:49,732
and I barely even
have $100 and...

626
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,565
Please don't fire me.

627
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,006
Is this theory more
promising than the others?

628
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,781
We'll know in a few hours.

629
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,678
How are you holding up?

630
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,783
Other than the fact
that my dad's in a coma,

631
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,716
terrible.

632
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,228
Tomorrow morning, I am
supposed to sign a piece of paper

633
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,629
that will move the company

634
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,759
and cost thousands
of employees their jobs.

635
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,716
I thought you'd rather
see the company

636
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,602
go under in New Jersey
than thrive in China.

637
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,409
It's what my dad wants,
and it's still his company.

638
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,639
I'm really just
keeping the seat warm.

639
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:38,244
But unless he wakes
up before tomorrow,

640
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,616
it's gonna be my signature
on that piece of paper.

641
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,292
You don't have to sign it.

642
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,798
I'll let you know when
we have the results.

643
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,423
Biopsy was clean.
It's not his liver.

644
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,283
I also ran the
spinal fluid test,

645
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,020
and you were right that
Andrews was wrong.

646
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,757
His ICP was not
normal, it was elevated.

647
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,424
What about HTLV?

648
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,134
We ruled that out
three days ago.

649
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,708
Because of his
heart problems. But...

650
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,363
Once something gets
taken off the board,

651
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,391
I'm the only one who's
allowed to put it back on.

652
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:42,978
You owe me 106,804 won.

653
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,383
Or $100 US.

654
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,049
God, but you're petty.

655
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,684
Okay. So, two options.

656
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,851
Either we figure out
what's wrong with this guy,

657
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,691
or we figure out how to make this
company profitable in New Jersey.

658
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,287
Eastern equine encephalitis?

659
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,828
Thinking in here.

660
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,630
Brain scans indicate it
could be Loa loa disease.

661
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,073
Shut it off!

662
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,986
Apparently we're
allowed to do this now.

663
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,923
Get out of here, House.

664
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,360
Start the patient
on plasmapheresis.

665
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,873
He'll wake up in an hour.

666
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:47,371
It's been a pleasure having
you in the neighborhood.

667
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:03,255
This diagnosis was
brought to you by the letter Y.

668
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,796
Dad! God, you're okay.

669
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:08,256
I'm thirsty.

670
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,298
It's a side effect of not dying.

671
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,574
Turns out your blood was
getting thick and syrupy

672
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,440
from complexes of large
Y-shaped antibodies.

673
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,571
<i>They were clogging
up your blood vessels,</i>

674
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,275
<i>causing your organs to
shut down, one by one.</i>

675
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,648
<i>Usually, with
hyperviscosity syndrome,</i>

676
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,482
<i>it's caused by an
elevated blood count</i>

677
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,987
<i>or protein count,
but yours eluded us</i>

678
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,433
<i>because it was
caused by antibodies</i>

679
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:33,982
<i>from your rheumatoid arthritis.</i>

680
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,788
<i>Now that they're
being filtered out,</i>

681
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:40,422
your blood will be a little less duck
sauce, and a little more soy sauce.

682
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,832
So I'm gonna be
completely cured?

683
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,868
It's not all about you.

684
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:51,140
Your stock price will be
completely cured once you sign this.

685
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,175
It's a press release.

686
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:55,770
It says that you're healthy,
you're going back to work,

687
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,459
and you're signing the lease that
officially moves the company to China.

688
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:02,045
He just woke up. Dad, you don't
have to deal with this right now.

689
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:06,515
Actually, he does. Because
the market opens at 9:00 a.m.

690
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,017
And this means a lot to me.

691
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,193
You may remember me
from the time I saved your life.

692
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,996
If you move it,
it'll be without me.

693
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,876
I know you object, I
know you disagree...

694
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,171
Dad. I can't do it.

695
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,845
If this is really about
family, you will not do this.

696
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,262
Morning.

697
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,375
I got lucky this time.

698
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,537
No, you didn't.

699
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,707
I made this bet so you'd
stop actively trying to fire Park,

700
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,048
so you'd be neutral. You went
out of your way to help her.

701
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,816
She obviously earned your
respect, passed whatever test you...

702
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,117
I sabotaged her hearing.

703
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,087
You do read the
school paper, don't you?

704
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,423
If you had sabotaged
her hearing,

705
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,405
she would have gotten
more than a slap on the wrist.

706
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,398
What you actually did
was make her emotional,

707
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,242
and make the board
members see her as a victim.

708
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,791
Because the
panel feels badly for

709
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:58,996
incompetent doctors
who nearly kill people.

710
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,943
You know that everyone
on that panel hates you.

711
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,050
You know the minute you
recommend firing anyone,

712
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,169
they start discussing how
big a bonus to give them.

713
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,744
That's just hurtful.

714
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,343
Fact is, winning $100 from
you gives me more pleasure

715
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,815
than winning $100 from her.

716
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:16,316
Here's your 5 grand.

717
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,352
What 5 grand?

718
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,819
Just take it. Trust me.

719
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,793
I found her
sleeping in the park.

720
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,031
Says she ran away because
her daddy didn't love her.

721
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:39,337
And that is exactly what
happened as far as you can prove.

722
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,480
Congratulations. You're
not going to jail. Today.

723
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,741
But you do know I
just can't let this slide.

724
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,819
Well, you need to
keep up your rep.

725
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:50,686
Fine, clinic hours.
I'll double them.

726
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,017
Okay. Twelve hours a week.

727
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,661
No. Three times two equals six.

728
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,596
And three times two
times two is twelve.

729
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,163
I know about your
deal with Adams.

730
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,330
Call Chase and Taub.

731
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:13,500
Get them in here.
The boys are back.

732
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,713
This check is for
significantly more

733
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,995
than what I told you it would
take to fund the department.

734
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,351
I know.

735
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,528
You paged me?

736
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,415
Congratulations.

737
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,720
You caught your boyfriend
cheating that morning.

738
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,997
You had a big fight,
that's why you were late.

739
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,601
You re-pitched an STD.

740
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:12,947
You haven't gone two
consecutive minutes

741
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,337
without using
the word "loyalty",

742
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,098
which explains the
anger and low self-esteem.

743
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,076
And the desire to feel pretty

744
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,510
after having been rejected
explains the clothes.

745
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,177
It wasn't my boyfriend.

746
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,412
It was my husband.

747
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,315
I was at my lawyer's office
signing the divorce papers.

748
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,053
Wow.

749
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,993
I missed the fact
that you were married.

750
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,057
We've been separated
for almost a year.

751
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,134
So... Old news?

752
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,201
No anger left?

753
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,884
It's all bought and paid for.
