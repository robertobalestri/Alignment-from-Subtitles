1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,770
You have to lift up the
sign so he can see it.

2
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,105
Evan.

3
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,607
Hey, buddy.

4
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,299
Aren't you excited
to see Uncle Brant?

5
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,354
No.

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,855
No?

7
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,152
I think you are.

8
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,852
I think something else
is making you upset.

9
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,194
You know I'm leaving soon.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,795
And it's okay to
be upset about that.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,495
But, hey, do you
remember what I told you

12
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,562
when we were watching
wrestling on Saturday night?

13
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,033
Yeah.

14
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,117
That you and Uncle Brant
are like the Reaper Brothers.

15
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,302
That's right.

16
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,942
And Uncle Brant has been
in the ring a whole year.

17
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:48,107
Now it's time for
Daddy to tag in.

18
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,481
And while I'm away, I need
you in your uncle's corner,

19
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,483
making sure he keeps
you and your mom safe.

20
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,990
Can you help me with that?

21
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,317
Good.

22
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,885
Now let's get
ready with that sign.

23
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,793
Now.

24
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,509
Okay.

25
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,850
Brant, what happened?

26
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,655
Captain, please step
aside. Sir, this is my brother.

27
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,927
What's going on?

28
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,987
PFC Macklin has been
charged with treason.

29
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,342
No, sir, there's gotta
be some mistake.

30
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:40,527
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,566
Brant!

32
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,275
Brant! Brant!

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,440
<i>We got visual
contact with that feed.</i>

34
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,643
<i>Possible hostile elements,
request permission to engage.</i>

35
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,097
<i>Stand by for orders.</i>

36
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,283
<i>Confirming multiple RPGs...</i>

37
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,270
Army apparently thought they
were clearing an insurgent hideout.

38
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,756
After this was leaked on
Saturday, the AP investigated.

39
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,828
<i>Confirms
authorization. Engaging.</i>

40
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:52,102
Thirty-four civilian
casualties. Six kids.

41
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,738
There'll be MPs stationed at
every entrance to the second floor,

42
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,209
as well as outside
his patient room.

43
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,303
No. Don't do that.

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,576
Every time there's people in uniform
in the cafeteria, they get served first.

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,283
Make sure your IDs
are clearly visible.

46
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,585
I'll speak with the cafeteria staff
about showing more disrespect.

47
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,425
20-year-old male. Generalized
tonic clonic seizures.

48
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,855
Army docs scanned for
structural abnormalities.

49
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:15,952
EEG was normal, so was...

50
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,191
Do you need me to sign for this?

51
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,695
Let me know if
you need anything.

52
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,929
Like a transfer.

53
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,469
Typhus?

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,601
Patient has no hair.
Probably means no lice.

55
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,974
Leishmaniasis?

56
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,640
No fever. Why couldn't they take
care of him at a military hospital?

57
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,784
I think because they
wanted to annoy you.

58
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,144
Any other
conscientious objectors?

59
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:46,058
So I'm the only one who
has a problem with someone

60
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,526
whose duty is to protect
our country blowing...

61
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:52,697
Blowing the whistle is honorable,
precisely because it's not dutiful.

62
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,479
I'm sorry, you said "blowing." Maybe
you were going somewhere else with that?

63
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,562
He's a coward.

64
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,171
He risked his freedom.

65
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,209
He anonymously downloaded a
computer file from a secure page

66
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,676
and uploaded it to
an unsecure page.

67
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,739
Not exactly storming
Omaha Beach.

68
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:13,081
EEG was normal because he
was faking it to avoid going to prison.

69
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,047
Let's treat him
with not-medicine.

70
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,385
Give those back. Come on.

71
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,226
You got 28. You can share.

72
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,568
Something's going on with
House. He just seemed off.

73
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,936
Didn't even notice that I
walked out of the room with this.

74
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,541
You began to suspect he was off

75
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,101
when he didn't notice the mug
you stole to see if he was off?

76
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,806
What else didn't he notice
that you don't want us to notice?

77
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,948
Those are the same
clothes you wore yesterday.

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,284
And you got very defensive
when House took your birth control.

79
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,393
Who was he? Or better yet, she?

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,122
Do I need to explain the
physiology behind birth control?

81
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,927
Attention deficit in a man
who has no attention deficits

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,730
has to be symptomatic
of something.

83
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,431
You're right. I'm thinking
either massive brain tumor,

84
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,096
or his soap got canceled
and he's distracted.

85
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,473
Could be dietary, Refsum.

86
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:14,775
Or maybe he thinks you just have
more than one non-descript, white blouse.

87
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,846
Or serotonin syndrome?

88
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,617
I'm not saying
he's definitely sick,

89
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,418
I'm just saying we
should look into it.

90
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,083
No, we shouldn't.

91
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,685
If you believe House is sick,

92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,127
it's only because that's
what he wants you to believe.

93
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,264
Let's go.

94
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,972
We think the long flight home
allowed clots to form in your leg.

95
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,037
Take this pill.

96
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,590
If you feel any numbness in
your leg after a few minutes,

97
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:48,638
it means we're right.

98
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,395
You should get comfortable because
you're gonna be here for a while.

99
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:58,221
While we wait, can
you tell me why?

100
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,855
It was the right thing to do.

101
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:06,732
There are reports that insurgents are
using your video to recruit new members.

102
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,879
Making the voting public aware of
what's really happening on the ground

103
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,496
will help bring our
troops home faster.

104
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,005
My brother's grunt
means he disagrees.

105
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,634
I think you're being naive.

106
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,744
And I know you took an oath.

107
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,978
If you want to influence
policy, run for office.

108
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,644
Dad raised us to believe that
exposing the truth is honorable.

109
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,017
Hayes likes to follow the rules.

110
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,850
Yeah, because that's what
Dad taught us was honorable.

111
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,635
You were 10 when he died,
you can't possibly have any...

112
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,924
If Dad always believed in
blindly following the rules,

113
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,553
how do you explain Tora Bora?

114
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,762
My dad was commanding
a Special Forces unit.

115
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,927
He lost communication with his
men, they were assumed dead.

116
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,235
He was ordered to abandon them
and focus on the primary mission.

117
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,368
He disobeyed that order, went and
found his men, still alive and fighting.

118
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,912
He saved their lives.

119
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,412
Did he die in service?

120
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,845
If it was something
genetic, it could help us.

121
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,614
No, it won't help. It
was a one-car accident.

122
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,415
That's the Army's
official story.

123
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,423
My brother's
naive on this and...

124
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,386
I can't feel my leg.

125
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,595
I'll get the discharge papers.

126
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,029
I have a blood clot.

127
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,431
No you don't. We
gave you a placebo

128
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:18,266
to see if you'd fake another
symptom to delay going to prison.

129
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,135
Wait, wait, wait. Wait a
second. He's not faking.

130
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,545
Because that's not the
way your dad raised him?

131
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,312
Yes.

132
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,746
My stomach hurts,
too. What's going on?

133
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,152
He's not faking.

134
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,278
Just because he's
got abdominal bruising

135
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,134
doesn't mean he wasn't
faking the numbness.

136
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,115
He's not contesting
the treason charges.

137
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,664
If his code of
honor is that strong,

138
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,438
he's not going to
bother faking symptoms.

139
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,237
Pleading guilty isn't
honorable, it's just stupid.

140
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,679
A distal esophageal rupture can lead
to compartment syndrome in his thigh.

141
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:07,845
Explains both symptoms.

142
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,620
No pain when he swallows.

143
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,456
What is honor?
Dying for your country?

144
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,324
Getting straight A's?

145
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,364
Killing your daughter because
she had the audacity to get raped?

146
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,863
Ruptured triple-A?

147
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,026
Doesn't explain the seizures.

148
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:26,004
Pancreatitis? Gallstones
obstructing his pancreatic duct.

149
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:33,007
People define honor with
whatever makes them feel honorable.

150
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,172
It's a circle going nowhere.

151
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,712
Which I guess
is what circles do.

152
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,085
We'll ultrasound his belly
and look for the obstruction.

153
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,060
Need your signature
on this order.

154
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,644
The Army's leaning on Foreman to
make sure this is done by the book.

155
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,464
Didn't need an order
for his last treatment.

156
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,561
His last treatment
wasn't a treatment.

157
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,198
Forge it.

158
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,898
I will. From now on.

159
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,306
But I need the original,
so I know what to forge.

160
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,065
We were having coffee
when the dizziness started.

161
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:09,539
Business meeting?

162
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,676
Date. Our first.

163
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,720
We met at the Ninety
Eight Cent Store.

164
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,948
We were reaching for
the same tube of cheese.

165
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,022
Huh!

166
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,886
I'm sorry. Yeah.

167
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,358
I need to talk to you.

168
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,260
Just about done.

169
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,562
Good news. Based on
her thrifty shopping habits

170
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,864
and taste for artificial dairy,

171
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,530
she's clearly not a gold digger.

172
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,107
Bad news.

173
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:39,543
Based on his
Rhinotillexomania, he is.

174
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,446
A compulsive addiction
to nose-picking.

175
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,514
A small cut on the
inside of the left nostril

176
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,713
led to an infection in
the cavernous sinus.

177
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,182
It was very nice
meeting you, Mel.

178
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,719
It's not true.

179
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,897
Gloria, wait. I can change.

180
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,135
My PPTH contract.

181
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:10,374
House signed it six months
ago. He signed this today.

182
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,280
His hands are unsteady.

183
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:22,083
Given his Vicodin abuse, I think
he has hepatic encephalopathy.

184
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,323
He's been forgetful,
inattentive...

185
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,954
Dominika's been trying
out new knish recipes.

186
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,393
One of them didn't
agree with him.

187
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,263
A little sleep deprivation could account
for his forgetfulness and inattention.

188
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,461
He loads up on caffeine,
that explains a jittery hand.

189
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,659
Maybe.

190
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,096
But if I'm right, his
liver's in decline.

191
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,410
It's curable, but if he doesn't get
treatment, it could actually be fatal.

192
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,475
This happens all the time.

193
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,607
One of the symptoms
of working for House,

194
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,914
you start seeing
zebras everywhere.

195
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,487
There's nothing wrong with him.

196
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,658
House.

197
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,771
Shh! I'm with a patient.

198
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,175
Sleep study.

199
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,013
You drugged him?

200
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,557
Well, I didn't say the
study was voluntary.

201
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,661
I think you're sick.

202
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,692
What? Because I'm sleeping
in the clinic, like I always do?

203
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,403
Slow reaction time.

204
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:50,602
Because I just woke up from
sleeping in the clinic, like I always do.

205
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,870
You're forgetful.

206
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,538
Sorry, what did you say?

207
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,191
You forgot that we were
supposed to have lunch.

208
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,583
I didn't forget. I was
sleeping in the clinic...

209
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,119
I'd like to run some tests.

210
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,382
For what? Where
is this coming from?

211
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,283
Hepatic encephalopathy.

212
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,917
I've watched you destroy
your body with Vicodin for years.

213
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,587
I'm surprised your
liver's lasted this long.

214
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,931
I'll do the examination myself.

215
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,464
While having you juggle
my jewels sounds interesting,

216
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,268
there's no such thing
as friends with benefits.

217
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,205
It always gets weird.

218
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,477
Your friends out there
are getting a little handsy.

219
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:38,058
Get enough death threats, eventually
they start taking them seriously.

220
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,150
A convoy was hit
outside of Kunar Province.

221
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,888
Eight American
soldiers were killed.

222
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:48,168
Army spokesperson's claiming that it's
revenge for the attack that I made public.

223
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,826
Better me take the
blame than them.

224
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,599
You don't think
you're to blame at all?

225
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:56,006
And you do? Like everyone else.

226
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,440
A strike like that would take
more than three days to plan.

227
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,811
So the next one
might be your fault?

228
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,015
Lateral view looks good.

229
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,517
If you have such a negative opinion
of the Army, why did you enlist?

230
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,089
I needed to find out what
really happened to my dad.

231
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,159
There were two redacted
pages in his service record.

232
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,964
Going into intelligence was the
quickest way to up my security clearance.

233
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,393
Then why would
you leak that video?

234
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,366
Part of my job was to grab
a cup of tea with the locals.

235
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,350
The face-time is
supposed to make them

236
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,866
more likely to trust us
with sensitive information,

237
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,875
but they became my friends.

238
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,183
If there was another attack, civilian
casualties, and I had done nothing...

239
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,311
Your spleen. It's enlarged. We
should do a biopsy and look for any...

240
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,185
He's got urinary bleeding.

241
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,384
Not just urinary.

242
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,731
I'll call the blood bank. HAYES:
What's happening to him?

243
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,996
His spleen must be
sequestering platelets.

244
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,667
He's bleeding too fast to
wait for a platelet infusion.

245
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,171
We need to squeeze his spleen
to release the ones he's got.

246
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,207
Tell the OR we're on our way.

247
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,344
- Pressure's dropping.
- Almost there.

248
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,144
BP's 70 over 40,
and he's hypovolemic.

249
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,722
Pressure's rising.

250
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,699
And he's starting to clot.

251
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,601
Good news is we can
control the bleeding.

252
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,401
Bad news is, bleeding's
not the problem.

253
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,909
Unless spleens are
supposed to be lumpy.

254
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,284
He's clotting, but CT
confirmed splenic nodules.

255
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,112
Dr. Taub has an
interesting theory.

256
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,188
No, I don't.

257
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,090
You're forfeiting?

258
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,518
If you can't play
the game and work...

259
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,124
Extramedullary hematopoiesis.

260
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,356
No history of anemia.

261
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,467
She's right. You're
an idiot. Try again.

262
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,365
Where I come from,
this is called "cheating."

263
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,600
Where's that?
Stickford-Upon-Anus?

264
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,205
TB.

265
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,606
PPD was negative.
Could be Bruce...

266
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,868
Don't interrupt Dr. Taub.

267
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,811
Brucellosis.

268
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,676
You just took out
a family of four.

269
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,717
They were clearly
armed insurgents,

270
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,253
and anyone who claims
or proves otherwise

271
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,719
is a traitor.

272
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,449
No rash or back pain.

273
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,619
You defend the patient
for being a whistle-blower,

274
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,625
then attack him for being
an honorable whistle-blower,

275
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,563
now you defend him for being a
maligned, honorable whistle-blower?

276
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,226
Adjectives matter. Hate
nurses, love naughty nurses.

277
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,735
Taub, pitch again.

278
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:38,837
I've pitched like five...

279
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,237
It's your turn.

280
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,397
Lymphoma?

281
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,618
If cancer caused his seizures,

282
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,634
we would have seen cerebral
masses on his head CT.

283
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,734
Yes!

284
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,172
Taub, pitch again. Now!

285
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,314
The nodules in his
spleen were granulomas.

286
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,688
He's got sarcoidosis!

287
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,885
Someone tell him he's wrong.

288
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,893
Sorry, House. Sarcoid
does explain the seizures.

289
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,254
And the bruises.

290
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,922
Say "bye-bye," House.

291
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:09,194
Yes! Yes!

292
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,407
Sarcoidosis it is.
Treat it with steroids.

293
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,376
Then come right back here,

294
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,349
'cause I'm not gonna rest until I've
made orphans of all your virtual children.

295
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,018
House never loses.

296
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,590
Seriously? Me beating
House is medically significant?

297
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,353
It could be.

298
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:38,797
Reduced fine motor control. Add
that to inattention and liver flap.

299
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,732
It does make sense.

300
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,630
We have to talk to Foreman.

301
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,398
No, we don't.

302
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:49,101
First of all, because I
can beat him in that game.

303
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:53,043
And second, even if you are
right, there's no reason to believe

304
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,910
that House's medical
judgment is impaired.

305
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,414
So we should wait until he
kills someone for confirmation?

306
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,195
Do you really think it's a coincidence
that we're treating a whistle-blower

307
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,711
and now talking about
blowing the whistle on House?

308
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,925
You're right. Playing dumb.

309
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,823
A messy signature.
Losing a video game.

310
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,954
It's way too
complicated to fake.

311
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,431
No. I won't take it.

312
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,604
Without this injection, you
could have a fatal arrhythmia.

313
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,477
Tell Major Mathewson that I'm
not taking any more treatment

314
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,880
until they give me a
live television interview.

315
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,679
You can't really think
they'll agree to that?

316
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,846
People need to know the tape's
not the reason for that attack.

317
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,446
They need to
know why I did this.

318
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,889
The people who think you're a
traitor will still think you're a traitor,

319
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,225
and the people who think you're
a hero will still think you're a hero.

320
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,022
The truth makes a difference.

321
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,829
If Dad were here, he'd be
begging for you not to do this.

322
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,703
If Dad were here,
he'd be proud of me.

323
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,549
The conspiracy theorists are
gonna go nuts if the patient dies.

324
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,024
I told him that, and he told me
that option is still less damaging

325
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,823
than giving the kid
a national platform.

326
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,056
So, what do we do now?

327
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,723
You explain to your brother
that he overplayed his hand.

328
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,209
Well, that won't
make any difference.

329
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,031
The idiot thinks he's
doing the right thing.

330
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,470
What if we convince
a court that his refusal

331
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,700
is part of an underlying
psychiatric disorder?

332
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,841
They assign a conservator,
we do what we want.

333
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,538
Fraud? Great.

334
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,681
Narcissistic
personality disorder.

335
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,012
Both the leaking of the tape
and the refusal of treatment

336
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,948
indicate that he has no
fear of consequences.

337
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,663
So instead of defrauding the
court, you'll waste their time?

338
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:45,021
No way a judge classifies a
personality disorder as a mental illness.

339
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,559
If a decorated military officer,

340
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:50,085
who happened to be the patient's
brother, corroborates, they might.

341
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:55,301
So you want me to sign a piece of
paper that says my brother is crazy

342
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,721
for doing what
he thinks is right?

343
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:00,206
I want you to save his life.
His heart could go at any time.

344
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,807
He's a fool, but he's not crazy.

345
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,913
The patient is refusing
treatment because of honor,

346
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,149
and his brother is refusing to be
his conservator because of honor.

347
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,790
Good, Taub's cured the patient.

348
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,962
I had to go to the bathroom.
Bathroom's that way.

349
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,324
You just ran in from that way.

350
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,774
That one's been out
of order for two days.

351
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,289
I had to go up
to the third floor.

352
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,397
I'm not lying.
It's out of order.

353
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,734
I believe you.
I'm going to fix it.

354
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,819
We could treat if he doesn't
know he's being treated.

355
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,311
Lace his sponge bath?

356
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,313
Would take too long to
reach his bloodstream.

357
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,245
What if we aerosolize
steroids and blast the room?

358
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,114
Speaking of which.

359
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:52,415
It'd be too hard to get the
prednisone concentrations right.

360
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,624
No one fixes anything unless
they have a compelling reason.

361
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,332
And if we're going to treat,

362
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,431
we have to give him
a compelling reason.

363
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:08,040
Something that he wants
more than an interview.

364
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,405
Fire in the hole!

365
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,576
A signed order from
Major Mathewson.

366
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,010
They've agreed to
declassify the redacted pages

367
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,847
from your father's
service record.

368
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,680
In two days, you'll
have all your answers.

369
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:24,656
But the only way you'll live long enough
to get the truth is by accepting treatment.

370
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,753
I don't trust the Army
to follow through on this.

371
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,922
But you trust me.

372
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,234
I'll make sure those
pages get here.

373
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,933
Okay.

374
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,341
Selfishness is
apparently honorable now.

375
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,247
He wanted to create change, instead
he's just satisfying his own curiosity.

376
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,514
He's getting the truth.
Most he could hope for.

377
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,352
I need to take a dump.

378
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,789
Specifically, House's dump.

379
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,029
You set this up?

380
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:16,474
All it took was showing up
two minutes late and a $2 sign.

381
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,047
Bile deposits are irregular.

382
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,153
House's liver is failing.

383
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:41,061
Cognitive impairment will
get progressively worse.

384
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,979
What's going on?

385
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,071
My foot. It's killing me.

386
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,416
It's completely cyanotic.

387
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,075
This isn't sarcoidosis.

388
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,989
Cholesterol embolization?

389
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,298
Are you even going to
acknowledge what we just told you?

390
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,924
That you pilfered my poo-poo?

391
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,465
Yeah, I was thinking it would
be less awkward for all of us

392
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,150
if we could just pretend
that never happened.

393
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,269
It's not an embolization. No
instrumentation inside the arteries.

394
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,704
Thank you for
getting us back to...

395
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,806
And if we start you on treatment
now, get you off Vicodin...

396
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:33,046
What's the opposite of "thank
you"? Pretty sure it ends in "you".

397
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,982
I know my body. I'm fine.

398
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,523
Methemoglobinemia.

399
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,289
Army tests for G6PD deficiency.

400
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:46,995
If you're not sick, then our
tests accurate 99.5% of the time,

401
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,661
yielded a false positive,
three separate times.

402
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,397
The odds of that are
one in eight million.

403
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:54,504
The test is accurate.
The diagnosis isn't.

404
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,475
The sample was obviously
contaminated by other foods

405
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,171
interacting with
my liver enzymes.

406
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,975
Now, can we talk
about the sick patient?

407
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,845
His clot dissolved. That could
have caused the vasospasm.

408
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:08,079
And DIC could have been caused
by Bernard Soulier Syndrome.

409
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,658
And you're sick and you
have to do something about it.

410
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,303
If we got a patient file with the
same symptoms you're exhibiting...

411
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,558
And the symptoms
I'm not exhibiting?

412
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:20,394
Jaundice, ascites,
fetor hepaticus.

413
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,867
We can't tell if your breath stinks
because you've been popping mints

414
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,027
like they're Vicodin.

415
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,415
And you would still diagnose
hepatic encephalopathy.

416
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,739
I know that because four doctors you
trained have unanimously diagnosed you

417
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,175
with hepatic encephalopathy.

418
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,042
Park's right. Treat the
patient with heparin.

419
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:55,564
We'll have a stronger argument if
we go to Foreman as a united front.

420
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,535
We'll have a stronger argument
if we have an argument.

421
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,206
If House is sick, it's his
business, not Foreman's.

422
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,153
Foreman's business is to make sure
his doctors are able to do their jobs.

423
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,768
That lives aren't put at risk.

424
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,777
Telling Foreman
will put lives at risk.

425
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,739
We tell Foreman, House either
agrees to treatment or gets suspended.

426
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,614
Which means House
gets suspended.

427
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,311
And considering House at 90%

428
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,580
is better than any other
doctor at this hospital at 100%,

429
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,990
that means our patients
get a lower standard of care.

430
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:24,257
House could be at 90%, he
could be at 60%. We don't know.

431
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,926
And until we do, there's no reason to
do anything more than what we've done.

432
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:38,634
Blurry vision, headache,
bit of nausea and dizziness.

433
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,175
I am completely baffled.

434
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,112
I only had eight beers.

435
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,128
Sophomore class pong
tournament's in a week.

436
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,586
I'm working on my tolerance.

437
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,953
Hop on one foot and
sing the <i>iCarly</i> theme song.

438
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,124
Like you don't know it.

439
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,308
Damn it, man, can't
you see I'm doctoring?

440
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,353
If you want to talk to me, you
can buy me a sandwich in an hour.

441
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,714
Or I can just hover
here until you're done.

442
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:32,189
Heard enough. Just never could
figure out the "breathe air" part.

443
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,890
Next year, stick to whiskey.

444
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,992
Or at least stay away
from week-old green beers.

445
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,870
A lot less likely to contain
tartrazine-laced green food dyes

446
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,067
for which you apparently
have an intolerance.

447
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:48,036
Once you break the seal, should
be out of your system in 48 hours.

448
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:55,580
What are my choices here? If I tell
you I'm fine, you won't believe me.

449
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,212
I've scheduled a
liver function test.

450
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:01,259
If I ignore you, then you'll
just ignore my ignoring.

451
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,885
Which is rude, frankly.

452
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:06,056
Depending on the results,
we'll customize a treatment plan.

453
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,929
If I tell you I think I'm
sick and I need your help

454
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:14,029
and we need to set up a time to talk
about it, you'll just assume I'm lying.

455
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,666
Again, rude. Also hurtful.

456
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,745
Why is it that you can find the
smallest thing wrong with anyone else,

457
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,006
but when it comes to you...

458
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,208
I really don't have
a choice here, do I?

459
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,978
No. You don't.

460
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,349
I'm on the list. He's not.

461
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,452
You can't ignore me forever.

462
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,215
Well, if you're right, it's
not gonna be all that long.

463
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:36,760
Do it slow.

464
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,632
Who are you?

465
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,589
Well, considering the only
people allowed in this room

466
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,878
are your doctors
and your family,

467
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,981
I'm your long-lost cousin Ralph.

468
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,987
So glad to finally meet you.

469
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,549
Are you going to check on me?

470
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:11,093
It's gonna be at least two hours until
we can tell if the heparin's working.

471
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,288
Then what are you doing here?

472
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,229
My father taught me

473
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,396
that it's dishonorable to interrupt
someone while they're reading.

474
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,736
Honor is not a punch line.

475
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,609
Get out of my room.

476
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,472
So, was it worth it?

477
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:33,245
Best case, you spend the
rest of your life in Leavenworth.

478
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:36,117
Worst case, you spend
the rest of your life here.

479
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,915
Justice for 34 deaths outweighs
anything the Army can do to me.

480
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,755
They got justice?
Do they know that?

481
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,689
What if only 10
people had died? Four?

482
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,324
Even one civilian death is...

483
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,495
What if they had just maimed a few
guys. Would that have been worth it?

484
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,438
My job was to log that tape,

485
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,641
get all the details
in the official record.

486
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,005
After the 10th
time of watching it,

487
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,446
I stopped trying
to convince myself

488
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,181
that the shovel could have
been mistaken for a gun

489
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,123
because all I could see
were the victims' faces.

490
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:17,854
All I was doing was trying to read
that kid's lips to make out his last words.

491
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,156
I couldn't sleep.

492
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,126
Couldn't eat.

493
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,597
Think I like the cue ball look?

494
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:30,233
My hair turned
gray in three days.

495
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,070
My body was telling me I
had to do whatever I could

496
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,706
to make sure that something
like this never happened again.

497
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,516
Your hair turned
gray in three days?

498
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,093
Loss of hair color indicates an autoimmune
condition, likely Graves disease.

499
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:56,931
Hyperthyroidism leads
to a hypercoagulable state

500
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,064
which causes thrombosis.

501
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:00,672
Start him on anti-thyroids.

502
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,640
You want to reject
our current diagnosis

503
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:05,200
because he had a few gray hairs,

504
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,610
panicked and shaved his head?

505
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,376
I want to reject our current
diagnosis because I think we're wrong

506
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,578
and treating for wrong diagnoses

507
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,450
can result in side
effects, like death.

508
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,285
Even if he did fully go gray, stress
seems way more likely than Graves.

509
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,917
I haven't read any journal
articles proving that veterans

510
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,962
have a higher incidence
of depigmentation.

511
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,574
But, of course, that could be the
hepatic encephalopathy talking.

512
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,438
Our treatment for Bernard
Soulier hasn't had...

513
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,694
So you all want to just
ignore the new symptom?

514
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,270
It's not Graves because
it's not a symptom at all.

515
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:34,897
And the anti-thyroids you want

516
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,805
could reduce his blood
pressure and his ability to breathe,

517
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,310
which could result in
side effects, like death.

518
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,945
Small soda.

519
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:46,148
Graves it is. Start
him on anti-thyroids.

520
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,052
I know we disagree
with House all the time,

521
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:56,753
but before I could say,
"Okay, he's a genius."

522
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,126
Now?

523
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,496
Maybe he's just really smart.

524
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,098
We're not gonna give
him the anti-thyroids.

525
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:22,010
Feeling okay? Any better?

526
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,350
Pretty good.

527
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,221
He did just ask
me for a blanket.

528
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,315
You're cold?

529
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,419
A little.

530
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:30,985
For how long?

531
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,831
It's really nothing.
Maybe an hour or two.

532
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,328
He's at 104.

533
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,836
It's not Bernard Soulier.

534
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:51,973
Bold move.

535
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:56,084
You've gone from speculating
that I'm sick, to acting like I'm dead.

536
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,385
We acted like we don't
trust your judgment,

537
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,619
because we don't
trust your judgment.

538
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,820
Why don't you start by
not trusting your own?

539
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,658
We did more blood work.
It's not Graves either.

540
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,793
Talk to you for a minute?

541
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,176
Anything you have to say
to me, you can say to them.

542
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,483
It's only fair, considering
anything they say to me,

543
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:16,566
they also say to you.

544
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:21,008
Jiggle your pockets.
Who's got the silver coins?

545
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,347
Until you receive a
clean bill of health,

546
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,476
I'll be authorizing
all treatment orders.

547
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,488
I would say that that was
an incredibly stupid mistake.

548
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,653
But apparently I'd have to clear
that opinion through Foreman first.

549
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,328
White count is high,

550
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:44,132
so all the infections we ruled out
when he came in are back on the table.

551
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,103
Legionnaires'? Unlikely
without pneumonia.

552
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,797
Taub?

553
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,968
Loyalty issues
in his personal life

554
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,705
make sense if they cross
over into his professional one.

555
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,847
I was hoping we could get a
diagnosis before the witch-hunt.

556
00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:00,543
The patient's infection is an
inherently less interesting puzzle

557
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,381
than the stab wound in my back.

558
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:06,288
Fine. I told Foreman.
Can we move on now?

559
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,358
What about dengue?

560
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,019
Patient isn't in enough pain.

561
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,151
Nope!

562
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,498
I don't mean about
dengue, I have no idea.

563
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,891
Taub's only confessing 'cause
he wants us to focus on the patient.

564
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,826
I told Foreman.

565
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:18,962
I did.

566
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,063
The next person
to confess is fired.

567
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,466
Or Spartacus.

568
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,568
For clarification, no
one's getting fired.

569
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:27,372
Who else has a pitch?

570
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,845
And then there's Park?

571
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,644
The only one who didn't confess.

572
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,485
And the same cowardice,

573
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,521
that makes someone unable to
move out of Mommy and Daddy's home,

574
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,490
might also make
someone a tattletale.

575
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,527
You threatened to fire
the next person who...

576
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,494
And it's malaria. No, it's not.

577
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,398
The Army issues
anti-malaria medication.

578
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,830
And has done for 10 years.

579
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,959
That's the equivalent
of 5,000 generations

580
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,766
of the Afghan mosquito,
<i>Anopheles gambiae.</i>

581
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,839
It's plenty long enough
to develop a resistance.

582
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:58,238
<i>Anopheles,</i> by the way,
it's Greek for "useless".

583
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:02,576
Cover for intra-abdominal
sepsis and treat with antimalarials.

584
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,383
And was I also right
that it was a stupid idea?

585
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,220
We believe you have malaria.

586
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,690
These pills...

587
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,387
I don't want any medication.

588
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,197
My dad's file
should've been here.

589
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:24,224
Brant, I told you. I looked
into it. There's just a delay.

590
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,964
I believe that's what
the Army's saying.

591
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,641
I don't believe it's true.

592
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,536
If they're not going to keep
their end of the bargain,

593
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,406
neither am I.

594
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,284
So, we got groped for nothing?

595
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,468
If he doesn't
want to stay alive...

596
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,492
Hold on.

597
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,290
Is it too late to become
his conservator?

598
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,193
I know what I said before.

599
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,029
Right now, I don't care.

600
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,203
Of course not. We'll get
the paperwork drawn up.

601
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,218
He changed his mind?

602
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,185
Why?

603
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,958
His brother's dying. He needs
a more substantial reason?

604
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,331
His brother was dying the last time
we asked him to be the conservator.

605
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,334
So instead of pushing the
issue with the Army to get that file,

606
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,838
he just decided to
give up on his code?

607
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:40,744
Apparently.

608
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,345
So, where do I sign?

609
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:50,745
We don't need you to.

610
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,649
The Army gave the
file to you yesterday.

611
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,560
Major Mathewson had
another copy sent over to us.

612
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:06,537
Uh... You know, there's a reason
I didn't want that file released.

613
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,097
I know. I read it.

614
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,604
I'm going to treat
my patient now.

615
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,552
I was right.

616
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,713
Wasn't I?

617
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,463
How did he die?

618
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,735
What did they cover up?

619
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,879
They didn't cover up anything.

620
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:53,775
I did.

621
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,724
Dad died in that car accident
because he was drunk.

622
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,954
Killed a pedestrian, too.

623
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,996
What are you... I...

624
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:09,499
He drank, Brant, a lot. You
were too young to see it.

625
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:20,908
I had some of Dad's
buddies take care of his files.

626
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,952
It's the only time I
ever broke the rules.

627
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:33,948
I'm sorry.

628
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,103
Can I begin treatment?

629
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,811
Fever hasn't broken.

630
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,546
White count is still up,
renal function is declining.

631
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,330
So, he has all the
signs of malaria,

632
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,346
except the antimalarials
aren't curing him.

633
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:08,393
Gonorrhea? If it
got into his heart...

634
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:11,622
We did an echo. His valves
look good. What about...

635
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,124
You bastard.

636
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,996
You were faking.

637
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,242
Yesterday, House stole
candy by putting it into a cup.

638
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,210
The cup was too small, so his solution
was to remove some of the candy.

639
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,804
But the obviously logical thing
was to just get a bigger cup,

640
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,179
which he did today

641
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,907
because he's no longer faking.

642
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,562
He couldn't have faked
it. We tested your...

643
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:38,853
I took St. John's Wort to alter the way
my liver metabolized acetaminophen.

644
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,751
Then some N-acetylcysteine
just to finish it off.

645
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:46,889
You tortured them to torture me
just to see who you could trust?

646
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:49,263
I did it to save lives.

647
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,827
God, I wish I could
rationalize that one.

648
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,169
And now you're gonna brilliantly
deduce which one of us is the rat?

649
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,236
What makes you
think I haven't already?

650
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:11,879
To be continued. I need
to brilliantly cure a patient.

651
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,793
No hair usually means no lice.

652
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,092
What we didn't account for
was that it wasn't your hair.

653
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,533
Tea was not the only thing that your
Afghani neighbors shared with you.

654
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,651
I'm sure they were generous
enough to let you sit on their furniture

655
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,040
which was
infested with rat lice.

656
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,734
You have typhus.

657
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,377
Caused the vasculitis and
explains all your other symptoms.

658
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,950
But here's where
it gets interesting.

659
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:45,048
One of those symptoms, a lawyer
might argue, was leaking the tape.

660
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,684
There are psychiatric
issues associated with typhus.

661
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:53,495
And if you change your mind,
plead not guilty, you've got a case.

662
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,927
I'd be undermining everything
I've been trying to do.

663
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,168
You did what you
thought you had to do.

664
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,512
Going to jail proves nothing.

665
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,606
It proves I still have my honor.

666
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,582
You're not doing this for honor,

667
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,649
you're doing this to
please your father.

668
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:27,062
And the pathetic thing is, is that the
man you're trying to please never existed.

669
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,082
Traitor.

670
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,220
You've been avoiding
me for two days.

671
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,734
Because when I stranded
you behind the barricades,

672
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,021
you went straight to Foreman.

673
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:58,359
I've been avoiding you
because you're an ass.

674
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,023
I've been an ass my whole
life. I can't get rid of you.

675
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,558
You can get rid of me now.
Just turn and limp away.

676
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,170
Huh!

677
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,673
Your whiny righteousness
has the stench of sincerity.

678
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,145
Fine. I'll have to
punish my whole team,

679
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,011
so one of them
will step forward.

680
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,711
Makes sense.

681
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:24,547
Damn. Now I'm gonna have
to punish my whole team

682
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,090
so one of them
will step forward.

683
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,419
You just said that.

684
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,117
Yeah, but I meant it this time.

685
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,125
First time, I was
just testing you.

686
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,757
Either you were gonna genuinely
confess or falsely confess,

687
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,530
or actually...

688
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,914
His name's Li'l Chase.

689
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,024
He's a rat.

690
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:39,855
You're a rat. Get it?

691
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,969
Taub confessed to telling
Foreman to protect the patient.

692
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,530
Adams confessed to protect Taub.

693
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,943
Your confession
was just piling on.

694
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,305
There was no rational
reason for you to have done it.

695
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,314
And my punishment
will be nothing.

696
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,476
You wanted me to tell Foreman.

697
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,019
Your ability to solve puzzles is
the only thing that matters to you.

698
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,550
And you're smart enough to know
even you'll lose your edge at some point.

699
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,654
You want to make sure
someone's there when you do.

700
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,067
If that were true,

701
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:21,530
why are Li'l
Chase's little cousins

702
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,966
scurrying through your
apartment floorboards right now?
