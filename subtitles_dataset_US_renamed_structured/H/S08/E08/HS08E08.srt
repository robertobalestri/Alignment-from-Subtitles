1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,255
And you're sure he didn't
leave until after 9:00?

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,671
Absolutely. We watched the
Devils demolish the Rangers.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,867
The game started at 7:00.

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,067
Neither of you stepped
out between periods?

5
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,372
Get beer, pick up a pizza?

6
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,605
We stayed at my place, we
were together the whole time.

7
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,106
And you said the Devils
won? Yeah. Four-zip.

8
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,943
Kovalchuk had two, Arnott
and Parise each had one,

9
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,384
and Marty got the shutout.

10
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,382
I'm sorry? Marty?

11
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:24,885
Martin Brodeur,

12
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,427
Devils' starting goalie
for, like, the past 20 years.

13
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,087
He played awesome, as usual.

14
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:33,065
Your Honor, may I submit the sports
page from the <i>New Jersey Chronicle</i>

15
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,895
on October 9th, 2011?

16
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,594
Objection. Relevance.

17
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,983
Goes to the
witness' credibility.

18
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,231
Go quickly.

19
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:45,542
Would you please read
the caption under the photo?

20
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:51,408
"Martin Brodeur stops
one of his 36 saves

21
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,545
"on the way to a
shutout victory."

22
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:55,779
That's what I just said.

23
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,603
That the defendant couldn't have
possibly committed the robbery

24
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,886
because he was with you,

25
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,604
watching Martin Brodeur
shut out the Rangers.

26
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,755
Yes.

27
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,229
Thank you.

28
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,997
Your Honor, may I submit the
<i>Chronicle</i> sports page from October 10th?

29
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,261
Your Honor... This is
what you call going quickly?

30
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,465
Just two more
questions. I promise.

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,276
Please read the highlighted
text at the bottom of the page.

32
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,473
"In Sunday's sports section,

33
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,611
"New Jersey Devils' goaltender,
Johan Hedberg, was..."

34
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,682
That's it. Keep going.

35
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,190
"misidentified as Martin Brodeur

36
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,495
"in a photo caption
and box score."

37
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,133
An understandable mistake

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,604
given that Martin Brodeur was
scheduled to start, but bowed out

39
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,344
after taking a shot to
the throat in warm-up.

40
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,145
Which brings me to my
most relevant question.

41
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,954
Did you and the defendant
spend the evening of October 8th

42
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,050
watching the Devils game on TV,

43
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,230
or did you just read about
the game in the <i>Chronicle</i>

44
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,818
while concocting
this false alibi?

45
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,233
Excuse me, Your
Honor, may I approach?

46
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,548
You sure you don't want to wait

47
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:19,972
till after he answers
your question?

48
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,235
No.

49
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,673
I'm gonna need a continuance.

50
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,972
Now? You're one answer away
from destroying their whole defense.

51
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,209
Your Honor... Oh, shut up.

52
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,341
You know it's true.

53
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,976
Let's finish this up. I can't.

54
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,576
Why the hell not?

55
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,719
Because I think I'm
having a heart attack.

56
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,987
Great. Call an ambulance.

57
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,396
Thinks he had a
heart attack, but didn't.

58
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,373
His EKG, cardiac enzymes
and catheterization are all normal.

59
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,808
Because it's an anxiety attack.

60
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,836
Probably because
he just turned 40

61
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,222
and still goes by
the name "Tommy."

62
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,373
It's not anxiety.

63
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,007
I had the ER docs
interview his wife,

64
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,574
she confirmed he's
been feeling fine.

65
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,395
Nothing out of the
ordinary at work or at home.

66
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,151
She probably also believes that he
thinks Salma Hayek's breasts are too big.

67
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,088
Which is why I had
them admit him anyway

68
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,320
and treat with alprazolam.
No improvements.

69
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,289
Because... Because
for some patients,

70
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,265
the diagnosis of anxiety disorder
can actually increase anxiety.

71
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,633
Which is also why I told him he
had a minor respiratory infection

72
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,933
that was easily curable
by the medication.

73
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,098
You lied?

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,075
I ruled out heart attack
and anxiety disorder.

75
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,946
Interesting.

76
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,008
I know.

77
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,677
<i>Impressive.</i>

78
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:20,627
What, the wiliness with which
Foreman ruled out anxiety,

79
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:25,291
or his complete wiliness-lessness
before he met me?

80
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,427
The fact that you managed to
smear jelly on nearly every page.

81
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,203
Shingles could cause chest
pain before a rash appeared.

82
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,805
Pain would be restricted to
one dermatome, not cross them.

83
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,640
Asthma induced
pneumothorax would,

84
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:39,972
and might not show up
on a posteroanterior x-ray.

85
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,274
No history of asthma.

86
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,340
They did a lateral view as well.

87
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,352
No sign of pneumothorax
or deep sulcus sign.

88
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,319
I treated an inmate once
with similar symptoms

89
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,533
after he tried to poison his
cellmate with chlorine gas.

90
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,527
He didn't realize sharing a
cell also meant sharing the air?

91
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,204
Chlorine gas pools
near the ground.

92
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,439
He thought he'd be
safe in the top bunk.

93
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,659
But why would anyone
try to poison our guy?

94
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,343
He makes a living
sending people to prison.

95
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,166
But he's not in prison, and
it's kind of hard to gas a guy

96
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,829
unless you can seal
him in a room first.

97
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:09,366
Which is why Arceus created a
universe with three states of matter,

98
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,072
and 300 solid and liquid poisons
that could cause his symptoms.

99
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,407
Arceus?

100
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,681
Look it up. And
alkalinize his urine.

101
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,272
Then search his
home, talk to his wife.

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,198
See if you can get her
to tell us what she used.

103
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,691
Wait, why would you
think his wife poisoned him?

104
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:28,752
Because dangerous people don't
break into your home, they live in it.

105
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,007
And although his kids are old
enough to want Daddy dead,

106
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,675
they're still too young
to do anything about it.

107
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,396
It must be such a pleasure
to live in your head.

108
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,269
You're right. The kids
might be precocious.

109
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,267
You handle his house.
You handle him and his wife.

110
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,070
They get to just hang
out and do nothing?

111
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,724
If you need help, you can
take whoever you want.

112
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,503
I'll take Taub. I'll take Taub.

113
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,050
Interesting.

114
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,176
No, it's not.

115
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,051
It was a 50-50 choice. I'm
totally fine with Taub or Park.

116
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,783
Cool. I'll take Taub.

117
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,914
And I'll take Park.

118
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,821
That was fun.

119
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,497
Not really.

120
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,903
Nice move, boss.
Lying to the patient.

121
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,599
I had no choice. I
knew House wouldn't

122
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,506
take the case unless
I ruled out anxiety.

123
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,874
You need a girlfriend.

124
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,188
To keep me from
lying to patients?

125
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,874
To give you the
excitement you need

126
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,091
so you don't go looking for it.

127
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,526
You're not working
for House anymore.

128
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,042
Which means you no longer
have him to blame if you get caught.

129
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,111
I'm not looking for
excitement, I'm doing my job.

130
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,282
Part of which is to make
sure House does his.

131
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,560
Girlfriend might not be so bad.

132
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,789
It's less dangerous than
where you're headed,

133
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,797
and that's from a
guy with one alimony

134
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,356
and two child support payments.

135
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,313
It's this new
curve control thing.

136
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,076
It automatically slows the car

137
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,380
when it senses I'm
taking a curve too fast.

138
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,951
You really think I
care about your car,

139
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,814
or are you just trying
to avoid talking about

140
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,216
why you don't like
working with me?

141
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,991
There's nothing to talk about.

142
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:09,062
House liked poking ant hills
with a stick when he was a kid,

143
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,064
and now he wants to
do the same with us.

144
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,657
House is an ass, but
he's an intuitive ass.

145
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,258
He obviously noticed something.

146
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,639
Yeah, the fact that
we work well together.

147
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,436
He thrives on conflict and is
looking for someone to torment.

148
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,772
Don't let it be us.

149
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,005
I don't see how that's possible.

150
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,085
Tommy's the most
popular guy in his office.

151
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,644
He's even had defendants thank
him after they were sentenced.

152
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,351
Why would they thank him?

153
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,967
Because he doesn't
treat them like scum.

154
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,654
He makes them feel like
he's helping by offering a plea,

155
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,560
or even just by letting them pay
their debt and clear their conscience.

156
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,441
And even if someone
wanted to poison him,

157
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,742
I don't see how
they would do it.

158
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,930
He never eats or drinks anything
that we haven't made at home.

159
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,462
Wait, you mean, literally,
like, not even a bottle of water?

160
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,599
No.

161
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,374
So, he was obviously
afraid of something.

162
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,275
Yeah. Rats, mice, cockroaches.

163
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,939
My first job out of law school
was at the Health Department.

164
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,417
If you'd seen some
of the kitchens

165
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,851
and the processing
plants I have,

166
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,179
you'd cook all
your own food, too.

167
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,281
The poison wouldn't
have to be in food.

168
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,692
Have you gotten any strange
letters or packages recently?

169
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,819
No.

170
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,190
It also wouldn't have
had to be at work.

171
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,197
We've got two young kids.

172
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,895
There's definitely no poisons

173
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,850
I could've accidentally
been exposed to at home.

174
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,972
What if it wasn't an accident?

175
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,035
How are things between
you and your wife?

176
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:37,413
Are you asking me if I think
my wife is trying to kill me?

177
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,318
Yes. I am.

178
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,921
Absolutely not.

179
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,084
This is coming from a man
whose eyes are wide open.

180
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,157
I've prosecuted hundreds
of despicable acts

181
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,857
by husbands, wives,
parents. I can assure you...

182
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,331
I love my husband.

183
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,870
And I would not ever,
even for a second,

184
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,768
consider doing
anything to hurt him.

185
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:04,176
No pesticides, fertilizers,
or fuel in the garage.

186
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,268
You find anything?

187
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,610
No. There's not even a bottle
of White-Out in this place.

188
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,842
Maybe we should look again.

189
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,747
Maybe we should leave
before the police get here.

190
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,378
Well, even if a neighbor saw
us break in and called 911,

191
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,582
unless they said we were
armed, it's low priority.

192
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:18,922
We've got another five minutes.

193
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,893
He's a prosecutor. Obviously
he knows a lot of cops.

194
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,897
His house is not
gonna be a low priority.

195
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,692
Good point.

196
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,559
Wait.

197
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,269
The dining room's on
the other side of that wall.

198
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,398
Yeah, so?

199
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,205
But it ends, like,
3 feet further over.

200
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,075
You gotta be kidding me.

201
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,558
A second ago, you
wanted to run like hell

202
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,643
and now you want to
look for secret passages?

203
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,785
There's a magnet
on the fridge they use

204
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,291
to open child proofed
cabinets. Go get it.

205
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,318
Hurry up.

206
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:04,664
Here.

207
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,735
Holy crap.

208
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,620
Don't tell me.

209
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,789
The jealous wife,
in the dining room,

210
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,993
with bipyridyl herbicide.

211
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,863
<i>We didn't find any poisons.</i>

212
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,473
You obviously found something.

213
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,543
Yeah. A hidden bunker with
enough guns to defend Fort Knox.

214
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,341
Or break into it.

215
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,579
Cool.

216
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,523
That's impossible. You must've
broken into the wrong house.

217
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,886
Then you have creepy neighbors

218
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,192
because there were photos
of you and your kids all over.

219
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,897
I don't understand.
How could this...

220
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,331
I had it put in during
the remodel last year.

221
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,839
But we went over
the plans together.

222
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,437
It's not on the plans.

223
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,937
I didn't want the
city to know about it.

224
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,173
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,382
I should've told you. I just...

226
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,248
I didn't want you
and the kids to worry.

227
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,379
About what?

228
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:34,017
Tommy, what is it? Why would
you think you needed so many guns?

229
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,734
You're not gonna believe this.

230
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,135
He's worried that
"Too big to fail"

231
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,041
applies to our banks
but not our government.

232
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,568
How'd you know?

233
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,290
Because it's what
every idiot with a bunker

234
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,146
full of assault
rifles is scared of.

235
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,078
Heather Sweeney?

236
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,698
It'll just be a couple minutes
till someone's ready to see you.

237
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,385
Maybe it's not
stupidity, it's a symptom.

238
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,723
Cocaine abuse can cause
paranoia and chest pain.

239
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,628
This isn't necessarily
paranoia. Societies do fall apart.

240
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,641
Look what happened
with London in the riots.

241
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,861
There's a difference
between an isolated riot

242
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,425
and the fall of civilization.

243
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,231
April Donaldson?

244
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,665
Sorry, misspoke.

245
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,885
Imagine what would happen
if there was a terrorist attack

246
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,172
on the food supply,

247
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,906
or a pandemic where we
had to ration the antibiotics.

248
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,073
That's ridiculous.

249
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,572
Ouch.

250
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,813
Oh, shut up. We know what you're
trying to do and it's not gonna work.

251
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,022
It was a little harsh.

252
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,016
Stop being so...

253
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,319
What? Paranoid?

254
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,604
You're gonna look pretty
foolish if that was a wrong guess.

255
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,468
I think you're a good
person and a fine doctor,

256
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,727
but it's ridiculous to
think anyone needs

257
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,096
an arsenal of assault weapons.

258
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,011
He's obviously paranoid.
What about Fahr's disease?

259
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,799
He's not hallucinating.
As far as we know.

260
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,702
We should do a mental
status examination

261
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,138
and get a CT of
his basal ganglia.

262
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,073
No, we shouldn't.
If it's not poison,

263
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,610
it's most likely
atrial fibrillation

264
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,476
brought on by
hyperthyroidism or sleep apnea.

265
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,183
Looks like we got ourselves
a good old fashioned cat fight.

266
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,311
No, we don't. We have a
reasoned disagreement.

267
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,379
Still, there's only
one way to settle this.

268
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,533
Actually, there's
two, but we don't have

269
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,150
enough Jell-O for the first.

270
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,060
Mini-mental, CT,
and get a hair sample

271
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,688
to check for past cocaine use.

272
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,732
Check his TSH levels
and get a sleep study.

273
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,354
Sorry, gotta
make it a fair fight,

274
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,712
which means
you're stuck with her.

275
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,068
He's not stuck with me.

276
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,662
And it's not a fight.

277
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,467
Excuse me, miss.

278
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,670
What is your name?

279
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,178
Mariel Wilkerson.

280
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,173
Hah.

281
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,677
You don't look like
a Mariel. You're up.

282
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,265
So what do you think? Is
the patient paranoid or am I?

283
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,101
I don't think stockpiling weapons
is the most reasoned response,

284
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,108
but given what I've seen at
Bloomingdales on Black Friday,

285
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,769
I wouldn't say it rises to
the level of mental illness.

286
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,204
And me?

287
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,113
Again, given what I've
seen at Bloomingdales...

288
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,544
Don't let House get to you.

289
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,113
It's all of you. I feel like
you don't respect me.

290
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,816
Chase certainly
didn't try to hide it.

291
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:20,950
Chase respects you.

292
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,404
He's just more
comfortable working with me

293
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,589
because he's known me longer.

294
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,441
And I'm not just saying
that because you own a gun.

295
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,728
I don't own a gun.

296
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,633
I've thought about
it, but I'd probably

297
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,302
end up shooting
someone in my own family.

298
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,466
Like, when my brother tosses his
toenail clippings behind the couch.

299
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,767
What about you?

300
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,406
If anarchy breaks out,

301
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:43,849
I plan to do what my ancestors
have done throughout the ages, run.

302
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,146
Sounds like a good plan.

303
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,311
You got a moment?

304
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,186
Stop telling the nurses
I'm looking for a girlfriend.

305
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,927
What makes you...
Two lunch offers

306
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,020
and a box of cupcakes
since this morning.

307
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,032
So a few people are nice to
you and your first thought is,

308
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,431
"Hmm. This seems strange."

309
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,698
I haven't even had time
to eat my own lunch,

310
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,768
much less run around trying
to recruit nurses for yours.

311
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,364
So can I get back to work?

312
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,272
You're lying, aren't you?

313
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,375
It's for his own good.

314
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,277
He's not paranoid,
he's just stupid.

315
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,650
Well, shouldn't you put
yourself in that group?

316
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,346
You own a gun.

317
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,556
Our patient doesn't own
a gun, he owns an arsenal.

318
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,893
And I don't own a gun.

319
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,161
Yes, you do. And you're a felon.

320
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,442
So, you'll end
up back in jail...

321
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:37,403
That is actually not one of the
many reasons that I don't own a gun.

322
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,540
Why would I need a gun? The
only thing I own worth protecting,

323
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,485
a thief would need a crane
to get out of my apartment.

324
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,307
You don't own anything you need.

325
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,672
You own things you want.

326
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,738
And you're definitely the
type who'd want a gun.

327
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,043
You like anything dangerous.

328
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,818
Monster trucks,
motorcycles, fireworks.

329
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,319
Everyone loves fireworks.

330
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,819
Watching them, not making them.

331
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,890
I'm telling the truth.

332
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,022
I stand corrected.

333
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,164
If you believe me, then
this issue will be resolved

334
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,996
with no further
action necessary.

335
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,663
Absolutely.

336
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,434
It's not resolved, is it?

337
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:12,663
Not even close.

338
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,877
It's not cocaine. Hair
samples were clean.

339
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,641
It's not looking good
for Fahr's either.

340
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,341
I'm not seeing
any calcifications.

341
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,508
You sure?

342
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,451
They can be pretty hard to
detect in people under 50.

343
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,645
See?

344
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,744
What?

345
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,517
We all disagree all the time.

346
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,022
It's not just me and Park.

347
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,790
Nice try, but I'm not
getting in the middle.

348
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,222
So why didn't you want to
go with her this morning?

349
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,322
She's weird.

350
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,839
She's not weird.
She's a good doctor.

351
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,564
Most good doctors are
weird. Look at House.

352
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,467
Am I weird?

353
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,098
Yeah, but you're hot, so
it's easier to put up with.

354
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,080
You're completely normal
and a pleasure to deal with.

355
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,075
You're weird.

356
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:58,741
In a good way?

357
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,872
Maybe we should just
concentrate on the medicine.

358
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,250
You own any guns?

359
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,416
That's not medicine.

360
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,583
But it's related to
medicine. Kind of.

361
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,292
What do you think?

362
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,189
Yeah. But not for protection.

363
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,244
Despite what the media
would have us believe,

364
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,964
you think we live
in a very safe world.

365
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,595
You just think they're fun.

366
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:21,832
How did you know?

367
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,018
Working in a prison, you learned

368
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,806
criminals rarely target
random strangers,

369
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,688
and you've got more money
than you know what to do with,

370
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,807
so anything that seems
different and fun is worth trying.

371
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,143
And you?

372
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:35,052
Not here in the States. Back
home, I keep a few for hunting 'roos.

373
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,654
You hunt kangaroos?

374
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,550
But they're so cute.

375
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,625
They're also delicious.

376
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:44,987
You're screwing with me.

377
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,959
Totally.

378
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,194
There's no calcification.

379
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,897
Looks like we're both wrong.

380
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,002
You don't need to stay.

381
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,802
We won't have the
results until the morning.

382
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,901
It's okay. I'll stay.

383
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:02,638
Go. I'm sure your mother's
ready for a break by now.

384
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,178
Give the kids a kiss for me.

385
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,348
You think it's the end of the
world, but you wanted kids.

386
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,715
Oh, honey, come on.

387
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,818
I don't think the world's
coming to an end.

388
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,224
Look.

389
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,896
You have a spare
tire in your car, right?

390
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,901
That's what those guns are.

391
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,342
I mean, I hope to God I
never have to use one.

392
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,435
But if we can wake up

393
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,341
and learn that the entire banking
system has gone bankrupt overnight,

394
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,182
it just seems stupid not
to have a jack in the trunk.

395
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,617
Just in case.

396
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,351
And you've always...

397
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,687
What's that from?

398
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,884
I don't know.

399
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,654
You don't feel that?

400
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,730
No.

401
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,731
He also spiked a fever
overnight. Could be TB.

402
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,134
You wanna say it? Say what?

403
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,268
There's no sign of atelectasis
or infiltrates on the chest x-ray.

404
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,540
Yeah. That's med-speak
for, "She's an idiot."

405
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,994
Systemic sclerosis can
cause lower extremity ulcers.

406
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,745
It would have to
be pretty far along.

407
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,457
His first symptom was
just a few days ago.

408
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,452
His paranoia started
at least a year ago.

409
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,816
If he's paranoid.

410
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,287
So it's either not sclerosis,

411
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,225
or it's extremely
aggressive sclerosis.

412
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,059
We should biopsy the skin
lesion and start him on enoxaparin.

413
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,771
Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy
results before we start treatment?

414
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,163
Now's your chance.
She's leading with her chin.

415
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,398
I agree with her.

416
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,467
No, you don't.

417
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,471
Which means you're both idiots.

418
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,011
Get to work.

419
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,147
I know you don't
think I'm an idiot.

420
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:49,478
Does it matter?

421
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,286
If you're just looking to amuse
yourself at my expense, then no.

422
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,453
But if you feel the
need to manipulate me

423
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,622
to make me useful, then yes.

424
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,077
I thought we'd gotten past that.

425
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,691
If we hadn't gotten past
that, you wouldn't be here.

426
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:05,966
But ability isn't always enough.
Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.

427
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,470
So this is you
trying to help me?

428
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,204
No, this is me helping me, and
amusing myself at your expense.

429
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,279
Which brings us back
to, why do you care?

430
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,814
I deserve respect.
I'm a good doctor.

431
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,683
People respect you.

432
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,878
They just don't like you.

433
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,520
Where's your wife?

434
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,390
She just needed some time.

435
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,855
Not a fan of the
guns, I take it.

436
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,925
It's not the guns, it's...

437
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,897
I shouldn't have lied about it.

438
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,872
I'm guessing
it's a little of both.

439
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,672
And a little of, "Who
the hell is this guy?"

440
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,776
I'm not a nutcase.

441
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,916
I just want to do everything
I can to protect my family.

442
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,451
Don't worry, I'm
sure she understands.

443
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,153
<i>At first I thought it
might be frostbite.</i>

444
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:06,461
But I haven't really
been out in the cold.

445
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,792
And yet your first
thought was frostbite?

446
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,201
Yeah. I guess I was
just going by how it looks.

447
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,874
It looks absolutely
nothing like frostbite.

448
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,235
You serious?

449
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,309
With some difficulty.

450
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,073
Then what is it?

451
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,810
A sign that you need
to take a long vacation.

452
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,448
At least a month.

453
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:26,575
A vacation?

454
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,647
Wait, is this like a
<i>Bucket List</i> thing?

455
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,423
It's cancer?

456
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,754
It's silver.

457
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:36,455
I'm guessing silver nitrate
mixed with petroleum jelly

458
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,224
that your boss put
on the petty cash

459
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,823
so he'd know who to
have arrested for stealing it.

460
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,660
Damn.

461
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,963
Yeah. Damn.

462
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,609
It's diffused into your skin.

463
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,145
The only way to get rid
of it is to get new skin.

464
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,444
That normally happens
every 30 days, so...

465
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,914
I hear that La Crosse, Wisconsin

466
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,250
has got the world's
largest beer can.

467
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,525
Here's the per diem schedules.

468
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,271
These are supposed
to be in a computer file.

469
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:12,163
Sorry, since Claudine left, no
one's been inputting the numbers.

470
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,823
I miss Claudine.

471
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,799
She left because of you.

472
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:16,908
I thought that was Nadine.

473
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:17,936
Her, too.

474
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,131
Where are you going?
You still have an hour left.

475
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,673
Emergency page takes precedence.

476
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,453
Can you... I don't know
how to use the program.

477
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,140
Then find someone who
does. I gotta get out of here.

478
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,017
Got your page.

479
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,318
You're an ass!

480
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,629
Admit it.

481
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,323
Let me down.

482
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,801
After you admit it.

483
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,417
I'm a little tired. I
think I'm gonna go...

484
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,000
All right, I admit it.

485
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,955
Despite the fact that I
know there's a gun in here,

486
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,882
I'd never find it because
you are more devious...

487
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,849
Clever. Devious.

488
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,054
All right. Fine, clever.

489
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,649
More clever, and you'll always
be one step ahead of me.

490
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,371
You're either preparing
to fight Pacquiao,

491
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,005
or you're having one
heck of a bad day.

492
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:37,906
I'm Anita.

493
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,346
Eric. Nice to meet you.

494
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,613
And you can tell Taub

495
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,022
that he's gonna get the same
treatment as this heavy bag

496
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,390
if he doesn't cut this crap out.

497
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,587
Who's Taub?

498
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,461
You know, I'm sure
you're a nice person,

499
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,510
and you have no idea what
you've gotten sucked into,

500
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,901
but really, I'm not interested.

501
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,071
Okay, and I'm sure
you're a nice person,

502
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,938
but I just moved from Atlanta,

503
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,386
and this is my first
time at this gym,

504
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,141
so I definitely don't know
who this Taub guy is.

505
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,738
But I already
agree. He's a jerk.

506
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,123
Are you sure you
don't want to start over?

507
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,815
Take your time. I'll be around.

508
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,161
Taub, it's Foreman.

509
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,379
<i>Can't talk now. Little busy.</i>

510
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,427
What's going on?

511
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,485
Need some droperidol in here!

512
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,909
I gotta go.

513
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,808
He was hallucinating he
was being attacked by bears.

514
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,477
Points again to paranoia.

515
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,748
I agree, except for the "again."

516
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,688
Acute onset points to tularemia.

517
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,654
Or it's been chronic, which
points to GAD autoimmunity.

518
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,004
Explains the
neurological impairment,

519
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,272
as well as the
normal blood work.

520
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,274
Tularemia doesn't always
show up in the blood work either.

521
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:01,658
You know what else doesn't
show up in the blood work?

522
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,134
Nothing. This could
all be psychiatric.

523
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,831
An untreated schizoid disorder,

524
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,702
he's finally lost the
ability to suppress.

525
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,275
Schizophrenia doesn't
cause skin ulcers or fevers.

526
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,504
No, but digging
delusions out of your skin

527
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,274
with dirty fingernails
could cause both.

528
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,814
I don't think he's a psych case.

529
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,535
Because you're
paranoid about paranoia.

530
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,485
Because his symptoms point toward
an infection that's spread to his brain.

531
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,431
I think we should treat with
high dose broad spectrum...

532
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,619
Which will kill him if
it's a GAD autoimmunity.

533
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:32,988
Treat for GAD.

534
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,197
Corticosteroids and
IV immunoglobulin.

535
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,310
I'm not paranoid. And
they don't dislike me.

536
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,210
They don't even really know me.

537
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,474
Did they tell you that?

538
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,677
I didn't ask because you
wouldn't believe the answer.

539
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,720
If it makes you feel
better to think that.

540
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,016
You're the one
everyone dislikes.

541
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,566
You probably don't
even think it's GAD.

542
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,667
You're just agreeing with her

543
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,422
because you think it'll create
more conflict between us.

544
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,554
There's only one
way to find out.

545
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,929
Actually, there's two, but we're
still waiting for that Jell-O delivery.

546
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,059
Let me know how it goes.

547
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,755
Gotcha!

548
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,287
You poor dumb bastard.

549
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,571
Touché.

550
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,459
God, this is exactly
what I needed.

551
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,433
Tell me about it.

552
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,436
Nita? Oh, my God.

553
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:29,547
Who's that, your roommate?

554
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:30,652
No. It's just... You have to go.

555
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:31,735
Why, what's the big deal?

556
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,130
Please, I'm...
I'll explain later.

557
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,044
Just hurry up, please.

558
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,171
You have a boyfriend?

559
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,613
No, he's not my boyfriend.

560
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,010
He's my husband.
I'm really sorry.

561
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:49,487
Hey, I thought you weren't
getting back till tomorrow.

562
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,812
His fever's going
through the roof,

563
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,464
which means we
were wrong about GAD,

564
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,316
and the steroids kicked
the infection into high gear.

565
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,468
Or it is GAD and we
started treatment too late.

566
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:04,942
Increase the steroid dose.

567
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,010
<i>We can't.</i>

568
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,878
If it's an infection,
we'll kill him for sure.

569
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:12,044
<i>With neurological symptoms progressing
this fast, he's dead either way.</i>

570
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,410
If we increase the steroids,
either death comes slower,

571
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,752
which means we were too late
with the GAD, or death comes faster,

572
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,224
which means we were
too stupid with the infection.

573
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,419
We were already stupid with
infection, but it's not too late.

574
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,997
He's young and was
perfectly healthy two days ago.

575
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,563
He can fight this off, if
we give him a chance.

576
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:37,871
Fine, but a shotgun is not gonna
work. We need a sniper rifle.

577
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,875
<i>Start running DNA
assays for sporotrichosis,</i>

578
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,542
<i>meningococcemia, and any other
Boggle-winning words you can think of.</i>

579
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,160
You just said you wanted
to increase the steroids.

580
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,184
Now you wanna just...

581
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,914
I changed my mind.

582
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,113
But... <i>Do what Park says.</i>

583
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,701
Well, you don't have a gun.

584
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:05,431
But you do have my sunglasses,

585
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,939
my tennis racket, I
can't imagine why...

586
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,870
Had to kill a mouse.

587
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,274
It's really hard with those
stupid, little sunglasses.

588
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,809
And my money clip.

589
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,006
Was there any money in it?

590
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,105
Not anymore.

591
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,082
Can I go to bed now, or do
you want to do a cavity search?

592
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,785
Lock up on your way out.

593
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,621
This is ridiculous.

594
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:27,702
Every moment we waste
looking for a phantom infection

595
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:28,803
is time we could
be treating him.

596
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,956
For the wrong diagnosis. If it
was GAD, he'd be having seizures.

597
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,308
And if it was infection,

598
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,332
there would be some sign
of it in his blood or CNS,

599
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,164
which there isn't. Yet.

600
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,636
I'm beginning to think we
should just go with House's idea.

601
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,296
This was House's
idea. He said...

602
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,238
No, I'm talking
about the Jell-O.

603
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,243
At least it wouldn't be
so annoying to watch.

604
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,579
Taub. You got a minute?

605
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,475
You're an ass. You know that?

606
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,417
What's the problem? Some cute,
young nurse baked you cookies?

607
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,590
No. Some guy almost
caught me making out

608
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,018
with his wife in
their living room.

609
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,286
And how exactly
is that my fault?

610
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,573
If you hadn't been
screwing with me

611
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,641
and put the idea in my head...

612
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:09,260
So you don't date anyone
unless I put the idea in your head.

613
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,962
You really do need
psychiatric help.

614
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,839
Unlike you, I don't need drama.

615
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,431
I like my job and I'm
happy with my life.

616
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,038
You're so happy with your life

617
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,687
you've got nothing
better to do at midnight

618
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,646
than to come back
into work to yell at me?

619
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:25,179
Stay out of my business.

620
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,986
You're blaming the wrong guy.

621
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,627
Good for him.

622
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,522
Married one's not a
keeper, but it's a start.

623
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:42,994
You're an idiot.

624
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,303
He has stridor
but no obstruction.

625
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,959
He's anaphylaxing.
Get me a trach kit.

626
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,844
Scalpel.

627
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,373
It's not working. There's no breath
sounds. Doesn't make any sense.

628
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,023
His trachea's blocked
below the incision point.

629
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,047
We need racemic epinephrine.
We tried that already.

630
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,347
We're gonna try again.
It's our only choice.

631
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,916
We got him
breathing, but barely.

632
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,394
At least we know tracheal
edema isn't from anything we did.

633
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,898
Because we're
not doing anything.

634
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,730
Which is a good thing because
neither GAD nor a systemic infection

635
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,032
would cause anaphylaxis
or tracheal edema.

636
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:54,084
And an allergic reaction
wouldn't get worse

637
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,539
three days after
he was admitted.

638
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,638
So we got nothing.

639
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,613
Unless he was
still being poisoned.

640
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,739
By who?

641
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,654
His wife wasn't even
here when he hallucinated.

642
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:07,777
Good question.

643
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:09,987
Now we're the
ones being paranoid.

644
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,456
What about squamous
cell carcinoma?

645
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,421
If it's only in his epithelium,

646
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,293
it wouldn't show up
on his chest x-ray.

647
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,360
It is possible, but...

648
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:21,661
Wouldn't cause hallucinations.

649
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,099
It could if he also had
paraneoplastic syndrome.

650
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,400
Get a biopsy.

651
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,069
You think it's cancer?

652
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,342
I think you should get a biopsy.

653
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,417
Admit it.

654
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,198
Two hours ago, I
found this in your closet

655
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:56,929
in a box with your name on it.

656
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:00,000
I knew you'd move it
somewhere outside your apartment

657
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,768
until you were certain
I'd given up looking.

658
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:06,278
So, I had to convince you
that I'd given up looking.

659
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,972
It's not a gun.

660
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,112
Yes. It's a paperweight

661
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,348
with a handy storage compartment

662
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,515
for .45-caliber bullets.

663
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,685
And that's not
a bullet. Admit it.

664
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:27,193
I'm more clever and more
devious. You can even have it back.

665
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,910
It's not my problem if
you go back to prison.

666
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:32,029
My problem is you thinking you're
always one step ahead of me.

667
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,538
This proves nothing,
because it's not a gun.

668
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,197
It's a prop.

669
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,406
From Dorothy
Dietrich's magic act.

670
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:40,878
Look it up.

671
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,890
She's the only woman ever
to do the catch a bullet trick.

672
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,407
I won this off her prop
master in a poker game.

673
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,282
House... It's fake.

674
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,279
It's plugged.

675
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,949
Look for yourself.

676
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,018
Hey! Hey! Don't
point that thing at me.

677
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,064
It's not dangerous
because it's not a gun.

678
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,890
House... House, just stop it.

679
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,465
Fine.

680
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,303
What the hell are you doing?

681
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,239
Pull the trigger.
Don't be insane.

682
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,470
They're blanks.

683
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,977
You pull the trigger,

684
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,072
I drool a little fake blood,
and I spit out the bullet

685
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,793
that the audience thinks
I caught with my teeth.

686
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,285
Go ahead. Shoot me.

687
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,279
I'm not shooting you.

688
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,846
All right. I'll shoot you.

689
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,220
Don't! House, don't!

690
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,621
Even if they are
blanks, people will freak.

691
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,621
It's not real.

692
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,596
Which means you didn't
prove that I have a gun,

693
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,102
which means you've
proved nothing.

694
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,764
Admit it.

695
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:51,680
Admit it.

696
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:54,980
All right.

697
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:56,180
All right, what?

698
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,115
You win.

699
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,522
And it feels good.

700
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,723
You were wrong.

701
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,322
Don't feel too bad, we all were.

702
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,425
His trachea wasn't
swollen, it was blocked.

703
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,697
By a psuedomembrane
growing across it.

704
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:50,405
Means he's not paranoid, is
an idiot, and was poisoned.

705
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,434
What are you doing?

706
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,105
Give me a Machida scope.

707
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,308
Hold his legs, he's
not gonna like this.

708
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:02,846
Because you're not
gonna be able to breathe.

709
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,885
But I need to see
down your barrel.

710
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,130
Good news is,

711
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,193
the poison didn't
come from your wife.

712
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,701
It came from a little
bastard of a bacterium

713
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,568
whose crap can cause chest pain,

714
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,936
respiratory
distress, skin ulcers,

715
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,042
the growth of pseudomembrane
across the airway,

716
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:30,479
and in very rare
cases, hallucinations.

717
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,949
Call the CDC. Tell them we
need antitoxin as soon as possible.

718
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,084
Diphtheria?

719
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,889
We didn't guess it
because nobody gets it.

720
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:49,899
Instead of building bunkers,
you should be getting boosters.

721
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:53,405
As in the routine vaccines
against stuff that is actually scary.

722
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,354
Diphtheria?

723
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,490
House pulled it out of nowhere.

724
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,921
Cool.

725
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,093
You just getting in?

726
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:23,761
I had a meeting about a
new parking validation system.

727
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,164
Cool.

728
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,008
How are you feeling?

729
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,741
Not great.

730
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:35,872
But better.

731
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,154
The antitoxin is working. He'll
be able to go home in a few days.

732
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,917
That's good news.

733
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,055
But we've moved out.

734
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,751
Oh, come on, honey.

735
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,087
I'm sorry I lied, but...

736
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,164
I know. Okay...

737
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,898
It was for our own
good, but I don't care.

738
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,699
I don't want to be lied
to, and I can't live like that.

739
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,741
And I can't live in that home.

740
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,745
Oh, please, don't.

741
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:08,905
I love you.

742
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:14,049
I love you too,

743
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,519
which is why you're not
gonna live there either.

744
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,456
I don't care if we
might need them.

745
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:23,794
I just know that I can't live
my life feeling like we do.

746
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,091
It's not worth living in fear.

747
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,063
Okay. I'm sorry.

748
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,088
Hey.

749
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,113
Thanks.

750
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,562
You know, there's a bunch of
us going to happy hour after work.

751
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,400
I'm craving nachos.
You interested?

752
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:05,335
Thanks, but I got a lot of
work I need to get done.

753
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:08,838
Sure. Well, if you change
your mind, we'll be at Rudy's.

754
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,631
Okay.

755
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:24,747
Hey.

756
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,313
Hey. Hey.

757
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:37,499
Would you like to get a
drink sometime after work?

758
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,337
You mean all of us? Or just us?

759
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,966
I was thinking
just the two of us.

760
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,905
Did Taub put you up to this?

761
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,139
No.

762
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,647
It was just something I'd been
thinking about and I figured,

763
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:53,310
"What the heck?
Might as well ask."

764
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,882
Yeah, well, it's
probably not a good idea,

765
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,187
you know, with us
working together.

766
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:04,326
Didn't you marry someone
you used to work with?

767
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,193
Yeah, but...

768
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:11,196
All right, sure. When?

769
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,533
Tonight? Sure.

770
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,795
Hey, I changed my mind.

771
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:45,895
Okay.

772
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,558
Glad you changed your mind.

773
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,160
Hey.
