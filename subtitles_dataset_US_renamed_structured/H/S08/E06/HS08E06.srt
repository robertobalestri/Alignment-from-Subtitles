1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,103
Okay, boys and girls.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,300
Guess what kind of animal
Wacky Benny's making now.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,972
Give you a big hint.

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,883
Is it a dead animal?

5
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,688
I say we put him out of his
misery and bring out Emma's cake.

6
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,296
He's so new to this. How's he
gonna learn if we stop his act?

7
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,695
You're a sucky clown.

8
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,395
And you're a
super-duper audience.

9
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,801
Hey, that is not okay.

10
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,398
Hey, keep your hands off my son!

11
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,068
Tell him to keep
his hands off me.

12
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,486
I can't move my arm or leg.

13
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,619
So how does a completely
healthy teenager have a mini-stroke?

14
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,921
Head CT and cerebral
angiogram are normal,

15
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,257
clotting parameters are normal.

16
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,026
You're forgetting the wrinkly
clump in the middle of his shirt.

17
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,127
Thought we'd diagnose
the middle-aged clown first.

18
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,069
It's probably from my seatbelt.

19
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,367
Wrinkle pattern's too varied.

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,409
Looks like someone
shoved you. Or grabbed you.

21
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,720
Probably from the diaper
bag. If the patient's using drugs,

22
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,077
cocaine could've caused an
arterial spasm in his brain...

23
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,307
Tox screen's clean.

24
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,578
I'm gonna say it was the
ex-girlfriend you cheated on,

25
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,313
not the ex-wife you cheated with

26
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,863
because if the latter
was prone to violence,

27
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,915
you'd have been scattered in
various dumpsters years ago.

28
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:07,952
Seriously?

29
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,928
No one else wants to
talk about the patient?

30
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,763
New office
furniture. Meaty topic.

31
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,462
What's the action
on the ex-wife?

32
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,264
It was Rachel's boyfriend Phil.

33
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,001
His company's moving
him back to Portland.

34
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,837
He wants me to change
my visitation order

35
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:26,607
so he can ask Rachel and my
daughter to move out west with him.

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,080
Things got a little heated.

37
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,177
The patient was
punched in the groin,

38
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,084
could've triggered a massive
sympathetic discharge...

39
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,589
Carotid duplex is normal.

40
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,922
And who's better
qualified to be the daddy?

41
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,860
The guy who spilled a
little DNA in her gene pool,

42
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,606
or the guy who's gonna
be there day and night

43
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,125
to pass on important values like not
shtupping Mommy after the divorce?

44
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,797
I am her daddy.
She's staying here.

45
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,101
House has a point.

46
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,665
A couple nights a week with
each kid may make you feel better.

47
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,616
It doesn't replace two
round-the-clock parents.

48
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,147
Round-the-clock or not,
parenting's an impossible job.

49
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,977
No way not to mess it up.

50
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,136
Why shouldn't Taub
be the one to do it?

51
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,985
Thank you. HOUSE: Makes sense.

52
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,818
Park's tiger mom and
dad were so insufferable,

53
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,051
she has to measure
their affection in hours.

54
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,617
Chase's careerist dad and
alcoholic mom were so indifferent,

55
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,027
he has to believe it's a wash.

56
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,153
Your turn.

57
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,697
What did your
screwed-up parents do

58
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,232
to screw up your
view of parenting?

59
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,059
They were good parents.

60
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,832
That's an oxymoron.

61
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,568
Chase is right, all parents
screw up all children.

62
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,666
He's also dreamy, but
it's not relevant now.

63
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,575
So all parents
screw up all children,

64
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,510
but it makes some
huge difference

65
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,479
if I keep my daughter
here or let her move?

66
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,579
Endocarditis, flipped a piece
of vegetation into his brain,

67
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,485
which could've broken
up before the angiogram.

68
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,515
Transesophageal echo to confirm.

69
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,889
And screwed up is her best-case.

70
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,427
Bouncing between a
philandering, workaholic dad

71
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,191
and an embittered,
sexually-betrayed mom,

72
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,926
it's gonna lead to
screwed-up squared.

73
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,265
Is endocarditis treatable?

74
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,633
Very.

75
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,174
The echo will show us any
growths on his heart valve.

76
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,370
Most likely meds'll be enough,
he won't even need surgery.

77
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:08,204
He's just taken up performing,
and it's very stressful for him.

78
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,035
Could that have caused this?

79
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,018
It's not stressful, I have fun.

80
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,212
Stress wouldn't be relevant.

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,000
But anything that increases his
adrenaline could have made it worse.

82
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,083
Maybe we find you a new
hobby. One you're a little better at.

83
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,392
I'm gonna get better at
it, and it's not a hobby.

84
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,932
I think I want to
get a job working

85
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,934
as a circus clown,
making people laugh.

86
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,436
Ben, I don't think
that's a good idea.

87
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,742
It was good enough for my dad.

88
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,378
You were a...

89
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:41,914
His biological father.

90
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,950
Could his dad's
melanoma be a factor here?

91
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,178
That wouldn't be related.

92
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,849
Ben, you barely knew him.

93
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,946
You're such a smart kid,

94
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,357
you could aim a lot higher than
face paint and seltzer bottles.

95
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,699
I need treatment for
my Type 2 diabetes.

96
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,930
There is absolutely no part
of that sentence that is true.

97
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,905
I've been experiencing weight
gain, fatigue and sluggishness.

98
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,942
Weight loss is a
symptom of diabetes.

99
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,568
Fatigue is a symptom
of thinking you

100
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,236
have a disease you
don't actually have.

101
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,782
And sluggishness is
a synonym of fatigue.

102
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,976
I need insulin. I know it.

103
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,521
Much as I'd like to kill you by
dangerously lowering your blood sugar,

104
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,386
murder violates my parole.

105
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,221
That blood work is
weeks old. Test me again.

106
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,058
I am the test. The
test is negative.

107
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,055
The test also thinks you're
a giant pain in the ass.

108
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,766
That last insult was
your cue to leave.

109
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,032
Test me.

110
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,034
Fine. Wait right here.

111
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,910
Thank you.

112
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,547
Sleep study. Please
make sure he's

113
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,449
not disturbed for
the next eight hours.

114
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,189
We need to talk
about Saturday night.

115
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,258
No, no, no, no, no.

116
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,562
Historians will talk of
Saturday night, not us.

117
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,464
The legendary night on which we
watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw

118
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,398
and you epically pay me $50.

119
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,767
I have a chance
to really watch it.

120
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,136
A patient of mine has a
pair of tickets he can't use.

121
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,905
And obviously you're under
house and office arrest,

122
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,140
I just wanted to make
sure you were cool

123
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,442
if I go to Atlantic
City without you.

124
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,847
No, thanks.

125
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,795
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to decline your invitation

126
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,788
to not spend Saturday
night with you.

127
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,251
These are ringside seats.

128
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,120
Cameras are ringside, too.

129
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,784
If you want, I
could sweat and spit

130
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,920
and bleed on you
from time to time.

131
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,590
I'd take you if I could.

132
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,325
Well, I'd take me
if either of us could.

133
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,569
See what a tough spot I'm in?

134
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,193
I'm going to that fight.

135
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,308
All right, I'll take
the other ticket.

136
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,872
Let me worry about logistics.

137
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,022
Patient's heart valves are
normal. It's not endocarditis.

138
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,302
But he has a thickened
pericardium, which makes no sense.

139
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:10,195
He has a heart problem, but not
one that could've caused his TIA.

140
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,993
Syphilitic vasculitis
would explain the TIA

141
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,828
and the pericardial
inflammation.

142
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,029
Syph test was negative. Plus,
the kid's never been sexually active.

143
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:20,335
Yeah, I got that from the line on
his chart that says "birthday clown".

144
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,000
His late father
was a circus clown.

145
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,636
Histoplasmosis.

146
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,987
He's not immunocompromised.

147
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,877
And I assume you
added that irrelevant tidbit

148
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,142
because you're moved
by the son's idiotic tribute,

149
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,535
and think it justifies keeping
your daughter in New Jersey.

150
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,362
But what if he has a
heightened immune system.

151
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,651
I mentioned it because...

152
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,022
Take your time. We'll
continue with medicine.

153
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,824
Sjögren's could've
given him chronic

154
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,693
pericarditis and
cerebral arteritis.

155
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,529
Sjögren's it is. IV
immunosuppressants to treat.

156
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,701
Anything?

157
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,372
This'll calm your immune system.

158
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,841
You should be out of
here within the week.

159
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,505
My mom'll be happy to hear that.

160
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,879
I've got an internship
that starts in three weeks.

161
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,749
I take it it's not at a
place with a big top.

162
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,382
It's in my stepdad's law office.

163
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,053
I know I'm not any good
at being a clown yet,

164
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,422
but when I do get a laugh,

165
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,693
see those kids' eyes light up,

166
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,065
that's how my dad made
me feel when I was a kid.

167
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,962
You need to hang onto that.

168
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,043
My mom says he
was a loving father,

169
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,580
but always broke and
always on the road.

170
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,541
It's a stupid way
to make a living.

171
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,780
You're 16. Plenty of
time to make money.

172
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,850
Wanting to build a
connection with your dad,

173
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,588
pass on some of the
joy that he gave you,

174
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,229
that's not stupid at all.

175
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,801
I got it.

176
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:07,380
Is this because of the
medication? Is it normal?

177
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:16,314
It's not normal, and
it's not Sjögren's.

178
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,595
TIA, thickened
pericardium, and now

179
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,031
he's bleeding from
his nose and mouth.

180
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,832
What are you doing with her?

181
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,768
"Her"?

182
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:38,977
Surely this little bundle
of fun has an actual name.

183
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,205
It's Sophie.

184
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,781
Both your kids are named...

185
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,409
She's Sophie. The
other one's Sophia.

186
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,518
It's different enough.

187
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,484
They actually have two
completely different derivations.

188
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,058
No, they don't.

189
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,357
I wasn't in a strong negotiating
position. Why is she here?

190
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,424
Ruby dropped her off.
Seemed pretty upset.

191
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,867
Apparently someone forgot
that it was Daddy's night.

192
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,371
She wasn't even gonna leave her

193
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,016
till I said that I was
letting you off early.

194
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,306
Damn it. I just started back on
the team. My schedule's a mess.

195
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,336
If your own kids are
a scheduling item,

196
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,107
maybe you should
let one of them move.

197
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,577
Patient has low platelets,
makes me think DIC.

198
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,929
She doesn't seem
to like that idea.

199
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:24,357
You're right. No
schistocytes in his smear.

200
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,593
He also has a low red count.
What if it's a retroperitoneal bleed?

201
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,754
No Grey-Turner's sign.

202
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,628
She wasn't fussy like that
when I was holding her.

203
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,257
Maybe she likes the
sound of my voice.

204
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:38,499
Which is weird because I have
no genetic connection to her.

205
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,734
Could it be she doesn't
know the difference?

206
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,437
So many children of your own,

207
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,911
no wonder you
have such insight into

208
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,243
my relationship with my babies.

209
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,613
Good point. How could I
comprehend that you're too despised

210
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,203
to keep them from
having the same name,

211
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,345
too overwhelmed to
remember your own calendar,

212
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,054
and too vain to admit
that at this stage,

213
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,817
you don't matter to either baby?

214
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,452
Low white count
suggests infection.

215
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,026
What if you're all right? Low
platelets, plus low red count,

216
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,361
plus low white count equals...

217
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,763
Aplastic anemia.

218
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,100
Kid needs a bone
marrow transplant.

219
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,098
Everyone except Adams transfuse

220
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,334
his platelets till
you find a match.

221
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,186
You started college
a semester late

222
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,222
because you left high
school a semester late

223
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:33,783
because you had five
incompletes in your junior year.

224
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,590
And you're offering
one bad semester

225
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,458
as proof that my
parents screwed me up?

226
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,795
Did okay before that,
straight A's after that.

227
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,698
I went through a
rebellious phase.

228
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,397
Don't tell me. Mom and Dad
were at each other's throats,

229
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,737
and the academic
crisis was a cry for help.

230
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,477
Sorry to mess with your world
view, but I'm not messed up.

231
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,345
So my parents couldn't
have messed me up.

232
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:01,044
Mom's HLA is only a 3/6 match.

233
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,180
Maternal grandmother's
worse than that.

234
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,588
Where'd you unload the baby?

235
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,056
Maternity ward. Shut up.

236
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,254
You realize you're making
House's argument for him.

237
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,558
The part where he said any
parent who uses day care

238
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,344
should ship their child
across the country?

239
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,578
No, the part where he said
that baby doesn't need you.

240
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,179
You've only got her
a couple days a week,

241
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,481
and most of that's spent
with a rotating cast of nurses...

242
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,440
That's how Daddy likes
to spend his time, too.

243
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,510
Shut up. First
cousin's also a whiff.

244
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:27,541
So much for genetics mattering.
I'll try the marrow registry.

245
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,595
Dr. Park is
searching the registry.

246
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,059
Transfusing his platelets will
keep him healthy while we wait.

247
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,366
You sure there's no one on
the father's side of the family?

248
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,859
If one of them's a match,
that'd speed things up a lot.

249
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,756
His parents died young,
he was an only child.

250
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,695
There's no living
relatives that I know of.

251
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,892
Something will turn up soon.

252
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,806
How soon is soon? Will
he miss a lot of school?

253
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,661
I'm actually thinking
of just getting my GED.

254
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,765
How do you expect to
get into a good college?

255
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:59,176
I'm gonna take classes on magic,
juggling, try to make a go of this.

256
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,942
Ben, you keep your grades up,
you can do anything in the world.

257
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,985
Like what? Work in
some boring office?

258
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,781
Do you think my father would
have done that for 10 minutes?

259
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,665
You don't remember your
father. You don't know...

260
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,181
I want to build a
connection with him.

261
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,159
Pass on some of the
joy that he gave me.

262
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:19,926
My...

263
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,159
My back hurts.

264
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,039
His BP's dropping.

265
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,700
<i>We think we've dealt
with all the liability issues.</i>

266
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,038
I'm in a meeting.

267
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,880
Sorry. Since you paged me, I
didn't want to keep you waiting.

268
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,545
Yeah. I paged you,
which means you're next.

269
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,714
That's cool. I'll wait.

270
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,988
That's a good start. Let's
go through it point by point.

271
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,153
First up...

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,195
I'll call you back.

273
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,397
Just got this.

274
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,305
The American Association
of Rheumatology

275
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,005
wants you to speak, 9:00,
Saturday, in Atlantic City.

276
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,839
Dr. Neusinger canceled
on them at the last minute.

277
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,379
I hate conferences.

278
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:16,518
Well, this is a big one.
And it's the premium slot.

279
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,818
I'd like you to do it.

280
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,416
I'll clear it with
your parole officer.

281
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,889
What do I need to do for you?

282
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,564
Halve the clinic hours
that you recently doubled,

283
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:33,401
and double the hooker
budget that you recently halved.

284
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,834
I think you refer
to it as petty cash.

285
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,405
Fine.

286
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:45,376
Just one thing. I'm gonna ask
them to put you on in the morning.

287
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,145
We're doing them a favor. Why
should you have to spend the night?

288
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,420
But you said that 9:00
was the premium slot.

289
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,391
I want to feel like I've
earned my hookers.

290
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,622
The place'll be a madhouse.

291
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,461
Especially since it's 2 miles from
the Rubio fight, at the exact same time.

292
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:05,704
Nice try. You called up, pretended
to be Neusinger, canceled,

293
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,372
then suggested yourself
as a replacement.

294
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,700
You go to that fight,
you go to prison.

295
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,435
Well, that'd be redundant

296
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:15,106
when I have an angry black guy
waiting for me to drop the soap right here.

297
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,116
Better go do some of those
clinic hours I recently doubled.

298
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,581
Test my urine.

299
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,566
Looks like I was wrong
about my diagnosis.

300
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,289
Yeah. I have diabetes.

301
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,423
No. But you're not
a hypochondriac.

302
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,019
Or you'd have imagined
some new disease

303
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,592
after I shot down the first one.

304
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,096
So whose urine is that? Diabetic
girlfriend without health insurance?

305
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:44,008
It's not a scam, I'm sick.
Now I have swollen ankles.

306
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,045
The medical term is cankles.

307
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,938
Is there some black market in
insulin that I don't know about?

308
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,506
It's in my genes.

309
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,986
My old man got diabetes at 50, my older
brother got it at 50, I just turned 50.

310
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,717
Well, that's a great argument
if diabetes was a gold watch.

311
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:02,285
I've got sciatica like my dad,
class-four hemorrhoids like him.

312
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,227
I need to get a
jump on this thing.

313
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,724
We had to stop the transfusion.

314
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,013
Patient's having an allergic
reaction to donor platelets.

315
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,317
No one in Mom's
family's a match,

316
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,349
and as far as she knows,
Dad has no living relatives.

317
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,035
It's been years since he died.

318
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,186
If the kid's dad died
young of melanoma,

319
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,022
how come the overprotective mom

320
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,647
never took him to
a dermatologist?

321
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,164
Are you gonna test
my urine, or what?

322
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,038
Not diabetes.

323
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,711
Use crossmatched platelets,

324
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,137
try to find the patient some
blood that's closer to his own.

325
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,842
And get the real story
on clown senior's death.

326
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,714
Mom's hiding something.

327
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,753
There's a good bet that
it's medically relevant.

328
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:07,452
Apple juice. Easiest way to
fake a spike in blood sugar.

329
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:16,763
His family history of melanoma
may have affected his cellular outlook.

330
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,306
If we had more detail on the exact
type of melanoma his father had...

331
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:25,104
Otherwise we might not be
able to find a marrow match.

332
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,975
He never had melanoma.

333
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,879
How did he die?

334
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,084
He didn't.

335
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:42,455
He lives in Pennsauken, under a
different name. Mitchell Gordon.

336
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,997
How could you keep
this from me? From Ben?

337
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,497
He really needs to know his dad

338
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,332
just breezed in
and out of his life,

339
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,066
drunk and incoherent?

340
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,134
It's better to think the
man's dead but decent.

341
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,620
You realize I have to invite
someone else to the Rubio fight.

342
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,920
Nope. No realization whatsoever.

343
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,926
You have a LoJack on your leg.

344
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,833
I was happy watching
the fight on pay-per-view.

345
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,928
You're the one who
insisted we go to Atlantic City.

346
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,843
Your biological father was a
decent, God-fearing minister,

347
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,974
the guy who raised you
was a cold-hearted jerk.

348
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,728
I'm trying to figure out
why you're so convinced

349
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,312
Adams has
parentally-inflicted damage.

350
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,720
You're trying to deflect.

351
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,222
Now you are.

352
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,658
You have to believe that every
parent screws up every child,

353
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,822
or you were screwed
out of a decent childhood.

354
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,263
My decent
daddy-of-the-cloth was also

355
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,766
being indecent with
my married mom.

356
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,231
He probably would've taken
other kids to the playground.

357
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,844
Not my fault, bad parenting.

358
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,683
Mitchell Gordon?

359
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,967
I've already got a
religion. Go away.

360
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,254
We're doctors.

361
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,185
Your son Ben is in the hospital,

362
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,355
at Princeton-Plainsboro.
He's very sick.

363
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,094
Yeah, well, I don't have
a son. Not anymore.

364
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,069
We know there are
some issues there,

365
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,106
but your bone
marrow could cure him.

366
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,604
There's a hospital 2 miles
from here. It's a simple test...

367
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,543
You said he was at
Princeton-Plainsboro.

368
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:45,216
His mother feels it's better to
do the tests at a different hospital.

369
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,886
Like I said, I don't
have a son anymore.

370
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,765
House isn't gonna give up.
Just tell him about your parents.

371
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,127
Or make up a lie.

372
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,595
I don't want to lie.

373
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,894
And I don't want to
validate his ridiculous theory.

374
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,959
It's not ridiculous. Even
the best-intentioned

375
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,129
parents end up
damaging their kids.

376
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,730
You're a smart,
successful doctor.

377
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,400
How much damage could you have?

378
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,081
Know how I got
interested in medicine?

379
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,515
When my mother drank,
she couldn't handle me,

380
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,177
so she locked me
in my father's study.

381
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,188
Only so many hours you
can cry and bang on the door

382
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,226
before you give up,
find something to read.

383
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:32,162
We all have family dysfunction.
That's why we're successful.

384
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,358
To fill that hole.

385
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,372
My parents have a lot of money.

386
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:45,468
But they didn't make it legally.

387
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,404
White-collar crime?

388
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,347
Started with card
games, high-stakes poker.

389
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,180
Then my dad got into narcotics.

390
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,381
At first just selling,

391
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,084
but then using, too.

392
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,557
Or he never would've
gotten into the slave trade.

393
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,392
Children mostly.

394
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,131
Easier to pack in small crates.

395
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,666
Plus the shipping's
a lot cheaper...

396
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,404
<i>Won't even trust a co-worker.</i>

397
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,534
<i>What did your parents do to you?</i>

398
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,127
You have to go see him yourself.

399
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,616
He wouldn't even come
to the door a second time.

400
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,385
Okay. I'll drive over there.

401
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,426
It's a pleural effusion.

402
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:43,845
He had a bleeding
problem earlier,

403
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,149
must be bleeding into his lungs.

404
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,919
Except there's no blood.

405
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,150
What does that mean?

406
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,568
Means you don't have
to make that drive.

407
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,788
The problem isn't his
marrow, it's his liver.

408
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,095
Liver failure
explains everything.

409
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,969
Question is, what
explains the liver failure?

410
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,940
It's not an infection. We tried
antibiotics, but he's not responding.

411
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,206
More curiously, what
explains the mom lying

412
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,577
about Dad pushing
up squirting daisies?

413
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,243
This is how you plan to
get to that boxing game?

414
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,234
Why are you looking at her?

415
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,448
Because I'm stunned

416
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,958
and I have to look at something.

417
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:45,356
Match, bout, fight,
contest, day, Helena.

418
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:49,963
Almost anything works after
boxing except the word game.

419
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,663
Your bigger
problem is the people

420
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,466
who design those
things aren't idiots.

421
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,227
Can you believe she
used to work in the can?

422
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,036
Nothing is tamper-proof.

423
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:00,355
It's a synthetic problem.

424
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,211
His liver's not
synthesizing proteins,

425
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,180
so fluid is leaking out
of his blood vessels.

426
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:05,717
And Mom's a selfish jerk.

427
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,684
She traded up, married a lawyer,

428
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,721
wants to forget the
lowly circus clown.

429
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,188
You're defending the father

430
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,454
because you feel like a jerk for
baking buns in two different ovens.

431
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,825
You want to believe
the mythical biological

432
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,955
connection excuses
being a man-slut... Ow!

433
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,077
I don't know why I'm starting
to doubt your expertise.

434
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,912
You do have a classified
ad and a piece of metal.

435
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,098
It's temperature that
sets it off, not force.

436
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,141
The rivets go pop, I slide in
the heating pad. Easy peasy.

437
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,439
More likely the patient has
a hyperammonemic problem.

438
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,069
His liver's not
cleaning out his blood,

439
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,823
the buildup of toxins
is causing everything.

440
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,645
I'm defending the dad
because he got screwed.

441
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,513
After he lost his
son, he lost his job,

442
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,483
been in and out of
rehab, gave up clowning.

443
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,714
Yes, as a parent, I empathize.

444
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,119
I say we tell the kid.

445
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,953
He's a minor, the
mom's his guardian,

446
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,855
and it's not even
medically relevant.

447
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,622
She robbed them
of 12 years together.

448
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,221
Or she ripped off
the Band-Aid too late.

449
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:55,301
That memory she let
Son of Bozo establish

450
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,701
is making him chase his
father's moronic profession.

451
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:02,172
When he could be living
the high life in Portland.

452
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,210
And I mean that
metaphorically, of course.

453
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,247
This is where you dazzle
me with your contingency plan.

454
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:22,150
I see why employers are
reluctant to hire ex-cons.

455
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,559
Well, what about the patient?

456
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,403
Is the problem
hyperammonemic or synthetic?

457
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,622
Can't treat for both.

458
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,401
One requires hemodialysis,
the other a liver transplant

459
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:35,984
and we couldn't even get
the kid a marrow match.

460
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,204
Get the mom's consent
to pump him full of protein.

461
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,109
If it's a synthetic
problem, more fluid

462
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,157
will leak into his chest
and his heart will fail.

463
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,945
If it's hyperammonemic,
toxins will

464
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,847
overwhelm his body
and he'll go into a coma.

465
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,038
Do you only like tests that
involve the risk of death?

466
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:52,582
There are some slower, less
conclusive tests, but why take that risk?

467
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,098
In here.

468
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:11,077
Oh, my God. The water.

469
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,644
This is completely my fault.

470
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,414
There are very serious risks,

471
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:23,820
but if we don't figure out what
he has, we can't treat him at all.

472
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,657
I may be a little
out of bounds here,

473
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,234
but in case there
are complications,

474
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,293
might be a good time to
come clean to your son.

475
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:40,339
Let his father visit.

476
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,966
A little out of bounds?

477
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:46,468
I don't know the history, but
everyone makes mistakes.

478
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,602
Your son worships him.

479
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,946
The doctor's right about that.

480
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:51,181
Yeah?

481
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,615
And when did he learn that?

482
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,516
When he encouraged
Ben to drop out of school?

483
00:25:56,822 --> 00:26:00,315
Mitchell is not Ben's father any more
than a sperm donor would've been.

484
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,365
Dr. House?

485
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,466
Unless you're a
locksmith or an electrician

486
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,435
with political
contacts, I'm busy.

487
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:17,135
My husband saw you in the
clinic. Wants treatment for diabetes.

488
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,508
My condolences on
your forthcoming divorce.

489
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,170
He keeps imagining symptoms,

490
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,308
and now I have to make him
these awful anti-diabetic meals.

491
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,751
Since I have no
intention of testing him,

492
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,287
treating him, or
cooking for him...

493
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,888
Could you write me a
fake prescription for insulin?

494
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:36,871
The advantage of
fake prescriptions

495
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,023
is you don't have to be
a real doctor to write one.

496
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,566
Just tell me what's
safe to inject in his thigh.

497
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:47,066
His symptoms will go away and
then I can show him he was never sick.

498
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,936
Water?

499
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,872
Imaginary medicine's
not my specialty.

500
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,403
I do have an imaginary colleague

501
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,605
who's just sent me
an imaginary page.

502
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,047
Imagine how sorry I am.

503
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,054
Still mad about what
happened in the lab?

504
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,493
I'm not mad, I'm
being professional.

505
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:14,793
You claim you're not screwed
up, you may even believe it,

506
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,335
but House doesn't, and I don't.

507
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,802
So you can wait till he camps
out on your parents' lawn,

508
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,430
or you can admit you don't live

509
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,132
on some higher plane
and thank me later.

510
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:25,137
My... My eye feels weird.

511
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,208
What's happening to me?

512
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,554
You look tired.

513
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,592
I hate when people say
that. I know, I look bad.

514
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,854
I thought you were gonna
go to bed early last night.

515
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:46,729
Like an idiot, I went out with my
girlfriends to pretend I have a life.

516
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,630
When all I did
was flirt with guys

517
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,565
who'd have no interest in a mom,

518
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,898
and miss the baby I
couldn't wait to get rid of,

519
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,916
and then get yelled at by my
mom for staying out too late.

520
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,374
You need your own place. Yes.

521
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,411
I moved back home because it
was too drafty at the Four Seasons.

522
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,855
So go back to
work at the hospital.

523
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,508
Day care costs more than
what I earned as a nurse.

524
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,677
Have you considered
sub-standard day care?

525
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,201
Why don't you stay here tonight?

526
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,220
No, I mean in the guest room.

527
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,053
I'll watch the baby again,
you can get a real night's sleep.

528
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,223
You'd do that?

529
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,271
Win-win.

530
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,436
Mommy gets a rest, Daddy
gets more time with his little angel.

531
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,440
There's some sweats
in the closet in the back.

532
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:47,223
Lucky girl, gets another
sleepover with Dada.

533
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,094
Makes a difference,

534
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,465
doesn't it?

535
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,145
Didn't answer
your page last night.

536
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,680
Sorry, battery died.

537
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,910
We got the patient's eye back
in place with steroid injections.

538
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,921
But a bulging eyeball
means it's not a liver problem.

539
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,752
And Mom's determination
to keep Dad away,

540
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,953
even as her kid gets sicker and
sicker, means she's got more to hide.

541
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,587
It's not diagnostically
relevant, let's let it drop.

542
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:27,758
You just lost my vote. You
flip-flopped on parental rights.

543
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,393
I've been trying to
persuade the mother,

544
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,127
but it's her son,
so it's her call.

545
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,513
Well, that's very
evolved of you.

546
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,167
You don't usually see
Darwinian changes over breakfast.

547
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,710
You made nice-nice with Phil.

548
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:44,041
You decided that he'd make a
decent father for Thing Two after all.

549
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,214
I had Sophie again last night,
and Ruby slept in my guest room.

550
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,254
Which has nothing
to do with Phil,

551
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,323
who will never be a
father to my children.

552
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,655
Angioneurotic edema
can cause rapid swelling.

553
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,818
Hey, we're having
a conversation here.

554
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,189
No abdominal pain.

555
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,577
So that must've been nice having

556
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,875
Ruby and the baby
under one roof.

557
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,459
Yes, it was nice having
my daughter in my home.

558
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,164
That's why I would like her
sister to live near my home.

559
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,399
Anasarca?

560
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,783
Swelling would
have followed gravity.

561
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,175
Isn't that getting this whole
parenting thing ass backwards?

562
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,354
Aren't you supposed
to figure out

563
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,075
what you can sacrifice to
maximize their niceness?

564
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:19,151
And do you think I should
sacrifice myself from their lives?

565
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:24,087
Just one life. Until the other one's
mommy meets someone nicer than you.

566
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,748
Swelling that fast and localized

567
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,484
has to come from
the lymph nodes.

568
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,357
Burkitt's lymphoma.

569
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,398
Swelling.

570
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,029
Cankles.

571
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:37,979
That's not a symptom of
Burkitt's. Are you saying...

572
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,337
It's Burkitt's. Prep
him for chemo.

573
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,472
I think you should give House
permission to go to Atlantic City.

574
00:30:57,122 --> 00:31:00,217
We'll stop by the rheumatology
conference. Everyone's covered.

575
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,919
No.

576
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,361
The guy has earned the
right to go to one boxing match.

577
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,228
He's done everything
you've asked.

578
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,268
Funded and staffed
his own department,

579
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,370
hasn't even broken
as much as a traffic law.

580
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,330
You're right.

581
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:16,066
So you'll let him go?

582
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,237
No.

583
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,109
I get why he wants to go to
that fight. I'd love to go myself.

584
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,773
Which is kind of why
I have to stop him.

585
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,408
My job is to be the jerk.

586
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,953
House has to believe that
I have authority over him.

587
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,284
He can't function
under someone's thumb.

588
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,483
I know. Which means
you can't go either.

589
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,326
Your job is to be his friend.

590
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,909
To stay here and sit with him
and watch the fight on pay-per-view

591
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:42,992
while bitching about me.

592
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,535
If we both do our jobs, we might

593
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,103
actually get him
through his parole.

594
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,677
You're right.

595
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,416
Sorry to show up like this.

596
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,923
I was expecting a
battery of lawyers.

597
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,351
No lawyers.

598
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,922
Phil had something
that he would like to say.

599
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,288
So I thought that he
should say it in person.

600
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,857
It was wrong of
me to confront you

601
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,759
about taking Rachel to Portland.

602
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,465
You don't want to
move to Portland?

603
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,033
Of course I do.

604
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,864
But this is about
your daughter, too,

605
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:21,201
and I'm not gonna do something
like this without your support.

606
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:26,508
So, you guys are trying to manipulate
me by playing good cop/good cop?

607
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,736
Is that how little
you think of me?

608
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,418
It's clear you're back
working for House.

609
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,079
I will see you this weekend
when you pick up Sophie.

610
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,480
Sophia.

611
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,133
We actually started
calling her Sophie.

612
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,250
Yeah.

613
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,287
Great.

614
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,427
It's cute.

615
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,099
Cankles.

616
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,266
Is there some problem with
the prescription you gave me?

617
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:01,104
I'm faint, I've been gaining more
weight. I think I need a bigger dose.

618
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,013
If you double his
placebo, he might drown.

619
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:08,216
Also, you forgot to mention
that your heart rate is slow.

620
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,322
My heart rate's not...

621
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,450
52?

622
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,084
The technical term is slow.

623
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:20,799
Those awful anti-diabetic meals
you eat, do they contain bok choy?

624
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,565
A pound of it. Every day.

625
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,001
Bok choy has glucosinolates,

626
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,405
which inhibit thyroid function
and account for all your symptoms.

627
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,967
So, this isn't diabetes?

628
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,637
You have a bad case of irony.

629
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:38,650
The food that you're eating to stop
making you sick is making you sick.

630
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:42,020
Maybe I don't have my
father's crummy genes after all.

631
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,885
On the other hand, maybe you're

632
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,854
fat enough to get
diabetes even without him.

633
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,065
I can't believe I have cancer.

634
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,931
We caught it early.
You should be okay.

635
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,197
I could die. I never went
anywhere, did anything.

636
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:05,800
If my father had lived, everything
would have been different.

637
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:10,548
Your mom and stepdad love you,
they've given you a great home.

638
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,779
That counts for a lot.

639
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,819
He's crashing,
everything's shutting down.

640
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,737
Renal failure, lung failure, heart
failure, all before we started chemo.

641
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:35,467
Burkitt's lymphoma is
fast-moving, but not this fast.

642
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:42,939
No rush. ICU stands for
"take your time" in Latin.

643
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,114
Multiple aneurysms.

644
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:48,347
That would mean every symptom
after his TIA was a coincidence.

645
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,978
Cholesterol emboli.

646
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,646
Bingo! Fits perfectly.

647
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,749
Check the file, confirm that we
did major abdominal surgery on him,

648
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,226
and then completely
forgot about it.

649
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,260
House.

650
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,368
Hello.

651
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:08,950
What the hell are
you doing here?

652
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,205
I was told this might be my
last chance to see my son.

653
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,171
You had no right. This
is none of your business!

654
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,372
I didn't... I called him.

655
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,181
This man is Ben's hero. Let
them spend five minutes together.

656
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,612
No. You get out of here!

657
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:31,621
Wait.

658
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,067
You sexually molested your son.

659
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,206
Your walk, tabes dorsalis.

660
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,674
You have late-stage syphilis.

661
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:49,511
Which you gave to our patient,
presumably 12 years ago.

662
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:53,016
Which also explains why Mom
is not big on family reunions.

663
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,221
I shouldn't be here.

664
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:09,164
We tested him for
syphilis, he was negative.

665
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:12,830
After 12 years, the active
infection would have died down

666
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,235
everywhere except
the arteries in his brain,

667
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,137
where it could hide
out from our tests.

668
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:21,236
When that six-year-old heckler
punched him in his juggling pins,

669
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,077
<i>it kicked up the dormant
bacteria in his pelvis.</i>

670
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,209
<i>The immunosuppressants we
gave him sent it into overdrive.</i>

671
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,846
<i>The antibiotics we gave him
actually started destroying the syphilis.</i>

672
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,187
<i>But like pouring
water on a fire,</i>

673
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,589
<i>led to a trail of
toxic smoke and ash,</i>

674
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,925
<i>which made his immune
system overcompensate.</i>

675
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,521
Severe
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.

676
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,757
Is this true? HOUSE: Yes.

677
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,735
Jarisch-Herxheimer is
real. It sounds silly but...

678
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,733
You mean the... Right.

679
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,446
I found stains on his clothes.

680
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:04,184
He didn't understand and
he didn't seem traumatized.

681
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:09,552
I kept trying to talk to him,
but before long, he'd forgotten.

682
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,357
And he seemed...

683
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,764
He seemed happy,
and he seemed normal.

684
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,386
So you made Daddy
go away, and you made

685
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,028
sure Junior had no
reason to go looking.

686
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,271
I was just trying
to protect him,

687
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:26,472
like I should have
done from the start.

688
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,615
I'm sorry.

689
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:37,415
IV penicillin and anti-TNF
antibodies, he'll be fine.

690
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,254
Apart from the whole
daddy-rape thing.

691
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,962
We're not done.

692
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,764
No, we are not.

693
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:55,170
Notify the dad's sexual
partners, notify his employer,

694
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,265
his landlord, notify the police.

695
00:37:57,342 --> 00:38:00,801
I meant the kid. We're not
gonna tell him he was molested?

696
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,438
To make him miserable,
or to forfeit your license?

697
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,609
To tell him the truth.

698
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,084
He's a virgin, how
do I explain the STD?

699
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:11,089
It's a medical diagnosis. Screw
the parents, the kid's our patient.

700
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:15,116
I guess Taub's got a tough choice
to make when the kid wakes up.

701
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:16,388
Why is it my choice?

702
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:17,757
Because you're a dad.

703
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,196
How could the rest of
us possibly understand?

704
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:31,871
What was wrong with me?

705
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,709
It's called syphilis.

706
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:39,683
Uh...

707
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,450
You can get that
without having sex?

708
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,363
I didn't tell him.

709
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,467
Your heart said
he needed to know,

710
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,840
your brain knew he's
better off without it.

711
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,209
Following your heart is easy.
Following your brain is tough.

712
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,909
Especially after
years of following

713
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,145
that much smaller, third organ.

714
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:20,548
That's why all parents
screw up all children.

715
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,731
Evening.

716
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:38,775
Clever tactic, pretending
you're not interested anymore.

717
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:43,548
How could that
possibly work as a tactic?

718
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,013
The fact is, once I
saw those incompletes,

719
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,948
I knew your parents
screwed you up.

720
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,884
The details are just gravy.

721
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,424
You're wrong.

722
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:57,923
The only evidence you have
is proof of something else.

723
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,733
I ran away from home.

724
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,403
Because you had lousy parents.

725
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,473
Because I didn't.

726
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:16,243
All my friends' parents were
divorced, or having affairs,

727
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:19,113
or barely knew
their kids' birthdays.

728
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,317
You envied their dysfunction?

729
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,656
I thought it made
them deeper somehow.

730
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,328
It was stupid.

731
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:39,494
I hitchhiked to Manhattan,
moved in with an older guy.

732
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,335
In two months I
came running home.

733
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,137
Took my parents
years to get over it.

734
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:51,340
That's when you started to excel.
You were making it up to them.

735
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,181
Your parents screwed you
up by not screwing you up.

736
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,420
How does briefly wishing I was
screwed up make me screwed up?

737
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,823
It's normal to be screwed up. It's
really screwed up to romanticize it.

738
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,765
Guess that's why you
wanted to work with prisoners.

739
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,431
It's why I wanted
to work with you.

740
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,339
It was a tactic.

741
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,390
Chris. Yeah.

742
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,367
I need to talk to you and Phil.

743
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,962
Is everything okay?

744
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,034
Yeah.

745
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,253
I can't let you move.

746
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,317
You drove all the
way out here just

747
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,085
to tell us what you
already told us?

748
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,425
I'm sorry.

749
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,942
House, open up. I don't
want to miss the opening bell.

750
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,570
House?

751
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:44,058
<i>Telecast, and we expect an
electric atmosphere in the arena</i>

752
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:48,122
<i>and a sell-out crowd of about
10,000 for Rubio vs. Santos.</i>

753
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,224
<i>Two great fighters
with illustrious careers</i>

754
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,600
<i>might have been expected
to meet a long time ago.</i>

755
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,865
<i>As for Santos,
his handlers tell us</i>

756
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,568
<i>that he's done more roadwork
than at any time in his career,</i>

757
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:00,976
<i>hoping to prove tonight that
he can box for 12 full rounds.</i>

758
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,548
<i>Significant, because
Santos hasn't heard</i>

759
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,150
<i>the final bell in
more than six years.</i>

760
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,378
<i>He comes in with 11
straight knockout wins.</i>

761
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:11,287
<i>He saw how a
power-puncher with a left hook</i>

762
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,654
<i>was able to cut Rubio
over the right eye</i>

763
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,090
<i>in the 10th round
of that last fight.</i>
