1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,929
Come on!

2
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,447
Yeah!

3
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,912
Hatchet! Hatchet!

4
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,680
Hatchet! Hatchet!

5
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:57,757
<i>Come on, Toros!
Let's make some noise!</i>

6
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,755
Nice to meet the
pride of Trois-RiviÃ¨res.

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,919
I still got your
Wings rookie card.

8
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:04,069
So what's that worth?
Well, it's a collector's item.

9
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,644
They don't make
them like you anymore.

10
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,660
So you want to go?

11
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,895
Square up. Good luck.

12
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,690
He didn't get a hand on you?

13
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,361
You're gonna be
a force in the show.

14
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,273
Hatchet! Hatchet! Hatchet!

15
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,061
Hatchet! Hatchet! Hatchet!

16
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,730
Come on, Toros!

17
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,148
Get a trainer over here!

18
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,462
Capacity crowd is on its
feet, five seconds on the clock.

19
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,965
Ah!

20
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,669
How is it possible for one man
to be blessed with so much skill?

21
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,706
I had one just like this, except
it was Bruins and the Habs.

22
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:58,802
Where'd you get it?

23
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,475
Birthday present for
someone in pediatric oncology.

24
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,849
Twenty-two-year-old
enforcer with hemoptysis.

25
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:06,976
He's a hockey player?

26
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,147
No, he's a superhero.

27
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,884
He's coughing up blood
because he probably broke a rib

28
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,358
and punctured a lung while
breaking someone else's rib

29
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,395
and puncturing their
lung in the name of sport.

30
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:20,627
Nice conclusion, to which the
ER already jumped 18 hours ago.

31
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,636
Short man equals bullied child.

32
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,195
I was average height as
a kid. And never bullied.

33
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,398
Until now.

34
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:31,811
X-ray ruled out traumatic
sequelae, overt TB and lung cancer.

35
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,576
Sarcoidosis. Nodules could be
too small to show up on an X-ray.

36
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,241
But fighting's the
best part of hockey.

37
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,842
Without it, you've
got the Ice Capades.

38
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,717
Fighting has nothing
to do with hockey.

39
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,665
It's like the cheerleaders
at a basketball game.

40
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,434
Cheerleading's the
best part of basketball.

41
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,927
Without it, you've
got basketball.

42
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,589
He's a duck hunter.

43
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,494
He could have contracted
psittacosis from exposure to fowl.

44
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,000
He had three teeth
knocked out two weeks ago.

45
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,036
Infection could have
led to oral bleeding.

46
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,662
Not without
continuing dental pain.

47
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,434
Then he took an
elbow to the gut,

48
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,786
which caused an esophageal tear.

49
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,176
Chase, CT the patient,
check for sarcoid.

50
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,214
Adams, sputum cultures
and serologies for psittacosis.

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,011
Taub, I'd tell you
why I think your theory

52
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,279
is not just wrong
but ill-conceived,

53
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:16,379
but it's more fun to prove it by
having you check the stool for blood.

54
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,189
Now while we wait for the
stool fairy, I'm a man down.

55
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,753
So if you want to drop
your pants and hit the ice.

56
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,009
<i>The faster you guys
can do this, the better.</i>

57
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,434
The NHL's been sniffing around,

58
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,048
and being in the hospital's not
really helping my marketability, so...

59
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,200
You have to be pretty
good to get called up.

60
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,072
Yeah, leading the
league in penalty minutes.

61
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,703
And visits to the ER, not
counting the ones you've caused.

62
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,574
Not a hockey fan, I gather?

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,014
I am, that's the point. Fighting
cheapens a great sport.

64
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,747
Oh, come on. That's like
saying passing cheapens football.

65
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,879
It's part of the game.

66
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,547
I don't cause injuries.

67
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,716
They're self-inflicted?

68
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,952
No, I prevent them.

69
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,022
I take the hits, so the
smaller guys don't have to.

70
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,376
I thought you'd appreciate that.

71
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,814
Neighbor's baby again?

72
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,446
I could hear it
through earplugs,

73
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,147
two pillows, and
three sleeping pills.

74
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,184
Hmm.

75
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,991
What is wrong with you?

76
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,429
I just said, "Hmm."

77
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,991
You're trying to figure out
some deeper significance

78
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,546
to my having a
couple of crappy nights.

79
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,506
Which one of us is analyzing
the word "hmm" here?

80
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,643
Fine. I'm sorry.

81
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,269
Apology accepted.

82
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,916
However, it's not the crying
that's keeping you awake.

83
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:54,819
The sound of a needy child
is stirring your paternal juices.

84
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,119
The sound of a needy
child at 112 decibels

85
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,854
has stirred my inner
murderer. Don't mess with me.

86
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:04,363
Explain the stains on
your shirt. You're lactating.

87
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,995
The fact that
you're the only fruit

88
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,468
on your family tree
is getting to you.

89
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:19,545
It's not a big deal. So I'll
probably never be a dad.

90
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,810
It sucks. I'll lose
a little sleep, but...

91
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,217
You're not supposed to feel
bad when you dodge a bullet.

92
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,799
It's like you've
got survivor's guilt.

93
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,789
There are actually
things in this world

94
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,381
that give life even more meaning

95
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,016
than soap operas
and monster trucks.

96
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,522
And we happen to be missing
out on at least one of them.

97
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,160
You remember the falconer?

98
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,507
Beth?

99
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,043
You dated two falconers?

100
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,202
Yes, Beth.

101
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,876
The night the
two of you split up,

102
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,885
you came around to my place,

103
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,920
wallowing in
self-pity and tequila.

104
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,190
You passed out.

105
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,525
She called that night. Asked
me to give you a message.

106
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,426
She said she was pregnant.

107
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,767
Which, God and Planned
Parenthood willing,

108
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:23,173
means you are the
father of an 11-year-old.

109
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:31,617
I told you the next
morning. Hypothetically.

110
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,381
I asked you how you'd feel
if Beth had gotten pregnant,

111
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:40,052
and you said, and I quote, "It
would be the worst mistake of my life."

112
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,890
And scene.

113
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,527
Two performances
Sunday, dark Mondays?

114
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,972
Just as well.

115
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,779
I want to kill my mother.

116
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,013
My Popo's on her own

117
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,390
and my mother always
needs me to take care of her.

118
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,794
Well, you could
kill Popo instead.

119
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,766
I have to take her shopping,
to her friends, to Atlantic City.

120
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,328
I love her, but every
night, every weekend...

121
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,929
And only if there
was some solution,

122
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,602
some place where you could live.

123
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,905
That's not there.

124
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:35,278
My mom would freak. It would
be the ultimate sign of disrespect.

125
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,112
Okay. Then stay.

126
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,258
And maybe you'd consider
not bitching about it?

127
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,918
Not everyone's lucky enough
to have your independence.

128
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,922
Don't worry. When you lose
your family, you'll have it, too.

129
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,925
He doesn't have sarcoid.

130
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,833
Look at that. That's his spleen.

131
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,029
I know, but he's
gotten it supersized.

132
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,802
Deep vein thrombosis, caused by
any one of his many injuries or surgeries.

133
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,036
Leukemia's a better fit.

134
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:05,772
We have a guy who is punishing
his body on a daily basis.

135
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,690
Don't you think that's a
more likely cause than cancer?

136
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,307
No, because she
doesn't have an agenda.

137
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,547
Well, that was
incredibly unprofessional.

138
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,278
Although, it's
really Taub's fault.

139
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,449
If you're not prepared to
slam her into the board,

140
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,084
she's got no reason
not to go after you.

141
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,895
Might I suggest pulling her
jersey over her head first?

142
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:26,330
We should get an ultrasound
for DVT and WBC for leukemia.

143
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,298
You think I could have cancer?

144
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,807
More likely it's just a DVT.

145
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,437
This is my agent.
I gotta take this.

146
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,004
Yeah.

147
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,847
Give me some good news, Kenny.

148
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,648
I thought you said "any day".

149
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,190
Okay. All right.

150
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,057
I gotta go.

151
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,555
I called Beth.

152
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,727
I have an 11-year-old son.

153
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,805
Liver failure could
alter hormone levels,

154
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,746
cause abnormal
breast development.

155
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,809
Alcoholism. We should search
his home and locker room.

156
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,320
Note that the person who
wants to search the home

157
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,720
didn't sleep in one last night.

158
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,749
You have the imprint of a
seatbelt buckle on your cheek.

159
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,457
I got in a fight with my mother.

160
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,425
She hit you with a seatbelt?

161
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,729
It could be hemochromatosis.

162
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,146
Explains the liver
and the spleen,

163
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,661
but hemoptysis is a stretch.

164
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:12,831
What about leptospirosis?

165
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:13,965
That's a good fit.

166
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,651
If you ignore the fact
that he's a pro athlete

167
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,166
who looks like
the Incredible Hulk,

168
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,746
which means he's got to be
on steroids, which is a better fit.

169
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,542
All we really know
for sure is that

170
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,845
it was his evil job that
caused the problems.

171
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,579
Yes, I don't like him. Doesn't
mean my judgment's affected.

172
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,316
Maybe. Let's take a
look at the instant replay.

173
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:33,659
This is the hit that
precipitated Booby Orr's fight.

174
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,456
Dirty or clean?

175
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,563
- The hit was clean.
- Really?

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,993
The guy released the puck at
least a second before the hit.

177
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,971
We have a difference
of opinion. That's all.

178
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,803
Absolutely.

179
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,405
Maybe she's as biased as you.

180
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,412
Or maybe the entire league is.

181
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:57,041
After review, the league
disciplinary commissioner ruled the hit

182
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,643
illegal and dangerous, and
suspended the player for three games.

183
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,315
Adams and Taub, run
antibody titers for lepto.

184
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,325
Chase and Park, check out the
home, the locker room for booze,

185
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,226
steroids and Taub's objectivity.

186
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,766
At least you're free.

187
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,027
You gonna get your own place?

188
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,895
If I can find a place
I can afford, so no.

189
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,613
If you want, you can crash at
my place. Got a spare bedroom.

190
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,910
That might be kind of weird.

191
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,342
I live in an apartment,
not a dungeon.

192
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,083
It's just two single
people, opposite sex.

193
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,690
Your bedroom door
has a lock on the inside.

194
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,702
Hey, if you prefer
your car, be my guest.

195
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,805
Scrip for ganciclovir.

196
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:03,080
If his neighbor has mono,
it could mean he has mono.

197
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,450
If he has mono, explains
his spleen and hemoptysis.

198
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:11,490
And it's caused by the Epstein-Barr
virus, which explains his liver.

199
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,224
And my moonroof leaks.

200
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,327
Thank you.

201
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,970
Why don't we just assume
that you're not the dad?

202
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,687
Well, either you're the dad

203
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,509
or she cheated on
you with your dad.

204
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,774
Oh!

205
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,247
Sand art. I used to love this.

206
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,443
He's bitter, not
mentally handicapped.

207
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,353
Who knows what Beth
told him about you?

208
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:47,325
At worst, you're a rapist.
At best, you're a rapist.

209
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,295
Maybe she said I
was a dead war hero.

210
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:53,595
Raised by a lunatic mother
and abandoned by his father.

211
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,169
Oh, I know, squirrel handcuffs.

212
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,601
You think he's got any of those?

213
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,196
If you really wanted me to do
nothing with this information,

214
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,517
then why did you give it to me?

215
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,840
Because you
were pining for a kid

216
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,503
and you deserved to know
that you already had one.

217
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,605
But your paternal cravings are
more theoretical than applied.

218
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,550
You want vicarious immortality

219
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,019
more than you want
a lifelong burden.

220
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,022
You're assuming he's
gonna be a nightmare.

221
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,853
What if he's a good kid?

222
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,895
He's a kid. Best you can
hope for is he's a nightmare.

223
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,126
House, I'm not naive. I realize
that this thing could go very badly,

224
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,035
but the point is my son wants to
meet me, and I want to meet him.

225
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,632
Popo, I presume.

226
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,874
Hey. I let myself in.

227
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,036
This is... We've met.

228
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,608
I thought the whole point of
this was to get away from Popo.

229
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,209
My dad's getting a cyst removed

230
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,755
and my mother had
to take him to the clinic.

231
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,053
Don't worry, she'll
be gone in an hour.

232
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,151
I'm not worried
because it's not my issue.

233
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,726
She seems awfully quiet.

234
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,664
You haven't seen her drunk.

235
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,976
Bobby?

236
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,426
I found him crying
in the fetal position.

237
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,695
It's not a new symptom.

238
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,463
He's crying because
his liver failure

239
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,680
threw his hormones out of whack.

240
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,866
Aside from the crying, he's
actually recovering nicely.

241
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,584
Aside from the guy
in the book depository,

242
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,203
the Kennedys had
a lovely trip to Dallas.

243
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,472
Repetitive blows to the head

244
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,980
can cause chronic
traumatic encephalopathy,

245
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,514
the symptoms of which are
aggressive behavior and depression.

246
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,610
So your theory is that
his aggressive behavior

247
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,314
caused his aggressive behavior?

248
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,447
He's not depressed,
he's just bummed,

249
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,355
because he knows
he's a talentless moron

250
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,155
who's only one lost fight
away from being a barista.

251
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,864
I understand that can
get to a guy after a while.

252
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,525
If he quits being an
enforcer, it could save his life.

253
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,398
You don't want to save his life.

254
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,734
You want to kill his career.

255
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,508
I moved into Chase's apartment.

256
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,146
He knows. He was staring
at our matching cups.

257
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,374
I told you we
should have split up.

258
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,577
We're not having
sex. With each other.

259
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,078
Yet. Yes.

260
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,247
Yes?

261
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:08,220
I just mean no one knows the future
right now, so we don't really know...

262
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:16,032
The only conclusive test
for CTE is post-mortem.

263
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:19,334
But an MRI of his brain could
reveal white matter disintegrity,

264
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,874
which is the effect of CTE.

265
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,705
Why? Are you trying
to sleep with her?

266
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,938
'Cause a simpler
technique is just to ask.

267
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,911
I was doing something nice. No.

268
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,779
That doesn't fit.

269
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,216
He's only had three
concussions since he was 10.

270
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,549
It's not enough to cause CTE.

271
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,282
Three reported concussions.

272
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,709
These guys are taught in high
school how to dupe the tests.

273
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,723
Guilt? This is really insulting.

274
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,025
It's not guilt.
Park is a friend.

275
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:45,857
So it's guilt.

276
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:50,495
Chase convinced you to leave
Mommy and now he feels responsible.

277
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,399
No MRI.

278
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,236
Do a psych eval, if he doesn't
start weeping again, send him home.

279
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,750
Dr. Wilson?

280
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,112
Duncan?

281
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,914
James.

282
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,187
Nice to meet you.

283
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,154
It's nice to meet you.

284
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,493
Um...

285
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,768
How are you doing?

286
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,929
Good.

287
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,472
Good.

288
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,003
I got you this.

289
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,206
Oh.

290
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,481
Thank you.

291
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,477
Go ahead. Okay.

292
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,489
It's got three games built-in,

293
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,290
but you can download
more from the website.

294
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,323
I know.

295
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,527
You already have one.

296
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,528
I can always use a backup.

297
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,399
Hi. Can I start you
with something to drink?

298
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,971
Just water, please.

299
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,336
You got a GameDeck?
Way to go, Dad.

300
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,705
According to your psych eval,

301
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,241
the only thing happier
than you is Disneyland.

302
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,272
I'm sorry you had to
see me like that last night.

303
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:19,725
I'm just upset about being in the
hospital, I'm on some weird meds.

304
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,522
But they must be working,
because I'm feeling a lot better now.

305
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:28,724
Depression could be the
symptom of a serious illness, CTE.

306
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,895
Yeah. My aunt sends me
every article she can find on it.

307
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,181
Then you know it could kill you.

308
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,935
In the long run,
like a lot of things.

309
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,031
You might be right.

310
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,236
And an MRI could confirm that.

311
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:42,873
I have enough evidence of head
trauma in my file already, so...

312
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:51,021
My mom said you had trouble maintaining
relationships with normal people.

313
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,051
She also said you
were a nice guy.

314
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,755
I always figured she was lying

315
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,889
'cause she didn't want me
to hate my deadbeat dad.

316
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,059
I didn't know.

317
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,728
I know, now.

318
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,771
You're a bright kid.

319
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,868
Thanks to you. Thanks to my mom,

320
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,811
I'm also a big,
soft-hearted wuss.

321
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,240
I think you may have
gotten that from both of us.

322
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,756
I got to go, but it was
really nice meeting you.

323
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,591
It was nice meeting you, Duncan.

324
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,810
You want to hang out again?

325
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,128
Absolutely. Tonight?

326
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,260
Tonight?

327
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,767
Well, I... There's...

328
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,670
That would be great.

329
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,911
Okay. I'll text you.

330
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,057
Thank you. How'd
you talk him into it?

331
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,152
He agreed once I
promised him anonymity.

332
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,960
Mr. and Mrs. Doe liked
the name John, apparently.

333
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,796
Unfortunately, we just wasted
his time and proved House right.

334
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,369
Nothing?

335
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,230
What about that?
That's an artifact.

336
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,639
That's a density.

337
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,488
I know you think I'm
convincing myself,

338
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,708
but this brain has been
hammered for years,

339
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,182
meaning evidence may
be subtle, but it's there.

340
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,050
<i>Meaning you see
what you want to see.</i>

341
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,724
<i>Unless, of course, Chase is an
idiot and I do have brain damage.</i>

342
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,093
Patient's stroking out.

343
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,760
<i>Chase. Can you get me out of...</i>

344
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,064
<i>Oh...</i>

345
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:46,929
<i>Hello?</i>

346
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,715
The good news is it's
isolated ophthalmoplegia,

347
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,444
which means he
didn't have a stroke.

348
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:01,953
Bad news is Taub was
right. You're still sick.

349
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,117
I said "right", not "competent".

350
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,918
Bursts your CTE bubble. You're
gonna need a whole new theory

351
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,463
to keep Uncle Jesse and
his Olsen Twins on the bench.

352
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:14,762
Can we discuss my
incompetence somewhere else?

353
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,571
Dr. House. Could I
talk to you for a minute?

354
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,116
Could be neurosyphilis.

355
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,285
He's only 22.

356
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,555
And he's been on the
road since he was 14.

357
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:46,997
So he was trash even
before he was trash?

358
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,761
Are you curious
about what he wanted?

359
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,928
I assume he wanted
me off the case,

360
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:53,438
and you told him I was
hit in the head as a child,

361
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,441
and your mother made you
promise to take care of me.

362
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,568
He was doing what
he always does.

363
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,943
Sticking up for the little guy.

364
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,413
He told me to apologize to you,

365
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,976
or he would excrete
down my throat.

366
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,813
I'm paraphrasing.

367
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,448
So if he should ask,
I was a gentleman,

368
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,152
or I will excrete
down your throat.

369
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,729
Microscopic polyangiitis fits.

370
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,228
We should start
plasmapheresis immediately.

371
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,768
We need to run an ANCA
panel to confirm first.

372
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,913
Putting him on plasmapheresis
could make him bleed out.

373
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,371
MPA can progress quickly.

374
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,636
We may not have time
before it reaches his lungs.

375
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:34,305
I think you're right, thus
confirming my objectivity.

376
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,279
Start the treatment.

377
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,285
Miserable yet?

378
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:53,791
He's polite, well-adjusted,
and a straight-A student.

379
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,029
Which means he doesn't need you.

380
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,114
So why don't you get out
while the butterfly effect

381
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,663
is still in the cocoon stage.

382
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,105
I'm making him dinner.

383
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,302
You don't make an
11-year-old dinner.

384
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,971
You give him a
jar of peanut butter.

385
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,139
It'll be fine.

386
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,409
I could give this
kid a quinoa salad

387
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,860
and he would eat
it just to be nice.

388
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,513
'Cause he's a gutless
placater, just like his dad.

389
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,644
He's nice.

390
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,450
This is a terrible idea.

391
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,604
Because we like each other?

392
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,322
Yes. Because of the
statement, "We like each other."

393
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,761
You've known him 25 minutes.

394
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,527
All you know about him is that
he'd lie about a quinoa salad,

395
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,862
whatever the hell that is.

396
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,271
You're jealous of an 11-year-old

397
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,603
because you are an 11-year-old.

398
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,850
So tell me about yourself.

399
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:52,447
I mean you're smart,
you're nice, but what else?

400
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,857
I don't know. I'm a kid.

401
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:58,053
Right.

402
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,529
What are you looking for?

403
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:04,734
Nothing.

404
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,804
You want peanut butter?

405
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,669
Do you have prosciutto?

406
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,143
You like prosciutto? I'm weird.

407
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,844
No! No, I like it, too.

408
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,917
I've got some in the fridge.
How about goat cheese?

409
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,413
I love goat cheese.

410
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,231
I think that was the
best pizza I ever had.

411
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,435
It was the hint of Dijon.

412
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:43,765
Do you have any aunts
or uncles or grandparents?

413
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,441
My mom got into some
stupid fight with my grandfather.

414
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,912
They all kind of cut us off.

415
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,005
Hmm.

416
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,051
Are you talking to your parents?

417
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:57,385
Yes, and they're going to be very
surprised and excited to meet you.

418
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,186
That's awesome.

419
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,955
<i>You have arrived
at your destination.</i>

420
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,761
Well... Thanks for the pizza.

421
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:09,130
Sure. Sure. I mean, it was
great to spend time with you.

422
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:12,928
I love you, Dad.

423
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,596
It can't be easy
doing what you do.

424
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,000
I mean, do you love it?

425
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,101
Is it fun?

426
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:53,677
I had my own plastic surgery
practice, making lots of money.

427
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,773
But I wasn't happy. It wasn't
what I went to med school for.

428
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:15,928
Every winter, my dad would
flood the backyard and make a rink.

429
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,596
I was Lemieux, my
little brother was Gretzky.

430
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,472
I was good. I won the NDHA
scoring title three years in a row.

431
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:28,378
I kept getting bigger
and stronger and better.

432
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,711
Until I didn't.

433
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:35,516
My Juniors coach told me that
if I wanted to stay on the team,

434
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:38,022
that I'd have to use my size.

435
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,620
Every game, I got
less and less ice time,

436
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:46,222
until it was all
fighting and no hockey.

437
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,808
There's something
going on with my arms.

438
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,712
I can't feel them! Doctor,
I can't feel my arms.

439
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,384
Patient's arms
are now paralyzed.

440
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,888
ANCA panel was
negative. It's not MPA.

441
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,457
Lyme disease could
cause paralysis,

442
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,356
if he was hunting, he'd
be exposed to ticks.

443
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,191
No target rash or
cardiac involvement.

444
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,696
Roomies with benefits
keeping you up?

445
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,894
Cribbage. I played
with Park's Popo.

446
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,900
Is that two separate events?

447
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,737
Her grandmother. ALS
could explain the symptoms.

448
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,868
Sensory involvement
rules out ALS.

449
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,311
Okay, now this is interesting.

450
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,924
We'll get back to the
patient in a second.

451
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,917
Your issue is the
same as Wilson's.

452
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,919
Except you're haunted by
the pitter-patter of tiny skanks.

453
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,580
You don't feel guilty about
getting Park thrown out of her home.

454
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,592
You feel guilty about all the
women that you've screwed over.

455
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,424
My mother needs 1,000
bucks for snow tires.

456
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,828
Park's a friend, Popo's fun.

457
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,868
Paralysis has gone
from his face to his arms,

458
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:59,666
meaning it's descending,
which is the hallmark of botulism.

459
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,539
So it was something
he ate. How innocuous.

460
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,840
You've overcome
your bias by reversing it.

461
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,380
The only problem is that
being in love with the patient

462
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:11,042
is just as judgmental
as being in hate.

463
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,160
We didn't find any
contaminated...

464
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,346
No contaminated
food, I'm not an idiot.

465
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,685
But what if it's not from
ingesting, but from injecting?

466
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,851
He was treated for intractable
muscle spasms by the team's trainers.

467
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,020
Sometimes they use Botox.

468
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,029
We need to start the antitoxin.

469
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,089
The antitoxin could
cause anaphylaxis.

470
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,134
We need to test
first to confirm.

471
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,566
As if to prove my point.

472
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:33,196
Last time you said there
wasn't enough time to test

473
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,797
prior to a more
dangerous treatment.

474
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,685
It's a different situation, a different
symptom, a different diagnosis.

475
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,975
Different emotion.
Give him the antitoxin.

476
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,014
Anything?

477
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,612
No adverse effects.

478
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,803
Chase let me move in with him
to get away from my grandmother,

479
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:10,000
then he practically let my
grandmother move in with the both of us.

480
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,169
He's being way more than nice.

481
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,271
Then which answer is it?

482
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,284
Chase feels guilty for
pushing you to move out?

483
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:20,512
He didn't push me.

484
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,485
Guilt about skanks?
He loves skanks.

485
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:23,782
It's not the other option.

486
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,118
There are people that like me,

487
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,921
people who even
want to sleep with me.

488
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,155
Some of them are
even good looking.

489
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:31,628
That good looking?

490
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,095
Did you see that?

491
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,770
You're feeling something?

492
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,606
Yeah.

493
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,550
I could give you crap for
making me wait 11 years,

494
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,055
but instead I'm gonna thank you

495
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:01,321
for not making me
wait another 11.

496
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,489
Every little girl wants a pony

497
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,464
until they have
to clean up after it.

498
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,831
You think I'm gonna quit
on this? On an 11-year-old?

499
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,221
The only relationship you
haven't quit on has been with me.

500
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,796
Hmm. A needy,
truculent narcissist.

501
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,002
I think it's been the perfect
training for parenthood.

502
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:20,973
That's not even close.

503
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,380
This is the rest of your life.

504
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,915
If you screw this up,
you don't get to run away.

505
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,555
You get to ruin both your lives.

506
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,089
This is a bigger responsibility

507
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,685
than any you've ever
taken on, and screwed up.

508
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,228
I know.

509
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,031
That's why I'm
so excited about it.

510
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,070
You're really happier doing
this than looking at boobs all day?

511
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,240
Luckily, I get patients like
you every now and again

512
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,580
who let me
re-experience the joy.

513
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,085
You know the best part of my day

514
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,680
is when I'm sitting
in that penalty box

515
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,385
after I beat someone up.

516
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,793
It's the only time
I know I'm safe.

517
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:13,024
Think Lemieux
ever felt that way?

518
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,157
I'm not going back.

519
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,256
To hockey?

520
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,428
To enforcing.
Whatever that costs.

521
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,870
Good for you.

522
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,499
Oh!

523
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,544
First goal for the
Pocket Rocket.

524
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,413
Bobby?

525
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,713
We need a team in here!

526
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:43,292
He's completely paralyzed and
he tested negative for botulism.

527
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,831
I am now accepting long shots.

528
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,263
Polio?

529
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,482
Some kids were never vaccinated.

530
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,943
Unless they played sports all their
lives and had two physicals a year.

531
00:32:58,777 --> 00:32:59,972
How about MLD?

532
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,308
That's a bad fit.

533
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,292
I say that not because
there's no treatment for MLD,

534
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,477
but because it's a bad fit.

535
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,143
His cognitive abilities
are unaffected.

536
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,078
Prion disease could explain the
waxing and waning symptoms.

537
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,646
The test for prions
is a brain biopsy.

538
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,590
And given his history,
there's got to be brain swelling.

539
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,787
We can't risk
drilling into his skull.

540
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:17,989
Pretty sure we can.

541
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:22,295
We also could keep talking until we
can find an answer we all can agree on.

542
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,999
What, all of us? Those of us
who love him, those who hate him?

543
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,096
Those who don't give a
crap about him or you?

544
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,301
Or I could just discuss it
on my own with Foreman.

545
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,639
He's not your friend.

546
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,509
I get it, he's a patient.

547
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:37,447
I'm not... He never
had your back.

548
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,009
He didn't insist that
I apologize to you.

549
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,457
He asked me to
take you off the case.

550
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,463
Biopsy his brain.

551
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,898
Hey, Dad.

552
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:04,975
Hey.

553
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:10,307
Sorry I'm late. Got in a fight
with my mom. She is such a tool.

554
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,748
I'm sure she means well.

555
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,651
She wants to open a reserve in
Costa Rica for rescued birds of prey.

556
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,991
But how serious is she?

557
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,257
From my recollection, she
used to talk about doing a lot.

558
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,355
Yeah, but she bought
plane tickets for Monday.

559
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:36,069
Well, Costa Rica is beautiful.

560
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:38,235
And the schools are
supposed to be great.

561
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:41,040
Oh! I'm not going. It's
her stupid dream, not mine.

562
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,208
Then what will you do?

563
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,380
Uh...

564
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:56,156
I thought maybe I
could stay with you?

565
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,556
Your place is only three
miles away from my school.

566
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:01,895
I can bus it every day.

567
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,801
And I do my own laundry.
I keep my room tidy.

568
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:08,067
Duncan, this...

569
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,234
This is very sudden.

570
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,572
I know. I'm sorry.

571
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,820
Please don't send
me to the jungle.

572
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,194
If it's okay with your
mother, it's okay with me.

573
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,339
Take me off the case.

574
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,973
I've obviously completely
lost my objectivity.

575
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:53,018
I'm not helping.
I'm not even neutral.

576
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,151
Agreed.

577
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,089
So why shouldn't I take
you off all my cases?

578
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,160
Because you were
right. I hate bullies.

579
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,087
You work for me.

580
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,195
You're not a bully.

581
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,856
Pretty sure I am, dickwad.

582
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,060
I've known a lot of bullies, people
who didn't like me because I'm short,

583
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,345
people who didn't like
me because I'm Jewish.

584
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,849
Yeah, I get it, there's a long
list of reasons not to like you.

585
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:17,535
You relentlessly mock, but
it's not for self-aggrandizement,

586
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,943
it's because ideas are
bigger than feelings.

587
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,180
At least that's what
I choose to believe.

588
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,210
I also thought you had the
side effect of desensitizing me.

589
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,720
You little hebe.

590
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,588
Here are some ideas for you.

591
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:43,226
You screwed up. You kept on
screwing up. Everything you said is true.

592
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:48,704
Except it doesn't
mean you walk away.

593
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,876
You just learn to trust nothing.

594
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:58,441
Everything you think you feel,
everything you think you know,

595
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:02,880
you question every call,
play through every whistle.

596
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,653
I just had a light bulb.

597
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:11,925
Maybe.

598
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,223
You can trust light bulbs.

599
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,975
Stop. It's not prions.

600
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:31,774
Epstein-Barr gave him mono, it
also gave him Miller Fisher syndrome.

601
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,843
The plasmapheresis
played through the whistle.

602
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:37,923
We gave it to him for MPA, but
when he got worse, we took him off.

603
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,481
When he got better, we
thought it was the antitoxin,

604
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,426
but it was actually the
plasmapheresis still working.

605
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,261
We had the right treatment,
just the wrong diagnosis.

606
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,435
It was my metaphor
that solved the case.

607
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,829
Put him back on
plasmapheresis. He'll be fine.

608
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,371
Nice save.

609
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,841
Didn't quite make up for being
a sieve the rest of the game.

610
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,985
Ex-girlfriend's baby again?

611
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,694
His mother is
moving to Costa Rica,

612
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,752
he asked if he could
move in with me...

613
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:20,889
and I said yes.

614
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,965
Well, it's only six
or seven years.

615
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,671
Unless he can't
get into college,

616
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:36,237
in which case it's more a
matter of your life expectancy.

617
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,749
I said yes, knowing I'm
not remotely ready for that,

618
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:43,288
knowing he's not ready to
be separated from his mother.

619
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:46,119
This isn't the act of a
mature, rational adult.

620
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,389
I can't do this, House.

621
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,059
You were right.

622
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:02,104
I have an idea that can make
this entire problem go away.

623
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:05,735
Yes, I really want to hear your
clever late-term abortion joke.

624
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,473
You were right about
everything. This is life.

625
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,141
It's real. It doesn't
just go away.

626
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,483
None of that is true.

627
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,325
Hey.

628
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,489
Duncan.

629
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:31,259
Actually, it's Wendel, one "L".

630
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:38,500
If you're gonna get pissy,
remember, it was House's idea.

631
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,807
You're an actor?

632
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,945
Five commercials, and a
recurring on <i>Days of our Lives.</i>

633
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,650
You were regretting not
having kids, so I gave you one.

634
00:39:57,462 --> 00:40:01,263
Thereby rendering you
regret-free. It's a priceless gift.

635
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,766
Get out. Well,
it's not priceless.

636
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,598
He charges SAG minimum...

637
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,501
Get out!

638
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:10,600
Chillax, Dad.

639
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:13,711
Can you do an Australian accent?

640
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,633
I just got the call.

641
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,543
Three-year deal, 2.1 million.

642
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:58,479
What about the flooded backyard
and pretending to be Lemieux?

643
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,391
That's why I took it.

644
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,991
After all I did to get here,

645
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:07,430
half a dream is
better than nothing.

646
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:14,071
Maybe my new coach will see
what my Juniors coach didn't.

647
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,107
That'd be nice.

648
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,366
I'm not sleeping with you.

649
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,794
That's a shame.

650
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,210
This is about Popo.

651
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:59,350
She's not sleeping
with me either, right?

652
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,249
You were jealous
of me, my family.

653
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:14,199
Maybe you've got too
much and I've got too little.

654
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,539
I might sleep
with you after all.

655
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,109
The woman that I called,
that was really Beth?

656
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,770
Found her on Facebook.

657
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:03,212
How much did she charge?

658
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,876
Nothing. She's
still pissed at you.

659
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,186
Can you pass the bacon?

660
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,449
I thought you liked prosciutto.

661
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:13,548
Nobody likes prosciutto.
