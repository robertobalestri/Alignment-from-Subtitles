1
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,068
Who are you?

2
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,637
What are you doing?
Get out of here!

3
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:46,975
Mom!

4
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,177
Lue? Lue?

5
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:54,815
Are you okay?

6
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,287
Okay, honey, calm down.

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,625
It's all right. You were just
having another bad dream.

8
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,499
I can't breathe. Yes, you can.

9
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,626
You're fine. Just relax.

10
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,503
Just take slow, deep
breaths. Nice and easy.

11
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,301
There's nothing to be afraid of.

12
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:17,708
I'm trying, but I can't.

13
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,938
Relax.

14
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,776
Slow, deep breaths.

15
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,873
I can't.

16
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,644
Lue?

17
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,787
Oh, my God. Lue?

18
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,190
Lue, wake up!

19
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,989
Wake up, Lue! Come on!

20
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,693
Lue!

21
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,395
Been paging you
for over two hours.

22
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,694
Must've been in the shower.

23
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,066
And then I had to moisturize.

24
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,104
Eight-year-old boy
was brought into the ER

25
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,606
last night with acute
respiratory distress.

26
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,369
No history of...

27
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:30,376
No history of asthma or allergies
and his chest x-ray is clear.

28
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,748
Actually, I had to
moisturize twice.

29
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,846
Dominika made Oysters
Rockefeller last night.

30
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,220
Kid's been having night terrors.

31
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,782
Woke up in the middle of
one in full respiratory arrest.

32
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,021
Stress-induced panic attack.

33
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,291
Tell the parents to
lay off the grades.

34
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,128
The world needs fry cooks, too.

35
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,259
He does great in school.
The parents are divorced,

36
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,633
but it was amicable and
Dad's moved out of state.

37
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,337
You seen Wilson around?

38
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,071
The dreams are about an ugly
old hag trying to strangle him.

39
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,910
The family's Hmong.

40
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,619
SUNDS.

41
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,424
Sudden unexpected
nocturnal death syndrome.

42
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:21,025
AKA BS name for, "No one's
figured out why they died."

43
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,830
Over 100 in the early '80s,

44
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,135
only male, only Hmong.

45
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,938
Healthy right up until the
moment they died in their sleep.

46
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,039
What was he dreaming
about? It doesn't matter.

47
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,811
It's a dream. It
doesn't mean anything.

48
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,012
If the nightmare's scary
enough, meaningful or not,

49
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,988
it could cause a catecholamine
surge and ventricular fibrillation.

50
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,048
An ancient demon, called a dab,

51
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,991
was sitting on
him, strangling him.

52
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,289
Think that qualifies.

53
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,872
Except in the
rational part of the file

54
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,025
where it says his EKG's within
normal limits. It's not his heart.

55
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,829
What about obstructive
sleep apnea?

56
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,199
Sleep apnea wouldn't have caused

57
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,965
breathing problems
after he woke up.

58
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,563
What did you dream of?

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,833
I never remember my dreams.

60
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,643
But you're certain that
they're insignificant.

61
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,037
Defensively so.

62
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,512
I was defending science.

63
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,311
You were defensively
defending science.

64
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,078
Lung damage from inhaled toxins

65
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,944
could keep causing
problems after he woke up.

66
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,978
Or an upper
respiratory infection.

67
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,693
Okay. Chase and Park, start
IV antibiotics for pneumonia.

68
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,504
Taub and Adams, go
check the home for toxins.

69
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,757
Can I go with Taub?

70
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,662
It was my idea.

71
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,598
Right.

72
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,978
'Cause for a moment
there I thought

73
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,246
you were uncomfortable
around Chase

74
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,432
because you had a
nocturnal Australian.

75
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,105
You can go with
whoever you want.

76
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,407
But all of you, read
all of these files.

77
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,054
Do you believe a spirit
could be hurting your son?

78
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,617
No, of course not.

79
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,697
Because if he's been
taught to believe that,

80
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,460
it is possible for the fear
alone to affect heart function.

81
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,435
I'm an engineer. I know illnesses
aren't caused by evil spirits.

82
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:07,406
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to, I just had to check.

83
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,943
Anything else you need to check?

84
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,375
No.

85
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,817
I had a dream.

86
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,891
House, we can talk later.

87
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,795
Relax, I'm a doctor.

88
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,331
Your spectacular breasts
mean nothing to me.

89
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,893
House. House.

90
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,734
Later.

91
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,835
I had sex with Dominika.

92
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,739
In a dream?

93
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,648
It wasn't literally sex.
Technically, it was flossing,

94
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,447
but you know, teeth, testicles.

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,284
I think the symbolism
is pretty clear.

96
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,517
"Later" just changed to "never".

97
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,893
I'll tell you what
would be weirder.

98
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,798
If you didn't dream about
having sex with Chase.

99
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,497
Have you? No.

100
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,340
But I've dreamed
about having sex

101
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,806
with a lot of people I work with

102
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,036
and it didn't freak me out.

103
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,474
That's different.

104
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,807
How?

105
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,542
'Cause you've actually had
sex with a lot of people at work

106
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,913
and that hasn't freaked you out.

107
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,417
Good point.

108
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:29,046
So you're worried
about what it means?

109
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,852
I'm not worried.
It means nothing.

110
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,825
It means something, doesn't it?

111
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,024
I work with him. I can't
want to sleep with him.

112
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,432
Maybe Chase just
represents work.

113
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,766
You're just falling
in love with your job.

114
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:47,468
It has been very
satisfying lately.

115
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,838
You smell that?

116
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,907
Yeah. It smells like a wet dog.

117
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,610
It's mold. It's not mold.

118
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,947
It's definitely mold.

119
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,392
I don't see any sign
of water damage.

120
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,779
Holy crap.

121
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,458
It looked like a slaughterhouse.

122
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,070
I don't know what
you're talking about.

123
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,585
It was clean when we left.

124
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,757
You're telling us some random
person broke into your house

125
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,960
to dismember a pig
in your son's bedroom?

126
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,263
A pig?

127
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,933
My father-in-law.

128
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,237
What did you do?

129
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,480
What you should have done
weeks ago, when the dreams started.

130
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,776
I'm saving Lue.

131
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,248
He's coding! Need
a doctor in here!

132
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,288
V-tach. No pulse.

133
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,121
Oh, my God. Push
one milligram epi.

134
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,792
- Paddles. Charge to 50.
- Charging.

135
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,622
Clear.

136
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,759
Still V-tach.

137
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,260
Charge to 100.

138
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,563
100.

139
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,661
Clear.

140
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,841
Charging... Wait.
Normal sinus rhythm.

141
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,971
He's stable, but we've
obviously got a second symptom.

142
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,457
Yeah, yeah, kid's in V-tach. Tell
me about the luau in his bedroom.

143
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,151
It's a traditional
Hmong ceremony.

144
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,865
It's supposed to call
back the kid's soul.

145
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:47,973
Hasn't he heard of star 69?

146
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,052
There's more.

147
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,140
The reason grandpa thinks
the kid's soul was stolen

148
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,757
is because he's
convinced his son,

149
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,664
the kid's father, had
his stolen as well.

150
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,327
He beat his boss to death.

151
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,534
The dad didn't move
away, he's in prison.

152
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:02,269
PTSD could definitely cause
breathing problems and...

153
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,401
It's not PTSD.

154
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,911
Even if the kid wasn't there,

155
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,223
just hearing what the dad did...

156
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,340
But he hasn't.

157
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,907
It happened when he was
two, and all he's ever been told

158
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,078
is that his parents divorced
and his dad moved away.

159
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,965
The heart thing indicates
a malignant arrhythmia.

160
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,116
He needs an EP study.

161
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,886
How many of the other files
showed malignant arrhythmias?

162
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,928
None. Then forget the EP.

163
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,462
What about acute pericarditis?

164
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,622
Explains the dyspnea.

165
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:25,741
How many of the other files...

166
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,597
It's exacerbated
by lying supine,

167
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,192
so the symptoms would get
worse when he goes to sleep.

168
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,932
Just like all 100 of the others.

169
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,365
Do an echo to check
the pericardium.

170
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:40,073
See if you can find any cardio-active
toxins in the home samples.

171
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,583
Can I just say that I
very much enjoy my job?

172
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,061
No, no, please.

173
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,497
No need to apologize
for your earlier behavior.

174
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,802
The floss was mint, probably
because of this green G-string

175
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,667
she hangs up to
dry in the bathroom.

176
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,072
My watch must have stopped.
Apparently it's already "never".

177
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,111
You might want to
forward your calls.

178
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,408
You do not want the
<i>Reader's Digest</i> version on this.

179
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,806
There was a very
tight hygienist's uniform,

180
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,851
suggestive use of
a water sprayer...

181
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,477
The floss isn't sex. It's guilt.

182
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,752
It's tying you up for throwing
away the INS notification

183
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,419
granting Dominika
her citizenship.

184
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,259
She can move out but
she still doesn't know it,

185
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,959
which means you're
basically holding her prisoner.

186
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,265
Tell her the truth
and leave me alone.

187
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,842
Really? What?

188
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,613
You startled me.

189
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,183
We work together every day,
usually under a fair amount of stress.

190
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,854
It's only natural I pop into a
subconscious thought every once in a while.

191
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,724
Have you ever dreamt
about having sex with me?

192
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,399
No.

193
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,663
You paused.

194
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,901
No, I didn't. You
think I'm lying?

195
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,841
No. I think you were fighting
the urge to snap the word "no"

196
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,903
because your subconscious
finds the idea abhorrent.

197
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,509
So if I snap it's offensive,

198
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,146
and if I don't snap it's offensive
for the exact same reason?

199
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,316
Talk to your subconscious.

200
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,587
This is becoming weird
because you're making it weird.

201
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,595
So you don't find
the idea abhorrent?

202
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,574
I work with you. I don't
have to answer that question.

203
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,089
You just did.

204
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,227
What happened?

205
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,507
Echo was negative but he
has severe abdominal pain.

206
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,910
Ultrasound didn't suggest
any intestinal blockages,

207
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,571
but he's severely constipated.

208
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,845
No spores, clostridium, or organic
toxins in the kitchen samples.

209
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,061
Nothing in the bedroom either.

210
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,782
We need to scope him and we're
gonna need to clear his bowel first.

211
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,516
We should biopsy his thyroid.

212
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,283
For an impacted bowel?

213
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,292
Hashimoto's
thyroiditis would explain

214
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,386
his lung, heart and
intestinal involvement.

215
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,030
And if you think we still
need House's approval,

216
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,794
it also explains
dying in his sleep.

217
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,865
Nice call.

218
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,472
When you invite me for dinner, I
thought maybe you take me to a restaurant.

219
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,209
Or have plates.

220
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,479
Yeah. Sorry.

221
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,611
Idiot delivery guy
forgot them. Hmm.

222
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,314
The idiot delivery
guy, or the idiot guy

223
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,422
whose food you stole from
lounge refrigerator, huh?

224
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,624
You've gotten to
know me pretty well.

225
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,221
My citizenship
depends on it, right?

226
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,228
Yeah.

227
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,912
That's actually why I
wanted to talk to you.

228
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:50,995
You heard news?

229
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,505
Yeah.

230
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,065
So, what news?

231
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,570
They want us to come
in for another interview?

232
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,846
No.

233
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,988
Since we hadn't
heard anything, I called.

234
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,786
And they said it's gonna
be a couple weeks.

235
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,959
Maybe a month till they
finalize their decision.

236
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,463
A month?

237
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,660
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

238
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,871
No, it does not
suck to live with you.

239
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:31,376
It's been fun, but, you
know, I just want to be legal.

240
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:36,276
And you will be. Absolutely.

241
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,021
In the meantime...

242
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,213
You ever shot anyone?

243
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,288
No. Get away.

244
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:52,389
Look, this needle isn't nearly
as big as the one in your arm,

245
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,898
and that didn't hurt, did it?

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,969
I don't want it. They
need to do it, Lue.

247
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,163
You'll only feel a little pinch

248
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,548
as we give you the
numbing medicine.

249
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,063
After that you
won't feel a thing.

250
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,099
No!

251
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,536
Lue, calm down,
it's gonna be okay.

252
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,707
What's he saying?
What's the problem?

253
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:11,910
I don't know.

254
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,486
He's saying it's too late.

255
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,987
There's nothing we can do.

256
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,482
It's Hmong.

257
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,083
He doesn't speak Hmong.
He's never even heard it.

258
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,718
It isn't him speaking.

259
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,319
It's the dab.

260
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,093
He's seizing.

261
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,598
Oh, my God!

262
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,395
Need some lorazepam in here!

263
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,373
Seizure rules out Hashimoto's.

264
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,539
Yeah, that's the issue.

265
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,742
Not that we have no
rational explanation

266
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,028
for how the patient spoke a
language he's never even heard.

267
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,213
I've got one.

268
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,291
It means "you're a bunch
of pathetic idiots" in Hmong.

269
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:55,893
Or it doesn't.

270
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,955
But you wouldn't know because
none of you speak Hmong.

271
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,762
Kid, on the other hand, is
presumably fluent in gibberish.

272
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,394
The grandfather speaks
Hmong. He translated.

273
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,029
He heard what he wanted to hear

274
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,903
because if his grandson
really is possessed,

275
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,418
that means his son
really is possessed,

276
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,606
which is a giant step up from being
a sledge-hammering psychopath.

277
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,510
Whatever it was
preceded a seizure.

278
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,024
It's obviously a
neurological symptom.

279
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,745
Scleroderma, advanced to the
point that it's affecting his brain?

280
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,846
Interesting.

281
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,065
So we should
start treating with...

282
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,729
Interesting that you keep falling
for it when I say, "Interesting."

283
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,853
The scleroderma
part was idiotic.

284
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,138
We'd have seen skin involvement.

285
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,495
The interesting part is
that you and Park agree

286
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,234
but you're not able
to look at each other.

287
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,300
Um... I'm looking at her.

288
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,406
I'm looking at him.

289
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,840
Good. Now lick your lips.

290
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,909
Rasmussen's encephalitis.

291
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,972
Diffuse spotty inflammation could
hit the autonomic centers of the brain.

292
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,951
That's Hmong for
"get an MRI to confirm."

293
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,823
Rasmussen's encephalitis?

294
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,594
But he'll be okay?

295
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,330
With treatment, it's manageable.

296
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,964
And it explains all the things
that have happened to him?

297
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,606
We think so... You're wrong.

298
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,605
And you're wasting
my grandson's time.

299
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,773
Neurological issues can cause
a person to speak in tongues,

300
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:22,907
speak with an accent...

301
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,541
He wasn't speaking in tongues.

302
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,176
In times of stress, our senses
can fool us into believing...

303
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,723
I know the difference
between science and faith.

304
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,817
And when my son started having the
same dreams my grandson is having,

305
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,487
science couldn't help him.

306
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,191
I'm sorry if your son suffered
from mental illness, but...

307
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,028
Kao was not crazy.

308
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,795
He was bright, caring, happy.

309
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,902
Until the bad dreams came.

310
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,636
I don't want to watch
it happen again.

311
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,542
Please don't scare the boy.

312
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,078
It won't help him get better.

313
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,525
Axial view of the mid-brain level
looks good. Moving onto thalamic.

314
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,233
I had another dream last night.

315
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,432
This time it was about you.

316
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,899
Really? See.

317
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,444
That's how you're
supposed to react.

318
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,189
When a woman tells you
she's dreamt about you,

319
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,237
you should be thrilled,

320
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,106
even if not interested
in her whatsoever.

321
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,913
You're an idiot, you know that?

322
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,930
Well, I definitely won't be
dreaming about you tonight.

323
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,115
I'm jealous of you two.

324
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,200
You couldn't be
more different and yet,

325
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,056
you have this good
thing happening.

326
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,721
You support each
other, you like each other.

327
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,764
Don't let House screw it up.

328
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,260
We're not that different.

329
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,427
Yeah, you are.

330
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,397
Well, apparently there are some
things about you I don't know.

331
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,624
I served one
year in police unit.

332
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,323
And you're just telling
your husband now?

333
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,922
Immigration doesn't know,

334
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,490
no need for husband to know.

335
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,500
What is happening
to boy with demons?

336
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,770
An absence of
evidence on an MRI,

337
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,279
which my team has mistaken
for evidence of absence.

338
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,646
This is what I am
not understanding.

339
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,984
How can you believe in dark
matters but not in dark spirits?

340
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:47,985
Is the idea of demons so
different than the Higgs boson?

341
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,792
We can't see it, but we can
see the impact of its presence.

342
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,990
I borrowed your physics book.

343
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,332
I read while in bathroom.

344
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,872
So you're a deadeye shot,

345
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,636
and enjoy reading quantum
physics on the crapper.

346
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,644
I read in bathtub.

347
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,304
Better image. Thank you.

348
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,518
The doctors say
my brain is sick.

349
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,255
Your doctors are
trying their best

350
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,390
but they aren't looking
in the right place.

351
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:31,466
Yeah, I know this is a lot
to put on an eight-year-old,

352
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,472
but you've angered our ancestors

353
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,337
by ignoring them.

354
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,743
Now, do you remember
how to talk to them?

355
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,541
Yeah, that's right.

356
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,208
Good. Now, close your eyes

357
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,911
and we will ask for
forgiveness together.

358
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,521
You're doing good.

359
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,654
But we have to do more.

360
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,657
The evil spirits are in the air.

361
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,531
And the only way to stop them

362
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,064
is by stopping the air.

363
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,712
You have to be brave.

364
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,254
I'm not trying to hurt you.

365
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,685
This will help you.

366
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,458
I know it will.

367
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,867
Lue, are you okay?

368
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,902
I can't wake him up.

369
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,442
Lue? Lue?

370
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,637
You're safe, you're
in the hospital.

371
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,772
Get Grandpa away!
He's not here, honey.

372
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:49,940
It was just a dream.

373
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,244
He was choking me!

374
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:52,876
No, Lue, it wasn't real.

375
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,443
It was. He grabbed my neck!

376
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,616
Those bruises
weren't there before.

377
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,003
He had the dream,
then he had the bruising.

378
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,663
More likely,

379
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:17,403
and by "likely", I mean rationally,
it was the other way around.

380
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,308
His brain felt the
pain in his neck,

381
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,472
created the dream to explain it.

382
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,408
Coagulopathy.

383
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,917
Lung problems cause
a clotting disturbance.

384
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,262
He would have
bruises everywhere.

385
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,187
Is it really preposterous

386
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,349
that dreams can have
physical manifestations?

387
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,358
The short answer is...

388
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:38,193
Thoughts during sleep can
and do cause physical changes.

389
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,526
Is that right, Dr. Park?

390
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,091
Did you wake up this morning
experiencing physical changes?

391
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,515
It's medically relevant. Her
dream doesn't mean anything.

392
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,031
Can we start acting like
it doesn't mean anything?

393
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,575
Sure. We could also start acting

394
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,043
like walls don't mean anything.

395
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,510
But then we'd hurt our noses.

396
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,892
You've been
taking the high road.

397
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,711
You haven't been teasing in
an obviously teasable situation

398
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,377
because you know it
does mean something.

399
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,186
She hates the dream because
it makes her feel vulnerable.

400
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,484
You love the dream because
it makes you feel superior.

401
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,723
The poor lass who can't help
but fall sway to your charms,

402
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,525
and you're bestowing upon
her the gift of illusory irrelevance.

403
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,862
Can you please hint to House
that you had a sex dream?

404
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,469
I'd really prefer
not to get distracted

405
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,402
with trying to cure
the patient today.

406
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,669
I refuse to divulge my dreams
about girl-on-girl loofa action.

407
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,303
The bruising could
indicate anemia,

408
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,506
a vitamin C deficiency,
or even leukemia.

409
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,880
That is so weird that you
and I had the same dream.

410
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:35,318
I assume yours also ends
with me achieving ecstasy

411
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,516
while simultaneously placing
third in the New York City Marathon.

412
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:39,889
Third?

413
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,188
I'm a realist.

414
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,997
Liver failure can
cause gibberish

415
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,930
from encephalopathy,
constipation,

416
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,864
bruising, and
breathing problems.

417
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,267
Hepatic fibrosis could
hit someone his age.

418
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:55,203
So let's hit his
liver. Get a biopsy.

419
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,414
Angle a bit more superiorly.

420
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,388
He keeps having these
nightmares that become real.

421
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,720
They really hurt him.

422
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,853
I don't want to believe that a
nightmare can do that, but...

423
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:19,763
I'm struggling with it, too. But these
things can be explained medically.

424
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,401
But you haven't.

425
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:26,303
Every doctor, every
idea they've had,

426
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:29,071
it's been wrong.

427
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,449
Liver biopsy's back.
Team's about to meet.

428
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,277
You're back to avoiding
eye contact with me?

429
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,086
House got to you again?

430
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,923
Want me to gaze
longingly into your eyes

431
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,620
as I tell you the test results?

432
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,987
I want you to treat
me like a friend.

433
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,260
Which means
getting over the fact

434
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,893
that you like me
more than I like you.

435
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,569
Yeah, egotism and
preening really turn me on.

436
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,466
Too bad I'm not
attracted to androgyny

437
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,408
and self-pity or
you'd have it made.

438
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:09,414
Because anyone who hasn't gotten
wet from your petri dish of STDs

439
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,313
clearly has low self-esteem.

440
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,250
Bitch.

441
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,583
Dick.

442
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,534
<i>Are you coming?</i>

443
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,185
Why didn't your lips
move when you said that?

444
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,007
Chase, are you coming?

445
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,441
The liver biopsy's back.

446
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,382
I'll be right there.

447
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,958
Biopsy was
negative for fibrosis.

448
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,224
So once again you
don't know what's wrong.

449
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,300
It's always good to
rule out the bad things.

450
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,699
Doctors.

451
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,566
God.

452
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:24,985
Was he...

453
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,986
Yes.

454
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,724
He was levitating.

455
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,393
Cool.

456
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:41,099
So the one thing we know for
sure is, he was not levitating.

457
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,506
He was floating six
inches off the bed.

458
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,670
He could've just been
arching his back off the bed.

459
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,943
Yes. But then I would have
come into the room and reported

460
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,417
that the patient was weirdly
arching his back off the bed.

461
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,785
It was his whole
body. He was levitating.

462
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,949
So many questions.

463
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,856
Starting with,

464
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,394
why did Chase
address his comment

465
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,981
to someone who
wasn't even in the room?

466
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,737
Hocus pocus, on my
feet you idiots must focus.

467
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,574
I feel so drained.

468
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:23,911
The kid's not a magician.

469
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,474
Of course not, he's
the lovely assistant.

470
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,453
His Grandpa Pig
Sticker's waving the wand.

471
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,285
Middling with,

472
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,992
is Chase trying to avoid Taub

473
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,824
or is he trying to prove
that he's not avoiding Park?

474
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,056
We checked the bed.

475
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,225
There were no platforms
or wires. This wasn't a trick.

476
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,132
Tetanus can cause
muscle rigidity.

477
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,295
Maybe he was propped
up by his heel and elbow.

478
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,667
Except he wasn't.

479
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,241
Tetanus wouldn't cause
that kind of breathing difficulty.

480
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,576
And ending with,

481
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,339
if Chase is trying
not to avoid Park,

482
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,914
why is he doing this
today and not yesterday?

483
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,472
But hypocalcaemia could,

484
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,582
and the enema we administered
to cure his constipation

485
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:01,949
had a high phosphorus load,

486
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,649
which could make him
transiently hypocalcaemic.

487
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,091
It's a long shot.

488
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:09,119
But at least it has the
benefit of being rational.

489
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,921
Go pump up his electrolytes
and start beta-blockers.

490
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,930
And good news for Park.

491
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,699
I think Chase had a
sex dream about you.

492
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,469
Dreams don't mean anything.

493
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,373
I don't know. Nothing
you've done has helped.

494
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,345
If we don't start and
he has another seizure,

495
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,441
the neurological damage
could be permanent.

496
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,049
My father-in-law...

497
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,457
He thinks the calling ceremony
didn't work because Lue wasn't there.

498
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:39,890
And you think he's right?

499
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,321
I don't know.

500
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,889
I'm sorry, but there's no way we
can allow him to perform an exorcism

501
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,695
in your son's hospital room.

502
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,303
Then I will have
to take him home.

503
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,169
A day ago you were insulted I'd
even think you might believe that stuff.

504
00:27:56,241 --> 00:28:00,372
And now you're willing to stop
all treatment so you can try it?

505
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,846
Maybe Xang was right about Kao.

506
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:07,683
The man I loved wasn't evil
and would never do what he did.

507
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,326
He was possessed.

508
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,490
And my son needs his soul back.

509
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,228
Why not?

510
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:28,049
As long as he doesn't feed the kid
anything or put anything on his skin

511
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,313
that we haven't verified as
harmless, what's the problem?

512
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:31,571
I agree.

513
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:33,441
And since we're
establishing a new policy of,

514
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:34,822
"What the hell,
we'll try anything,"

515
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,408
I'd like to hire Shakira to
belly-dance while singing <i>Waka Waka.</i>

516
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,582
As long as you get the
mom and Shakira to consent.

517
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,923
It's no different than having a
priest or rabbi lead a prayer vigil.

518
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,583
The mom is scared and confused

519
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,458
and desperate for anything
that'll give her hope.

520
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,255
True.

521
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,230
But in the long run, I
think you'll be happier

522
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,131
having our lawyer
declare her unfit.

523
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,101
That way, you won't
be ratifying superstition

524
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,436
over science and I'll
still be working here.

525
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,600
And why would that
make me happier?

526
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,440
You're not going anywhere,
and we're not ratifying their beliefs.

527
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:08,912
We're respecting them.

528
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:12,076
You do realize it may
involve animal sacrifice?

529
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:19,284
People who live in glass
hospitals shouldn't throw exorcisms.

530
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,590
I'll talk to the mother.

531
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,954
I don't want to deny
him the medicine.

532
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,327
I just

533
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,325
want to make sure I
try everything I can.

534
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,001
I understand that.

535
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,577
But you have to understand
that we're a hospital, not a temple.

536
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,809
Then I'll take him elsewhere.

537
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,341
No, you won't.

538
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,115
He's sick. We can't
let him leave here.

539
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,445
I'm sorry. You really
have no choice.

540
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,689
I spoke to a lawyer.

541
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,699
He told me as long as I wasn't
saying no to your treatment,

542
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,061
you couldn't say
no to my religion.

543
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,775
Give me 24 hours.

544
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,896
This came in the mail today.

545
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,028
I'm sorry.

546
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,332
I should have told you but...

547
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,566
Tell me what?

548
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,401
I don't understand.

549
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:48,972
What's the letter?

550
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,039
It's from my uncle in
Poland. My Aunt Luba,

551
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,869
they put in the nursing
home two months ago.

552
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,347
That's too bad.

553
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,083
My mother, I talk
to her twice a week

554
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,436
and she never even mentioned it.

555
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,257
What does she think, that I
can't handle? I'm 29 years old!

556
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,193
I am not a child!

557
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,261
Were you going out tonight?

558
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,935
I could stay.

559
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,256
He's still barely breathing.

560
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,589
Lue,

561
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,097
how you feeling?

562
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,956
Any stronger?

563
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,366
Lue? Can you hear me?

564
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,368
What's wrong? I'm not sure.

565
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,304
Lue, I need you to
squeeze my hand.

566
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,405
He's not responding.
Get me an amp of D50.

567
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:55,874
You're wrong again?

568
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,246
I'm calling his grandfather.

569
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:46,361
<i>Genetic tests for Brugada and
Long QT variants came back negative.</i>

570
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,865
What about a carotid aneurysm?

571
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,026
We should do an angiogram.

572
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,069
He's got normal carotid pulses.

573
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,398
Who cares?

574
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,666
Mom's given up, why shouldn't I?

575
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,569
I'm sorry. Do we not treat
idiots because I thought...

576
00:32:58,677 --> 00:32:59,838
And her kid levitated.

577
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,313
That happens to my girl, I'm
expanding my diagnostic horizons.

578
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,475
All the more reason
why we should shut down.

579
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,076
We cure this kid
now, crazy grandpa

580
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,645
and his magic beads
get all the credit.

581
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,884
And since when do
you care about credit?

582
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,559
Since when do I
care about this kid?

583
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,960
All I care about is sending
mommy out into the world

584
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,158
having faith in faith.

585
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,701
Kid's better off dead.

586
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,166
Soon as she's done
appeasing the gods, let's talk.

587
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,366
What about Kawasaki?

588
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,072
Explains the
irregular heartbeat,

589
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,541
respiratory distress
and seizures.

590
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,838
It fits.

591
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,041
Which means he needs
a coronary bypass.

592
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,979
It can't be Kawasaki.

593
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,347
The echo would've shown it.

594
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,880
But a patent
ductus arteriosis...

595
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,080
It can't be a PDA.

596
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,352
He's not an infant nor has he
had any symptoms for eight years.

597
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,517
Maybe he has.

598
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,890
Maybe he had an infected ductus

599
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:51,225
which we inadvertently
treated with antibiotics.

600
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,163
So no evidence is
evidence of evidence?

601
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,962
Just saying it's consistent.

602
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,263
It's a billion to one.

603
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,803
Which means there
are seven people

604
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,270
in the world who
fit the diagnosis.

605
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,863
I thought we were
looking for 100.

606
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,441
Maybe PDA is more
common than we thought.

607
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,654
But idiot doctors like you...

608
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:07,702
You're wrong.

609
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:10,849
But the treatment's
just ibuprofen.

610
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,179
Closes the malformed duct.

611
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,279
Worst-case scenario,
he just doesn't get better.

612
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,357
Worst-case scenario
is, you piss me off...

613
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,034
You're not gonna let
us save an eight-year-old

614
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,289
because one more person
might embrace religion?

615
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,789
Does anyone here think
my diagnosis is right?

616
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:35,404
Well, then, I've decided, for
today only, to respect your opinions.

617
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,806
We'll proceed according
to your diagnosis.

618
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,537
And nothing else.

619
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,409
That's an order.

620
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:44,616
Good luck.

621
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,155
We need to put him
on the OR schedule.

622
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,535
His BP is dropping.

623
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,803
He's crashing. Call a code.

624
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,347
You need to stop this.

625
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,484
I'm giving him the ibuprofen.

626
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,014
Dinner's almost ready.

627
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,818
I think I'll stick with the
fluids tonight, thanks.

628
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,853
Why are you sulking?

629
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,118
I'm not sulking.

630
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,419
Oh!

631
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,086
My mistake.

632
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,399
Either religion is
killing a kid or I am.

633
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,351
What are you doing?

634
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,117
Comforting my
husband after a bad day.

635
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,439
If this is not what you want,
I go back to making dinner.

636
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,439
I'm not gonna answer that.

637
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:23,839
Oh, smart man.

638
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,479
This is killing mood.

639
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,821
U.S. Citizenship.

640
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,281
I'll get it.

641
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,483
This is Mrs. House.

642
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,186
Please give good news so my
husband and I can go back to sex.

643
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,857
It's fantastic!

644
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,268
How many notices you sent me?

645
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:08,283
Okay. I come pick up
naturalization certificate.

646
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,056
Thank you for calling.

647
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,565
I'm sorry.

648
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,914
Dr. Adams, Dr. Taub.

649
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,042
His vitals are improving.
He's stabilizing.

650
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:49,486
He's gonna be okay.

651
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:54,290
It worked.

652
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,769
Um... No, it didn't.

653
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:00,397
Mrs. Cheng, the
medicine I administered

654
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,497
was a long-shot
treatment for Lue's heart.

655
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,974
But that's what's helping him.

656
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,144
Ibuprofen? That's for headaches.

657
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,409
I know it seems hard
to believe but it's true.

658
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,646
And I know this seems
hard for you to believe.

659
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,824
Honey.

660
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,090
Grandpa was right.

661
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,757
He saved you.

662
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:36,631
There were two things we
thought were impossible.

663
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,505
One of them wasn't.

664
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,438
That's all we know.

665
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,239
You're such a brave boy.

666
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,693
Was I good?

667
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,426
Doesn't mean anything.

668
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,522
Idea got planted, it
was probably inevitable.

669
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,868
It means something.

670
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,204
What?

671
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:20,777
Well, it could mean the obvious,
that you want some of this.

672
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,946
When will you learn
that that look is insulting?

673
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:35,189
Or it could just mean
that we like each other.

674
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,787
I'm weird, and you're pretty,

675
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:42,094
but we connect, we feel safe.

676
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,800
We trust each other.

677
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:48,872
Maybe.

678
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,905
Just testing my theory.

679
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:11,391
Adams defied me. There's
one more zealot in the world.

680
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,390
And Dominika moved out.

681
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:20,928
She was fun. She was hot.

682
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,372
She fixed my blender.

683
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:25,774
That is not a metaphor.

684
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,813
You know any good
fake divorce lawyers?

685
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,649
I'm surprisingly
depressed by this.

686
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:39,252
I have cancer.

687
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,131
You were a little short
with me the other day.

688
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,722
You do need an excuse.
Cancer may be overplaying it.

689
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,958
Stage II thymoma.

690
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:55,473
I didn't want to tell you
until I had it confirmed.

691
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,933
I got the tests
back this morning.

692
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,446
I have cancer, House.
