1
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,664
Hey.

2
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,191
Don't bother.

3
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,361
He's dead.

4
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,397
You're dead, too.

5
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:13,834
The fire isn't.

6
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,297
You might want to get up and
start heading for the exit signs.

7
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,350
For all I know,

8
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,053
I already am up.

9
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,324
More interesting question is,

10
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,526
why would I hallucinate
an ex-employee

11
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,365
who I last saw with a
self-inflicted gunshot wound,

12
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,270
as opposed to
someone more busty?

13
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,437
Care to explain why you're here?

14
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,541
The dead guy.

15
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,576
Who is he?

16
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,009
How'd you meet him?

17
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,947
I was in a car
accident last month.

18
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,050
I won a swimming trophy
in high school. Your turn.

19
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,184
I ran out of pain medication.

20
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,060
I got an orbital fracture.
It's just taking ages to heal.

21
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,131
Take off your shirt.

22
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,066
My eye's up here.

23
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,482
Orbital fracture means your
face went into the windshield.

24
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,903
Which means your chest
went into the steering wheel.

25
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,999
Painkillers can
suppress heart rate,

26
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,285
so unless you
want me to kill you,

27
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,107
take off your shirt, let
me do a heart exam.

28
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,784
I also wanted to see the ring
of burns around your collarbone.

29
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,621
How did you know?
The "codeine allergy"

30
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,030
you told the nurse about, that's
shorthand for "give me the strong stuff,"

31
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,728
which matches your
seen-better-days

32
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,236
- because-my-life-fell-apart
suit.

33
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,702
The two old burns
on your fingers

34
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,082
mean you tend to
nod off with a cigarette

35
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:28,826
in your hand. No reason you
shouldn't do that with one in your mouth.

36
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,308
May all your doctors be stupid.

37
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,213
Hold on a second.

38
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,613
That bruising around
your belly button.

39
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,552
You might get some fun
drugs out of this after all.

40
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,890
<i>Cullen's sign,</i>

41
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,922
but the ultrasound showed
air as well as blood. Now,

42
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,264
I know what you're thinking.
Hemorrhagic pancreatitis.

43
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,295
But I also know
what I'm thinking.

44
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,839
Doesn't explain the
pneumoperitoneum.

45
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,000
You took a new case?

46
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,240
You ran tests yourself?

47
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:10,247
I saw the chance to help someone
in need, and I instinctively...

48
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,183
No, wait, that was
someone else's instincts.

49
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,652
Wilson's dying,
your parole officer

50
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,246
is probably on his
way here right now.

51
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,417
How are you possibly
in a good mood?

52
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:21,826
Did you never see <i>Dead
Poets Society?</i> Carpe diem.

53
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:26,160
Air in his abdomen could
mean blah, blah, blah.

54
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,430
But blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

55
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,630
Blah, blah, blah.

56
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,296
Nobody cares about the medicine.

57
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,901
Perforated ulcer.

58
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,153
Laparotomy to find the hole
in his tummy and close it up.

59
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,454
You didn't answer
the team's question.

60
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,073
Which is weird 'cause normally
when I talk to my own employees,

61
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,140
I'm under oath and
hooked up to a lie detector.

62
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,761
You were looking at
six months of prison

63
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,185
instead of five
months of Wilson.

64
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,286
Why happy?

65
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,481
Obviously I had a plan.

66
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,079
Obviously, obviously
you had a plan.

67
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,367
The more interesting
question is,

68
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,859
why you didn't tell the team.

69
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,771
I think it's because part
of you knew from the start

70
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,627
that the plan wouldn't work.

71
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,329
I need a meeting.

72
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,664
I'm busy. Call my office.

73
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,105
Yes.

74
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,701
Because wobbly tables don't
just un-wobble themselves.

75
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,378
I need a meeting.

76
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,475
Thanks for fitting me in.

77
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,745
My team has eight
urgent, life-or-death cases

78
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,900
that they've been waiting
for me to accept or reject.

79
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,424
When is that not true?

80
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,317
Well, right now for one.

81
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,025
But tell my parole board
that I'm taking all eight.

82
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,108
That no one else can crack them,

83
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,609
that you need me here
for the next five months

84
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,363
or eight people will die.

85
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,096
You're asking me
to perjure myself.

86
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,766
Just a tiny white
lie. No offence.

87
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,300
Especially since from what
I hear nothing black is tiny.

88
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,347
Except your penis, I guess.

89
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,507
You really think I wanted
to cave in that ceiling?

90
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,609
It was a prank that went wrong.

91
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,949
Dock my pay, sue me...

92
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,454
Felony vandalism should've added

93
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,799
another year or two
to your sentence.

94
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,156
It's a miracle the parole
board agreed to six months.

95
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,828
I will go to jail. Eventually.

96
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,795
I will pay the price. I'd just
rather that Wilson didn't.

97
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,368
Come on. Be a friend.

98
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,540
Okay.

99
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:23,549
But whatever cases you
have, you have to take them all.

100
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,958
"Be a friend"?

101
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,895
How many fingers
am I holding up?

102
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,663
Of course, you know it's three

103
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,093
because you know
everything I know,

104
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,636
everything my smack-addled
brain can remember.

105
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,730
Including that I actually
said, "Be a friend."

106
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,117
My point wasn't
that you said it.

107
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,201
My point was, once again, why?

108
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,520
I think it's because
part of you knew

109
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,822
you were going to need a friend.

110
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:56,248
Part of you knew the plan, even
when it was working, wouldn't work.

111
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,296
And right now, I'm curious about
why you're sitting on the ground

112
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,652
instead of heading for the door.

113
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,595
Guess we've figured
out why you're seeing me,

114
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,763
your suicidal friend.

115
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,674
He'll call you twice a day. Then
his wife will call you twice a day

116
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,337
to make sure she understands
what he told her you told him.

117
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,574
Which she won't,
because he didn't.

118
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,361
Maybe you want to
give this one to Connors.

119
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,217
Where's House?

120
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,178
Don't know, don't care, working.

121
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,325
Excuse me.

122
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,157
No one has seen or heard
from him since two nights ago.

123
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,701
I'm sure he's enjoying himself.

124
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,848
Last time he went to prison

125
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,047
he maxed out his credit cards.

126
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:55,202
Last time he went to prison, he
thought he had you waiting for him.

127
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,069
You think he could have
done something stupid?

128
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,681
I think stupid is our
best-case scenario.

129
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,713
Why do you want
to kill yourself?

130
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:10,348
Here's a reason. I can't even get
stoned without some annoying jerk

131
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,120
deciding I need to
be deeply analyzed.

132
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,857
Isn't this just an incredibly
simple calculation?

133
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:22,198
I'm going to jail, losing my
job, losing my best friend.

134
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,268
Do I need more?

135
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,305
You think that's the
sum total of who you are?

136
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,896
A doctor, a friend to Wilson?

137
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,805
I'm also a tremendous baritone.

138
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,309
Now go away.

139
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,377
Even with your
subconscious, you're evasive.

140
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,253
Death's not interesting.

141
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,289
You exist for
what's interesting.

142
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,189
Puzzles, ideas, analysis.

143
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,457
Death is the opposite
of a cool puzzle.

144
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,389
It's eternal nothingness.

145
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,569
But you don't find life
interesting anymore.

146
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,040
Stop being an idiot.

147
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,248
Can I have Kutner back, please?

148
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,061
How much pathetic wallowing
do I have to sit through?

149
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,383
How are things in hell?

150
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,921
Is the humidity the big issue?

151
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,753
What happened next with
the guy's medical case?

152
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,493
Why? Exactly.

153
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,392
Why am I, meaning you,

154
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,963
still obsessing about this case?

155
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,966
Obviously, we
think it's relevant

156
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,800
to why we're still sitting on
the floor of a burning building.

157
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,299
There was a code.

158
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,456
Gotta be a clot in his lungs.
We need to get him to an OR.

159
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,449
No time, his O2
sats are falling.

160
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,635
We have to suck it out here,

161
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,628
bedside embolectomy. Float
a catheter through his heart

162
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,518
and his oxygenation'll
get even worse.

163
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,079
He'll die before we
can finish the procedure.

164
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,651
House, we need a call here.

165
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,398
What are you doing?

166
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,527
What did you give him?

167
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,794
Five,

168
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,138
four,

169
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,540
three, two...

170
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,583
Naloxone.

171
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,395
We should have got suspicious

172
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,515
when his visiting cousin
signed in as Mr. Tar H. Horse.

173
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,092
The heroin caused
the respiratory distress,

174
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,095
the naloxone turned off the
receptors, causing your distress.

175
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,757
I'm not going to
stop doing drugs!

176
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,426
It's reality that sucks!

177
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,707
You're saying I'm lying?
To my subconscious?

178
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,687
People do it all the time. And
like it or not, you are a person.

179
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:45,940
He said every one of those...

180
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,344
But not then. And not like that.

181
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,087
This guy was going
nuts from the naloxone.

182
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,993
He couldn't be rational
if you wanted him to be.

183
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,452
Which you did. Why?

184
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,797
I compressed the
story a little to...

185
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,880
Context matters.

186
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,019
You never talk to patients
for non-diagnostic reasons.

187
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,650
But this guy...

188
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,694
Feeling better?

189
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,074
I'm not going to
stop doing drugs.

190
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,338
You were a stockbroker,
son of a stockbroker,

191
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,710
married, children...

192
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,839
And I was miserable.

193
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,217
You say you were miserable

194
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,812
because you need to
rationalize screwing it up.

195
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,983
Except I didn't.

196
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,856
I mean, I did,

197
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,696
but I'm not miserable.

198
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,255
Not anymore.

199
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,269
I had a ski injury

200
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,635
and painkillers weren't enough

201
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,709
and a friend of mine
gave me some heroin.

202
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,375
The second it entered
my veins, it was like

203
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,220
God had taken over my body.

204
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,049
It was like there
was no more pain

205
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,960
or unhappiness in my
life or anybody else's.

206
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,330
But then you lost everything.

207
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,465
Everything wasn't enough.

208
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,276
Because it's reality that sucks.

209
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,343
Are you arguing that
he's a good role model?

210
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,851
He's happy.

211
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:33,952
He's dead.

212
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:36,966
You heard what
you wanted to hear.

213
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,652
The more interesting question,

214
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,954
always, is why you
wanted to hear it.

215
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,476
You're stealing
this guy's oxygen?

216
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,473
There's oxygen everywhere.

217
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,172
You passed on all your cases,

218
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,545
reassigned them
to other doctors.

219
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,508
They weren't interesting.

220
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,696
They were my reason for
getting your sentence delayed.

221
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,120
Yeah, I guess
you'll have to tell

222
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,816
the parole board something else.

223
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,519
Maybe that I was in the OR the
entire day the ceiling collapsed,

224
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,495
so I couldn't have caused
the plumbing problem.

225
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,028
You set me up. Not really.

226
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,193
You were going to
basically perjure yourself

227
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,827
so that I could delay jail time.

228
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,099
Doesn't it make more sense
to actually perjure yourself

229
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,367
so I can actually
avoid jail time?

230
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,544
Why are you doing this?

231
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,410
Why are you risking
destroying yourself?

232
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,676
There is no risk. I know you.

233
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,715
You'll do the honest thing.

234
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,219
You'll lie.

235
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,452
No.

236
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,203
He's happy.

237
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,075
He's dead.

238
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,881
You weren't worried.

239
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,443
Of course I was worried.
My plan fell through.

240
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,490
The plan didn't matter. Your plan
to replace that plan didn't matter.

241
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,488
Wilson didn't matter,
jail didn't matter,

242
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,071
the only thing that mattered,

243
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,554
the only thing that ever
mattered, was the puzzle.

244
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,441
I noticed a slight twitch
in his thenar eminence.

245
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,503
<i>Which meant...</i>

246
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,976
You're dying.

247
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,444
Because my thumb
is a little shaky?

248
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,326
Plus the thinning of the muscle.

249
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,512
Plus that speech you
gave at Yankee Stadium

250
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,418
saying you were the luckiest
man on the face of the earth.

251
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,115
Add them up, it means ALS.

252
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,021
Lou Gehrig's disease?

253
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,923
You're trapped in your
body. You can't move or speak

254
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,333
while you just die?

255
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,643
If it makes you feel any better,

256
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,193
at this rate, it'll be fast.

257
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,972
You're not symmetrical.

258
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,045
Wait.

259
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,357
Now you're standing at the door.

260
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,581
What happened in the meantime?

261
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,017
And Io, there was a miraculous
wonder. I walked across the room...

262
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,147
No, you just skipped over
a chunk of conversation.

263
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,714
He swore that he'd live
a better, more selfless life

264
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,521
in his remaining
time, blah, blah, blah.

265
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,825
After two blahs, I'd heard
enough and I moved to the door.

266
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,866
No. You're avoiding it.

267
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,430
Do you smell smoke?

268
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,236
Fair enough.

269
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,740
You're not symmetrical.

270
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,105
The veins on your
right side are distended.

271
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,180
What does that mean?

272
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,046
There's a bulge in your
supraclavicular notch.

273
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,330
There's something in there.

274
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,385
What?

275
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,381
I'm not that good a doctor.

276
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,101
Good news.

277
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,696
Your case is fascinating.

278
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,602
And good news for you,

279
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:16,936
you're gonna live.

280
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,875
<i>You've inhaled a small branch,</i>

281
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,574
<i>probably while you were
realizing that it's all worth it</i>

282
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,708
<i>while you were passed
out on a park bench.</i>

283
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,129
<i>Anyone else would have coughed
it up, but 'cause you're a junkie,</i>

284
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,985
<i>your cough reflex is suppressed.</i>

285
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,147
<i>And it grew?</i>

286
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,267
<i>Not unless you also
inhaled a chunk of the sun</i>

287
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,227
<i>and a drip-irrigation
system, you idiot.</i>

288
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,390
<i>It set off an autoimmune reaction
which, and I can't help saying this,</i>

289
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,730
<i>was the root of
all your problems.</i>

290
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,928
You're smiling.

291
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,470
I was, and now I'm not.

292
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,104
Because a moment's
fun a few days ago

293
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,842
does not trump a friend dying.

294
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,280
Yeah, it does, you idiot.

295
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,661
Because after he's
dead you cry for a while

296
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,847
and then you go back
to doing what you love.

297
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,488
Every patient I've had,

298
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,119
in 70 years from now, they'll
all be as dead as Wilson.

299
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,357
Everybody dies.
It's meaningless.

300
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,760
When you solve a puzzle,

301
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,936
the world makes sense
and everything feels right.

302
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,631
And you'll always
have another one,

303
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,105
because people
will always get sick.

304
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,005
It's shallow and
it's insignificant,

305
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,873
but if you don't give
a damn if idiots live,

306
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,175
why would you possibly give
a damn about shallowness?

307
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,711
It makes you happy.

308
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,548
And why would you
need more than that?

309
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,120
Go home.

310
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,125
Foreman.

311
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,297
House would never leave
food out here rotting for days.

312
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,734
His suitcases are in his closet.

313
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,698
If we had handled
this differently...

314
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,709
We did the right thing.

315
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Hello?

316
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,950
I'll let his accountant know.

317
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,739
House no-showed on
a hooker two nights ago.

318
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,887
Outgoing calls.

319
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,162
Hooker.

320
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,438
Me. I didn't pick up.

321
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,902
The Chinese place...

322
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,932
Wait, wait, wait. Who's that?

323
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,905
He called four times.

324
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,001
I don't know.

325
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:21,476
It's a total disaster. Do you
have any idea how hard it is

326
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,786
to schedule a cable appointment
with the hours that I work?

327
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,935
House has been missing for two
days, we know he talked to you.

328
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,071
Anything you can tell
us about his mental state,

329
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,735
or where he was
headed, anything at all...

330
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,356
Would be a breach of confidentiality
and a violation of the law.

331
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,799
Not if he's a danger to
himself or someone else.

332
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,969
Is this coming out
of our 50 minutes?

333
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,370
Is this your douchebag group?

334
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,266
Excuse me.

335
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,791
What makes you think
he's a danger to himself?

336
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,593
He hasn't been home, but he
didn't take anything with him,

337
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,381
not even his cell.

338
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,448
You're not saying anything,

339
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,582
which means he didn't
specifically mention suicide.

340
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,216
But you came out
here to talk to us,

341
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,285
so he must've said
something that worries you.

342
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,431
There are other ways
of reaching oblivion.

343
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,860
Vicodin? He always
has his Vicodin,

344
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,461
there's no reason
to call a shrink...

345
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,010
His last patient
was a heroin addict.

346
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,168
So I guess we're all done here.

347
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,479
The guy's address
has gotta be in the file.

348
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,578
What about God?

349
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,684
You were leaving,
and then you stopped.

350
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,087
Why?

351
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,687
Your theory is I'm not leaving
because I believe in God?

352
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,594
What? He's calling me home?

353
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,156
Maybe falling through
that floor was a sign.

354
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,429
Maybe that the universe
hates you. Something.

355
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,530
You really don't believe?

356
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,436
Really, not in some deep
crack of some remote recess

357
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,945
of some dark
corner of your mind?

358
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,345
No.

359
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,879
Except that some deep
crack of some remote recess

360
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,919
of some dark corner
is here telling me...

361
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:01,986
That's enough.

362
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,616
In a burning building, facing imminent
death, that's more than enough.

363
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,821
Pascal's wager is facile.

364
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,124
Saying it's facile is facile.

365
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:12,964
Why is it wrong?

366
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,226
Don't be logical. Be desperate.

367
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,503
You've gotta have
something to hold on to.

368
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,674
But you can't live your life based
on something you don't believe.

369
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:27,679
But you could end your life based
on something you don't believe?

370
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,975
What about love?

371
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:33,350
I lived with you for years.
I know you believe in love.

372
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,483
Foreman wouldn't help me.

373
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,654
Which means I need
you to take the fall.

374
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,358
You do remember
I'm dying, right?

375
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,368
Which is why you'll
never spend a day in jail.

376
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,270
Fresh-faced, cancer-ridden.

377
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,015
It's tough to do both,
but you pull it off.

378
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,750
Your fingerprints are all
over those hockey tickets.

379
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,243
I never admitted
to flushing anything.

380
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:01,678
My prints make sense if I
gave those tickets to you,

381
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,238
as an incentive to stay alive.

382
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,441
And I was so angry that you
didn't respect my dying wishes,

383
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,646
I took thousands of
dollars of season tickets

384
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,019
and flushed them down toilets?

385
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,956
All you have to do is
create reasonable doubt.

386
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,516
Great. What if I
do more than that?

387
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:15,788
What if I end up in jail?

388
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,354
Or spending my final
months in endless hearings?

389
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,697
That's a risk you're
willing to take.

390
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,769
I have a reputation, I
have a legacy that could...

391
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,275
Wilson.

392
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,676
I don't want to lose
this time with you.

393
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:46,785
Okay.

394
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,328
Thanks.

395
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,891
I knew I could count on you.

396
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,505
Wait! Wait!

397
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,345
You want the fries back?

398
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,244
I'm not gonna take the fall.

399
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:18,684
Don't do this to me, Wilson.

400
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,491
It's our only option. Exactly.

401
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,826
Because you overplayed
your hand with Foreman.

402
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,890
Because you knew you
had me as a backstop.

403
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,868
Even with me dying,
you just assumed

404
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,056
I'd be here to bail you out.

405
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,999
Since you are here, and
you are bailing me out,

406
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:37,566
seems like a pretty
safe assumption.

407
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,171
Hey!

408
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,779
I won't be here soon.

409
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,680
If I do this, I'm teaching you

410
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,845
that your bad behavior
will always be rewarded.

411
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,183
You need to learn...

412
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,120
How to act when you're gone?

413
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,783
If that's the lesson, we've a
really great opportunity coming up.

414
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,092
You'll just try to find someone
else, and it won't work,

415
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,288
and it shouldn't work.

416
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,592
So that's the great
wisdom you're imparting?

417
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,098
That I'll always be alone?

418
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,364
There's only one
person you can count on.

419
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,942
I thought there were two.

420
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,641
I need to do this.

421
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:16,943
For you.

422
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,753
Wilson's right.

423
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:32,054
He's always right. He's
always been your good side.

424
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,500
I always wondered why I
photographed so poorly.

425
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,164
And because he's
always played that role,

426
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,569
you've never had to develop
a conscience of your own.

427
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:45,835
People don't change. Consciences
don't spontaneously develop.

428
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,810
You're wrong, Greg.

429
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,611
Which is why you'll be
better off without him.

430
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:02,285
You've been looking to him to find
what you've gotta find within yourself.

431
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,728
Something you can find.

432
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,511
Hold your child.

433
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,728
This is a reason to die.

434
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,271
This is what my life could
have been, not what it can be.

435
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,605
If it could have been,

436
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,871
you're capable of it now.

437
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,950
You're married, Cuddy's gone.

438
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:02,715
We aren't the only two
people who could love you.

439
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,223
Why settle so easily?

440
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,065
These are just
idiotic fantasies.

441
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,107
Greg, don't.

442
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,407
At odds with every
logical bone in my body.

443
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,742
Get up.

444
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,874
You do not have to die in here!

445
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,157
Is this hell?

446
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,798
An eternity of people
trying to convince me to live?

447
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,977
Who says I'm here to
convince you to live?

448
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,517
You're the last one I
thought would hate me.

449
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,815
I don't hate you.

450
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,256
I love you.

451
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,189
And yet you think
I deserve to die.

452
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,661
But not as a punishment.

453
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:21,131
As a reward.

454
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,036
I think

455
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,832
you've suffered enough.

456
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,702
You've given enough.

457
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,609
I think you deserve
a chance to just

458
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,772
give up.

459
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,214
Like Wilson did?

460
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,320
Like Wilson did.

461
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:48,689
You accepted his choice that
ending the pain is better than the pain.

462
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,160
Why can't you give
yourself that gift?

463
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,172
This is the address
House's patient gave?

464
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,373
Everybody lies.

465
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,851
Do you smell smoke?

466
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,976
Just let go.

467
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,541
Just go to sleep.

468
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,653
I had a chance to avoid this.

469
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:52,816
You had many chances,
and you blew them all up.

470
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,922
No, this was different.

471
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,755
They're all different. But
the reasons are all the same.

472
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,495
You're arrogant.
You're self-destructive.

473
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,133
You only care about yourself.

474
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,140
That moment with the patient.

475
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,844
That chunk of
conversation I skipped over.

476
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,851
I told him he was dying.

477
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,465
If it makes you feel any better,

478
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,989
at this rate, it'll be fast.

479
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,994
Let me take the fall.

480
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,827
For you. For that prank.

481
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:44,515
You don't owe me anything.

482
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:45,643
You tried to save me.

483
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,840
I failed. Motives don't
matter. Only actions.

484
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,779
Trying is an action.

485
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,181
Why are you trying
to talk me out of this?

486
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,552
You just fake the records, you
say I came into the clinic last week.

487
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,818
I'll tell the cops you
treated me like crap.

488
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,960
So I stole your tickets
and flushed them.

489
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,466
Thank you.

490
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,385
And you're doing this
because you're dying?

491
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,977
I'm doing this because I
have nothing left to lose.

492
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,503
So when you were living, you did
nothing for anyone and didn't care.

493
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:40,397
Now that you're dying, you're
willing to help a virtual stranger.

494
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:44,595
Which means you're a better
person dying than you ever were living.

495
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:49,099
And the world's a better
place because I didn't save you.

496
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:55,911
Which makes me wonder
why I'm about to tell you,

497
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,650
you're not symmetrical.

498
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,720
What's your point?

499
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:04,586
That you cared about him more
than you cared about yourself?

500
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,459
You cared about the puzzle
more than you cared about yourself.

501
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,726
If I kept it to myself, then
it would just be a puzzle.

502
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,063
But I opened my mouth
because I thought it was more.

503
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,114
You know it's the same or you
wouldn't be bickering with me

504
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,498
while the flames
lick at your feet.

505
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,308
You're afraid of this decision,

506
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,105
and you are trying to argue until
fate takes it out of your hands.

507
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,415
You're taking the
cowardly way out.

508
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,812
And worse,

509
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,186
you're too cowardly to even admit
you're taking the cowardly way out.

510
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,665
You're right.

511
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,628
But I can change.

512
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,336
He could have gotten out.

513
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,738
People are found sometimes.

514
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,342
Even in collapsed...

515
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,582
I think they're
pulling a body out.

516
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,124
The coroner confirms it's him.

517
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:23,344
House hired me when
no one else would.

518
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,949
He got me fired.

519
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,455
He gave me the
guts to get fired.

520
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,659
He gave me the courage to quit.

521
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,169
Gregory was...

522
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,256
He was a good son.

523
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:40,267
He was a trying boyfriend, but I

524
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,209
never stopped loving him.

525
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,506
<i>He was my husband for real.</i>

526
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,784
I couldn't help but love him.

527
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,009
<i>He was my boss</i>

528
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,114
and my employee.

529
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:00,552
At both times,

530
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:04,886
I learned from him.

531
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,361
He made me a better parent,

532
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,462
whether he meant to or not.

533
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,934
He was willing to kill me.

534
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,704
And I'll always be grateful.

535
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,907
He wasn't always
easy to deal with...

536
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,145
<i>but somewhere in there,</i>

537
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,982
he knew how to love.

538
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,748
He was my friend.

539
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:39,726
The thing you have to remember,

540
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,157
the thing you can't forget,

541
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,701
is that Gregory
House saved lives.

542
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:51,774
He was a healer,
and in the end...

543
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,685
House was an ass.

544
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,120
He mocked anyone.

545
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,057
Patients, co-workers,
his dwindling friends,

546
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,726
anyone who didn't measure up
to his insane ideals of integrity.

547
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,460
He claimed to be on
some heroic quest for truth.

548
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,937
But the truth is
he was a bitter jerk

549
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,473
who liked making
people miserable.

550
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,805
And he proved that
by dying selfishly,

551
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,469
numbed by narcotics,
without a thought of anyone.

552
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:33,569
A betrayal of everyone
who cared about him.

553
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,409
Phone.

554
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,256
A million times he needed me

555
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,447
and the one time
that I needed...

556
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:46,727
Oh, come on! This is a funeral.

557
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:48,497
Just get it.

558
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,108
This is embarrassing.

559
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,937
I'd sworn I'd turned this off.

560
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,313
This isn't my phone.

561
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:38,608
Hi.

562
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,378
How...

563
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,855
I got out of the
back of the building.

564
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,187
The body...

565
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,734
Just switched
the dental records.

566
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,708
You're destroying
your entire life.

567
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,245
You can't go back from this.

568
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,810
You'll go to jail for years.

569
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,511
You can never be a doctor again.

570
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,048
I'm dead, Wilson.

571
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,759
How do you want to
spend your last five months?

572
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,651
When the cancer
starts getting really bad...

573
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,955
Cancer's boring.
