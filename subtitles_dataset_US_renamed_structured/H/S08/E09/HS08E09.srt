1
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:07,700
We're in the car, honey. We're
going to the hospital for tests.

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,284
We're in the hospital. We're
going to the doctor's office.

3
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,461
Can you tell me
what this is called?

4
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,462
You use it to get
food from inside.

5
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:34,262
Yes, but what's it called?

6
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,460
Is it a spatula?

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,972
No.

8
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,836
Good. Is it a can opener?

9
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:45,242
No. It's... It's...

10
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,682
You're trying to
make me look stupid.

11
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,117
You can go to hell! Why
don't you kill yourself?

12
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,621
Andres.

13
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,916
It's okay.

14
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,922
There she is.

15
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,094
Here I am.

16
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,260
Here. Come on.

17
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,503
You just need to answer
a few more questions,

18
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,510
then we're going home.
We'll have lunch, okay?

19
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,372
Okay.

20
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:23,844
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,854
I have Alzheimer's.

22
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,984
I know.

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,158
The mood swings come on
quickly, but it's under control.

24
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,494
Don't worry. He's actually
perfect for the drug trial.

25
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,058
Oh.

26
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,393
Thank God.

27
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,369
We can start as
soon as next week.

28
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,869
Andres! Oh, my God!

29
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,248
Andres?

30
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,310
Early onset familial
Alzheimer's. Brazilian descent.

31
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,912
Blood chemistries
showed high ammonia.

32
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,382
Vomiting stopped after the
ER put him on antiemetics.

33
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,256
Any recent health issues?

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,091
Just a sore throat
a few weeks ago.

35
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,665
How advanced is he?
Could be hyperalimentation.

36
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,758
Advanced enough,
but no IV feedings.

37
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,064
The wife shut down her
floral company to stay home

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,401
and feed him every meal
he's had in the last four years.

39
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,372
Do we owe this
case to your guilt

40
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,501
at having ignored your
own forgetful mommy?

41
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,704
My guilt over my mom is
why I put up with my dad.

42
00:02:58,779 --> 00:02:59,872
You're taking this case

43
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,225
because we're running a Phase
Two trial on an Alzheimer's drug.

44
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,946
You couldn't round up enough
doddering, old guinea pigs,

45
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,850
so you need us to
fix this little piggy?

46
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,220
I'd like to sit in. Especially since
you're short a team member.

47
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,883
You mean Taub? Got him in here.

48
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,120
He asked for personal
days. His daughter's sick.

49
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,594
Isn't that the point
of having a spare?

50
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,097
I denied his request.

51
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,791
After I'd already approved it,

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,466
which you knew because
I sent you a memo.

53
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,901
Dr. Adams, taped under
your chair is an index card.

54
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,306
Would you read it, please?

55
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,483
"Wednesday, 2:43 p.m.

56
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,582
"A black pawn will
believe he's the black king

57
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,652
"and attempt to capture the
white head of diagnostics."

58
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:52,466
It's 10:15 on Friday.

59
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,934
Damn it. Look, the point
is, I saw this coming.

60
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,970
Dr. Foreman and I did
not always see eye to eye,

61
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,973
but he never had the
power to overrule me.

62
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,337
Now that he has the power,

63
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,640
he won't be able to resist
the temptation to use it.

64
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,647
With great power comes
great micromanaging.

65
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,011
And great vests.

66
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,676
I know you're the
better diagnostician.

67
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,777
I'm not gonna interfere.
I'm only here to help.

68
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,585
Could be transient nitrogen
load from a GI bleed.

69
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,090
Not if the
vomiting's persistent.

70
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,595
Which we won't know, because
the ER put him on antiemetics.

71
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,661
Take him off.

72
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,095
Wait. He was
puking his guts out.

73
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,030
We'd risk aspiration.

74
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,133
I'm just disagreeing,
not overruling.

75
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,366
So glad you're on board.
Take him off antiemetics.

76
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,375
Do an upper endoscopy
to check for bleeds.

77
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,583
It could be a bladder infection.

78
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,846
We'll run a pregnancy test.

79
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,215
I'm not pregnant.

80
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,620
Any type of birth
control can fail.

81
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,987
Not mine.

82
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,290
Oh, I'm sorry. You
said you were married?

83
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,490
Yeah. Happily.

84
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:03,303
It's okay. Sex can wane
in any marriage over time.

85
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,396
No, no. We've never had sex.

86
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,835
We kiss and cuddle, but neither
one of us is interested in sex.

87
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,247
You're both celibate?

88
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,340
No, neither of us.

89
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,581
Celibacy is a choice.
This is our orientation.

90
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,081
We're asexual.

91
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,852
Not quite sure what
box to check here.

92
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,170
<i>You're making a mistake.</i>

93
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,893
If I had the power to veto him,

94
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,230
given all the crap I've
put up with over the years,

95
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,746
I don't know if I could
use it objectively.

96
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,829
I do.

97
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,372
I can. I have.

98
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,038
It might be easier if
you'd stay out of the room.

99
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,409
I thought it'd be
different. This week.

100
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:50,211
I'm supposed to talk to his PO about
getting his ankle monitor off early.

101
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,723
You're saying he
should defer to you?

102
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,778
No. I'm just saying what he's
doing doesn't seem rational,

103
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:58,347
which makes me think it's
rational in a way I'm not privy to.

104
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,189
He always has a plan.

105
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,195
And he's always
self-destructive.

106
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:05,426
He may just be shooting
himself in the ankle.

107
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,275
I know it feels strange. Dr. Chase
is just looking in your throat.

108
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,709
We're in the
hospital. You're fine.

109
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,946
That's a pretty nice
trophy there, Andres.

110
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,539
He coached youth soccer.

111
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,210
Took a team that
was zero-and-six

112
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,584
all the way to the state
finals at Long Branch.

113
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,187
Hey, thanks for
doing this in here.

114
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,595
Switching rooms can
be very disorienting.

115
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,996
You take very good care of him.

116
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,330
I love him. Sickness
and health, right?

117
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,803
Upper esophagus is clear,
moving on to the GE junction.

118
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,000
Hi. Hey.

119
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,012
I'm sorry, family members
only during procedures.

120
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,048
I'll wait outside.

121
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,641
Oh, no, please, it's okay.

122
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,279
Joseph helps me with
my husband sometimes.

123
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,582
He's a good friend.

124
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,252
Which means not family.

125
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,294
Wait, we're gonna
be here a while.

126
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,525
Why don't you show Joseph
where the visitor's lounge is?

127
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,860
Okay.

128
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,631
What?

129
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,538
I'm surprised you didn't
go into the diplomatic corps.

130
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,838
Oh, you think they're...

131
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,006
No. If they're having sex,

132
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,709
it's probably
with their genitals.

133
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:35,546
Mallory-Weiss tear. Vomiting
must have torn the lining.

134
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,191
You know that close to 1% of the
population identifies as asexual?

135
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,332
We really got to get you laid.

136
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,063
If I have to plow that
furrow myself, so be it.

137
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,401
I've a patient who's asexual.

138
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,701
Is she a giant pool of algae?

139
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,004
It's a valid sexual orientation,

140
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,568
according to this
article, at least.

141
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,007
Yeah, I think I read that,
too. Is that <i>Fugliness Weekly?</i>

142
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,846
She's perfectly fine-looking.

143
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,061
Happily married for 10 years.

144
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,179
To a guy who loves penis
enough for both of them.

145
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,482
He's asexual, too.

146
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,990
Ran a complete physical on her.

147
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,323
Nothing wrong except a
common bladder infection.

148
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,057
Hundred bucks says I
can find a medical reason

149
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,310
why she doesn't
want to have sex.

150
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,825
You're out of your
mind if you think

151
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,632
I'm letting you anywhere
near my patient.

152
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,138
Fine, I won't go near her.

153
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:30,007
Just give me her file and any
blood samples you have left over.

154
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,714
No contact whatsoever.
You talk to her, the bet is void.

155
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,344
No contact. Plays to
my strengths, anyway.

156
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,151
Right now's not a
good time, House.

157
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,925
Not for the Dean of Medicine,

158
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,398
but it's the perfect time if
you're a member of my team.

159
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,264
Which one are you?

160
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,368
What did the endoscopy show?

161
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,107
No signs of ulcers or blockages.

162
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,241
But you found a tear
just below the esophagus.

163
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,407
Explains the bleeding.

164
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:12,281
Doesn't explain why he vomited
so hard he ripped his insides.

165
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,082
His liver enzymes are slightly
elevated. Gallstones could...

166
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,520
No complaints of pain.

167
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,082
Steatohepatitis would make
his AST and ATL levels rise.

168
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,923
Are you calling his liver fat?

169
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,629
Start the patient on statins,

170
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,030
do a biopsy to confirm.

171
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,966
And knock him out,
I've heard he's a wiggler.

172
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,212
There's no need
to put him under.

173
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,400
We can confirm fatty
liver with an ultrasound.

174
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,439
Just making an observation.

175
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,037
Well done. And now,
as a member of my team,

176
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,140
you can make the equally useful
observations that the sky is blue,

177
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,708
I'm wearing pants, and I'm
ignoring your first observation.

178
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,146
Of course.

179
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Wait.

180
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,496
And there it is.

181
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,626
You're trying to screw
with my confidence.

182
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,809
Well, if I wanted to do that,

183
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,473
I'd tell you how much
the nurses hate you.

184
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,163
You're trying to get me to
define myself as a subordinate

185
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,136
to keep me from
ever intervening,

186
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,504
even if it's fully in the
scope of my duties.

187
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,907
Like now. This isn't
about diagnostics,

188
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,497
it's about what's
safe for the patient.

189
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:13,940
Do the ultrasound.

190
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,845
Ultrasound it is.

191
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,016
And the nurses love you.

192
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,168
You don't think I knew House
was gonna tell you to ignore me

193
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,683
and not do the ultrasound?

194
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,527
This is an ultrasound machine.

195
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,326
Which you're gonna use to
do an ultrasound-guided biopsy.

196
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,800
You've probably got
a kit stashed here...

197
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:49,041
"Cuddy Dark will waste his
afternoon chasing conspiracy theories."

198
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,084
You're letting him
get inside your head.

199
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,017
He can do a lot of
damage in there.

200
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:58,049
Dr. Chase, he
started vomiting again.

201
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,026
This is why we
stopped the antiemetics.

202
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,773
We needed to see if
it was still a symptom.

203
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:05,958
Okay.

204
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,459
Here. You want this?

205
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,664
Get your hands off me.
You're taking my head!

206
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,971
It's okay, Andres.
You're in the hospital.

207
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,016
10 milligrams of diazepam.

208
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,483
Already on it.

209
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,248
Hey! NATALIE:
I'm fine. I'm fine.

210
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,918
Foreman.

211
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,656
Blood in his urine.

212
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,369
We resumed the antiemetics
and increased his sedation.

213
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,667
He really went after her.

214
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,731
Maybe he found out
about her "good friend."

215
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,401
It was just paranoid rage.
Typical of Alzheimer's.

216
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,022
We don't even know if
they were sleeping together.

217
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,106
A few hours ago, you were sure.

218
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,411
And that's significant why?

219
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,112
Sorry, only the bleeding's
medically relevant.

220
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,586
No, I wasn't being rhetorical.

221
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:05,648
If they are sleeping together,
why do we disapprove?

222
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,490
You're pro infidelity?

223
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,722
She's not married.

224
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,762
If marriage is feeding
and cleaning someone

225
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,359
and limiting conversation to
repeating a few simple commands,

226
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,167
then I was married
to my pet rat.

227
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,731
And a lot of people
owe me wedding gifts.

228
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,742
And we're walking,
we're walking.

229
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,280
I don't care how sick your
spouse gets, you don't jump ship.

230
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,373
Alzheimer's is different. She
can't share her problems with him,

231
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,851
or plan for the future. The man
she married no longer exists.

232
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,387
Yes, he does. He's in there.

233
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,582
This is why you get married.

234
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,352
Said the divorced woman
to the divorced man.

235
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,692
I didn't jump ship. My husband
sank it when he cheated on me.

236
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,356
Commitment's not conditional.

237
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,265
She is there for him in the
only way that matters now.

238
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,745
She gave up her life
to take care of him.

239
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,896
Proves she's an idiot.

240
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,201
If she had any sense, she'd
have stuck him in a facility

241
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,707
and jumped on that strange...

242
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,403
Dr. Foreman. We were
just looking for you.

243
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,412
I was right about
the antiemetics.

244
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,839
If we kept him on
them like I said,

245
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,891
he wouldn't have gotten
agitated and punched his wife.

246
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,475
Yes, we're back to my
supposed diabolical plan

247
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,383
to shake your confidence.

248
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,615
Let's see if this helps.

249
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,089
If you're speaking
as a team member,

250
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,490
then I'd say you're a moron.

251
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,289
'Cause taking him
off the antiemetics

252
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,262
gave us crucial
diagnostic information.

253
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,630
If you're speaking as Dean of
Medicine, then I'd say you're a moron.

254
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,293
'Cause your micromanaging
kept us from doing a biopsy.

255
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,963
And if we had, the patient would've
been anesthetized hours ago

256
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,735
thus unable to go all
Chris Brown on her ass.

257
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,642
Unless one of your index
cards actually predicted

258
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,024
the guy was gonna
punch his wife,

259
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,140
everything you're saying
is post hoc rationalization.

260
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,811
Dr. Park, would you please
reach under that chair?

261
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,121
"The patient will
punch his wife."

262
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,791
You clearly wrote
that after the fact.

263
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,362
Dr. Adams, would you
please reach into my pants?

264
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,801
"Dr. Blackenshmurtz
will accuse me

265
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,572
"of writing about the
punch after the fact."

266
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,477
And look, there's
a photograph of me

267
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,676
holding a newspaper
dated last Tuesday.

268
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,261
How could I have
gotten my hands on that?

269
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,653
You done? Rhabdomyolysis
fits the vomiting,

270
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,189
pigmenturia and renal failure.

271
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,452
No muscle symptoms
and urine had no myoglobin.

272
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,483
TTP fits, though.

273
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,529
Start him on
plasmapheresis. Unless...

274
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,829
Unless I need to
say, "Mother, may I?"

275
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,301
And "mother's" an abbreviation.

276
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:39,302
Fresh plasma will replace
the damaged red blood cells

277
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,489
that are clogging his kidneys.

278
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:41,537
That sounds hopeful.

279
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,117
How's that feeling?

280
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,449
I've never been hit
in the eye before.

281
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,355
I feel kind of badass.

282
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,619
I think maybe you should go.

283
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,721
Look, I'm fine, okay?

284
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,658
I'll see you tomorrow?

285
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,825
Okay.

286
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,666
We're not having an affair.

287
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,002
It's none of my business.

288
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,169
I mean, not really.

289
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:16,177
'Cause nothing's happened, but
we've talked about it a lot and...

290
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:21,651
It's just really hard
doing this by myself.

291
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,216
When's the last time you
had a full night's sleep?

292
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,419
Um...

293
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,524
I don't know. Three years?

294
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,560
You're not gonna
get any rest here.

295
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,336
People who are sick
are not the only ones

296
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,339
who need to be taken care of.

297
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,917
Why doesn't Chase
have to be here?

298
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,010
You think he knows anything about
women who don't want to have sex?

299
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:59,385
Hormone levels are normal. This
woman seems perfectly healthy.

300
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,259
What does it matter if
she says she's asexual?

301
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,264
It's the fundamental drive of
our species. Sex is healthy.

302
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,059
Orgasms oxygenate the brain,

303
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,725
lighting up over
30 different areas

304
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,429
and making us forget
how boring Susie Cooper is.

305
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,134
That last one may
not be universal.

306
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,038
How about damage
to her spinal cord,

307
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,872
blocking the signals
from her genitals?

308
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,572
Sex drive is in the brain.

309
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,706
I suppose it could be
psychological intimacy issues

310
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,148
caused by childhood abuse.

311
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,930
She's been sharing a toilet with
the same guy for the last 10 years.

312
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,045
It's not the same.

313
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,420
Sex releases oxytocin, it's the
neurochemical basis for bonding.

314
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,756
And that's why men always
marry their right hands.

315
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,919
It's different for girls.

316
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,122
No, it's not. I've
tapped over 30 guys

317
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,876
and never wanted to
see most of them again.

318
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,293
I lived next to a Jewish frat.

319
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,270
We are veering wildly
off track. Please continue.

320
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,275
This woman's life is
probably better off without sex.

321
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,607
Eliminates most
of her insecurities,

322
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,044
she's immune to
most advertising,

323
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,878
and can have honest
relationships with men.

324
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,118
Not a lot of them.

325
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,813
We've run every test and
ruled out all the options.

326
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,390
You're gonna have to accept
she just doesn't want sex.

327
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,823
Lots of people don't have sex.

328
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,291
The only people
who don't want it

329
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,919
are either sick, dead or lying.

330
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,327
So maybe she's lying.

331
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,227
You think she's had a
boyfriend on the side?

332
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:13,391
For 10 years?

333
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,664
Sticking around the whole
time? It doesn't make sense.

334
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,934
What does...

335
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,007
Thirty?

336
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,008
Everybody lies.

337
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,019
Higher or lower?

338
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,986
Followed your advice
and took the night off.

339
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,406
It seems to have
done you some good.

340
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,762
Mmm-hmm.

341
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,339
Where's my husband?

342
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:56,768
He's not in the hospital.

343
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,935
So he just walked out?

344
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,536
All of the shift nurses had their
hands full with a double code.

345
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,342
Perfectly reasonable
explanation.

346
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,883
Same thing happened to me.
Couldn't find my keys for days.

347
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,352
The police have been
notified, I have staff searching.

348
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,685
You told me it
was okay to leave.

349
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,617
I'm sorry.

350
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,890
He has Alzheimer's!
It's freezing outside!

351
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,623
And he's sick!

352
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,893
I mean, you don't even
know what it is yet, do you?

353
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,991
The plasmapheresis
hasn't had time to work,

354
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,536
but TTP is our most likely...

355
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,070
Okay, I have to go look for him.

356
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,636
Hey. Don't be an ass.
Can't you see she's upset?

357
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,644
No, she's guilty.

358
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,643
Instead of being at her
husband's side, she was under you.

359
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,309
Okay. That's...

360
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,183
Yeah, he already
said I was an ass.

361
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,684
Personally, I applaud your
decision to step down off your cross

362
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,988
and get on with your life,
but your misplaced guilt

363
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,357
is shutting down your brain.

364
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,864
We need you to sit, focus,
and answer our questions.

365
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,238
So it's 6:00 a.m.,
patient wakes up,

366
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,909
and the first thing he sees...

367
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,880
In moments of confusion, Alzheimer's
patients regress to old routines.

368
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,282
So what would your husband
do on a Saturday morning?

369
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,211
Nothing. Be at home.

370
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,586
What about a year
ago, five years, or 10?

371
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,787
I don't know.

372
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,284
He trained for a marathon once.

373
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:25,194
Soccer practice. We
took a cooking class.

374
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:30,203
The soccer trophy you were
telling me about, it's gone.

375
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,362
Where was practice?

376
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,202
It was close to
here, on Chesterfield.

377
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,417
Okay, he comes, he thinks
he's waiting for practice.

378
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,686
He'd want to get
out of the wind,

379
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,251
but somewhere he
could see the kids arrive.

380
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,725
There.

381
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,796
Over here!

382
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,803
On three. One, two, three.

383
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,475
Nothing.

384
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,487
Not dead till he's
warm and dead.

385
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,926
Get him to the ICU.

386
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,794
Start him on
extracorporeal circulation.

387
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,377
That'll raise his temperature
too quickly, it'll cause acidosis.

388
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,131
We can deal with his
metabolism crashing.

389
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,296
We can't reverse brain
damage if we go too slowly.

390
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,249
Either way, if we don't get
his temperature above 95,

391
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,332
it's not gonna matter.

392
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,910
Multiple warm lavage is safer.

393
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,312
Do what House says.

394
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:01,684
He has no heartbeat,
he's not breathing.

395
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,028
How can he not be dead?

396
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,929
Body slows down when it
cools, but it doesn't fully stop.

397
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,096
We're warming his blood outside
of his body and then putting it back.

398
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,537
It'll raise his
temperature enough

399
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,632
that his heart
should naturally start.

400
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,839
Then we can shock
it back into rhythm.

401
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,969
And if it doesn't start?

402
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:23,955
Then there's nothing we can do.

403
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,150
You think it's possible he
knew what he was doing?

404
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,452
Like some part of him gets
what he's putting his wife through,

405
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,021
so he tried to... Kill himself?

406
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,158
It's what I'd do if I were him.

407
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,066
At least I wish I would.

408
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,063
I meant run away.

409
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,139
You think you should kill
yourself if you become a burden

410
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,302
to the people who love you?

411
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:55,075
If you really loved
them back, then yes.

412
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,416
That's really dark.

413
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,317
It's not naive.

414
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:07,884
I just believe people are capable
of more than you do, apparently.

415
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,358
We've got brain activity.

416
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,866
Temp's at 93. His
heart should start soon.

417
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,510
My dad left me alone to
care for my alcoholic mom

418
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,840
and raise my baby sister.

419
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,345
I was just a teenager.

420
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,078
I spent half of my
time changing diapers

421
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,344
and the other half cleaning
up my mom's vomit.

422
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,512
But it must have been important

423
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,716
that you stayed
for both of them.

424
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,626
Mom died after a few years.

425
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,356
It was ugly and painful, and
she went with me hating her.

426
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,695
My sister ended up
drinking half of her life away

427
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,394
and hating me
because I couldn't help.

428
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,198
After Mom, I had nothing left.

429
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:56,607
So do I wish Mom had used
a gun instead of a bottle?

430
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,938
Yes.

431
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,442
I didn't know.

432
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,880
That's why I told you.

433
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,579
Ventricular fibrillation.

434
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,288
Give him 300
milligrams amiodarone.

435
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,098
Be careful. Once
we establish rhythm,

436
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,607
any accidental movement
could crash him back into V-fib.

437
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,336
Clear.

438
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,090
We still have a long way to go.

439
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,750
Cold can be
protective to the brain,

440
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,227
but there is a
possibility of damage.

441
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:54,597
We also need to confirm and
treat whatever's making him sick.

442
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,302
I just gotta do a
standard battery of tests.

443
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,465
Blood, urine, EEG.

444
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,873
Is that really necessary
for a free flu shot?

445
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,646
Excuse me, I have to deal with
someone who's having a panic attack.

446
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,321
I specifically said
the bet was off

447
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,860
if you contacted the patient.

448
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,897
Exactly. You never said anything
about the patient's husband.

449
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:29,392
The deal was a medical
reason why she doesn't have sex.

450
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,527
I admit I was
stuck until I realized

451
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,368
that the medical issue
was not hers, but his.

452
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,002
She's lying to compensate.
It's a tale as old as time.

453
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,239
Boy meets girl.
Girl falls for boy.

454
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,110
Boy says, "I'm asexual."

455
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,945
Girls says, "Yeah, me, too."

456
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,614
Your twisted logic
can't hide the fact

457
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,450
that tricking a patient
into being tested

458
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,080
is completely unethical.

459
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:55,289
Come on. Don't you think she
deserves to know why her husband

460
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,590
won't bend her over
the kitchen counter?

461
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,392
You love all that caring crap.

462
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,576
You're not doing this out of
the kindness of your heart.

463
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,967
You're not even doing
this out of medical curiosity.

464
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,231
I thought I made it clear
I'm doing it for the cash.

465
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,803
Two people are happy, and
your natural impulse is to destroy it.

466
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,877
How do you know she's
happy? Did she tell you?

467
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:15,540
No, chirping birds flew out
of her butt carrying a banner.

468
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,446
All right, I admit that
my natural impulse

469
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,314
is to doubt people's
claims to happiness,

470
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,546
but yours is to be
a sucker for them.

471
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,248
You tell me which one's worse.

472
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,632
He just opened his
eyes a little while ago.

473
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:40,331
His heartbeat's doing well and
his body temperature stabilized.

474
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,076
There he is.

475
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,586
Is that Portuguese?

476
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:58,988
Yeah.

477
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,026
Honey, I don't understand.

478
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:08,791
What's he saying?

479
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,168
I don't know.

480
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:15,101
I tried to learn when we
got married, but I just...

481
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,176
It's okay, it's okay.

482
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,813
His body temperature is
rising. It's above normal.

483
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:31,550
Wait, I thought you said it
was stable. Why is it still rising?

484
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,148
I don't know.

485
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:38,187
Vomiting, liver,
kidneys and now fever.

486
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,829
I don't want to tell you how
to do your job, Dr. Foreman,

487
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,394
since telling people how
to do their job is your job.

488
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,831
But when your
less-than-competent

489
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,398
administration of this hospital

490
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,408
affects what's written
on my whiteboard...

491
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,570
Get to the point.

492
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,148
The word "fever." Could
come from the patient's illness,

493
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,992
or it could come from the
fact that you allowed him

494
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,645
to saunter out of your hospital
and take a nap in the snow.

495
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,864
He couldn't have caught a
virus while he was outside,

496
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,481
fever came on too fast.

497
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,752
The hypothermia could
have caused cell necrosis.

498
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,720
TTP was the diagnosis
when he walked out.

499
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,026
Fever's a little
high, but it still fits.

500
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,760
We should continue
plasmapheresis.

501
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,360
We're missing symptoms.

502
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,565
We should add language
loss and aggression.

503
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,164
Should we also add
forgetfulness? He's got Alzheimer's.

504
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,335
We've just been assuming.

505
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,901
Because the patient's wife
said he exhibited both for a year.

506
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,972
He's never hit her before
or lost all his English.

507
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,345
We have to consider any change

508
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,855
since he's been
admitted as relevant.

509
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:35,183
"Have to?" Do I need
to pull out another card?

510
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,384
Disseminated viral
infection, with encephalitis.

511
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,191
Patient complained of a
sore throat a few weeks ago.

512
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:46,596
Start him on interferon.

513
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:53,805
Encephalitis makes
his brain swell,

514
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,808
which causes symptoms that are
hard to distinguish from his Alzheimer's.

515
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,936
With the interferon, his
English should come back

516
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,809
and the aggression
should subside.

517
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,542
But you're not sure?

518
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,079
Unfortunately, no.

519
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:10,885
And you're not sure if he has
brain damage from being frozen?

520
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:17,260
So best-case scenario,

521
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,962
I just had a glimpse
into his future?

522
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,600
I can't take care
of him anymore.

523
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,972
Chances are his
mental state will improve.

524
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,737
You could get
more time with him.

525
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:36,275
We married six
months after I met him.

526
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,012
A year after that, he
started forgetting things.

527
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:45,124
I've known my husband longer
with his Alzheimer's than without.

528
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,251
I've watched more of him
disappear than I ever got to know.

529
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,823
I just can't do this anymore.

530
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,030
You lose.

531
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,507
Blood work shows
high levels of prolactin.

532
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,339
Add that to some peripheral
red-green confusion,

533
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:11,110
puts my money, excuse me,
your money, soon to be my money,

534
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,452
on a tumor near his pituitary.

535
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,544
Probably started
growing in his early teens.

536
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:20,149
Lowering his libido and
causing erectile dysfunction.

537
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,818
A year on dopamine agonists

538
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,522
and he'll be a sex-crazed
creep just like the rest of us.

539
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,195
Completely fascinated
by Susie Cooper.

540
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,395
I would prefer to be
paid in a single $100 bill.

541
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,665
Always wanted to
use one to light a cigar.

542
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,674
Hooray for us. We
disproved his asexuality.

543
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,679
We also probably
ruined his life.

544
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,238
He'll thank us.
Then he'll doze off.

545
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,874
And then, in a couple of
hours, he'll thank us again.

546
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,976
It could destroy his identity.

547
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:51,182
It's like a gay person being
told they're really straight.

548
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:52,716
So don't tell him.

549
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,726
Yeah, why bother telling a guy he
has a tumor growing in his head?

550
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,239
He'll notice it eventually when
it starts leaking out his ears.

551
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,663
It's a slow-growing tumor.

552
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,723
He'll probably die of
boredom long before that.

553
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:09,069
You always do this. You meddle
and force me into impossible situations.

554
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,505
You knew the second you told me

555
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,101
about this case
that I'd get involved.

556
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,043
You wanted me to meddle.

557
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,491
'Cause no matter
how much you wanted

558
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,177
to believe in this
chaste romance,

559
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,343
you didn't buy it either.

560
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,778
Where's that petition
House's PO sent over

561
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,720
about him getting
his ankle monitor off?

562
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,224
On your desk.

563
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,909
You played me.

564
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,412
This whole thing was
about your ankle monitor.

565
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,125
You weren't trying to
undermine my confidence,

566
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,293
you were trying to inflate it.

567
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,616
You manufactured
conflict with me

568
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,126
so, eventually, you
could let me win.

569
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,854
You knew it was encephalitis,

570
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:59,000
but you waited for me to say it,

571
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,356
because then, with
my ego boosted,

572
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,437
you thought I'd be in the
mood to take off your monitor.

573
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,362
Because I'd think
I could control you.

574
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:10,500
You're right. Take
off my monitor.

575
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,529
See, the beauty of the plan

576
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,303
is if it works, then you
think you can control me.

577
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,141
If it fails, then
you will actually

578
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,306
have proven that
you can control me.

579
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,175
It's pretty genius.

580
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,511
These are your training wheels.

581
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,112
If you think you're up to
this job, it's time to lose them.

582
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,038
Second half of my
plan might need work.

583
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,513
V-fib. Two rounds at 360

584
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,484
without establishing a rhythm.

585
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,513
Wait! Dr. Foreman!

586
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,554
Clear.

587
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,927
He's back.

588
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,636
I sure hope this
Alzheimer's drug trial

589
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,078
is worth a lot to this hospital,

590
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,810
'cause we're wasting a
crapload of time and man power

591
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,749
just to let this guy
watch his mind shrivel

592
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:34,939
and keep his wife miserable.

593
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,888
Heart attack while he was on
interferon rules out encephalitis,

594
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,220
but I still think I'm right
about the neuro symptoms.

595
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,918
It's probably
aseptic meningitis.

596
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,393
We would have
seen meningeal signs.

597
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,455
Given his abnormal mental
status, not necessarily.

598
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,364
Dr. Foreman! Would you
please reach under your chair?

599
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,070
It's just wet gum under here.

600
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,040
Where's the card? What card?

601
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:04,175
I'm happy to leave if you have a
better theory than aseptic meningitis.

602
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,376
Toxins.

603
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,816
If this guy went on a walkabout,

604
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,183
chances are he's done it before.

605
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:09,363
Wife keeps the doors
in the house locked.

606
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,832
There's plenty of
nasty stuff to get into

607
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,066
during the middle of the night.

608
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,334
We asked about
toxins on the history.

609
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,903
The wife said she was sure to clear
the house for her husband's safety.

610
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,054
And I'm sure she succeeded.

611
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,120
She's a PhD in
toxicology, right?

612
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,266
She's an ex-florist. Search
the home for toxic plants,

613
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,132
methyl bromide, any medications.

614
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:29,431
Stop. You're not infallible.

615
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,618
You were wrong
about encephalitis.

616
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,642
Just before you were.

617
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,269
Run CSF tests, find out
what's causing the meningitis.

618
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,780
You said you weren't gonna
overrule me, diagnostically.

619
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,285
And you said I wouldn't
be able to help it.

620
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,287
Apparently, you were
right about that one.

621
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,725
Fine. I'll look
for toxins myself.

622
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,905
You can't go to their house
without Foreman's permission.

623
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,730
Don't need it, I'm gonna talk
to the toxicology PhD upstairs.

624
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,825
What about gifts
from South America?

625
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:59,427
Anyone send any
fruits or vegetables?

626
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,672
I don't think so... No.

627
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,812
I'm gonna need your boyfriend
to collect samples of plants

628
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:11,281
in and around your house.
Toxins are the most...

629
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:21,320
Wait. You understand
him? What's he saying?

630
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,431
He's repeating "blue shack."

631
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:28,161
You know what that is?

632
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,531
Is it somewhere where
pesticides may be kept?

633
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,272
It's where we
had our first date.

634
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:42,103
Do you have a cleaning lady
who might bring her own supplies?

635
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,177
What's he saying?

636
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,342
If it's not relevant to the case, I
don't care, and neither should you.

637
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,853
Please.

638
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,009
This might be the last time I
ever know what he's thinking.

639
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,226
"When I saw her waiting...

640
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,238
"Waiting for me at the table...

641
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,707
"The way her eyes
looked when she smiled...

642
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,337
"I felt like crying.

643
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,513
"I knew she was the
woman I wanted to marry.

644
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:28,925
"And every time
I see her, I say...

645
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,890
"There she is." "There she is."

646
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,267
He's still in there.

647
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,842
What did he say?

648
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,774
He asked who you were.

649
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,547
Don't get your hopes up.

650
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,126
Have your boyfriend
get me those samples.

651
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,266
How did you even
know to look for a tumor?

652
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:18,743
Dr. House noticed
hormone levels in your blood

653
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,745
and consulted with
me as an oncologist...

654
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:22,732
Who cares how they
found it, okay? They found it.

655
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,635
Are there any side
effects to the treatment?

656
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,745
Some nausea, dizziness,
and as the tumor shrinks,

657
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,791
there will be
behavioral changes.

658
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,616
Like what?

659
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,058
Well...

660
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:40,397
The tumor interferes with
certain natural systems.

661
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:47,064
It lowers libido and
causes erectile dysfunction.

662
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:54,676
You mean the treatment will
make me want to have sex?

663
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:58,848
What if I don't
want the treatment?

664
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,578
I would strongly advise...

665
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,348
Look, you have a
brain tumor, okay?

666
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:03,531
You have to have the treatment.

667
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,956
Okay, look, I know
who I am, okay?

668
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,117
And I'm not one of them.

669
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,957
Hey, look, we'll adjust.

670
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:13,260
Okay? We can go
through this together.

671
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,699
You mean have sex? I
can't make you do that.

672
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,501
Maybe it won't be so bad.

673
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,005
It'll be terrible.

674
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,504
It's actually pretty fun.

675
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,281
From what I remember.

676
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,778
But you said that... I know.

677
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:37,018
I know. I wanted to
spend my life with you

678
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,786
and I knew that meant
making certain sacrifices.

679
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,158
But a girl has needs.

680
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,463
You dropped in the
<i>U.S. News</i> rankings.

681
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:55,701
With respect, Mr. Laffont, that's
only because we temporarily

682
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,365
shut down our
diagnostics department.

683
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,738
It's up and running again.

684
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,489
I'm actually concerned it might be
because of the change in management.

685
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:05,041
If you want my money, I'll
need to see a five year plan.

686
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,413
Am I boring you?

687
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:18,028
No, I just, those flowers
are from last week.

688
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,088
They should be dead by now.

689
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,257
Excuse me?

690
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,068
Sorry, I have to go.

691
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:39,751
It's Reye's Syndrome.

692
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,514
Patient had a sore throat a few
weeks ago before he was admitted.

693
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,852
Reye's in adults is a reach.

694
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,050
Not if he took aspirin.

695
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:48,286
Aspirin in adults is a reach.

696
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:50,521
Especially in a house with
locked medicine cabinets.

697
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:51,927
It wasn't in the
medicine cabinet.

698
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,465
The wife used to
run a floral company,

699
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,932
still does a few
orders from home.

700
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,900
She uses crushed
aspirin in the water

701
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,801
to make the flowers last longer.

702
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,768
So the husband
has a sore throat,

703
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,435
takes an aspirin
without her knowing,

704
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,454
realizes he's got a sore
throat, takes an aspirin,

705
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,789
realizes he's got
a sore throat...

706
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,282
You can stop me
whenever you like.

707
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,442
Have Chase start
him on steroids.

708
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,215
I already did.

709
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:18,690
Then why are you telling me?

710
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,782
Because I wanted
you to hear it from me.

711
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,490
There she is.

712
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:58,196
Here I am.

713
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,699
Your eye. What happened?

714
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,704
It's nothing I can't handle.

715
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:25,014
MRI confirmed macroprolactinoma.

716
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,185
He's doing the treatment.

717
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,385
And the wife?

718
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:40,332
Come on. We saved a man's life,

719
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:44,240
course-corrected two people's
wildly screwed up worldviews.

720
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,379
Not bad for a day's work.

721
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,943
I think they were happy,
even if it was based on lies.

722
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,851
Most happiness is.

723
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,515
Better to have <i>shtupped</i> and lost

724
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,458
than never to have
<i>shtupped</i> at all.

725
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,054
We can't smoke in here.

726
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,998
We also can't summon people
into the clinic based on a lie

727
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:16,405
motivated by a petty
bet, and yet it happens.

728
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,635
It's an imperfect world.

729
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,417
Well?

730
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,683
Disgustingly satisfying.

731
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,025
He said it was okay.

732
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,160
Is one of you Dr. House?

733
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,870
You've seen <i>Spartacus,</i> right?

734
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,931
I got an order here to deactivate
and remove his ankle monitor.

735
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:04,950
<i>Robbie?</i>

736
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,354
Hey, sis.

737
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,187
<i>It's been years.</i>

738
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,524
I know.

739
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,893
I thought of you
on Mom's birthday.

740
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,893
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

741
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,438
Yeah, yeah. Fine. I just...

742
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,804
wanted to see how you were.

743
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,071
<i>I'm fine.</i>

744
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,656
Bikes go faster
without training wheels.

745
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,298
Now get out, I have work to do.

746
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:00,010
Whoops.
