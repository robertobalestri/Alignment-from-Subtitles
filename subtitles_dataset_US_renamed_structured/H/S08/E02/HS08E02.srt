1
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:07,998
Get up, House.

2
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,134
Must be some mistake.

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:13,579
I specifically requested my
wake-up startle three hours from now.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,650
Some VIP visitor. Dean of
Medicine from your old hospital.

5
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,486
I've had dreams about this.

6
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,183
I'm gonna assume
this is another one.

7
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,361
Get up.

8
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:31,058
I can refuse to see
any visitor I want.

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,926
Tell the Dean that I
don't want to see her.

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,497
He said you'd say that.

11
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,534
"He"?

12
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,633
What's the hiring policy
over there? All ass-based?

13
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,364
I can get you out of here.

14
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,238
Not unless that
file has a file in it.

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,039
Judge's order for your
immediate release.

16
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:26,783
I had eight months added to
my sentence two months ago.

17
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,082
The math is pretty basic.

18
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,212
We have a crisis.

19
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,192
Which is good news for you.

20
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,351
You're out tonight
on conditional parole,

21
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,263
the condition being that you're
employed by me at PPTH.

22
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,192
No, thanks.

23
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,179
You think it's a
good idea for me

24
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,138
to go right back to my old life?

25
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,399
For either of us?

26
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:51,370
Your patient is
two lungs in a box.

27
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,608
It only has 12 hours left.

28
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:59,647
No pulse, no body, no
ability to answer questions.

29
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,082
It's your perfect patient.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,928
I did pay for the room
for the whole week, but...

31
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,110
<i>Donor's an 18-year-old
college kid back from Hofstra.</i>

32
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,817
<i>Goes to a homecoming
party with his buddies,</i>

33
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,140
<i>hops on his motorcycle,
ends up an organ donor.</i>

34
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,506
<i>Asystole in the ER.</i>

35
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,079
<i>No pulse. No blood circulating.</i>

36
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,012
<i>His heart, liver,
kidneys were all toast.</i>

37
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,626
<i>Surgeons had the
recipient on the table</i>

38
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,620
<i>when they realized the lungs
had increased airway resistance.</i>

39
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,178
<i>The team closed her up, put
the lungs in suspended animation.</i>

40
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,321
<i>Buys 24 hours to fix it,
12 of which have passed.</i>

41
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,427
<i>And we still have
no clue what's wrong.</i>

42
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,362
Nice painting.

43
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,970
Blues and greens. Calming
with a hint of nurturing.

44
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,140
Totally offsets the stench
of suffering and death.

45
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,611
Where's my patient?
We need to not talk.

46
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,345
ICU isolation room.

47
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,862
The transplant team
will meet you there

48
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,326
with updates from
the past two hours.

49
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,955
Great. Take this.

50
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,187
How about you
drop it in your office?

51
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,488
I completely understand
and almost respect your desire

52
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,431
to appear to be Dean of Medicine

53
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,298
given that your title
is Dean of Medicine.

54
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,237
On the other hand, seriously?

55
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,410
Get this straight.

56
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,505
You break the law,
you go back to jail.

57
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,413
Scam extra
Vicodin, back to jail.

58
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,813
Flout my authority, make the
hospital look bad, back to jail.

59
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,724
I own you.

60
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,251
Yes, master.

61
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,392
See, that would be an example.

62
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,160
When did Cuddy leave?

63
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,503
She gave her notice the
day after your incident.

64
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:01,733
Took a job...

65
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,504
Don't need the details.

66
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,540
Ortho needed more space.

67
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,083
You're this way.

68
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,225
Where's my stuff?

69
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,784
No idea.

70
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,263
What about my team?

71
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,388
Pathetic.

72
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,728
The first thing you said to me

73
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,598
was you don't want
your old environment,

74
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,331
the fourth thing you said was,
"Where's my old environment?"

75
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:35,034
It's been a year. Taub,
Chase, Thirteen all moved on.

76
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,705
The world does that sometimes.

77
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,370
No, it doesn't.

78
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,404
Here's your new office.

79
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,245
And there's your new team.

80
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,215
Hi.

81
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,932
I'm not interested in another
department's sloppy seconds.

82
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,091
I'm not sloppy seconds...

83
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,259
It's 3:00 a.m.

84
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,226
If Foreman had called
you in from home,

85
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,068
you wouldn't have pressed
clothes, coiffed hair and make-up.

86
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,750
Which means you were
already here in the hospital.

87
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,039
Yes, I was on-call
for Neurology.

88
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,377
If that were true, you'd be working
right now and unavailable to help.

89
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,825
Which means that
you're hanging out

90
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,442
in the hospital
pretending to work.

91
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,281
Which means you're
not just a reject,

92
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:23,585
you're a cowardly reject who's trying
to hide her rejectedness from someone.

93
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,920
I am not a reject.

94
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,986
Then go back to Neurology.

95
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,562
I can't.

96
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,091
I punched my attending.

97
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:59,316
ARDS secondary to trauma
is our leading hypothesis.

98
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,592
FI02 is 93%...

99
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,754
Prison!

100
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,862
Sorry, I thought I heard
everyone else think that.

101
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,304
I was in prison, see?

102
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,701
It was a long time ago,
but still, you're curious.

103
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,036
Never was raped.

104
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,137
Not raped-raped.

105
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,009
Well, raped-raped but
not raped-raped-raped.

106
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:26,517
Well, now that we've got
that completely behind us...

107
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,821
I'm sorry. Dr. House,
welcome back...

108
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,557
Is there cake?

109
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,496
Any alveolar exudate?

110
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,792
No. Lungs are dry.

111
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,026
Well, it's not ARDS.
It's the autumn.

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,101
It's tick-borne disease season.

113
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,364
Ehrlichiosis
causing bronchiolitis.

114
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,774
You'll appreciate that I
left the "idiots" subtextual.

115
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,902
Blood smear was
clear, and we idiots

116
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,072
treated with
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

117
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,039
Cocaine. Tox screen was clean.

118
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,175
Dead men don't pee.

119
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,444
Tox screen tests for
metabolites in the urine.

120
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,348
Coke never got past the lungs.

121
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,617
Also explains the
motorcycle crash.

122
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,384
Idiots.

123
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,119
Let's get the
lungs on treatment.

124
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,527
Great idea, unless you're wrong.

125
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,860
And by you, I mean me.

126
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,299
Then this treatment will
burn holes in the lungs.

127
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,129
I'd call you idiots,
but at this point,

128
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,614
I'm starting to doubt whether you
understand what I mean by the word.

129
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,608
Kato, get Black Beauty
and meet me out front.

130
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,374
We're gonna find
the dead kid's stash.

131
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,255
Since an 18-year-old
with organ donor

132
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,088
on his license is
not a cancer patient,

133
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,560
I'm figuring the recipient
is a lifetime member

134
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,153
of the Wilson Cares
Too Much Club.

135
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,731
Excellent deduction.

136
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,832
You're the reason I'm
out of the big house.

137
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,779
Doesn't quite make up
for never visiting, but...

138
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,396
Springing you was
Foreman's idea.

139
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,906
I wasn't convinced until
Simpson failed three times.

140
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,840
Amounts to the same
thing, you wanted me back.

141
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,309
See, I knew you'd
over-interpret it.

142
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,778
Strong, emotional reaction.

143
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,181
I guess that's what lifetime
membership gets you.

144
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,542
How's your wrist?

145
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,349
Healed, thank you.

146
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:09,899
I was wrong.

147
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,858
I went to prison,
I paid the price.

148
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,586
You're a changed man.

149
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,186
I said I was wrong, I didn't
say I changed. I haven't.

150
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,440
Neither have you.
Which is why...

151
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,584
Analyze it however you like.

152
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,628
We're not friends anymore.

153
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,299
What can I do?

154
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,503
My chest...

155
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,779
Angina's back.

156
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,950
Upping the nitro. Should
knock it back down.

157
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,212
Sis and I were talking,
trying to figure out

158
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,380
how many hospital
sleepovers we've had.

159
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,590
Definitely started with the
Great Mastectomy of 2001.

160
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,989
God, I miss my boobs.

161
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,922
They were spectacular.

162
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,998
Is there a chance of
locating another donor?

163
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:58,863
It's unlikely,

164
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,698
especially since with the extent

165
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,414
of the emphysema,
she needs a double lung.

166
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,307
How you doing?

167
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,277
Better already.

168
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,394
It's a good thing that worked

169
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,182
or I was gonna make
you bring me a bottle.

170
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,347
Lighten up, Sis.

171
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,986
Least you could do is
laugh at a dying lady's jokes.

172
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,387
Your drinking wasn't funny
then, okay? And it's not funny now.

173
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,625
Because you're not dying.

174
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,061
The hospital brought in a
consultant to work on the lungs.

175
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,867
Do you know him? Is he good?

176
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,974
He is an excellent doctor.

177
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,707
We probably shouldn't be
turning up unannounced like this.

178
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,752
Their son just died.

179
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,980
Bright side, they're
probably up weeping.

180
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,993
Hey, we both assaulted our
bosses. It's like we're twins.

181
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,170
I'd really rather not discuss...

182
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,356
Okay, I'll go first.
My boss dumped me.

183
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,524
And yours, what,
called you his china doll?

184
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,694
Joked about what a crappy
deal you got for Manhattan?

185
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,238
Assumed that you
have a huge penis?

186
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,873
I have no idea
what flavor you are,

187
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,934
so I thought I'd just
cover the spread.

188
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,104
My mom's Filipino, Dad's Korean.

189
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,274
And my boss grabbed my behind.

190
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,010
Behind what?

191
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,116
Oh, yeah, your...
Grabbed your tushy.

192
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,517
So now you're
pretending to be on-call

193
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,719
so that your overly
protective boyfriend

194
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,126
won't find out you got groped.

195
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,793
I don't have a boyfriend.

196
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:34,957
It's my parents.

197
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,970
If they found out what I've
done, they'd be mortified.

198
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,135
Your parents know
your call schedule?

199
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,538
I live with them.

200
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,575
Right.

201
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,777
No issues there.

202
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:51,541
I told you, my son
didn't do cocaine.

203
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,483
Druggies are not
known for their honesty.

204
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:55,980
Trust me on this one.

205
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:03,925
Mr. Weathers, I'm sure you're
right, but we need to be thorough.

206
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,831
Did your son ever
smoke marijuana?

207
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,228
He was an athlete, took real
good care of himself... Hey.

208
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,338
Take it easy. Steve
loved all that...

209
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,930
Sorry, but we're on a clock.

210
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,961
I think he's about
to throw us out.

211
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,251
Nope.

212
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,649
His son is dead.

213
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,588
The only way that
has any meaning

214
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,093
is if we fix the lungs
and transplant them.

215
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,671
It doesn't matter how
much we piss him off

216
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,027
as long as we find something.

217
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,532
So go back there, piss
him off and find something.

218
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:48,299
Do you know any of the kids
at the party with your son?

219
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,020
A bunch of his
high school buddies,

220
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,979
they'd gotten really into poker,

221
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:56,316
decided to have an all-night game
in Brandon Broome's basement.

222
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,678
Hey...

223
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,055
I understand we're in a hurry,

224
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,988
and that he's probably
not gonna throw us out,

225
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,126
but maybe he should.

226
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,629
Your son isn't wearing
glasses in any of these pictures.

227
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,462
He just got them a
couple weeks ago.

228
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,873
Because he was having headaches?

229
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,009
Answer the question
before answering the door.

230
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,246
Yeah, he was.

231
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:31,351
You're right, he was
not doing cocaine.

232
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,513
He had a brain tumor.

233
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,819
Don't bother, it's for me.

234
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,095
Turns out they
monitor these monitors.

235
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,347
Thank you, Officer.

236
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,655
I thought the bracelet
was decorative.

237
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,122
My aunt had one just like it.

238
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,249
Wait a minute.

239
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,838
You're allowed to be at the
hospital, you're allowed to go home.

240
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:16,955
That was made clear.

241
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:20,124
The dead kid's house was
on the way to my apartment,

242
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,792
assuming I got lost twice.

243
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,130
Those consultants in my office

244
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,727
are only costing the
hospital 100 bucks

245
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,084
every minute I
keep them waiting.

246
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,916
Why didn't you just tell
me what you were doing?

247
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,535
I knew you were very busy
being vaguely important.

248
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,920
I might have cleared
it with the cops.

249
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,970
Yeah, it's the word
"might" that bumps me.

250
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,276
I'll run it by you next time.

251
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,415
House.

252
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,290
Getting you out of jail was not a
popular decision with the board.

253
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,618
I need you to solve this,

254
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:50,458
and I need you to do it without
making me look like I can't control you.

255
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,464
For both our sakes.

256
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,305
Disciplinary hearing
should be fun,

257
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,003
and the subsequent lingering
black mark on your record.

258
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,672
I'm not worried.

259
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,086
We have to wheel
this out to the MRI.

260
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,688
We should probably
leave the body in the bag.

261
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,590
There's a mass in the arm.

262
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,857
Analyzing part of this tumor is
gonna be quicker than a scan.

263
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,496
So, where's the next job?

264
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,330
You worry about what
people think of you,

265
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:37,604
thus the carefully maintained
hair, clothes and parental secrets.

266
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,941
The only way that you're
not worried about this hearing

267
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,457
is if you don't think
there's gonna be one.

268
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,451
The only way that happens is
you leave Princeton-Plainsboro.

269
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:51,154
I had a video interview with
Chicago yesterday. It went well.

270
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,895
My money's on rhabdomyosarcoma.

271
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,166
Chicago has a great program.

272
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,860
And you're a dumbass.

273
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,562
Running away from home
is a time-honored tradition.

274
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,730
But you're not doing
it to flee your parents,

275
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,037
you're doing it to protect them.

276
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:13,341
That's an insult to everything
teen prostitutes have worked for.

277
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,474
Time to grow up and come clean.

278
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,818
You're right. I should
just drive my car

279
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,718
into their living
room and tell them.

280
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,996
Didn't it turn out that he'd
stolen the hot dog cart?

281
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,089
No, borrowed. Bobby was
very insistent on that point.

282
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,667
Seems like someone's
feeling better.

283
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,268
No more chest pain.

284
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,114
I haven't heard the name
Bobby in a long time.

285
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,178
How's he doing these days?

286
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,730
I don't know,
we're not in touch.

287
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,945
And don't even pretend like you're
not relieved, you never liked him.

288
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:50,176
Bobby is an incredibly fun, great
guy, just not a great influence.

289
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,445
I would have gone
with colossal drunk.

290
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,851
I was gonna leave that
implied, but yes, colossal drunk.

291
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:59,086
What? It's good for a
couple to share a hobby.

292
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:04,862
Your catheter bag is empty,
despite taking in 200 cc's of fluids.

293
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,133
I'm gonna have to
dial back on the nitro.

294
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,565
Won't her chest pain come back?

295
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,125
We don't have any choice.

296
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,929
The nitro is dropping the
blood flow to your kidneys.

297
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,465
They're shutting down.

298
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,556
This is so our song.

299
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,654
My patient is
running out of time.

300
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,093
Not worried.

301
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,761
My team is confirming
the diagnosis as we speak.

302
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,999
I want to be understanding.
It's your first day back...

303
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,441
See?

304
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,142
I smell empathy.

305
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,605
Just remember
all the good times.

306
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,982
Like when I gave
you that necklace

307
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,848
that you just
dumped in the ocean.

308
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,147
What were you thinking?

309
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,119
House, I haven't
forgotten our friendship.

310
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,026
For every good memory,
there's a slew of bad ones.

311
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:11,687
Come in. Come in.

312
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,601
Paraneoplastic syndrome is out.

313
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,160
The lung donor
didn't have cancer.

314
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,271
You tell that to the tumor
that I found in his arm?

315
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,606
That mass wasn't a tumour.
It was coagulated plasma.

316
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:26,510
ER pumped him full of
it, IV leaked into his arm.

317
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,105
I even did a complete
MRI. No cancer anywhere.

318
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,976
We've got nothing.

319
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,188
Just 'cause it wasn't a tumor

320
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,453
doesn't mean it didn't
mess with the lungs.

321
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,324
They're reacting to
something in the plasma.

322
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:47,296
But every unit of plasma can
have up to 25 contributing donors.

323
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,665
We'd need to track
down all of them.

324
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,967
Still. Not as bad
as 1,000 people

325
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,067
going down in a
gigantic boat, right?

326
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,809
My heart will go on.

327
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,010
No. You can't
leave the hospital.

328
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:14,323
Twenty-five donors contributed to
the plasma that the lung donor got.

329
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,921
My "team" cannot track down
and interview them all in six hours.

330
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,498
I vouch for you to the cops,

331
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:23,002
you take some parole-violating
detour celebrating your freedom,

332
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,403
justified, of course, by some absurd
theory connecting it to the case.

333
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:31,034
You asked me to ask you. Was
that just so you'd enjoy saying no?

334
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,711
I don't trust you,
House. I can't.

335
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,372
Actually, you have to.

336
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,940
Not absolutely. Not outside
the walls of this hospital.

337
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,747
Fine, then give me a team I don't
have to put in quotation marks.

338
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,287
Use the people
already on the case.

339
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,050
Get me Chase, Taub, Thirteen.

340
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,500
We don't have the
money to pay them.

341
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:49,222
Oh. Yeah, it went to interior
designers, I understand.

342
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,457
You only have Park because
she's on Neurology's tab.

343
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,089
You are making minimum wage.

344
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,193
I am?

345
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,933
Get out of my office, please.

346
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,747
What you got?

347
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,655
Number three went to a baseball
game the day before he donated.

348
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,226
Boredom is not transmissible.

349
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,160
He ate a bag of peanuts.
And peanut proteins would be.

350
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,754
If our donor had an allergy,
could explain the lungs.

351
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,960
Nice.

352
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,327
What? HOUSE: <i>Nothing.</i>

353
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:31,995
Don't start that.

354
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,097
Start what? I'm enjoying
our conversation.

355
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:36,967
The repartee.

356
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,170
There was no repartee.

357
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,643
That was repartee.

358
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,807
I'm not doing this for you.

359
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,281
I'm doing it to help my patient.

360
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,249
It's just good to
hear your voice.

361
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,916
Goodbye.

362
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,694
That's my whiteboard.

363
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:00,856
I need it.

364
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,329
And he really doesn't care
how the cast comes off.

365
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,201
Dr. Foreman warned us
that you'd try something.

366
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,540
Told me to call him if you did.

367
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,179
I'd like to do that.

368
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,280
I'll take this outside.

369
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,964
Yeah.

370
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,908
<i>Donor six traveled to
Thailand, around Korat.</i>

371
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,205
Region was endemic
with dengue fever.

372
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,808
Good.

373
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,700
Yeah. CHI: <i>Alcohol.</i>

374
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,373
You'd have to be pretty drunk
for it to affect a pool of plasma.

375
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:19,791
These guys have
got that covered.

376
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:23,377
<i>Acute ETOH ingestion
could have... Hey!</i>

377
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,110
Paint around them.
They're not hurting anyone.

378
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,243
Who's painting?

379
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,847
<i>The crew is just starting. The paint
fumes didn't cause contamination.</i>

380
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:35,452
But maybe the old paint did.

381
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,052
They scraped off the underpass,

382
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,597
probably because it contains...

383
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,761
Lead. <i>Lead.</i>

384
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,697
Chest pain back?

385
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,205
It's worse this time.

386
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,387
Is there any way
to take the edge off?

387
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,574
We're still working on the
lungs. We should know soon.

388
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,639
Soon is good.

389
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,823
How's the chelation going?

390
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,123
Reverend Moon started
it about 20 minutes ago.

391
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:14,055
You missed lunch tracking
down the plasma donors.

392
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,658
Got you a Reuben
from the cafeteria.

393
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,230
Thanks.

394
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,240
Lead exposure's
a nice diagnosis.

395
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:22,734
I hope it pays off.

396
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,436
It will.

397
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,955
I appreciate your confidence,
but she's not really...

398
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,140
Oh, no, she could die.

399
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,912
But technically, it
would still pay off.

400
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:35,113
Even if your patient dies,
someone will get the lungs.

401
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,421
You really haven't changed.

402
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,191
But I've given up red meat.

403
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,964
What round of chelation is this?

404
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,531
Fourth.

405
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,972
Are you checking up
on me? Or on House?

406
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,042
On this case.

407
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,014
Unique situation.

408
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,147
Oxygenating?

409
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,882
98%. Airway resistance down.

410
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,120
Great.

411
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,589
Is House okay?

412
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:19,723
I have no idea.

413
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:34,840
Dad, what are you doing here?

414
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,847
Got your text. I brought you
some of your mother's gomguk.

415
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,011
What text?

416
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,612
The one asking me to
bring you some dinner.

417
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,254
I went by Neurology. The
secretary said you were on leave.

418
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,794
I'm consulting on this case.

419
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,428
Unique situation.

420
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,297
Looks very complicated.

421
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,028
You can help with that?

422
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,968
Lungs are crashing.
I have to go.

423
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,734
Bye.

424
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,107
Increasing to 100% FIO2.

425
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,739
Saline flow is down to 10 cc.

426
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,045
Blockage? Clot in the line?

427
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,696
Chelation is making it worse, which
means we were wrong about lead.

428
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,780
Hold the analysis and
help me save this thing.

429
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,552
Saline's flushing forward,
but getting no return.

430
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,655
One-way valve. Vasospasm.

431
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,923
If you're right, calcium channel
blocker should relax the artery.

432
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,126
The lungs have no nervous
system, will that still work?

433
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,564
We'll know soon.

434
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,764
Saline flow's rising.

435
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,240
Vasospasm's relaxing.

436
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:42,071
Left lung is pinking
up. Good job.

437
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,955
Right middle lobe isn't.

438
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,695
Nothing.

439
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,695
We killed part of the lung.

440
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,806
Page Dr. Pinto
stat to the cath lab.

441
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,858
We're going to the cath
lab? Are you thinking that...

442
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,350
What? Who?

443
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,653
One dead lobe
means four live ones,

444
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,450
means enough to transplant,

445
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,321
with a side order of dead
tissue that we can test.

446
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:29,656
Makes sense, unlike
you stealing my phone.

447
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,392
You have unlimited texting.

448
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,597
Until your parents
know, you'll never see

449
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,190
that punch for
what it really was,

450
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,733
your February 4th.

451
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,370
Sri Lankan Independence Day.

452
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,168
I told you I'm
Korean and Filipino.

453
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,643
And I told you I wasn't
listening. By my actions.

454
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,881
Violence isn't an appropriate
way to handle conflict.

455
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,244
It was a moment of weakness.

456
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,875
You've barked at me, picked
a fight with a painting crew.

457
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,682
Maybe it's time to recognize
it's not a character flaw.

458
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,484
Maybe it's your character.

459
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,047
Pinto.

460
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,387
House.

461
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,258
Embrace your inner bitch.

462
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:14,195
So, why did chelation
make the lungs worse?

463
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,841
We got about five
minutes till Pinto gets back.

464
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,275
Give me a hand with this. No.

465
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,902
I tracked down
another bag of plasma

466
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,459
from the batch they
used on the donor,

467
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,747
negative for all our
other exposures.

468
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,885
Sarcoidosis could be
inflamed by the treatment.

469
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,848
I'm a cripple, in
need of assistance.

470
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,424
Transplant team
ran an ACE, negative.

471
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,362
It's mine. And it's your job.

472
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,061
My job is to assist
you in curing the lungs.

473
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,797
This chair will help me do that.

474
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,541
What if the scrapings from the
bridge contained other heavy metals,

475
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,738
like beryllium, or asbestos?

476
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:57,214
Chelation for lead wouldn't
have made them worse.

477
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,788
But

478
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,155
maybe the problem isn't a
heavy metal from outside.

479
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,622
It's inside.

480
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:14,325
But it's not leaving the body
like it's supposed to, it's stuck.

481
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,262
Iron. Donor had hemosiderosis.

482
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,636
His body wasn't
disposing of iron,

483
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,641
massive amounts
choke up the lungs.

484
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,903
Then our chelation
would wreak havoc

485
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,287
because it picks
up too much stuff.

486
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,303
Go stain the dead
lung tissue for iron.

487
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:35,981
I'm sorry, young lady, I simply
will not help you steal this chair.

488
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,015
Pinto. House.

489
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,830
Hi.

490
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,497
She can barely catch her breath.

491
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,368
Lungs ready yet?

492
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,374
We had a small setback.
We're testing for iron overload.

493
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,009
I thought it was lead.

494
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:01,012
This is not an exact process.

495
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,615
Your small airways
are collapsing.

496
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,346
You're not getting
enough oxygen.

497
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:12,690
I'd like to try forcing an
oxygen-rich slurry into your lungs.

498
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,052
It should open up the airways

499
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,118
and buy you some time
until the lungs are ready.

500
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,199
Fluid in my lungs?

501
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,470
Sounds like drowning.

502
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:28,800
It is.

503
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,714
Gonna hurt, isn't it?

504
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,848
Yes. A fair amount.

505
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,584
No.

506
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,651
I'm done.

507
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,528
House, the nurses
saw you come in.

508
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,937
Enter.

509
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,432
It's a bathroom.

510
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,532
Ah!

511
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,408
Explains the hole in this chair.

512
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,381
God, I've missed doors.

513
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,853
And air freshener.

514
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:23,958
Now go away. I'm waiting
for some test results.

515
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,429
My patient signed a
DNR, she's giving up.

516
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,228
Looks like someone else
will be getting the lungs.

517
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:32,736
Making this yet another interaction
with you in which I get nothing.

518
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,069
It's not my fault you
can't handle your patient.

519
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,770
She said she's done.

520
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,943
I spent half an hour trying to change
her mind, but she'd made her decision.

521
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,709
I accepted that.
It's called respect.

522
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,439
What's after respect?

523
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:47,876
You find another angle,
you hold her hands,

524
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,583
get the sister to beg, stick
your fingers in your ears

525
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,216
and pretend you can't hear her.

526
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,053
Do whatever it takes.

527
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:59,164
Oh. Whatever it takes? Thanks,
House, I hadn't thought of that.

528
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,970
What are you testing
for? Hemosiderosis.

529
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,877
I'm staining for excess iron.

530
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,177
Promising.

531
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:24,013
When your dad showed up
unexpectedly, House have a hand in that?

532
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,581
I'm guessing he does
things like that a lot.

533
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,427
His version of a compliment.

534
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,657
I spoke to the head of
Neurology in Chicago.

535
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:36,013
I gave you a good
recommendation.

536
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,759
Did you mention what happened?

537
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,262
Lawyers say I'm not allowed to.

538
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,274
Works out well for everyone.

539
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,973
Why exactly is
that good for you?

540
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,105
Excuse me?

541
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,379
I'm a talented physician,
top 2% of my class.

542
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,747
I'm an asset to this hospital,

543
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,481
an asset you're about
to lose to Chicago.

544
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:58,718
You applied for the job, you asked
me to call and recommend you...

545
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:01,316
Andrews is the one that
should leave, he's the supervisor.

546
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,859
He touched me first.

547
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,055
I can't discuss any of
that, not before the hearing.

548
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:10,159
But if you're having doubts about
Chicago, I can call them back.

549
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,535
No. Thank you.

550
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,713
Dr. Foreman, would
you look at this?

551
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,874
Iron? No.

552
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,850
White blood cells.

553
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,985
Classic presentation
of an infection.

554
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,491
How the hell did we miss that?

555
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,928
Biopsy revealed white
blood cell infiltrates.

556
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,229
Infection was right after all.

557
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,698
Fresh fruit in prison
is usually chicken.

558
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,853
Why aren't you more alarmed?
We're running out of time.

559
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,937
She's dying!

560
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,607
Were you able to figure out what
was wrong while I was screaming?

561
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,852
Infection was the first thing that
the transplant team treated for.

562
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,584
Which would've worked if the
bacteria had been out in the open.

563
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,556
If they're hiding
inside the lung's cells...

564
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,419
I'm thinking Brucella.

565
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,021
To wipe that out,
you need special ops.

566
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,099
An intact immune system.

567
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,567
But that's what
white blood cells are.

568
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:23,698
They're part of the immune
defense force, like the infantry.

569
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,739
Those lungs need the
Air Force, the Marines,

570
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,282
antibodies raining
down from above.

571
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,415
Antibiotics and IVIG.

572
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,456
Did you use metaphors
for your old team?

573
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,426
Or do you just think
I'm particularly stupid?

574
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,624
No. They were stupid, too.

575
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,504
What are you doing here?

576
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,468
I'm here for Vanessa.

577
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,173
Now is not the time, Bobby.

578
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,076
She asked me to
come. Right, Doc?

579
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,353
Actually, it was my idea.

580
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,999
What? What are you thinking?
She doesn't want to see him.

581
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,855
When Vanessa was
ready to quit chemo,

582
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,837
Bobby's the one who got
her to do one more round.

583
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,626
Yeah. And then he got her drunk.

584
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,602
At least tell me you
haven't been drinking today.

585
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,599
I should go. Yeah.

586
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,200
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.

587
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,015
Hey, beautiful.

588
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,277
Hi.

589
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:05,307
Case is under
control. It's me time.

590
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,756
Vanessa's gonna
do the lung slurry.

591
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,591
You were right to push me.
I needed that. Thank you.

592
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,393
So we're good?

593
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,533
It was good advice. I just
came here to say thank you.

594
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,575
I like you.

595
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,103
I have fun with you.

596
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:47,249
And if you can honestly say that you
don't like me, you don't have fun with me,

597
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:48,411
I can accept that.

598
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,048
But just do whatever you
have to do to get over this.

599
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,782
Punch me in the face,
kick me in the nuts.

600
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,793
Either/or. Both seems excessive.

601
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,270
The thing is, House,

602
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,071
I don't like you.

603
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:29,086
When did the
discoloration start?

604
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,386
A few minutes after
I started the IVIG.

605
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,330
Means we're wrong
about infection.

606
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,094
And by we, you mean you.
You screwed up the lungs.

607
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,997
Wrong about
auto-immune, about cancer,

608
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:45,066
heavy metals, genetic issues...

609
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,469
Increase PEEP.

610
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,568
Already maxed out.

611
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,190
We're close to the
point of no return.

612
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:52,343
The lungs will never
be viable for transplant.

613
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,418
I need...

614
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,482
I need ideas.

615
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,658
LgA nephropathy?

616
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,460
It's already ruled out.

617
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,327
Lupus? No.

618
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,790
Maybe we're just out of time.

619
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,503
We're out of time when we're out
of time. When they die or she dies.

620
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,204
Keep them stable
as long as you can.

621
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,679
I need to think.

622
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,744
One, two, three!

623
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:29,974
Make a wish, make a wish!

624
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,427
The lungs are smoker.

625
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,909
You of all people
should know better.

626
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,269
But the kid never smoked.

627
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:58,473
He played poker. Who
plays poker without cigars?

628
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,905
Even if he didn't
light up himself.

629
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,578
<i>It was a rainy night. The
windows were closed.</i>

630
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,116
<i>All parents think
their kids are special.</i>

631
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,465
<i>These ones were right.</i>

632
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,250
<i>At least his white
blood cells were special.</i>

633
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,485
<i>They had an on switch for
reacting to smoke, but no off.</i>

634
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,857
<i>If he inhaled small amounts of
smoke, he had small problems.</i>

635
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:17,985
<i>No one even noticed.</i>

636
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:21,464
<i>Big amounts of smoke
is enough to trash a lung.</i>

637
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:25,334
As soon as he breathed in all that
cigar smoke, he was a dead man.

638
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:30,500
The motorcycle accident was
an unnecessary dramatic flourish.

639
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,042
Eosinophilic Pneumonitis.

640
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,170
But the steroids would
have treated for that.

641
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,971
I was right.

642
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,316
Not about anything medical,
but my metaphors were perfect.

643
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:43,647
We need to hit it harder.

644
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:46,890
We need to carpet
bomb, blitzkrieg.

645
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,221
We need the nuclear option...

646
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,625
At some point, you're gonna
say we need to radiate, right?

647
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,321
See? The metaphors work.

648
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,127
But that'll destroy
the good lung, too.

649
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,859
Better to go with a strong
cocktail of immunosuppressants.

650
00:38:56,968 --> 00:39:00,200
Won't be fast enough.
Wilson needs these lungs.

651
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:30,759
It's working.

652
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,731
He did it.

653
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,410
I'm not going to Chicago.

654
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,247
If you stay, we'll have
to have a hearing.

655
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,185
I know.

656
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,807
Dad. Do you have a minute?

657
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,878
Thoracic cavity clear.
Ready for the donor lungs.

658
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,902
Thank God you called him.

659
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,303
Wonder what happens now.

660
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,146
She can handle it.

661
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:08,528
House.

662
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:15,535
Got something for you.

663
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,278
Found your stuff in storage.

664
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,391
This is all you get. Ortho
still has the outer office.

665
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,993
Well, that sucks.

666
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:41,897
Where are Chase, Taub
and Thirteen gonna sit?

667
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,802
You're welcome, House.

668
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,361
Dinner later? I'll
pick something up.

669
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,574
I heard about a good
new vegetarian place.

670
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:27,041
Screw that. I want a steak.

671
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,346
I'll meet you at
your place at 8:00.
