1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:05,137
Given goodish behavior

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,735
and eight of 12
months’ time served,

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,175
we have the discretion to
grant parole Friday the 10th,

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,075
five days from now.

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,673
Are you sorry
about what you did?

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,811
Yes.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,651
Yes?

8
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,189
That's the correct
answer, isn't it?

9
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,142
Are you trying to annoy us?

10
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,531
No. I'm just trying to give you the
answers you need to cover your asses,

11
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,314
fill out your forms
and let me out of here.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,804
We need you to show us remorse.

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,071
Is that how our system works?

14
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,705
Release the best actors?

15
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,219
I shudder to think what
that world would be like.

16
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,678
You drove your car into
your ex-girlfriend's house

17
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,510
and then fled the
country for three months.

18
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:51,207
I knew that her daughter was
at grandma's, like every Friday.

19
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,583
And I saw everyone else
move into the living room...

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,152
They could have moved back.

21
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,567
Which I would have noticed since
I was driving right towards them.

22
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,889
Shut up.

23
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,154
We got an order to
reduce overcrowding.

24
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,563
But let me be clear.

25
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,155
You mouth off to one guard,

26
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,827
we catch you with a single
cafeteria tray in your cell,

27
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,427
you break any rules I
don't even remember,

28
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,006
you can park your ass
here for four more months.

29
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,572
So forget being sorry. Can you
stay out of trouble for five days?

30
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,674
Yes.

31
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,787
Gather up for meds.

32
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:11,923
Asofa.

33
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,639
Yeah.

34
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,144
Why you keep helping him out?

35
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,316
Yeah. Why would
I wanna make sure

36
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:33,479
that my homicidal cell mate is
taking the right anti-psychotics?

37
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,419
House.

38
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,202
Mendelson.

39
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,273
He's on 80 milligrams
of propranolol, this is 40.

40
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,950
You're right. Sorry.

41
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,783
No worries. I like
my nurses naughty.

42
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,070
You know, I'm starting
to think, Mendelson,

43
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,689
you just really like
the taste of my spit.

44
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,133
Hey, House, check
out our new brand.

45
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,032
You've really got a thing
for swastikas, Mendelson.

46
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,044
Like an ironic thing?

47
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,743
It's a German name.

48
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,146
So is House, and I'm Jewish.

49
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,345
Nah. I'm a black, gay gypsy.

50
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,102
Knight to king's bishop three.

51
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,531
Queen to king's bishop seven.

52
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,103
Hey. You're House, right?

53
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:11,051
I got these weird pains in
my elbows and in my knees.

54
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,121
You know what's weirder is
how the clinic is a large room,

55
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,849
and you somehow
confused me with it.

56
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,455
Well, to be fair, I am large.

57
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,659
Hi, Rollo.

58
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,394
I realize this is probably
a rhetorical question.

59
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,303
Why are you stealing my stuff?

60
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,534
Hey, House. I heard
you're on short time.

61
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,140
You won't need this.

62
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,042
You heard about my parole.

63
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:43,083
But not about my violent reactions
when people steal my tuna.

64
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,010
Put it back. Nuh-uh.

65
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,415
Really?

66
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,784
You're stepping to a guy who
outweighs you by 50 pounds

67
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,728
and who is carrying a cane
which, while prison-approved,

68
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,097
will still cause some issues
if inserted into your colon.

69
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,536
Yeah, like you
losing your parole.

70
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,882
And you ain't gonna
rat me out neither,

71
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,138
'cause you don't wanna get a snitch
jacket and wind up shanked in the showers.

72
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,205
So you're just gonna
let me walk out of here.

73
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,661
You wanna get
back at these guys,

74
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,291
get out alive on Friday.

75
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,604
Okay? Now, go to work, House.

76
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,943
And that was
checkmate, right? Yep.

77
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,785
I heard you're on
that short time, House.

78
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,680
If you like tuna,
you're a little late.

79
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,650
I want your stereo
and your headphones.

80
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,523
It can wait till you
finish your work.

81
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,528
Drop it off in my cell.

82
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,055
99.9. I'm gonna start
him on ceftriaxone.

83
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,090
Good catch. I might
have missed that.

84
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,933
It's not gonorrhea.

85
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,171
I didn't say it was.

86
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,941
Not out loud. You're just figuring a
joint pain plus fever plus a low lifestyle

87
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,878
equals a ceftriaxone
prescription.

88
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,416
So you saying I got the clap?

89
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,452
I've only been in here one
week, my girlfriend's clean.

90
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,544
I ain't got a
girlfriend in here.

91
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,815
How do you know
about ceftriaxone?

92
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,257
House used to be a doctor.

93
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,457
Not going back.

94
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,397
And that look of shock
is elitist and offensive.

95
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,227
Doctors can be
degenerates. This is America.

96
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:18,804
There's subtle eyebrow loss.

97
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,839
It's lupus.

98
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,941
Well, there's no discoid
or malar rash on his face.

99
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,181
Which would be dispositive
if he was just a giant head.

100
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,455
He's got a point, but
I'll let you make the call.

101
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,755
No, there's no reason
to search for a bodily rash

102
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,261
since lupus doesn't
usually present that way.

103
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,695
"Usually"?

104
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,799
Well, I guess that's good
enough for prison work.

105
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,708
You don't write people up
for mouthing off, do you?

106
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,648
Not usually.

107
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,013
You don't want to
mess with Stomper.

108
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,718
He didn't get that name because
he's a fan of Santa's reindeer.

109
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,732
You think one of Santa's
reindeer was called Stomper?

110
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,994
You're missing my point.

111
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,045
I'm not gonna listen to a guy
who can't name the reindeer.

112
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,470
You saw what happened
in the yard with Diaz.

113
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,032
He barely said a couple of
words and set the boy off.

114
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,048
Oh, no.

115
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,844
I know that look.

116
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,508
Hey, Stomper. Where's my stereo?

117
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,544
I brought it to your
cell. It ain't there.

118
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,204
I was just getting to that part.

119
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,181
Rollo followed
me in and took it.

120
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,883
No way Rollo diss
me like that. Way.

121
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,356
I don't want to start any
rumors, but... But what?

122
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,027
He was all, "I can
take Stomper,"

123
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,620
and I was all, "How come?"

124
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,030
And he was all, ""Cause of how
Diaz kicked his ass last month."

125
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:31,268
In fact, he actually called
you "Stompee," with an "E."

126
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,363
I think his gist was...

127
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,101
You took my stereo?

128
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,235
Get out of my house,
Stomper, I ain't got no stereo.

129
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,406
What's this, then?

130
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,657
What? I didn't put that there!

131
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,459
You gonna lie to my face,
you lying son of a bitch!

132
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,475
What? I didn't do anything!

133
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,451
Next time I will
take your stereo!

134
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:48,783
That's enough!

135
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,155
Ow!

136
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,668
That was stupid.

137
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,473
Is that like a
synonym for "clever"?

138
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,780
Time they get out of solitary,

139
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:18,285
I'll be teaching physics
at the University of Fiji.

140
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,946
You have four days left.

141
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,458
How many more tricks do you got?

142
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,742
Don't.

143
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,519
Another pet?

144
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,813
This is gonna end badly. Again.

145
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,224
Remember, we talked about this?

146
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,592
Or at least I talked and
you stared at me eerily?

147
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,495
I think it was eerily. Eerily
felt like the best-case scenario.

148
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,711
Hey.

149
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,720
Take off your shirt
so I can find the rash.

150
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,390
Now you wanna help me?

151
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,282
'Cause that doctor
didn't believe you?

152
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:11,228
Well, if you could think of a better way
to prove that she's an idiot, I'm all ears.

153
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,526
Now, let's get this over with.

154
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,726
Yeah.

155
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,305
That's Nicole.

156
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,171
She lives at her mom's now,
on account that she lost her job.

157
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,610
Her mom hates me,

158
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:29,012
so she can't visit, she
ain't accepting my calls.

159
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,396
That's what happens
when you date a 12-year-old.

160
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,449
You don't believe me?

161
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:40,220
Belief implies a level of giving a
crap that I'm never gonna achieve.

162
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,726
Pull down your pants.

163
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,437
Hey.

164
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,980
It's not that I was trying to
prove you're an idiot or anything,

165
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,607
but lupus boy and I were
at the beach this morning,

166
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,482
and I noticed a
rash on his left thigh.

167
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,751
I checked you out.

168
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,819
You were a pretty big deal.

169
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,985
What went wrong?

170
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,091
Something very
obvious and very boring.

171
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,424
Drug related?

172
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,436
Forging prescriptions?

173
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,730
You're good.

174
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,502
Just like lupus boy will be,
when you start him on prednisone.

175
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,168
Name should have been a
giveaway. I'll send him up.

176
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,407
Why are you so sure I'm
gonna do what you say?

177
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,845
Because you're a smart, old
money trust-fund girl who took this job

178
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,855
because your liberal ideology
makes you want to make a difference,

179
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,926
but you're already getting
bored, and this is interesting.

180
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,859
Why would you say any of that?

181
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,691
Your shoes.

182
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,602
A different, expensive pair
every day, but never leather.

183
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,637
Which means you're
both rich and liberal.

184
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,697
Antique locket that's unpolished
gold, not some hipster thing.

185
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,639
It's a family heirloom,
which means old money.

186
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,338
Osler scarf, only on Fridays,

187
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,607
which means you did
your residency at Hopkins.

188
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,175
Which means you're smarter than
our interactions would so far indicate.

189
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,117
And your eyes.

190
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,599
The only time you haven't looked bored
in the three months since you've been here

191
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,525
is when we've been
discussing this diagnosis.

192
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,896
So, yeah, you'll
treat him for lupus.

193
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,138
House.

194
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,203
He wants you.

195
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,419
Parole?

196
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,357
You didn't tell me.

197
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,327
I didn't want a big
emotional scene.

198
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,694
You know what the rules are.

199
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,933
On short time, tax goes up.

200
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,009
How many do you want?

201
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,568
All of them.

202
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,573
Come on, Mendelson. I
should be on six a day.

203
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,216
I get four and I give you two.

204
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,951
Fine.

205
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,458
I'll get one in my
cell after lights out,

206
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,758
plus Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday. That's 11 in all.

207
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,024
I count 20.

208
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,125
You knew on Monday, you
get out Friday. Five days.

209
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,533
Should have told me earlier.

210
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,604
They give out four a day, max.

211
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,711
You'll figure something out.

212
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,040
You're a creative guy.

213
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,712
What if I just go into
protective custody

214
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,442
and spend the next
three days in the hole?

215
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,617
You could PC up.

216
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,085
But then you'll get out.

217
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,624
And unlike you, I got
friends on the outside.

218
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,922
Porter.

219
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,796
Doc. What you need?

220
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,328
I'm running a special on
grilled cheese this week.

221
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,614
I got some new girly mags, too.

222
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,631
I was thinking of
something more Vicodinny.

223
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,103
At least 16, and I need
them Friday at noon.

224
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,605
Man, that's pricey,
but it can be done.

225
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,393
How about you have one
of your peeps on the outside

226
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,909
send $200 to my
boy up in Trenton?

227
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,511
I am peepless.

228
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,754
This is just you
haggling, right? No.

229
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:37,457
You ever seen me chatting
on the phone? Taking visitors?

230
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,791
All right. I'm gonna
have to clean you out.

231
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:43,633
I'm gonna need to see some tuna, I'm
gonna need to see some stamps, stereo...

232
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,331
Just give them to me
as soon as you can.

233
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,206
What happened?

234
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,448
I was trying to use
the phone, I just...

235
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,079
I just got jostled
a little, that's all.

236
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,123
Who hit you?

237
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,986
No. I just... I just
bumped into the wall.

238
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,327
It's not lupus.

239
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,261
Is that good?

240
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,502
Does it feel good?

241
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,398
Sick.

242
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,038
No, I'm just going
through a bit of withdrawal.

243
00:17:56,342 --> 00:18:00,074
I'm trying to survive on one
a day for the next few days.

244
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,072
No.

245
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,186
Fix him.

246
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,328
It's not lupus.
He broke his arm.

247
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,703
Or it is lupus, and
he was in a fight.

248
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,036
He was in a jostle.

249
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,587
Because if he admits he was in
a fight, then he goes to the hole.

250
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,251
That's why he'd lie to the guards.
He's got no reason to lie to me.

251
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,448
Oh.

252
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,450
See? There are those eyes again.

253
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,447
How about a viral
syndrome or MRSA?

254
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,591
No, wouldn't chew
up the bone that fast.

255
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,956
But reaction to meds could.

256
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,422
May I? May you what?

257
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,863
Make me lose my job by
showing you a patient file?

258
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,466
But why don't you
assume no recent meds?

259
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,406
How long can I assume
that he's been smoking,

260
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,875
based on his yellow fingers?

261
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,777
You're thinking lung
cancer, metastatic.

262
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,714
I'll x-ray him on Friday.

263
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,650
We share a traveling x-ray
machine with two other clinics.

264
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,414
I'm out of here on
Friday. He's not.

265
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,956
Well, but if he throws
a clot and strokes out,

266
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,721
you can use the x-ray
to do the autopsy.

267
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,038
Start him on blood thinners.

268
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,293
Very interesting practice
you must have run.

269
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,300
No need for tests,
no need for proof?

270
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,661
Where are you going?
To the proof store.

271
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,973
You were right about Nicole.

272
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,405
About me not
caring? I thought so.

273
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,313
It wasn't her mom. It's her.

274
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,920
She doesn't want to talk to me.

275
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:52,083
Please. I'm trying to listen to
your lungs, not your self-pity.

276
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,254
Cancer can wait.

277
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,990
Hey, you heading out
to the yard? Mmm-hmm.

278
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,589
Mind trying to
find me a cricket?

279
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,465
The old swap trick.

280
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,361
You don't think that'll piss
off your cellie even more

281
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,940
when he figures
it's a different bug?

282
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,977
I'll dress them the
same, like in <i>Vertigo.</i>

283
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:16,611
I'll try. But they spray so much
pesticides, I'm surprised we're alive.

284
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,786
Good point.

285
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,616
Hey.

286
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,348
How's it coming?

287
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,483
It ain't.

288
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,471
Confederates be giving
themselves spanking new tats.

289
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,521
They putting a claim
on all my Vicodin.

290
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,030
Now I love you
and all, my brother,

291
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:37,467
but not as much as I love my gang
of crazy, roided out Nazi bitches.

292
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,339
Now try an inch to the left.

293
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,944
Hear the difference? Yeah.

294
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,213
It's called an
acoustical shadow.

295
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,051
Means he's got a tumor.

296
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,865
How did you find that
without a stethoscope?

297
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,357
I didn't even know
you could do this.

298
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,358
Start the blood thinners.

299
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,360
So I for sure got lung cancer?

300
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,827
No. Yeah.

301
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,064
All you've proven is there's
an anomaly in his chest.

302
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,211
Which means your initial
diagnosis could still be right?

303
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,067
Which, apparently,
really bugs you.

304
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,002
I could do a clotting test.

305
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,038
That's a good idea.

306
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:26,381
We're just gonna cut your earlobe
a bit and check back in two minutes.

307
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,683
If there's a little blood
bubbling up, that's normal.

308
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:34,652
But if it's completely clotted,
it may indicate cancer.

309
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,323
Okay? Ready?

310
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,842
Are you really leaving medicine?

311
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,923
What are you gonna do?

312
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:12,597
You know, for someone who
asks as many favors as you do,

313
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,793
you sure don't make
any effort to win me over.

314
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:24,199
Before I went to med school, I
thought about getting a PhD in physics.

315
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,140
You ever heard of dark matter?

316
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,282
The way galaxies rotate,
the motion of the universe,

317
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:35,115
it means there's six times
more stuff than we can detect.

318
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:39,083
It's been theorized, but no
one's ever proved it exists.

319
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,559
So you'd want to research it?

320
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,287
Why? It's the greatest
mystery there is.

321
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:47,425
Theory of everything.

322
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:50,264
And completely
divorced from humanity.

323
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:54,167
Me and humanity, we
got together too young.

324
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,038
You have a gift.

325
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:03,104
There is something in this
world you are undeniably great at.

326
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,983
You can read people.
You understand them.

327
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,481
You gotta go back to medicine.

328
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,659
Well, if that gift is related
to what brought me here,

329
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,358
you'll understand why I'd
wanna check the returns policy.

330
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:22,162
Hey! Is this supposed to happen?

331
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,068
Cool.

332
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,883
Jiminy didn't chirp
much last night.

333
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,693
If it's a disease,
he's six inches under.

334
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,522
But this could also
be pesticide poisoning,

335
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,532
which bicarbonate of
soda has been used to treat.

336
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,666
See? Just so much, and no more.

337
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,018
Mmm.

338
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,862
This is where you say thank you.

339
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,633
Or I say thank you
for not killing me.

340
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,140
Thank you.

341
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,292
Hey.

342
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:07,569
The x-ray didn't show any tumors.
The acoustical shadow was just a lipoma.

343
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,006
I'm thinking... You all right?

344
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,343
I'm fine.

345
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,810
Ibuprofen?

346
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,278
It's not gonna help.

347
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,923
You can look at the
patient file if you want.

348
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,156
You trust me?

349
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,522
Any reason I shouldn't?

350
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:35,124
You're really not good at reading
people, are you? Or buildings.

351
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,935
People are complicated.

352
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,868
And people change.

353
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,600
Not that much to the first
and not at all to the second.

354
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,247
But if it'll get me the file...

355
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,354
If we add clotting disorder to the
symptoms, it's gotta be a toxin...

356
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,869
This guy's the only
one with symptoms.

357
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,991
It's either gotta be his
cell or his workstation.

358
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:53,611
The laundry. So maybe
a solvent or detergent?

359
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,678
Can you get me an
escort to gather samples?

360
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,388
Dr. Adams.

361
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,683
Why does this man have a file?

362
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,337
You need to get cotton swabs.

363
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,808
Not now. I got something to do.

364
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,142
You're a prisoner on tier time.

365
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,908
By definition, you
have nothing to do.

366
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,934
I'm gonna call her family,
her friends, her work.

367
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,262
I'm gonna get
through eventually.

368
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,895
You're moving slower,
you're getting weaker.

369
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,354
This thing is attacking your
bones, your joints, your blood.

370
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,822
Look, my girl's more important.

371
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,358
She's not your girl, you idiot!

372
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,188
She was the girlfriend
of a loser drug dealer.

373
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,860
You think she's got the self-control
to wait around for three years?

374
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,028
You think she should?

375
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:48,040
There's a reason we're locked
away from nice, normal people.

376
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,171
Your life outside is over.

377
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,740
Your friends, your girl,
everyone you worked with,

378
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,547
they've moved on.

379
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,554
Get out of my house.

380
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,624
Get out!

381
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,139
Where's Sykes? Off
at his other clinics.

382
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,577
Great. I'm gonna
go to the laundry.

383
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,545
Give me some swabs... No.

384
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:30,276
What? He yelled at you
for letting me see the file.

385
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,585
You'll get over it. Few
years of therapy maybe...

386
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,780
Why did you lie to me
about what you were in for?

387
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:46,295
Okay, so I drove a car into a
wall instead of stealing some pills.

388
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:49,602
You obviously don't care what
I did, you care that I lied to you.

389
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,660
You feel jilted. I feel stupid.

390
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:55,541
It doesn't even make sense.
Why are you doing time?

391
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,844
You didn't have any priors.
You didn't hurt anyone.

392
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,380
I had a bad lawyer.

393
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:16,593
I'm sorry.

394
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,358
We can't talk about
this case anymore.

395
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,782
We hear you're gonna need an
incentive to get all my pills by tomorrow.

396
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,523
I can't get all 20,
but once I get out...

397
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,293
Give us a minute.

398
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:03,404
Why do you think
I'm on buspirone?

399
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,909
The stress.

400
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,079
I get the runs almost every day.

401
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,640
Any sign of weakness,
20 guys would line up

402
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,117
to stick a sharpened-up
toothbrush in my eye.

403
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,385
So as much as my better nature,
really, wants to give you a pass,

404
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,591
it just wouldn't be
good for my health.

405
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,492
See you tomorrow.

406
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,116
I need your help.

407
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,126
You got any matches?

408
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:57,128
No. That's serious contraband.

409
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,993
What are you planning to do?

410
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,157
How about a stick of gum?

411
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:03,428
Sure.

412
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,099
I'm gonna need that, too.

413
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,034
Why?

414
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,844
Why do I need the pen

415
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,678
that you always carry
around and never write with?

416
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,180
This is plan B.

417
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,690
What happened to your cheek?

418
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,562
What is it?

419
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,031
A fire?

420
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:15,199
House, we gotta evacuate
this area. Come on.

421
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,876
Hey, House.

422
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:26,783
You were saying something
about how I should, like, swab or...

423
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,855
You're confusing me
with the clinic again.

424
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,120
What, you're abandoning me?

425
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,255
As soon as you leave, I am.

426
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,092
Why? What changed?

427
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:45,469
I'm just done. No you,
medicine, fixing people. Done.

428
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,202
Now, get out. No.

429
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,469
Your lips are swelling.

430
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,114
Open your mouth.

431
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,444
Did you just eat something?

432
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,418
Meatloaf, potatoes, coffee...

433
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,715
You allergic to anything?

434
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,587
Guard!

435
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,935
You're going into
anaphylactic shock.

436
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,222
Guard!

437
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,952
Damn it.

438
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,589
I gotta make a hole,
so you can breathe.

439
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,159
House, get away from him!

440
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,960
He's having an allergic
reaction. He can't breathe.

441
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,462
Lie on the ground with your
hands behind your head.

442
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,012
Alvarez, look at what I'm
doing. It's a tracheotomy.

443
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,647
Come on, man. You
know I'm a doctor.

444
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,962
What's wrong with him?

445
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,689
I have no idea.

446
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:40,308
Saving us both from
contraband charges.

447
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:44,816
It's been great knowing you.

448
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,248
I need to be taken
into protective custody.

449
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,705
Wow, that was great.

450
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,013
I think I really
dodged a bullet there.

451
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,014
You don't need PC?

452
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,547
Nothing personal.
We'll reschedule.

453
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,553
Rain check, I promise.

454
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,719
It wasn't the food.

455
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,491
It was the heat.

456
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,496
It's mastocytosis.

457
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,960
Could be set off by hot liquids,
like the coffee he just drank.

458
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:41,029
Masto's usually a
skin disease. "Usually"?

459
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:42,841
It can hit any organ.

460
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:46,739
Joint pain, osteopenia and
anaphylaxis, eyebrow loss.

461
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:48,670
It fits.

462
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,012
It's a possibility. I'll run
some blood tests. Thank you.

463
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,712
No. No! It's almost impossible
to confirm masto with blood work.

464
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,248
Just give him five aspirin.

465
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,916
If he has masto,

466
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:03,189
he'll go into anaphylactic shock
and won't be able to breathe again.

467
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,730
You do understand the
meaning of the word "confirm".

468
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,093
I'll do it.

469
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,496
I almost died in that cell.

470
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,829
House, you're in here

471
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,415
because you think you can do
whatever you want, whenever you want.

472
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,873
You can't. And neither can I.

473
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,172
The ACLU would have my job,
my license, maybe even my house

474
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:20,837
if I do an unauthorized,
experimental...

475
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,211
But if it is masto... It's not.

476
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,192
Well, what do you have to
lose by giving him the aspirin?

477
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,514
I'm not taking the risk.

478
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,779
It's his risk to take.

479
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,564
If he has another attack and
there isn't a doctor in the next cell,

480
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:31,715
he could die.

481
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,954
For one second, will you stop
covering your ass and do the test?

482
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,453
I think House is right.

483
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,689
No.

484
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,928
You're a moron and a
coward. I'll do it myself.

485
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,901
Guard.

486
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:50,701
You're done here,

487
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,404
just like every other place
you've ever set foot in your life.

488
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,790
If I ever see you in here again,

489
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:59,216
I will write you up and
they will revoke your parole.

490
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,295
Dr. House.

491
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,597
Did you get all the
Vicodin you needed?

492
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,333
I'm not an idiot.

493
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,270
That fire, that
bruise on your face.

494
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:26,277
I talk to prisoners, I know about exit
taxes. You're clearly getting squeezed.

495
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,278
I need 20.

496
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,790
And let me back in the
clinic when Sykes is gone.

497
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,452
I'll take care of Nick. You
can't if you're not willing.

498
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:43,688
Just take care of yourself.

499
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,455
Well done.

500
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:12,491
I knew if you'd learned
nothing else in here,

501
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,856
you'd learned the smart
thing is to fall in line.

502
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,628
You're absolutely right.

503
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,272
Hey! Hey! Hey!

504
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,871
I need back-up here.

505
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,109
Hey! Hey! Son of a bitch!

506
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,214
You gotta get past me
before solitary, you hear me?

507
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,190
Come on. Come on!

508
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,786
Thanks for getting
me to the clinic.

509
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,186
Take him out.

510
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,367
I got only two years
left in my stretch.

511
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,626
Take him out.

512
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,836
C.O.! Need a little help here!

513
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:05,707
I need back-up! I need back-up!
Without back-up there will be a fight here.

514
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,675
Alvarez!

515
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,478
Sullivan, back off!

516
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,488
Mendelson, you'll
be held responsible!

517
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,548
Hey, I'm just playing solitaire.

518
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,281
Hands behind your head.

519
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,911
On the ground!

520
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,557
You are so lucky.

521
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,875
We got a guy in an ambulance
heading to Princeton General.

522
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,425
Another dozen getting
ear gas hosed off them.

523
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,366
Hey, sit down!

524
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,128
Back off!

525
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,638
Sit down!

526
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,543
Where's the aspirin?

527
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:22,610
Oh, God. Did you get
beaten up on purpose?

528
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,814
House. What are you doing?

529
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,349
Hey!

530
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,527
House, open up.
This is a direct order.

531
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,494
Yeah, it's always
a direct order.

532
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,294
Eight months, and I haven't
heard an indirect order in here.

533
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,698
Dr. Adams!

534
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,027
They're gonna
revoke your parole.

535
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:43,939
They're gonna charge you with extra crimes.
You'll be here six more months, minimum.

536
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,135
Sorry, distracted.

537
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:46,701
You were saying?

538
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,771
I checked your file. You
didn't have a bad lawyer,

539
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,145
you had no lawyer.

540
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:54,049
You took the first deal they offered you
because you wanted to punish yourself.

541
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,672
You think getting beaten up,

542
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,985
you think saving this one
guy will wipe your slate clean?

543
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,149
No.

544
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:02,193
Then why are you doing
this? Because I have a gift.

545
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:07,191
Once you drink this, you should
get an attack almost immediately.

546
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,493
That is, if I am right.

547
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,558
You just bought yourself
months in solitary.

548
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,830
Was it really worth it? If
I'm wrong, no, it wasn't.

549
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,906
No! No! No! Get
the cup! Get the cup!

550
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,067
Drink it! Drink it!

551
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,872
No! Grab the cup!

552
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,176
Hands behind your back.

553
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,986
What were you
thinking? I don't know. I...

554
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,221
I was... I was scared.

555
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:40,927
No!

556
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:42,390
You're fired.

557
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,893
You're beyond fired.

558
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:48,770
You're completely un-hirable
anywhere. Do you understand that?

559
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,977
Yes. Now shut up and
let's see if he has an attack.

560
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,256
Come on. Just
a little more time.

561
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,737
Get him out of here.
