1
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:35,797
Come on in.

2
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,229
I'm not doing any more chemo.

3
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:47,637
Good plan.

4
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,077
You'll be dead in five months.

5
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,749
We went for a
cure, it didn't work.

6
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,681
I've thought about this a lot.

7
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,954
Five more months on
this Earth is reasonable.

8
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:05,622
A year in the hospital
in excruciating pain is

9
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,262
not.

10
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,739
With two weeks on,
two weeks off of chemo,

11
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,864
you could have way
more than a year.

12
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,368
Maybe two or three.

13
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,476
House.

14
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,380
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,485
I'm not gonna let you just die.

16
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:21,906
Hey.

17
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,553
You know, management
research shows that

18
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,103
the best ideas come
from casual contact.

19
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:30,072
So, one set of season tickets.

20
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,879
I got the seat next to you.

21
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,387
First game is October 8th.

22
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,949
It's about one month after
Wilson's expiration date.

23
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,520
This isn't an
unstructured collaboration.

24
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,325
You're trying to
be the new Wilson.

25
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,957
I'm trying to show you there are
other people who care about you.

26
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,095
Relax. I'm probably
not gonna fall apart.

27
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:00,312
<i>Five, six, seven, eight. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.</i>

28
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:05,318
<i>One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. Here we go.</i>

29
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,419
<i>Cradle. One...</i>

30
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,923
Put down the pom-poms and
step away from the computer.

31
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,625
46-year-old oncologist
refuses treatment.

32
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,719
Foreman already gave us a case.

33
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,128
Wants us to keep
things as normal

34
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,962
as possible for as
long as possible.

35
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,929
Wilson is dying, Chase is gone,

36
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,131
how close to normal do
you think we can come?

37
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,306
19-year-old
cheerleader, admitted with

38
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,240
massive nosebleed and dizziness.

39
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:34,211
Wow, cool, I just completely
forgot that my best friend is dying.

40
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,777
Wait, that just reminded me.

41
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,351
Head CT is clean.

42
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,113
How can we turn Wilson
from a terminal idiot

43
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,680
into an interminable
pain in the ass?

44
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,259
A mini-stroke could
explain our patient's

45
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,766
neuro symptoms
and his butterfingers.

46
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,160
But not his bloody nose.

47
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,289
My best friend is
trying to kill himself.

48
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,500
He just wants to die
with a little dignity.

49
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,164
There's no such thing.

50
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,467
It's not your choice, House.

51
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,271
Your only choice here is
between acceptance and misery.

52
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,647
It's a midline granuloma.
Get your patient a PET scan.

53
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:23,289
No lesions along the optic
track... You already covered that.

54
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,326
Maybe we should get
someone else to take this case.

55
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,760
Why? Because someone
somewhere is dying?

56
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,167
Oh, crap! Turn off the mic.

57
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,535
It is off.

58
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:40,044
Not according to his brain. His
temporal lobe is completely lit up.

59
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,640
Auditory portion. He's
hearing something.

60
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,233
Foreman's trying to date me.

61
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,555
I assume that's
because you called him.

62
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,471
No, I...

63
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,167
Did you put something
in my coffee?

64
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:13,577
You know how you can be there
for me five months from now?

65
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,672
Don't be dead five
months from now.

66
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,697
Hey, Wilson...

67
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,628
Seriously?

68
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:36,930
Just a little picker-downer.

69
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,367
I assume this unwanted interruption
means you're looking for me

70
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,806
to discuss the
latest development

71
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,969
in a case I don't
want to discuss.

72
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,735
Our patient is hearing voices.

73
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,838
He denies it, but the
PET scan says otherwise.

74
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,009
He's at the right age for
the onset of schizophrenia.

75
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,280
Yeah. You really need me.

76
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,855
Ultrasound his abdomen
to check for schizophrenia.

77
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,154
We already ordered a psych
evaluation, but drugs could also cause...

78
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,956
Tox screen was clean.

79
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,461
Ultrasound his dorm.

80
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:10,436
Whoa! You guys can't just come
busting in here without a warrant.

81
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,198
We're not cops. We're
your roommate's doctors.

82
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:22,046
Any idea what flavor of drugs
would be making your roommate sick?

83
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,107
Objection. Entrapment.

84
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,980
I'm pre-law.

85
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,250
Derrick doesn't party.

86
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,458
Look at this.

87
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,057
Why would he have a
picture of a little boy?

88
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,894
Maybe it's his
nephew or something?

89
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,139
Hidden in his sock drawer?

90
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:41,858
Whoa!

91
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,267
Creepy.

92
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,223
We need to talk to Derrick
about some medical matters.

93
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,287
Well, she's my girlfriend.
She can be here for that.

94
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:04,256
We found this in your dorm room.

95
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,156
Who is that?

96
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,523
Nobody.

97
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,788
Then why was it
hidden in a drawer?

98
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:15,654
Derrick, what's
she talking about?

99
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,698
It's my brother, Christopher.

100
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,844
You never told me
you had a brother.

101
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,346
Well, he's been dead
almost 10 years, so...

102
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,210
Is that the voice you
hear in your head?

103
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,192
Mmm!

104
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,632
And, Io, he is risen.

105
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,836
So now my hair's
gonna fall out next week?

106
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,040
No, all I did was temporarily
kill you. How was it?

107
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,648
Look, I wasn't dead.
I was unconscious.

108
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:05,515
No dreams or thoughts.
You experience nothing.

109
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,513
Now, imagine that without
the waking up on the couch part.

110
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,386
Just nothing, times infinity.

111
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:17,654
You didn't just prove death is
nothing. You proved propofol is.

112
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,562
You're saying the
end is not the end?

113
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,904
I was expecting, "Nothing is
better than something lousy,"

114
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,274
but not, "The angels
are waiting for me."

115
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,876
I'm not having
this conversation.

116
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,307
Why? Because it
doesn't make sense?

117
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,117
Because I'm not gonna change
your mind, and I don't care.

118
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,346
More importantly, you're
not gonna change mine.

119
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,685
There is no heaven,
there is no hell,

120
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,282
your soul is not gonna
float out of your body

121
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,951
and join some great,
unifying energy force.

122
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,006
The fact that you're dying
is not gonna change that.

123
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,931
Please, just go.

124
00:08:58,772 --> 00:08:59,772
House.

125
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:07,471
I have spent the last 20 years
holding the hands of people as they die.

126
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,072
When I watch that
transformation...

127
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:17,557
I'm sorry, I don't believe that
we're just a bag of chemicals.

128
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,738
So are we gonna talk about
the patient, or wait for House?

129
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,569
Viral encephalitis.

130
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,278
It's been going on for 10 years.

131
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,749
I'm gonna go in there and
invite him to participate.

132
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,147
I think he'd welcome
the distraction.

133
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Come with me?

134
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,359
Why?

135
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,058
When was the last time House
listened to anything we said

136
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,326
about anything personal?

137
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,763
Maybe you'll feel better,
but sometimes, the truth is,

138
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,066
there's nothing anyone can do.

139
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,637
Temporal lobe epilepsy.

140
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,311
Causes voices, dizziness.

141
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,680
Trauma from a seizure
would explain the nose bleed.

142
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,117
You know about
all of my siblings,

143
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,120
and cousins, and
aunts and uncles, and...

144
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,282
You're overreacting.

145
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,519
Because you don't trust
me enough to tell me about...

146
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,755
Sorry. It's time to
go down for your test.

147
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,161
If you want to wait here,
it'll only take about an hour.

148
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,634
No, she's leaving.

149
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,234
Derrick, come on. I mean,
we should at least talk.

150
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,465
No, I'd rather you just leave.

151
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,175
And you don't need to come back.

152
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,158
<i>Time. Any odd tastes or smells?</i>

153
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,260
No. Feel fine.

154
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,888
Things looked
fine on my end, too.

155
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,399
So you won't admit
to your doctors

156
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,703
that you're hearing
your brother's voice,

157
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,572
which is dangerous.

158
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,236
And now, you lost
your girlfriend over it.

159
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,879
Which is stupid.

160
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,677
I assume there's
more to the story?

161
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,781
That's how I was raised.

162
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,578
Short story. Yeah.

163
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,182
My boss is losing his
best friend to cancer.

164
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,116
And instead of
talking about the pain,

165
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,492
he's pretending
there is no pain,

166
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,464
because everything can be fixed.

167
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,070
My father tried to deal with it.

168
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,475
Ironic that he'd drink
himself into oblivion

169
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,909
after my brother was
killed by a drunk driver.

170
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,312
Do you need a tissue?

171
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:06,893
After Dad left, my
mom moved us away.

172
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,897
She got rid of all the pictures of
Christopher and never mentioned him again.

173
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,424
It was like he never existed.

174
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,059
And that worked for us.

175
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,727
And, yet, you kept one.

176
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,836
Uh... My right eye...

177
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,605
I was seeing spots, but now I
can't see at all. Is that from the test?

178
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,143
No, this is something else.

179
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,908
Ah! That hurts! Sorry.

180
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,312
How many fingers?

181
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,086
Two. Fuzzy ones, but two.

182
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,183
It's a clot in the artery behind
your eye. I just broke it up.

183
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,259
Is that bad?

184
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,125
Don't know. Because I
don't know why it happened.

185
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:51,637
Hey.

186
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,462
Saved us a table.

187
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,630
There are no tables.

188
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,802
I recently hacked
into your old files.

189
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,109
Found a 6-year-old boy
with bilateral retinoblastoma.

190
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,614
Doctors wanted
to take his eyes out

191
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,229
before the cancer
spread to his brain.

192
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:09,951
But you fought them. Advocated
for a new photon beam radiation.

193
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,390
Saved the kid's vision,
probably saved his life.

194
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:16,489
That was my first case
at PPTH. Mikey Kimble.

195
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,723
It's Michael, now.

196
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,892
Oh, yeah, this is our table.

197
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,060
Wow.

198
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:30,776
How are you?

199
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,109
I'm doing great.
Graduating next month.

200
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,611
Already? Little Mikey?

201
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,649
And I got accepted to Princeton.

202
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,052
I'm planning on
going to med school.

203
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,859
He's going to be a doctor.
Instead of being dead.

204
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:54,891
Dr. House told me all
about your situation.

205
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,865
That's why I came.

206
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,030
There's just so much
good that you can do,

207
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,300
even in a small amount of time.

208
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,409
I wonder...

209
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:09,715
Hey!

210
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:14,252
Is there anybody else here who's alive
today because of Dr. James Wilson?

211
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:39,007
Gastric adenocarcinoma.
Fifteen years in remission.

212
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,841
Six grandchildren that
I never would have met.

213
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,516
Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

214
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,784
Squamous cell lung cancer.

215
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,016
Twelve years in remission.

216
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,422
I was able to walk my
daughter down the aisle last May.

217
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,826
Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

218
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,738
I did the math.

219
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,905
Seventy-four children are
alive today because of you.

220
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,143
Fourteen grandchildren.

221
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,419
Mikey Kimble started
kindergarten before the age cut-off.

222
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,083
He would have graduated
high school last year.

223
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,429
I flunked a year?

224
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,190
Was anybody in this room
really a patient of mine?

225
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,408
They're somewhere.

226
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,907
They're giving you a
standing "O" somewhere.

227
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,274
They exist. You
saved their lives.

228
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,785
It's actually more impressive
that they're too busy to be here.

229
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,649
What's this?

230
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,160
A glowing letter
of recommendation

231
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,288
you just wrote for
me on my laptop.

232
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,696
I noticed it's lacking your
signature at the bottom.

233
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,826
Don't you think you're being a bit
premature predicting House's demise?

234
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,962
Not demise, just implosion.

235
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,968
He's going through a rough time.

236
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,921
But, so far, he's
been handling it...

237
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,488
<i>House?</i>

238
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,626
Your shoes are wet.

239
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,422
Glad to see your
emotional turmoil

240
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,862
hasn't dulled your
powers of observation.

241
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,259
I know you're responsible.

242
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,930
No, you don't. Because I
didn't do it. Whatever "it" is.

243
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,535
But if I had shoved those
season tickets down some toilets,

244
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,577
I would have done it
because you asked me to.

245
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:55,077
You wanted to replace Wilson.
I prank Wilson all the time.

246
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,445
Enjoy.

247
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,537
I got you three,
but I drank them.

248
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,880
You didn't have to call me,
but I appreciate I made the list.

249
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,212
It wasn't entirely unselfish.

250
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,360
I didn't feel right approaching

251
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,861
any of my terminal
patients, but...

252
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,430
What is it like?

253
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,671
Hmm...

254
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,065
Does it ever stop being surreal?

255
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:04,376
It'll stop in about five or six
months, give or take, in your case.

256
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,880
You know what
happened to me today?

257
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,290
One of my patients
suddenly started crying.

258
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,325
It can't be your first.

259
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,894
It was the first one
who was crying for me.

260
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,633
It's the human response.
It's either overly saccharine,

261
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,900
because giving sympathy
makes them feel better,

262
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,439
or they ignore you,

263
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,478
because hiding from mortality
makes them feel better.

264
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,913
Well, why can't they just say
something that makes me feel better?

265
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,181
Like what, exactly?

266
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,317
I don't know. No.

267
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,125
Mmm...

268
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,496
You'd be doing what? Two
weeks on, two weeks off?

269
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,534
So maybe do your first
round, see how it goes.

270
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,467
May be not as
horrible as you fear.

271
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,870
Then do the second round,
enjoy your two weeks off,

272
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,705
and revisit the
decision. Rinse, repeat.

273
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,649
I just can't envision
spending my remaining time

274
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,949
in a chemo suite in Princeton.

275
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,695
I want to enjoy myself
with family and friends.

276
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,397
Friends, or friend?

277
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,868
Hi, this is Greg House
again. Third message.

278
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,205
Hopefully indicating how
much I want you to call me back.

279
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,302
I'd say that your son is
dying to increase the urgency,

280
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,211
but you probably
already know that.

281
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,651
The fake people who care that
Wilson stays alive didn't work,

282
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,654
so I need the real people
who care about him

283
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,314
to tell him what
an idiot he's being.

284
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,682
Where are we going?

285
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,502
Well, I just got paged
to go to the bathroom.

286
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,286
I don't know where the
rest of you are going.

287
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,191
Some of our patient's
symptoms might be physiological

288
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,028
and some might be psychological.

289
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,939
You think being forced
to bury painful memories

290
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,194
is making his symptoms worse?

291
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,069
Grief avoidance can lead to
all sorts of anxiety disorders,

292
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:10,007
which can manifest
into physical illness.

293
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,904
Let's assume that all his
symptoms are real symptoms.

294
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,512
So we're going to
avoid grief avoidance?

295
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,279
Studies after September
11th showed that

296
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,115
repression was
actually better for coping

297
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,416
than dwelling in misery.

298
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,054
What about polycythemia vera?

299
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,324
RBC's are slightly
elevated, but not that much.

300
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,793
Hodgkin's lymphoma?

301
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,328
Would have shown
up on the PET scan.

302
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,762
What if our guy
got hurt at practice

303
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,631
and, like everything else,
just didn't tell anyone?

304
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,921
Could have set off DIC.
Would explain everything.

305
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,564
I thought you had to
go to the bathroom.

306
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,169
I didn't say I had to go in.

307
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,167
Need some more mops in here!

308
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,418
What exactly are
you looking for?

309
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,411
Blood. If your spinal fluid
is yellow instead of clear,

310
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,289
it means you've had a
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

311
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,962
What does your
brother say to you?

312
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,756
Does he tell you
you're gonna be okay?

313
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,160
It doesn't really
work like that.

314
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,373
I think you hear your
brother's voice for a reason.

315
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,099
I thought you guys said that I
hear things because I'm sick.

316
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,112
Yes, but that doesn't explain
why you don't hear a different voice.

317
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,574
I think your mom
didn't let you deal

318
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,877
with the grief of losing
your brother properly.

319
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,184
There are people here
who could help you with that.

320
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:34,893
Okay.

321
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,658
The opening
pressure's way too high.

322
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,691
The prodigal daughter returns.

323
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,855
You taking me up
on my offer to off you?

324
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,326
I think I've still got
some leftover propofol.

325
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,898
I spoke to Wilson.

326
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,904
He's angry because I want him
to live longer. Who wouldn't be?

327
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,193
Friends respect
each other's decisions,

328
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,675
even if they don't
agree with them.

329
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:24,742
It's called loyalty.

330
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,540
Loyalty is a tool to get people

331
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,272
to do things they
don't want to do.

332
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,182
But you do want to.

333
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,255
And you may have
rationalized it 100 different ways,

334
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,449
but the fact is you
fired me so that

335
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,685
I'd be forced to spend
the rest of my life

336
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,285
doing exactly
what I wanted to do.

337
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,800
It was probably the most selfless
thing anyone has ever done for me.

338
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,211
And you don't even
like me that much.

339
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
I surrender.

340
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,598
I have been a disloyal,

341
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,969
disrespectful jerk.

342
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,164
I should've listened
to what you wanted.

343
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,932
I'm still not letting my
parents return your call.

344
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,077
I made a reservation for two
at Carmine's. Tonight, 8:00.

345
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,643
No more tricks. No
more manipulations.

346
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,485
Said Machiavelli.

347
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:47,358
Just two friends enjoying
the time they have left.

348
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,992
Please, don't... I'm not.

349
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,628
I promise.

350
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:54,866
Just dinner?

351
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,467
That depends on how
much you have to drink.

352
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,164
Sounds nice.

353
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,151
Mom.

354
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,329
I came as soon as
I got your message.

355
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,353
Is he gonna be okay?

356
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,447
We're hoping it's
just excess fluid

357
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,583
on his brain from
an extreme migraine.

358
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,085
Which isn't good,
but it's treatable.

359
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,657
He's scheduled to get an MRI as
soon as these meds start taking effect.

360
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,030
We found that picture
in his dorm room.

361
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,839
I'm not sure what
Derrick's told you,

362
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,880
but he's been hearing Christopher's
voice for the last 10 years.

363
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:48,118
And it's possible that
repressing all that grief he's felt

364
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,850
is actually causing some
of Derrick's symptoms.

365
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:57,322
I don't even know if this voice in
my head is something I invented,

366
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,365
or if it's what Christopher
was really like.

367
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,192
With no photos, no video,

368
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,204
my memories,

369
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,904
I really don't have any anymore.

370
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,839
Maybe you could just

371
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,485
tell me a little bit about him?

372
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,517
I'm sorry. It was
a long drive in.

373
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,425
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

374
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,529
Okay.

375
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:43,203
Seventy-nine years old and
you told her she was pregnant.

376
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,736
Well, it cured her hiccups.

377
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,246
I'll say I didn't expect
her to cry for quite so long.

378
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,516
Now, I know that the
tiramisu is great here,

379
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,385
but I actually ordered off menu.

380
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:11,431
Greg, I told you you didn't
hang the bear bag high enough.

381
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,369
It was a smart bear.

382
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,369
I'm almost certain
he untied my knots.

383
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,737
Well, he wasn't that smart.
He left the Oreos behind.

384
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:23,110
You hiked for 32 miles eating
nothing but creamy filling.

385
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,308
The black stuff is overrated.

386
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,777
To climbing the hill.

387
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,055
Okay.

388
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:43,091
If I did decide to stick
around a little longer...

389
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,568
Don't do that to me, Wilson.

390
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,640
No, I'm not. I'm just...

391
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:52,177
I do feel pretty good,
and maybe I should try it.

392
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:54,675
For a little while.

393
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,846
I think that's reasonable.

394
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,424
Are you conning me?

395
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:18,836
You're conning me.

396
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,204
What?

397
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:24,802
Just because you folded, that
means it must be some evil plan?

398
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:29,979
Well, that's usually how it works
with you. You drown me in nostalgia,

399
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,882
so I'll think about our friendship
and feel some kind of loyalty,

400
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,216
and agree to more chemo.

401
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,188
That was real nostalgia, it was
real emotion, it's a real decision.

402
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,953
A decision that I
just made for you.

403
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,326
I need you, okay.

404
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,836
I want you to be around
as long as possible,

405
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,485
because I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

406
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,876
No! No. Don't do that.

407
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,538
I don't owe you anything.

408
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,914
Our entire relationship
has been about you.

409
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,021
My dying is about me.

410
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,104
Look at you. You
don't wanna die.

411
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,931
Of course, I don't wanna die.

412
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,600
Then fight.

413
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,338
I did. I tried.

414
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,570
One time.

415
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,045
House, get out of my car.

416
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,705
You don't have
to just accept this.

417
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,082
Yes, I do have to accept
this. I have five months to live.

418
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,688
And you're making me
go through this alone?

419
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:27,196
I'm pissed because
I'm dying. That's not fair.

420
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,266
And I need...

421
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,203
I need a friend.

422
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:35,073
I need to know that
you're there. I need...

423
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,611
I need you to tell me that
my life was worthwhile.

424
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:48,618
And I need you to tell
me that you love me.

425
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,398
No.

426
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,931
I'm not gonna tell you
that unless you fight.

427
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:21,910
Blood vessels are
non-reactive. It's not a migraine.

428
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,980
<i>I'm not feeling so
great, how much longer?</i>

429
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,616
Finishing up.

430
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,589
Thank you, Dr. Adams.

431
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,271
It looks like the
ceiling might...

432
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,610
What are you doing back here?

433
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:27,449
We got a case. I assume the
status is patient's getting worse,

434
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,953
you guys are confused.

435
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,884
You think actually
showing up for work

436
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,219
is enough to make
up for ruining an MRI?

437
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,794
Endangering the
patient, injuring us?

438
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,956
I've got an airtight
alibi that I'm working on.

439
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,541
This isn't about the
damage. You're back

440
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,143
because something's
going on with Wilson.

441
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,396
I'm done with Wilson.

442
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,346
What does that mean,
you're done with Wilson?

443
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,498
If he's not dead, you're
not done with Wilson.

444
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,517
Suddenly, you think you're
gonna make a difference?

445
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,804
You can't just abandon him.

446
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,002
It's in his hands
now. Did you get

447
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,171
any good pictures
before the MRI drowned?

448
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,544
Enough to know it
wasn't a migraine.

449
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,913
And the patient
mistook me for Adams.

450
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:10,757
Come with me.

451
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,262
Hey.

452
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,546
So what do you
think's gonna happen

453
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,266
when I stick a needle
into his eardrum?

454
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,533
You quizzing us?

455
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,006
This is a good quiz.

456
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,541
He'll scream in pain.

457
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,689
Don't listen to her.

458
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,508
Very small needle,
very steady hands.

459
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,591
Now, when I pull
back on the plunger,

460
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,015
what do you think
is gonna come out?

461
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,117
Air.

462
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,253
Boy, that air sure is red.

463
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,286
Persistent Stapedial Artery.

464
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,456
It should disappear
in the embryonic stage.

465
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:49,534
But just like his dead
brother, he really can't let go.

466
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,400
So the artery's been pressing
against the temporal lobe of his brain,

467
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,530
right above the ear canal.

468
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,767
Explains the voices,
the dizziness, everything.

469
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,215
Now you guys can explain how
we're gonna make him better.

470
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,109
Will my brother's voice go away?

471
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:15,924
You're being an ass.

472
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,797
I just cured a patient.
How about you?

473
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:20,297
You can't just
give up on Wilson.

474
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,060
You know he needs you.

475
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,811
You know he's making
an impossible choice.

476
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,275
He just doesn't
want to live in pain.

477
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:26,966
Life is pain.

478
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,639
I wake up every morning and
I'm in pain. I go to work in pain.

479
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,782
You know how many times
I've wanted to just give up?

480
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,831
How many times I've
thought about ending it?

481
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,138
You here to yell at me,
or give me hockey tickets?

482
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,929
Had to delay the surgery
because our patient

483
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,639
drank ammonia
from the janitor's cart.

484
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:12,178
I guess he didn't want to
live without his brother's voice.

485
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,321
Where are you going?

486
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,361
You can't wait to die?

487
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,234
Here, let me help you.

488
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,826
Hey! Hey! House!

489
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:32,970
House!

490
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:34,996
See? You wanna live.

491
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,118
He did something stupid.
He's not gonna do it again.

492
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:40,909
You're resisting me because it's
our human responsibility to stay alive!

493
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,538
You've made your
point, House! Stop!

494
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:59,196
You've spent your whole
life looking for the truth.

495
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,063
Well, sometimes,
the truth just sucks.

496
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,406
Um, um...

497
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:16,580
I'm going to be leaving, uh... Quite a
bit earlier than we had talked about.

498
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:20,750
Next day or two.

499
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,716
What happened?

500
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,382
Something between you and House?

501
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,422
He's not my child.

502
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:37,796
I cannot be responsible for
the happiness of Gregory House.

503
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,767
I'll give these to Frankel.

504
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:44,108
Okay, thank you.

505
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,471
And you are responsible.

506
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:57,782
The past 20 years,
you've had three wives,

507
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,724
hundreds of colleagues,
thousands of patients.

508
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,462
But you've kept
that one best friend.

509
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:12,001
He wants me to suffer a misery
that I don't want to go through.

510
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,634
Chemo won't make
your life any better.

511
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:20,939
But caring will.

512
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,313
Enduring pain to do some
good for someone you care about.

513
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,584
Isn't that what life is?

514
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Mom.

515
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:46,997
Yeah?

516
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,559
That picture of Christopher
that I had on the stand,

517
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:53,763
did you take it?

518
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:57,574
Yes.

519
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,273
Did you throw it out?

520
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,915
If I agree to get this surgery,

521
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,883
can you bring that picture back?

522
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,253
Not home. WILSON: House.

523
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,922
I'm ready to start the
next round of chemo.

524
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,291
Why?

525
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,002
Because you need me.

526
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:05,040
And I don't think that's
a bad thing anymore.

527
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,513
No.

528
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,749
You're the only one I listen to.

529
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,983
And the last couple of days, I
didn't. I almost killed my patient.

530
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,625
So I think it's time
for me to accept

531
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:25,426
that you're just
smarter than I am.

532
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:32,199
Are you really okay that
there's only five months left?

533
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,105
No.

534
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,673
But it's better than nothing.

535
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,014
Um...

536
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:46,710
How do we start?

537
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:51,835
Well, I'm not gonna
say, "I love you."

538
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,382
Thank God. Got any Oreos?

539
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,178
Hey. How you feeling?

540
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,516
The surgery worked.

541
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:22,886
How can you tell?

542
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,890
Because Christopher's gone.

543
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,320
And this is the peak.
Almost 8,000 feet.

544
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:39,258
You do realize that my leg
situation has deteriorated a little

545
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,798
since the last time
we went hiking.

546
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,332
So add another day.

547
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,737
This is Matt Johnson,
the hospital lawyer.

548
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,443
Yes, I have decided
not to proceed

549
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,446
with the sexual harassment case.

550
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,082
Are these yours?

551
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:04,184
The plumber retrieved them
from the hospital outflow pipe.

552
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,520
They caused the sewage
back up that ruined the MRI.

553
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,991
And they have your name on them.

554
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:13,963
Gregory Danger House?
It's a very common name.

555
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,661
These apparently have your
finger prints on them also.

556
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,849
Okay, well, why don't you
tell me how many hours

557
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,705
of picking up trash
you want me to do?

558
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,604
House, I tried to
keep this internal.

559
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,176
The fire department handed
the tickets to the police,

560
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,041
who contacted
your parole officer.

561
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,050
It's felony vandalism.

562
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,716
He's gonna revoke your parole.

563
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:39,817
There's nothing we can do.

564
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,835
You have to report to
Mercer County Jail on Monday

565
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,691
to serve out the
rest of your sentence.

566
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:53,703
And that's how long?

567
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,040
I'm sorry. How long?

568
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,381
Six months.
