1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,735
Mom!

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,803
I'm thirsty.

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,673
I just gave you water.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,971
I want juice.

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,512
It's bedtime.

6
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,276
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

7
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,960
Mom!

8
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,198
What do you want, Clance?

9
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,402
Oh. Hi, Dad.

10
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,102
Go to bed.

11
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,611
Can I turn the TV on?

12
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,080
TV's only for the
daytime. That was the deal.

13
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,050
I'll keep the volume
down. I just like the light.

14
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,416
Go to bed.

15
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,250
Dad, what if...

16
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,615
What if they come
to get me again?

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,464
Nobody is coming to get
you, okay? Go to bed now.

18
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,917
Come on, Clancy.
It's time to get up.

19
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,738
<i>If you plan to be out at the
shore today, you are in for a treat.</i>

20
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:46,359
<i>We're looking at mostly sunny
skies up and down the Jersey coast...</i>

21
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,231
I guess he's already up.

22
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,860
That's a first.

23
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,707
Well, I'll see if he
needs breakfast.

24
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,501
Hey, Clance, you hungry?

25
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,743
Hon, he's not down here.

26
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,684
You sure?

27
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,179
Clancy?

28
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,723
Clancy?

29
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,403
Clancy? Where are you?

30
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,136
Sweetie, are you hiding? Clancy?

31
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,008
Where is he?

32
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,741
Clancy!

33
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,706
Clancy!

34
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,696
You're gonna be in big
trouble when I find you.

35
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,953
Honey, come out right now,
wherever you are. This is not funny.

36
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,517
Clance?

37
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,823
Clancy?

38
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,306
Where's the sweat and the BO?

39
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,113
You've taken such pride in
bathing us all in your musk.

40
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,346
I showered at home.

41
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,855
And yet you're
earlier than usual.

42
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,914
Is this an intervention?

43
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,153
It's a little late, since I'm
not using drugs anymore.

44
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,253
I am, however, still
hooked on phonics.

45
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,321
If you did your morning
run and showered at home,

46
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,558
you'd be later than usual.

47
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,362
Thought of you in the shower.

48
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,563
How's your leg? You seem
to be favoring your left side.

49
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,503
I was hanging down my
right pant leg yesterday,

50
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,052
makes all the
difference in the world.

51
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,541
You've taken the
stairs every day.

52
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,100
Do I need a restraining order?

53
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,873
You slack on your rehab,

54
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,143
the muscle will weaken,
and your leg will hurt again.

55
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,284
Looks like the ketamine
treatment might not stick.

56
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,518
Or maybe we've made him
depressed because we're lying to him,

57
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,934
telling him he got
that case wrong.

58
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,223
We didn't hurt
him. The pain isn't...

59
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,263
He gets depressed,
he stops exercising.

60
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,389
He stops exercising,
the muscle atrophies.

61
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,229
The muscle atrophies,
the pain returns.

62
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,465
Maybe he stopped exercising because
the giant hole in his leg actually hurts.

63
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,733
The ketamine
could work perfectly,

64
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,265
and he would still be back on
his cane, popping Vicodin again.

65
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,474
You can't tell him. He got
lucky. There was no medical...

66
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,106
He was right.

67
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,277
We tell him he was right,
and we're feeding his addiction.

68
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,446
Without Vicodin, he's
only got one to focus on.

69
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,490
Well, he's not gonna
OD on puzzles.

70
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,821
No, it's not gonna hurt him,

71
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,561
but he could just as easily
have killed that patient.

72
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:14,459
We have a tiny window of time here where
House may be healthy enough to change,

73
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:18,027
and based on that limp,
the window's closing fast.

74
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,774
Kid is a product of an in
vitro fertilization pregnancy,

75
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:29,373
had all his vaccinations,
fractured his right ulna at age three,

76
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,008
chicken pox at age five...

77
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,315
He ever get his feelings hurt?

78
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,689
I'll need to know that, too.

79
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:40,090
You are "0" for one since you came
back. We just wanna make sure that...

80
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,220
Rectal bleeding plus
alien-abduction fantasies.

81
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,593
Most likely sexual abuse.

82
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,132
Penetration causes the bleed.
Trauma causes the fantasy.

83
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,601
ER ran a rape kit, found no evidence
of tearing, semen or pubic hairs.

84
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,036
I think we should
talk to the kid.

85
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,870
Why? In case he's
telling the truth?

86
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,271
You're a believer, aren't you?

87
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,109
Well, I'm just not
arrogant enough to think

88
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,242
that of the 50 billion galaxies,
100 billion stars per galaxy

89
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,252
and 10 million billion
planets in the universe,

90
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,083
that we're the
only ones with life.

91
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,090
No, but I'm guessing we're the
only ones who like shoving things

92
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,888
through our back doors. There
is new research indicating a link

93
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,972
between neurological
problems and bleeding disorders.

94
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,262
Perfect, especially if there
were neurological problems.

95
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,996
What part of hallucinating an
alien abduction isn't neurological?

96
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,435
It wasn't a hallucination.

97
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,803
What? You think the kid...

98
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,967
He's having nightmares.

99
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,570
Nightmares aren't a symptom of anything
other than wanting to sleep with Mommy,

100
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,046
which just leaves us with one
symptom, the bloody <i>tuchus,</i>

101
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,552
which can easily explained by a
GI problem or bleeding disorder.

102
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,680
Check his coags with a
PT, PTT and bleeding time,

103
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:46,090
and prep him for endoscopies
from above and below.

104
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:54,199
I'm gonna make a tiny
nick in your forearm, okay?

105
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,328
Then I'm gonna time how long
it takes for you to stop bleeding.

106
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:02,531
Now, this is gonna sting a little, so
you might wanna look the other way.

107
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,412
Are those windows locked?

108
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,750
Those windows don't even open.
They're just here to let sunshine in.

109
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,052
Good, 'cause they know I'm here.

110
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,184
Clancy, don't bother
the doctor with this stuff.

111
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,661
No, it's okay. How do
they know you're here?

112
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,222
They put a chip in my neck
so they can keep track of me.

113
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,927
I can feel it back there.

114
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,561
Clancy, you know there
is nothing back there.

115
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:31,764
There is.

116
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,807
Let me see. Lean forwards.

117
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:39,009
And they have this other thing, and
they put it in between these two ribs,

118
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,517
always on this side, and then
they move it around my insides.

119
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,710
It hurts.

120
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,844
You know what, Clancy?

121
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,151
I think I might have
found the chip back there,

122
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,521
and I think I might be
able to get it out. Really?

123
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,591
Mmm-hmm.

124
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,931
Okay, lean forwards.

125
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,599
Now hold very still, okay?

126
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,100
Got it.

127
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:12,502
I'm seven, not three. All
you did was pinch my neck.

128
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,715
Sorry.

129
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,252
His alien-abduction
story, the level of detail is...

130
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,984
Well, I don't know
where he gets it from.

131
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,569
The parents say he doesn't watch
sci-fi. He doesn't read comic books...

132
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,153
Great. You do any of that
medical stuff we talked about?

133
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,130
Upper and lower
endoscopies were clean.

134
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,927
So it's a simple
bleeding disorder.

135
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,969
No, blood tests are all normal,
and he clotted in six minutes.

136
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,733
So it's a simple bleeding disorder,
and you screwed up the test.

137
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,798
I didn't screw up the test.

138
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:46,336
So it's a UFO.
Unidentified Flowing Orifice.

139
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:50,440
Either you screwed up the test, or I
screwed up my analysis of this case.

140
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,248
If you screwed up, I don't
have to cry myself to sleep.

141
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,221
It's a simple bleeding
disorder. Foreman, redo the test.

142
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,782
How could I screw up a
simple bleeding-time test?

143
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,988
Maybe you were
abducted, lost time.

144
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,103
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.

145
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,539
Sure?

146
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,100
I had to stop the bleeding
myself after 25 minutes.

147
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,476
So you're saying
Chase did screw up.

148
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,977
Or Foreman screwed up.

149
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,453
Big hand points to minutes.
Maybe you got it mixed up.

150
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,014
Oh, snap. Foreman's
playing the dozens.

151
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,219
You're at a huge cultural
disadvantage here, Chase.

152
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,205
Take a couple of minutes
to think of a witty retort.

153
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,027
So we have contradicting
bleeding-time tests.

154
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,363
If we run labs to check his clotting
factors, we can confirm which one's right.

155
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,925
Yeah, testing. Nice idea.

156
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,597
Way better than trying to guess
which doctor's incompetent.

157
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,470
Looks better in
the paperwork, too.

158
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,705
Hey, Foreman, your mama's
so fat, when her beeper goes off,

159
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,043
people think she's backing up.

160
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,789
Where's Clancy?

161
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,487
He's asleep. He's...

162
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,662
House, Clancy's gone missing.

163
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,165
Oh, no! You take Alpha Centauri,
Foreman can look on Tatooine,

164
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,542
and Cameron can set up
an intergalactic checkpoint.

165
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,976
Let's pray he hasn't gone into
hyperdrive. We'll never catch him.

166
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,190
Clancy?

167
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,361
I had to go where there are no windows
so I could get the chip out like you said.

168
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,589
God.

169
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,031
I can feel it. I
just can't grab it.

170
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,228
Clancy, stop. There is no chip.

171
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,474
We're gonna clean you up, and
we're gonna go back to your room.

172
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,974
You can't do things
like this. Your parents...

173
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,668
Results came back. The
lab cannot identify the metal.

174
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,534
Said it might not
even be terrestrial.

175
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,732
Really?

176
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:31,335
No, you idiot, it's titanium,
like from a surgical pin,

177
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,643
like the kind the kid had inserted
into his broken arm four years ago.

178
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:35,807
Nice medical history.

179
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,441
That pin was
removed six months...

180
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,248
So a little piece broke
off during removal.

181
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,779
Titanium is used to build nuclear
subs. Pieces don't just break off.

182
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,688
Tell that to the
guys on the <i>Kursk.</i>

183
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,024
And how exactly did it get from
his arm to the back of his neck?

184
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,893
Body attacks any foreign object.

185
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,798
Inflammatory reaction could erode it
into a vein. Fragment gets a free ride.

186
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,427
To his lungs
maybe, not his neck.

187
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,439
Yeah, an alien chip
makes more sense.

188
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,511
The real mystery is that
you didn't actually screw up.

189
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,736
You okay?

190
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,748
Fine. Tripped.

191
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,983
Kid carved a hole in
the back of his neck.

192
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,782
Apparently didn't bleed
to death. Now that's weird.

193
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,550
He clotted on his own?

194
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,954
Sure did.

195
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,927
So first there was no bleeding disorder.
Then there was. Now there's not again.

196
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,292
Which is impossible.

197
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,628
Or Foreman screwed up.

198
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,963
Two out of three tests
agree with my findings.

199
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,129
Lucky for us, the fourth
test will be the charm.

200
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,538
So you're just gonna keep
cutting him? Until what?

201
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,277
This test is different.

202
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:44,044
We'll draw some blood, and see if
any clotting factors are low or missing.

203
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,780
But why haven't the other
tests... We've got three results.

204
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:49,084
They haven't been consistent.
One of them must be wrong.

205
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,714
Or two of them.

206
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:56,327
Is it possible the problem isn't
his blood? It's just psychological?

207
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,332
I mean, he almost
killed himself.

208
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,595
He wasn't trying
to hurt himself.

209
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,968
No, he was just looking
for an alien tracking device.

210
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,504
I have time for one more.

211
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,375
Can't blame you for
spending extra time down here.

212
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:17,042
I heard the Artist Formerly
Known as Gimp is back upstairs.

213
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,607
Oh, Dr. Cuddy wants that one.

214
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,676
She's busy. I'll take it.

215
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,720
Oh, my God! You're...

216
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,325
You're okay!

217
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,694
Have we met?

218
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,562
I was one of your doctors.

219
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,000
You were in a vegetative state
when you left here last week.

220
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,037
Addison's disease.

221
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:43,236
All I needed was cortisol, and
my brain turned on like a switch.

222
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,743
This is amazing!

223
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,110
Surprised you didn't know.

224
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,375
How would I know?

225
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,713
Not quite my old self yet.

226
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,877
Baby steps, the
doctors tell me. Now...

227
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,320
With rehab, you'll do great.
What hospital did you go to?

228
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,553
How would I... I wanna
have sex with my wife,

229
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,259
and I was hoping
that maybe you could...

230
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,958
Viagra? You're here for Viagra?

231
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,524
A bucketful would be nice.

232
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,735
Dr. Cuddy.

233
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,837
Hi.

234
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,848
It's completely unethical.

235
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,178
He was reckless with a patient.

236
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,219
He was right. But
he didn't know that.

237
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,220
He needs at least
some glimmer of humility.

238
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,482
Why does he need that?

239
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:33,492
Because other people have that? Why
does he need to be like other people?

240
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,187
He needs to be less reckless.

241
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,729
Well, you did it.

242
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:41,029
He's dismissing symptoms, looking
for easy solutions. He's in pain.

243
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,169
How much pain? Why?

244
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,474
You know this is
affecting him, don't you?

245
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,346
Telling him that he got his last case
right won't do anything to help him.

246
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,691
It'll make him less depressed.
Which might not help his leg.

247
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,684
But you don't know.

248
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,180
Just let me run a PET scan

249
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,382
on his parietal thalamic
area to see if it's sensing pain.

250
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:07,416
If it is, the ketamine isn't working
anymore, and he's headed for a huge crash.

251
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:12,431
If it's not, the leg pain is my
fault, and I will tell him the truth.

252
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,503
Too tight?

253
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,009
My parents think I'm crazy.

254
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,566
No, they don't.

255
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,188
They're just worried
about you. That's all.

256
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,771
I'm not weird.

257
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,113
It's just that weird things
keep happening to me.

258
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,651
Slight pinch.

259
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:39,056
If you make me better, do you
think the aliens will leave me alone?

260
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,856
I don't think they're gonna be
bothering you for much longer.

261
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,055
Are you lying again?

262
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,222
No.

263
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,931
We figure this out,
everything's gonna be okay.

264
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,274
Still with us?

265
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,213
Let's go.

266
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,850
Pulmonary edema,
stage-two hypertensive crisis.

267
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,687
What is happening? Wait outside.

268
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,819
Get him oxygen, and start him on
an IV drip of sodium nitroprusside.

269
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,261
Get them outside!

270
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,130
He's in ICU, systolic
is hovering around 170.

271
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,762
I left instructions to lower it slowly so
we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.

272
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,001
Trade-off being that leaving his
blood pressure that high risks stroke,

273
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,372
MI and blindness.

274
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,138
I'm open to suggestions.

275
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,306
Solve the case. Kidneys could
explain... Kidneys are clean.

276
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,577
Tell me he's a
mutant-human hybrid.

277
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,119
It is a bleeding disorder.

278
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,917
Clancy tested positive
for Von Willebrand's.

279
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,419
I didn't screw up.

280
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,757
How could he clot on his
own two out of three times?

281
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,729
Maybe he cheated. CHASE: Right.

282
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,098
Kids always cheat on
their bleeding-time tests.

283
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,661
She was being metaphorical.
She's trying to sound like me.

284
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,005
I have no idea what you meant, but I
could smell what The Rock was cooking.

285
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,773
I meant, he's clotting right now,
and he's in hypertensive crisis.

286
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,212
Maybe the two are related.

287
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,840
What if he was hypertensive
the other two times that he clotted?

288
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,977
Hypertensive crisis can
activate clotting factors.

289
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:17,217
Even someone low on Von
Willebrand's could theoretically clot.

290
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,656
And the first time Clancy
clotted, he was all worked up

291
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,854
recounting his alien abduction. He
could've easily been hypertensive.

292
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:26,194
I know I get worked up when I cut
microchip tracking implants out of my neck.

293
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,631
Sounds like a cheat to me.

294
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,635
Yeah, we get it.

295
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,103
Okay, what's the differential
for a seven-year-old boy

296
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,766
suffering multiple
hypertensive crises?

297
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,478
We think the problem
is in your son's heart.

298
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:44,175
We need to do a procedure
called a transesophageal echo.

299
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,752
Okay, and that
will fix his heart?

300
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,189
That will tell us where the problem
is, hopefully. Then we can fix him.

301
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,563
Listen, this isn't
really part of my job,

302
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:07,630
but he's worried that
you think he's crazy.

303
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,733
Well, isn't he?

304
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,840
There are still plenty of other
explanations for what's going on.

305
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,185
It's important he knows you
believe in him, even if you don't.

306
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,755
It's clean. His heart
isn't the problem.

307
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:32,428
Why don't I have a high-def in
my office? I'm a department head.

308
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,229
There are no structural
defects. Valves are intact.

309
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:39,898
Tissue characterization is impossible
when the pixels are the size of Legos.

310
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,301
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

311
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,208
Foreman, you gotta
steal this thing for me.

312
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,871
Let me ring up
one of the homies.

313
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,835
The clearer the
image, the clearer it is

314
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:52,009
that there are no
masses, no clots, no tears.

315
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,417
The problem's gotta
be somewhere else.

316
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,020
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

317
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,931
You're wrong, House.

318
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,367
Think he'll make us break into
the IMAX before he admits it?

319
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,064
There. Where?

320
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,604
Right there. Left
side, no movement.

321
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,276
Well, don't freeze it.
Something's not moving.

322
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,179
How do you see something
not move if nothing's moving?

323
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:23,841
I need a laser pointer.

324
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,351
We don't have a laser
pointer. Well, why not?

325
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:30,048
Who's gonna take us seriously
if we don't have a laser pointer?

326
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,784
Right here.

327
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,818
A few thousand myocytes
not beating with the rest.

328
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,195
So you've found an arrhythmia?

329
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,734
That's not an arrhythmia.
That's a no-rhtyhmia.

330
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,464
Myocytes contract.
These aren't moving at all.

331
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:48,372
Go get me those myocytes. I
wanna talk to them in my office.

332
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,142
How's the kid doing?

333
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:58,281
Heart nearly exploded.
Still beating, though.

334
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,949
Most of it, anyway.

335
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,666
Why do they bother putting
age restrictions on these things

336
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,592
when all you have to do
is click, "Yes, I am 18?"

337
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,027
Even a 17-year-old
can figure that out.

338
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,087
What's going on with the leg?

339
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,559
First, tell me what's
going on with the boobs.

340
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,399
If you're feeling
pain... They're firmer.

341
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,530
It's called an underwire.

342
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,435
I wanna get a PET
scan of your brain.

343
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,771
I think it's hormones.

344
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,278
As long as there's no increased
activity in the thalamus...

345
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,247
Looks to me like those puppies
are going into the dairy business.

346
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:34,151
Then the pain can be good. It
could be muscle regenerating.

347
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,187
After you workout, you get sore.
Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.

348
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:40,556
Guess I should be saying, <i>"Mazel
tov."</i> Who gets to pass out the cigars?

349
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,892
I'm not pregnant. I need to
get a PET scan of your brain.

350
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,174
Boy or girl? You got a name
picked out? I'm not pregnant.

351
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,962
My leg doesn't
hurt. You're in denial.

352
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,831
No, I'm not!

353
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,370
Oh, you got me.

354
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,346
If I thought that my
leg was deteriorating,

355
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,315
don't you think I'd want to
take steps to prevent that?

356
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:07,878
Okay.

357
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,590
Gotta go.

358
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,136
Here's Clancy's DNA.

359
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:31,567
And here's the DNA from that
piece of his heart we just biopsied.

360
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,274
That is impossible.

361
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,746
Run it again.

362
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,847
We already did and
once more after that.

363
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,903
The genes from Clancy's
myocytes don't match the genes

364
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,987
from the rest of his body.

365
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,888
Alien DNA.

366
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,367
Anybody watch any <i>X-Files</i>
that inspired an explanation?

367
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:08,169
There are ways DNA can become
mutated. Extreme UV radiation.

368
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:11,479
That much sun, he'd be dying
with a healthy bronze glow.

369
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,985
Nitrous acid or
ethidium-bromide exposure.

370
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,853
First, Daddy was a
rapist. Now he's a chemist.

371
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,447
Various species of fungus
have been proven mutagenic.

372
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:23,121
Not unless the kid's been eating barrels
of celery or living in Indonesia or both.

373
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,839
Is your leg hurting? Is
that question helping?

374
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,074
You're leaning. You're sitting.

375
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,624
You're evading.
My head's hurting.

376
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,333
Please, someone, give me a
plausible, terrestrial explanation

377
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,101
for this kid's alien DNA.

378
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:38,440
We could search his home
for toxins, fungals and radiation.

379
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,446
Who cares what caused
it? A kid comes in with strep,

380
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:45,109
we don't conduct a search to see
which classmate he got it from. We cure it.

381
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,829
We know he's got the stuff inside
him. Let's get a scalpel and cut it out.

382
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,831
Where do we cut? Chances
are, it's not just in his heart.

383
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,120
Well, we got lucky with
the heart. Myocytes contract.

384
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,319
We could see that
these weren't working.

385
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:57,693
I don't know how the hell we're
gonna find it anywhere else.

386
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:03,926
What if we take the heart cells
with the bad DNA, and we tag them?

387
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,604
Can you phrase that in
the form of a metaphor?

388
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,642
It's the same way
we search for cancer.

389
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,974
The bad DNA creates a unique protein
on the surface of the affected cells.

390
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,674
We create an antibody that
recognizes only that protein,

391
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,582
we flush it throughout his
system, and the similar cells light up

392
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,176
like light bulbs.

393
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,453
Okay, let's do that.

394
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:37,526
You have to tell him.

395
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,803
He said he wasn't in any pain.

396
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,068
He's lying. Of
course he's lying.

397
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,435
We need another plan.

398
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:43,942
Don't talk about it that way.

399
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,136
What way?

400
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,735
"Plan."

401
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:49,372
It sounds like we're conspiring
against him. I'm gonna tell him.

402
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:53,283
No, you're not. Then come
up with a cunning plan and fast.

403
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,989
She's not nearly as
delightful as she thinks she is.

404
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,263
What's this machine do?

405
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,962
Makes a lot of noise,

406
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,599
and it's gonna help us figure
out what's wrong with you.

407
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,799
You think House has lost a step?

408
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,736
He's fine.

409
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:19,403
There. Clump of affected cells
in the bone marrow of the femur.

410
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,208
Explains the
intermittent-bleeding disorder.

411
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,876
'Cause I don't need to subject myself
to House's torture if there's no upside.

412
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,044
I'm telling you, he's fine.

413
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,983
We missed some
affected cells in his heart.

414
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,356
Explains the continuing
hypertensive issues.

415
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,191
You said the last case really
threw him, and now suddenly...

416
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,389
I was wrong.

417
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,730
So you changed your mind. Why?

418
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,527
His brilliant ideas on this
case have all been yours.

419
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,331
There's the reason for
him needing glasses.

420
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:52,138
Apparently, it's a symptom. It
means the condition predates...

421
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:55,943
You don't change your mind without
a reason. Now, what do you know?

422
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:03,218
House didn't blow the last case.

423
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,421
Cuddy cured the guy
using House's idea.

424
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,696
Cuddy and Wilson are trying
to teach him some humility.

425
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,594
Scan is complete. Three hot
spots, but nothing in his brain.

426
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:22,232
House's original theory was
right. It is not neurological.

427
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,776
<i>Is he going to be able to walk?</i>

428
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,813
<i>His leg should be
functional after some rehab.</i>

429
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,808
"Functional"? What
does that mean?

430
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:34,149
He'll be able to walk, but
not run? He'll have a limp?

431
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,711
If everything goes
well, he'll walk. He'll run.

432
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,348
He'll probably be even
stronger than he is now.

433
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,827
<i>When we close him up, we'll
move over to his other leg,</i>

434
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:47,492
<i>snake a catheter up through the
femoral artery and into his heart.</i>

435
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,165
<i>Once the affected
areas are removed,</i>

436
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,034
his normal tissue will
step back in, do its job.

437
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,939
He should have no more
problems with his blood pressure.

438
00:27:56,008 --> 00:28:00,275
After confirming those areas are
clear, we'll start the final procedure.

439
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,280
<i>We're gonna insert a
needle through the pupil</i>

440
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,078
<i>and get rid of the
abnormal cells in the retina.</i>

441
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,724
Close your right eye.
Can you see my face?

442
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,754
Yeah, it's clear.

443
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,767
You can throw away
your glasses. We got it all.

444
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,929
Get some sleep. You're
going home tomorrow.

445
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,571
Thank you.

446
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,354
Do you wanna go for a run?

447
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,385
What do you want?

448
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,789
I want you to run.

449
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,858
When did you become an enabler?

450
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,925
I'm enabling you to exercise.

451
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:59,494
Vicodin blocks the pain,
you get through your rehab,

452
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,699
muscle strength increases,
and pain decreases.

453
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:05,938
I'd rather not become dependent
on pain pills to get through my day.

454
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,614
You're just like
any other patient,

455
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,675
running away from knowledge
that won't make you happy.

456
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,721
I'm as happy as a pig in poop.

457
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,416
You're scared the ketamine
treatment's wearing off,

458
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,790
that it was just a torturous
window to the good life.

459
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,295
What part of "poop"
didn't you understand?

460
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:27,265
How can you be so sure
it isn't just a sore muscle?

461
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,461
It's my leg. We've known
each other a long time.

462
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:38,503
You're not always right,
House. You've proven that lately.

463
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,353
What's happening to him?

464
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,743
He's seizing. I need clonazepam.

465
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,441
I thought you got it all. Yeah,
yell at me. That'll fix your kid.

466
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,552
Obviously, we missed some foreign
tissue. There's something still in him.

467
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:34,753
The hallucinations and seizures
indicate problems in the temporal lobe.

468
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:38,786
Sorry, House, it is neurological.
Looks like you're wrong again.

469
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:42,426
We didn't miss anything. Brain
scan was completely clean.

470
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,903
Our tag must not have
penetrated the blood-brain barrier.

471
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:55,004
Don't use an IV this time.
Get it right into the brain.

472
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:09,652
No cells are lighting up. His
brain is clean. It is not neurological.

473
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:15,028
His symptoms are neurological.
His condition has to be neurological.

474
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,037
His scan was clean
twice. It's not there.

475
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,536
What if it is there, but
didn't show up on the scan?

476
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,044
What if the tag just
doesn't work in his brain?

477
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:30,742
Brain cells are structurally
different, express a different protein.

478
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,876
So how do we find it?

479
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,750
Where are we going?

480
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,850
I am going to think.

481
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,121
Send the kid home.

482
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,257
What do you mean?

483
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,895
Make sure his blood pressure's
stabilized, and send him home.

484
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,905
What, like nothing
ever happened?

485
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:29,134
We cured his bleeding disorder,

486
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:32,240
removed all the damaged
cells we could find.

487
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,905
We don't know that we fixed
anything. It's only been a day.

488
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,540
Maybe these symptoms come
and go like the blood disorder.

489
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:40,108
It's more probable that
his remaining symptoms are

490
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,884
just a nightmare.

491
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,354
He had a convulsion.

492
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:48,154
May be epilepsy. May be
psychological. May be nothing.

493
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,230
If the kid gets sick again,
it'll give us another clue.

494
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:55,392
We can start searching again.
If he doesn't, doesn't matter.

495
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,192
Send him home.

496
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:06,738
House.

497
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,550
You're just giving
up on this kid?

498
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,616
You gotta know when to stop.

499
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,350
You don't stop. You never stop.

500
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:22,292
You just keep on going until you
come up with something so insane

501
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,623
that it's usually right.

502
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:25,960
Except on my last case.

503
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:30,694
Don't be pathetic. Just
forget the last case.

504
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:34,467
This kid obviously has
something wrong with him.

505
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:39,302
When did you develop such
strong opinions about my patients?

506
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,505
Last week, you were
convinced my patient wasn't sick.

507
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,980
Now you're
convinced this one is.

508
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:46,780
This one is a young boy.
His parents are desperate.

509
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:51,118
Just get together with your
team, spend a few extra hours...

510
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,591
Well, I guess we could amputate his
left leg. That's where we found most of it.

511
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,992
Maybe we should just remove
his affected eye completely.

512
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,759
If you have reason to
believe that that might help...

513
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,665
I'm not gonna start
lopping off body parts,

514
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:06,270
but it's interesting that
you give me the green light.

515
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,671
I just want you to do something.

516
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,201
You've been overly
supportive this entire week.

517
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:16,106
Either you're hormonal,
or you're guilt-ridden,

518
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,541
and it's too early in the
pregnancy for this to be hormonal.

519
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,712
I'm not pregnant. Then
what did you do wrong?

520
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:34,123
He had Addison's. Your
last patient. You were right.

521
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:40,534
I gave him one shot of cortisol
and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.

522
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:49,072
Oh, your mommy is in such
trouble. She's such a liar.

523
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,512
That's why you don't have a
daddy. That's why she had to...

524
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:06,129
How does one person end up
with two different sets of DNA?

525
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:07,691
We've been through this.

526
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,701
Our assumptions are faulty.

527
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,738
We've confirmed two different sets
of DNA. We re-ran the sequence.

528
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:16,468
I didn't say the lab work was faulty.
I said our assumptions were faulty.

529
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,510
We assumed he's a person.

530
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:22,672
Of course. The aliens didn't
just visit him. They replaced him.

531
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:27,208
You're being silly. What if he's not
a person? What if he's two persons?

532
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,516
I'm not getting the
metaphor. No metaphor.

533
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,989
Chase, you said the mom
used in vitro fertilization, right?

534
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,378
Yeah, they had
trouble conceiving.

535
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,019
Kid was right all along.

536
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:39,189
He was implanted with something,
back when he was young.

537
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,699
I mean really young,
like 12-cells young.

538
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,497
In vitro increases the
likelihood of twinning.

539
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,764
But he doesn't have a twin.

540
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,772
Not walking around.

541
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,707
But in vitro fertilization
costs around 25 grand a pop,

542
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:54,143
so doctors implant two to six embryos
to make sure you get your money's worth.

543
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,910
<i>Problem is, there's not always
enough bedrooms for all the kiddies.</i>

544
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,178
<i>Two brothers get stuck
sharing. There's no bunk beds,</i>

545
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,483
<i>so they cuddle up to keep
warm, and they never untangle.</i>

546
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,685
He's two people in one.

547
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,289
It's called chimerism.

548
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:16,460
Unfortunately, his brother's
like a bad doubles partner.

549
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,302
The guy just takes up
space, gets in the way.

550
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,704
Clancy's body thinks that he's
gonna put away the easy winners.

551
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,869
His brother just keeps
swatting balls into the net.

552
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,136
We gotta get him off the court.

553
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:33,748
So does that mean that you can
find the bad cells in his brain or not?

554
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,379
Sure, abandon
the metaphor. Fine.

555
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:43,192
Clancy thinks differently than
his brother because he thinks.

556
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,196
If we induce an
alien abduction...

557
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,874
Wait. What the hell
are you talking about?

558
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,834
The foreign DNA has got to be
in a portion of your son's brain

559
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:52,097
that makes him believe
that he's being abducted.

560
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,639
If we stimulate those
neurons with an electric probe,

561
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,403
we can trick your son's
brain into hallucinating.

562
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:02,175
Your son's neurons will light up,
and his brother's cells will remain dark.

563
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,138
Those are the ones we cut out.

564
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,741
You're talking
about brain surgery.

565
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:11,552
I'm talking about really cool brain
surgery. One of your sons will die,

566
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,821
but the taller one won't
be so annoying anymore.

567
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,760
So I have a twin?

568
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,321
Not really. What's on the card?

569
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:21,559
A light bulb.

570
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,431
Start us out at 10.

571
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,467
I'm not doing that.

572
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,238
That was all me, kid. Sorry.

573
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,179
You're in motor function.
Try two centimeters back.

574
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,014
He lives inside me?

575
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,209
Sort of.

576
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:44,049
That tickles. Stop
tickling my feet.

577
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,182
You're in sensory.
You're getting closer.

578
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,384
What do you see on this one?

579
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,188
Moon and stars.

580
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:54,261
So I am kind of weird?

581
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,166
We're all kind of weird.

582
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,833
No!

583
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,032
Clancy? We got something.

584
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,043
What do you see? The light.

585
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,841
Here they come, I think.

586
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:12,145
Brain waves indicate a mild
hallucination. Neurons are lighting up.

587
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:14,311
Any dark spots?
Area's too fuzzy.

588
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,013
Hallucination isn't
strong enough.

589
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,749
Turn up the juice.

590
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:22,451
His blood pressure's already
160 over 110. Any higher...

591
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,794
Riding the short bus is better
than not breathing. Take us to 100.

592
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,468
Area's still too fuzzy to
make any kind of distinction.

593
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,508
Crank it up higher.
You've already exceeded

594
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,942
the preset maximum.
Next step's brain damage.

595
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:51,746
They're gonna get you.
They're coming through the walls.

596
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:56,261
They're gonna take you, torture you.
You'll never see your parents again.

597
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:22,145
Clancy? Can you hear me?

598
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,483
Clancy?

599
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:31,554
You got them.

600
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:35,660
Yep.

601
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,867
We got them all.

602
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,803
Close him up.

603
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,364
Everything's gonna
be normal again.

604
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:58,350
You believe what
Cuddy tried to pull?

605
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:00,555
What now?

606
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,389
She lied to me.

607
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,124
She cured my patient with my
diagnosis, then lied to me about it.

608
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,793
That doesn't sound like her.

609
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:09,493
You're right.

610
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,966
Does sound like you, though.

611
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,440
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?

612
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,208
Nothing that your body
language isn't telling me right now.

613
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,610
So what was the plan?

614
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:34,790
I'd feel so humbled by missing a
case that I'd reevaluate my entire life,

615
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,352
question the nature of truth and
goodness and become Cameron?

616
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:42,560
Something like that. More
that if we told you the truth,

617
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:47,628
that you solved a case based
on absolutely no medical proof,

618
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,697
you'd think you were God.

619
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:54,207
And I was worried
your wings would melt.

620
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,477
God doesn't limp.
