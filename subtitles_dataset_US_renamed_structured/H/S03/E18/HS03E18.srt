1
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,282
Fran? I'm Robin.

2
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,690
Please come in.

3
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,157
Cute home. Two
bedroom, one bath?

4
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,257
Yeah.

5
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,467
A guy I know collects those. Says
they're worth a fortune on the internet.

6
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,634
Yeah.

7
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:45,742
You've never used our
agency before, have you?

8
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,542
Is it that obvious?

9
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,284
As you can see, we offer
a full range of services.

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,920
"Round the World"?
Our deluxe package.

11
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,932
Offers all the
services of A, B, and C.

12
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,102
How much? $1,000.

13
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,438
And satisfaction is
guaranteed. Twice.

14
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,237
I'll get the money.
I'll get ready.

15
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,783
Harrington?

16
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:38,662
Harrington, what are
you doing up there?

17
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,002
All right, now don't take this
personally but you're gonna have to go...

18
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,163
Fran.

19
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,072
Is this okay?

20
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,281
Fran.

21
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,819
Fran, you all right?

22
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,497
Oh, God.

23
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,966
Fran?

24
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,031
Yeah, I need an ambulance
at 500 North Sycamore.

25
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,035
I don't know, my
friend collapsed.

26
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,908
And what were you
doing when you fainted?

27
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,169
We were just...
Looking for her cat.

28
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,092
And have you banged
your head recently?

29
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,140
No.

30
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,118
Is this a motion sickness patch?

31
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,683
I must have forgotten to take
it off. I just got back from a trip.

32
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,995
Scopolamine can cause
dizziness and blurred vision.

33
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,831
You probably hit your head when
you fell, and that caused the blackout.

34
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,680
I thought those patches were
supposed to prevent you from getting sick.

35
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,229
Every drug has a side effect.

36
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,950
But it might be a good
idea to keep your eye on her

37
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,273
for the next few hours
to make sure she's okay.

38
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,504
Actually...

39
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,046
She has to get back to work.

40
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:08,972
Is it important?

41
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,577
We just don't like people to
be alone after they leave here.

42
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,651
I'm fine. Really.

43
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,185
I'm... Fran?

44
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,886
Fran?

45
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:23,862
I got a seizure. Code cart.

46
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,057
What's wrong with her?

47
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,566
I have no idea.

48
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,330
Where's House?

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,002
I want my blankie! I want
my blankie! I want my blankie!

50
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:37,442
Antique vintner's
cane. Cost me $900.

51
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,036
It had a corkscrew in it.

52
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,104
That would explain
the vintner's reference.

53
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,480
It could be used as a
weapon against the pilot.

54
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,348
Only if he's stuck in
a bottle of zinfandel.

55
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,284
You'll get it back when we land.

56
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,619
I want my blankie!
I want my blankie!

57
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,420
Give her 20 milligrams of
antihistamine. Could save her life.

58
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,103
'Cause if she doesn't
shut up I'll kill her.

59
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,596
Delivering goodwill to
yet another continent.

60
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,928
You only forced me to
deliver a speech, not goodwill.

61
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,798
You gave a three-minute speech.

62
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,394
You know how much WHO
accreditation means to the hospital?

63
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,311
Well, it may have been
short, but it had girth.

64
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,332
And the room service
thing was just spiteful.

65
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,810
I was hungry. $300
for a bottle of wine.

66
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,278
I was thirsty.

67
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,611
$120 on video services.

68
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,945
I was lonely.

69
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,714
That's 500 in
expenses I can't justify.

70
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,652
Don't worry. I'll
take care of it.

71
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,916
Right.

72
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,123
Here you are, sir.
You're welcome.

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,556
Welcome aboard, Mr. House.

74
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,359
You're right here in 2-A.

75
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,565
Ms. Cuddy you're in the
next cabin and to the left, 9-C.

76
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,662
No, I booked two
first-class tickets.

77
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,764
This must be a
mistake. No mistake.

78
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,073
I just arranged for a
$500 fare reduction.

79
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,772
Expense problem solved.

80
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,512
Where did you travel? Duluth.

81
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,990
To visit my sister. Really?

82
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,583
Is this her artwork?

83
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,498
"Fire butt"?

84
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,232
I was a little drunk.

85
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,236
Where were you a little drunk?

86
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,809
I turned 58 last March.

87
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,313
Same age my mother
was when she died.

88
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,749
Next week I packed
a bag, I went to JFK,

89
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:28,152
looked at the big board, took the
first plane that went to a warm place.

90
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,086
Caracas. Oh, my God.

91
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,490
Did you drink the
water? Eat salads?

92
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,426
Any raw foods. Yup.

93
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,086
And?

94
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:46,801
I also did mescal shooters and snorted
cocaine from a homosexual man's stomach.

95
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,578
Did you have sex? No.

96
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,647
Not with him. I had
sex with El Gordo.

97
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,611
He was a large man.

98
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:01,848
Oh, my God.

99
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,290
I never do things like that.

100
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:12,063
I should have gone to
visit my sister. It was stupid.

101
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,968
That's why I'm sick, isn't it?

102
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,063
It's possible.

103
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,647
Here you are. Rib
eye, medium rare.

104
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,878
Thank you.

105
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,682
Some more Pinot Grigio?

106
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,689
No. I think I will
switch to the Syrah.

107
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,100
Sir, are you all right?

108
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,436
He's drunk.

109
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:07,946
See?

110
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,986
Does anyone speak Korean?

111
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,155
Is anyone a doctor?

112
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:18,923
Yes.

113
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,667
I'll go get her.

114
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,949
What do you want?

115
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,689
Do you really think I was gonna
leave you stuck back here for 18 hours?

116
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:49,786
Go on, enjoy.

117
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,833
With the Vicodin and the
wine I could sleep anywhere.

118
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,671
Thank you.

119
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,358
We should put her back
on the scopolamine patch.

120
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,934
She can't wear motion sickness
patches for the rest of her life.

121
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:13,681
No, but if it does relive her
symptoms it'll narrow down our search.

122
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,248
Anything else you two
guys wanna agree on?

123
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,722
You have a problem
with us agreeing?

124
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,869
No, I have a problem with
the other thing you're doing,

125
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,737
which makes me question
your motive for agreeing.

126
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,525
I'll put her back on
the patch. What else?

127
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,258
It's gotta be
something neurological.

128
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,197
We should do a CT,
look for a brain tumor.

129
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,111
Could also be an allergy
or something environmental.

130
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,135
We should check her home.

131
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,672
Bit more likely she got sick in
Caracas than in New Jersey.

132
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,140
Right, I forgot. There
are no toxins in the US.

133
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,404
I think I'm starting to
feel sorry for House.

134
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,777
Get a tox screen, chem-20,
STD panel, blood cultures.

135
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,316
Then you run a CT and
you check her house.

136
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,146
Please.

137
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,251
Not funny.

138
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,692
Wasn't supposed
to be funny ha-ha.

139
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,961
Fever, headache,
severe abdominal pain,

140
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,296
and a rash all
over his lower back.

141
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,358
It's serious. Maybe contagious.

142
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,165
We just attended a
symposium on pandemics

143
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,983
and you run right into
one on the flight home.

144
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,031
Talk about a small world.

145
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,133
If it's meningococcus,

146
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,206
half the passengers
on this plane could get

147
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,204
infected and die before
we reach New York.

148
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,908
Is someone sick? No.

149
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,948
Someone has a hangover.

150
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,817
He had a snootload of
Bloody Marys before dinner.

151
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,881
Watch the movie.

152
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,489
That booze did not give him the
rash. It is textbook meningococcus.

153
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,363
It's also textbook
allergic reaction to pollen,

154
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,893
peanuts, and the semen-stained
polyester blanket he's lying on.

155
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,099
Mr. Peng's throwing up again.

156
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,607
We have to turn around.

157
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,637
What? Why do we have to...

158
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,508
We don't. You misunderstood.

159
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,173
Dr. Cuddy just meant that
he might feel less nauseous

160
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,978
if he was facing in
a different direction.

161
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,018
She didn't mean to panic
a planeload of people.

162
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,077
We're about to head
over the North Pole.

163
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,056
We don't turn back now,
the next ER's 15 hours away.

164
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,217
He'll be fine.
I'm a doctor, too.

165
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,385
You haven't examined him.

166
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,692
Korean male, mid
30s, 5'9", 160, bald,

167
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,858
scar on the right side of his jaw,
medic alert bracelet on his left wrist

168
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,402
indicating that he's
allergic to, at least, penicillin.

169
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,667
Without any way to do an
LP or rule out meningococcus,

170
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,469
our only choice is
to assume the worst.

171
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,736
Good point.

172
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,870
On the other hand, I am a board-certified
specialist in infectious disease.

173
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,641
She assigns parking spaces.

174
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,252
Please let me know
if he gets any worse.

175
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,199
Think we should feed the cat?

176
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,331
Bowl's full.

177
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,971
If he wants it, he can
get it. Cadmium yellow?

178
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,741
Heavy metal poisoning would
explain the ataxia and the seizures.

179
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,009
Not unless she was
painting with her tongue.

180
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,642
Was Foreman right?

181
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,915
Did you agree with me
because of our relationship?

182
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,248
"Relationship"? You
know what I mean.

183
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,316
You mean because of
our lack of a relationship.

184
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,719
I mean, because
we're having sex.

185
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,593
Yes. Foreman's right.

186
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,875
I thought you were completely
wrong about the medicine,

187
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,162
but agreed with you anyway

188
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,500
because I figured then you'd
do me in some old lady's home.

189
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,937
Then well played.

190
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,140
Come on, we're supposed
to be looking for toxins.

191
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,180
We agreed it was a
brain tumor. What?

192
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,449
He's watching.

193
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,181
Haven't you had
anybody watch before?

194
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,273
Is that guy really sick? No.

195
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,641
He's all better. I
don't believe you.

196
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,349
Look that way. Why?

197
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,944
Because you're gonna throw
up and I don't want it on me.

198
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,957
I'll get some towels.

199
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:25,569
Give her a banana. Monkey see,
monkey barf. You smell vomit...

200
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,772
Okay. Wasn't expecting that.

201
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,922
I need help.

202
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,514
Who doesn't?

203
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,853
I need someone to talk to.

204
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,599
Can you say, "Crikey, mate"?

205
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,761
Crikey, mate. Perfect.

206
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,468
Now no matter what I say,
you agree with me, okay?

207
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,974
Okay. Nicely done.

208
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,009
And you disagree
with everything I say.

209
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,173
Sorry. Not understanding.

210
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,715
That's close enough.

211
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,843
And you get morally
outraged at everything I say.

212
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,047
That's a permanent
marker, you know.

213
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,683
Wow.

214
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,452
You guys are good.

215
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:23,190
We are looking for the simplest
way to explain these symptoms.

216
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,327
Organophosphate poisoning. Some
international flights spray pesticides.

217
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,433
Could be.

218
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,134
Sorry, English not so nice.

219
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,904
Is this a joke?

220
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,467
Just passed the halfway mark.

221
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,103
Can't turn around. Nice call.

222
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,340
No worries.

223
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,939
We think it's
pesticide poisoning.

224
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,449
We don't spray these flights.

225
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:45,644
Dramamine overdose.

226
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,929
Wouldn't explain the fever.

227
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,081
Jet lag. Wouldn't explain
the abdominal pain.

228
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,420
Deep vein thrombosis.
Wouldn't explain the nausea.

229
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,119
Food poisoning. What
was on the menu?

230
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:57,459
Steak and sea bass in First Class.
Fettuccine and seafood kebabs in Economy.

231
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,726
Since when does food
poisoning cause a rash?

232
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,826
Sea bass, seafood kebabs?
He had the sea bass.

233
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,064
Please tell me she
had the kebabs.

234
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,970
I think so.

235
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,337
Ciguatera poisoning.

236
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,967
It's an instant-onset toxin.

237
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,638
Symptoms include...
E. All of the above.

238
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:17,241
It's only found in certain kinds
of tropical game fish such as...

239
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,983
Sea bass?

240
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,576
Make sure you get
a resume from him.

241
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,683
<i>Hello?</i> Excuse me.

242
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,697
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief
announcement concerning your meals.</i>

243
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,393
<i>If you ate the sea bass
or the seafood kebabs,</i>

244
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,163
<i>you have ingested
a dangerous toxin.</i>

245
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,501
<i>However, if you proceed to the
restrooms both on your left and right</i>

246
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,041
<i>at the rear of the plane and
vomit as soon as possible,</i>

247
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,600
<i>the toxic effect should
be minimal.</i> What?

248
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,512
<i>Thank you, and
have a pleasant flight.</i>

249
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,845
Meningococcus makes
just as much sense.

250
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,116
I know.

251
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,961
What did you find?

252
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,003
Nothing in her house.
Big waste of time.

253
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,162
Medically.

254
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,933
CT was a complete waste.

255
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,445
She was negative for tumors,
her blood was negative for drugs,

256
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,139
heavy metals, tropical diseases,
food poisoning, and STDs.

257
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,443
Also no sign of lead
poisoning or sepsis.

258
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,951
Apparently Venezuelan tattoo
parlors have standards after all.

259
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,645
Good to know.

260
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,510
We sure she's even sick?

261
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,352
Two more seizures
in the last two hours.

262
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:34,417
Which is slower than she was having
them before you put the patch back on.

263
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:41,333
I'm an idiot. She's exposed herself to so
much crap I just assumed it was a zebra.

264
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,533
It's breast cancer.

265
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:46,539
Since when is breast cancer
treatable by motion sickness meds?

266
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:50,008
It's not. But the inflammation caused
by the paraneoplastic syndrome

267
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,638
caused by the cancer can
be reduced by anticholinergics.

268
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,912
Hey, here you go.

269
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,252
Is he gonna die?

270
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,489
We're doing all we can. We don't
know what's wrong with him yet.

271
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,825
Am I gonna die?

272
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,024
No.

273
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,062
Here, chew on these.

274
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,943
Good news is all the
pilots are red meat men.

275
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,709
Although I was kind of looking
forward to landing this puppy myself.

276
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,441
Peng's getting worse.

277
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,779
That makes sense.

278
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,320
First Class ate before Coach.

279
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,447
He digested more of his
food before he threw up.

280
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,118
Or you're wrong and we're gonna
start seeing neurological symptoms soon.

281
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,627
Seizures, paralysis, ataxia.

282
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,458
We're not gonna see ataxia.

283
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,797
You're so sure you're right. No.

284
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:53,203
It's just hard to show clumsiness when
you're lying moaning in a fetal position.

285
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,403
Hey, stand up.

286
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,674
Does nobody speak
Korean on this flight?

287
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,876
I assumed you did.

288
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,977
I know how to ask him
if his sister's over 18,

289
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,230
I just don't think
that's gonna help.

290
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,816
Hey, stand up. Stand up.

291
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,623
Don't play the
cripple card with me.

292
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,748
Oh, hi. I'm leaving.

293
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Work.

294
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,281
Okay.

295
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,415
Important client. Sure.

296
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,261
Listen.

297
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,204
Are you close?

298
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,431
Why?

299
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,370
She needs a mammogram.

300
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,874
Oh, God.

301
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:11,547
I know I'm throwing a lot at you.
She just has no family in town.

302
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,218
And I really think she
could use a friend right now.

303
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,097
Okay. Put your hand here.

304
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,740
You don't have to stay.

305
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,274
No, it's no problem.

306
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,437
But why?

307
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,414
You don't even know me.

308
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,274
You gotta be scared.

309
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,717
I almost hope it's
breast cancer. No.

310
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,258
Then it wouldn't be my fault.

311
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,486
Whatever it is,
it's not your fault.

312
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,629
That's not true. You
can control things.

313
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,757
Not everything.

314
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,429
But you don't have to take
stupid risks. I was being an idiot.

315
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,994
You were having fun.

316
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,142
You have regrets?

317
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,207
Yeah.

318
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,475
<i>Robin?</i>

319
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,620
Hold still.

320
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,857
Good.

321
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:40,128
Okay, we're gonna get just one
more. I'm sorry, I know it hurts.

322
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,697
It's not that.

323
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:46,209
It's my eye. My right eye.

324
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,146
I can't see.

325
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,881
It's definitely ataxia.
And it's definitely a rash.

326
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,682
You gonna look at it
for five more minutes

327
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:58,584
before concluding it's
also definitely a leg?

328
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,716
Thin leg.

329
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,283
It's been in a cast. So?

330
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,704
So it could be
radiation poisoning.

331
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,889
From a broken leg?

332
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,295
From the x-rays they took of it.

333
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,804
He could break
every bone in his body

334
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,177
and still not have enough
x-rays to cause radiation sickness.

335
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,638
Unless those x-rays were
performed in Wankoff, North Korea,

336
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,300
by a third-grade dropout
with a 50-year-old imager.

337
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,172
Which accounts for
the absence of fur.

338
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,405
Radiation poisoning
accounts for all his symptoms.

339
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:23,176
I have hair. I haven't had an
x-ray since I got my teeth whitened.

340
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,808
You're pregnant.

341
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:25,943
I'm what?

342
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:29,044
Explains the nausea,
abdominal pains, fever,

343
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,523
and why you're stuffing
your 36Cs into a 34B bra.

344
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,786
And her rash?

345
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,851
PUPPPs. Common pregnancy rash.

346
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:36,952
I can't be pregnant.

347
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,258
You a virgin?

348
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,354
No, but...

349
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,024
You're pregnant. Mazel tov.

350
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,234
Let's get him into the chair.

351
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,434
Two different diagnoses.

352
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,303
I thought you didn't
believe in coincidences.

353
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,070
I believe in statistics.

354
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:54,311
Two hundred passengers on
the plane, 10 should be gay,

355
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:58,011
two should be with child, and
one should be incredibly annoying

356
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,018
with an extra ass
chromosome. House.

357
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,317
Get him some iodized salt to
protect his thyroid. I'm going back...

358
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,516
House.

359
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,650
You're wrong.

360
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,149
I said we should have turned back.
You should have listened to me.

361
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,980
Now we're eight
miles over the Arctic...

362
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,885
I'm trying to listen to
you now, so shut up.

363
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,091
Heart's fine.

364
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,951
Breasts are firm.

365
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,222
Is it contagious?

366
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,196
A lot of the
passengers are scared.

367
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,575
Tell them there's
nothing to worry about.

368
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,398
Is there something
to worry about? Yeah.

369
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:55,030
Tell them there's nothing to worry
about. And get me a flashlight.

370
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,079
Cover your left eye with this.

371
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,825
Photophobia.

372
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,987
Symptom of meningitis.
We need antibiotics.

373
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,421
I'll call down to the pharmacy.

374
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,731
You're creeping me out.

375
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,031
Then get me a lab.

376
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,071
Pseudomonas smell
yeasty, staph smells musty,

377
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,239
and some liver disease
smell of ammonia.

378
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,946
House. I'm not in heat.

379
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,140
Citrus-y on the nose with
a blush of toasted coconut.

380
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,762
I need to get a better
look at your rash.

381
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,163
Use your imagination.

382
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:58,136
Fine, should I go with Lifeguard
Cuddy or Mother Superior Cuddy?

383
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,263
Three more passengers are sick.

384
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:04,370
If we don't get drugs, we're gonna
have a lot of dead passengers.

385
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:15,312
Blindness in her right eye
indicates it's not breast cancer.

386
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,514
It's likely neurological.

387
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,386
I just met her today.

388
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,293
You should go.

389
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,895
She needs someone here.

390
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,736
That's not your job.

391
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,231
Please let me know
that she's okay.

392
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:07,835
It's just sex.

393
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,238
There's no such thing.

394
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,742
Other eye.

395
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,490
Are you saying women can't separate
the physical from the emotional?

396
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,674
No one does it well,
women do it worse.

397
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,027
You just want us to stop
because you think it's affecting...

398
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,576
Me. Yeah.

399
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,317
Polyspikes are over 01 and 02.

400
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,950
That's her left eye.

401
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:29,185
Burst suppression on every lead.

402
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:33,657
Fran?

403
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,935
She's comatose.

404
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:45,175
Nothing. Nothing.

405
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:46,878
Nothing.

406
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,677
Come on, nobody has no meds!

407
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,046
Excuse me. Open your mouth.

408
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:58,555
Where's the acyclovir?

409
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,024
I'm not on any meds.

410
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:03,324
Well, you better get
some. You've got herpes.

411
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:16,635
What do you know? He's got
some. This must be your lucky day.

412
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,502
This is for real.
People are sick.

413
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,648
Some of us will be deplaning in
body bags unless you cough up.

414
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,913
Here. Over here.
Thank you. Thank you.

415
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,381
Thank you.

416
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,487
God bless you.

417
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,694
Her brain is shutting down
because of intracranial pressure.

418
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,957
Or her nerves are dying.

419
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,464
Because of the
increased pressure.

420
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,642
She has a bleed in her brain.

421
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:41,861
You said the CT showed...

422
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,927
No tumors. But if she has an AVM
leading to a cerebral hemorrhage,

423
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,248
we could've missed it. She
needs a burr hole to relieve...

424
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:51,403
You wanna drill into her brain because
of an invisible bleed the CT couldn't see?

425
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,946
We should do an LP to confirm
the presence of red blood cells.

426
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,447
And her brain herniates
and then she dies.

427
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,507
Right. Better to
kill her in the OR.

428
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,813
Chase, what do you think?

429
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,376
Here's a cliffhanger.

430
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:07,459
I think it would help to know what she
has before we start digging into her brain.

431
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,395
Might be better to play
it safe to start. Do an LP.

432
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,135
Sex better be damn good.

433
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,970
Lot of apples, not
many candy bars.

434
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,445
Any antibiotics?

435
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,975
Three caps of Augmentin.

436
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,278
For six patients.

437
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,612
Give them to Peng.

438
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,155
He's allergic to penicillin.

439
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,316
The First Aid kit
has two epi pens.

440
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,917
If he has a severe reaction,
10 epi pens won't save him.

441
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,225
You take the pills. He's worse.

442
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,736
He's a guy who
doesn't speak English.

443
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,095
Give him the meds.

444
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,830
If it's not meningitis, we're risking his
life and flushing meds down the toilet.

445
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:54,340
Then do an LP on
him. If it's clear, you win.

446
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:59,140
If it's cloudy he gets the
Augmentin. And we risk a reaction.

447
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,738
Sounds like a plan. All except for the
part where we don't have an LP needle.

448
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:07,217
And the shaking of the plane means
I'll probably pierce his spinal cord

449
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:11,280
and cripple him for life. But, I
mean, it totally sounds like a plan.

450
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:17,292
You're right. Let him
die. Give me the meds.

451
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:41,070
Got it. Damn.

452
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,742
What is it?

453
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,909
Shut up. Don't get hysterical.

454
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,215
Just tell me
what the hell it is.

455
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,416
House. We should
have turned back.

456
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,721
We should have turned back.

457
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,427
House.

458
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,566
Hold this.

459
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,005
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

460
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:16,071
<i>we have a passenger with a
confirmed case of bacterial meningitis.</i>

461
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,512
<i>Unless we land as soon as possible,
the passenger will not survive.</i>

462
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,887
<i>It's very likely that some of
you have been infected as well.</i>

463
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:28,950
<i>As soon as you start feeling symptoms, we
need to isolate you in First Class cabin.</i>

464
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,929
<i>Fever, rash, nausea,</i>

465
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:36,594
<i>and in the late stages
tremor in the left hand.</i>

466
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:41,831
I've got that. Oh, God.

467
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,840
- What do we do?
- It's really bad.

468
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,439
Break out the bubbly.

469
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,617
Yo, listen up.

470
00:30:55,287 --> 00:31:00,316
<i>The bad news is, you have an illness.
The good news is it's not meningitis.</i>

471
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:04,695
<i>It's not fatal, it's
just embarrassing.</i>

472
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:08,291
<i>It's conversion disorder, more
commonly known as mass hysteria.</i>

473
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:13,132
<i>It happens often in high-anxiety
situations, especially to women.</i>

474
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:17,438
<i>I know it sounds sexist, but science
says you're weak and soft. What can I do?</i>

475
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,501
House, you're wrong.

476
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:20,910
Look at my hand.

477
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,909
Yeah. Look at her hand.

478
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,382
Shaking left hand. What
is that a symptom of?

479
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,181
Not meningitis. It's basically
a symptom of nothing.

480
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,688
I put the idea into their
heads and watched it happen.

481
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:33,783
Same thing Peng cruelly did
with the puking and the rash.

482
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,157
The rash is in my head?

483
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,287
Your mind controls your body.

484
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,922
If it thinks you're
sick, it makes you sick.

485
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,565
It just started.

486
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:47,897
<i>If you'll all just calm down, your
symptoms will soon go away.</i>

487
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,498
<i>And to facilitate this process,</i>

488
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,807
<i>your flight crew will move through the
cabin with a complimentary bar service.</i>

489
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,244
<i>Thank you and, as always,
have a pleasant flight.</i>

490
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,583
Still feel like puking? No.

491
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,404
How did you know?

492
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,600
LP was negative.

493
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,176
I came up with an alternate
theory and I tested it.

494
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:31,040
Couldn't have done it without you.
Rage is a symptom of mass hysteria.

495
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:35,547
Just one more thing to clean
up. Peng set off the mass hysteria.

496
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,155
What set off Peng?

497
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,055
He really is dying. Yeah.

498
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,495
I haven't the faintest idea why.

499
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,402
What's extension pasturing?

500
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,969
It's when you're molested
by a priest's cousin.

501
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,018
Do we really need these three?

502
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,712
Worried they'll
make you look bad?

503
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,380
Could be symptomatic of
head trauma, cerebral infarction,

504
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,688
or intracranial
hemorrhage. Thoughts?

505
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,358
How long until we land?

506
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,555
Too long to wait.

507
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:20,030
His head's as smooth as
a baby's bottom, no bumps.

508
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,476
So I think we can
rule out head trauma.

509
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,800
But you gotta choose between
what's left, a clog or a leak?

510
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,566
You're talking of toilet?

511
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:29,335
House, is this actually helpful?

512
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,876
Not so far.

513
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,802
What about syphilis?

514
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,580
Well, first of all, he apparently
speaks a language no one else speaks,

515
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,017
which makes talking up
the ladies a little rough.

516
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:42,286
We're flying out of Singapore.

517
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,984
If he has a credit card and a
condom, he can get anything he wants.

518
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,284
What?

519
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:51,892
Condoms.

520
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,664
He has focal limb paralysis.

521
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:01,002
His legs got paralyzed
by a condom?

522
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,631
No, by cocaine.

523
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,203
It was inside the condom.

524
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,973
It's now spreading
through his digestive tract.

525
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,013
You think he's a mule.

526
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,708
I think he's a jackass.

527
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,908
We're gonna have
to operate. Cool!

528
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,066
They're gonna kill
her. We were wrong.

529
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,077
Which means Foreman was right.

530
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:43,907
Maybe Foreman's right about us,
too. Maybe we should just stop all this.

531
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,348
I mean, if it's
affecting our jobs.

532
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,352
It's not affecting our jobs.

533
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:51,720
We had sex in a patient's bedroom. A
bedroom we were examining for toxins.

534
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,691
Yeah, our judgment's
right on the mark.

535
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,819
All right. No more sex in patient's
homes, no more sex with cats watching.

536
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:59,421
Anywhere else you
wanna cross off the list?

537
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,695
The bowl. What?

538
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,528
Has she eaten since
she's been here?

539
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,300
She's been sick
since she's been here.

540
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,283
What if it's a symptom?
Well, why would you think...

541
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,003
The bowl was full.

542
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,754
You're gonna need to hold him
down. He's not gonna like this.

543
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:29,551
Do you really think he's a mule?

544
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,994
Fits the symptoms.

545
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,232
You sure he's not contagious?

546
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,426
Pretty much.

547
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,436
You can't be pretty much
sure. Means you're not sure.

548
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,199
Oh, aren't you clever?

549
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,870
Come on.

550
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,039
I know you're pretty
much unconscious,

551
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:51,675
but as has been pointed out to
me, pretty much doesn't mean squat.

552
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,108
Okay, hold him tight.

553
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,153
The faster we do this, the
less likely he is to die of shock.

554
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,829
Tighter.

555
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,237
Sorry. Do that again.

556
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,538
Ease off and then press down.

557
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,765
Pressure on his
joints relieves his pain.

558
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,965
Okay. Wrong again.

559
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,641
Where's his wallet?

560
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,040
Scuba certification card.

561
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,780
Big deal. I have
one of these. Yeah.

562
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:13,575
But do you also have a receipt from
Tekong's Scuba Rental dated yesterday?

563
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,055
Tell the Captain to drop as
low as he can, under 5,000 feet.

564
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,422
We're at 38,000...
Peng's got the bends.

565
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,585
He went diving yesterday.

566
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,528
Like an idiot, he surfaced too
quickly, and like a bigger idiot,

567
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:28,829
he boarded a flight which is
pressurized to 8,000 feet above sea level.

568
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,528
Low pressure is killing him.

569
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:34,471
Tell the pilot to dive until we can
club baby seals out of the window.

570
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,005
And get him some oxygen.

571
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:52,356
Fifty years ago, it was one estate. The
two homes shared an electrical system.

572
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,585
Unfortunately, the
exterminator didn't know that,

573
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,423
so when they
fumigated next door,

574
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,259
the poison gas flowed through
the old pipe and into your house.

575
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,391
The scopolamine patch was
masking the effects of the poison.

576
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:06,802
You'll have to stay here for a few more
days, but after that you should be fine.

577
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,303
I'm sorry about your cat.

578
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,472
And your hair.

579
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,573
For 12 years, Harrington
never left the property.

580
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,543
I thought I was being
punished for going away,

581
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:29,124
but really I was being
punished for coming home.

582
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,418
Thank you. I saved
your life. You owe me.

583
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,513
I wasn't sick.

584
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,821
But you didn't know
that. You owe me.

585
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,327
I know it now.

586
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:08,065
Your mind convinced your body
to get a rash, photophobia, vomit.

587
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,160
How do you know it wouldn't have
shut down your cold, cold heart next?

588
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,439
I don't owe you.

589
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,273
You're mean.

590
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,348
That's how I compensate
for being weak and soft.

591
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,518
I just wanted to say thank you.

592
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,149
You're extremely welcome.

593
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,955
And I'm in New
York every Monday.

594
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,792
Are you handicap accessible?

595
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,736
Hi, Robin?

596
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:55,704
This is Dr. Wilson.

597
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,581
Fran's doctor. James.

598
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,255
It was a toxin. We caught it in
time, and she's gonna be fine.

599
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,056
Yeah, it is.

600
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:17,100
Listen, I was just wondering if you
were coming back in again to visit.

601
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,861
Nice catch.

602
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:21,962
Thanks.

603
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,440
Think even House
would be impressed.

604
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,170
I don't know about that.

605
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,337
Any idea how you
wanna celebrate?

606
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:30,807
What?

607
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,245
I want more.

608
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,863
I thought you were
getting a little worn out by...

609
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,719
No, that's not what I meant.

610
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,117
I know.

611
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,359
I was just hoping you'd take the
hint and pretend you never said that.

612
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:47,359
I want this to be
more than it is.

613
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:49,128
I thought we were clear.

614
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:51,300
In the beginning,
but you can't tell me...

615
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:54,669
Yes, I can. And I don't.

616
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,841
It was fun. That's it.

617
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,812
And now it's over.
