1
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,009
All right. Stand here.

2
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,683
You're just tall enough.

3
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,546
I don't...

4
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,556
I don't think I am.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,952
It just goes around.

6
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,401
There's nothing to
be scared of, all right?

7
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,223
I didn't say I was scared.

8
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:28,318
It'll be fun.

9
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,092
Come on, when I was a kid,
this was my favorite thing ever.

10
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,894
I don't like rides.

11
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,996
All right. All right.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,581
I just... I thought
it would be fun.

13
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,267
I shouldn't be
making you do this.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,340
Uh...

15
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,437
Let's go home. We
can have fun at home.

16
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,338
No, Daddy. Wait.

17
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,814
The ride does look like fun.

18
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,630
Oh, this is awesome.

19
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,915
Alice? Are you all right?

20
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,686
Honey, you all right?

21
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,760
Alice? Alice? Are you okay?

22
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,970
Nothing happened.

23
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,226
Something happened.

24
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,376
It was a little kiddie ride.

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
She hates those rides.

26
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,012
I don't understand why
you insist on making her...

27
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:18,665
Okay, I appreciate the
fullness of your answers,

28
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,469
but I just wanted
to know if she'd had

29
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,371
any history of
abdominal problems.

30
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:23,603
No. No.

31
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,945
The admitting doctor
noted no family history of...

32
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,744
I have an aunt with
Crohn's disease.

33
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,646
You didn't mention that?

34
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,961
I forgot what it
was called, okay?

35
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,147
Your aunt's got a million
things wrong with her.

36
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,765
If you paid attention
for five minutes...

37
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,667
I doubt it's Crohn's. She has
none of the other symptoms.

38
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,593
You're alone with her for eight
hours, she ends up in the hospital.

39
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,391
I'm wondering if we can focus on

40
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,259
answering the
questions, Mrs. Hartmann.

41
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm not Mrs. Hartmann.
We're divorced.

42
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,935
I suspected.

43
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,832
And your past generosity
made me think of you.

44
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,209
We're half a million
dollars from our goal.

45
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,009
Of course, this is a naming
opportunity for your foundation.

46
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,776
Is there a problem?

47
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,082
There's something on your face.

48
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,854
It's, uh...

49
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,657
Excuse me. Oh...

50
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:20,733
Oh, God.

51
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,766
I'm sitting in there
hoping it's a sniper,

52
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:31,107
because at least then the
sociopath isn't my employee.

53
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,304
This baby won me second
place in the clinic's weekly

54
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,646
"weirdest thing pulled
out of an orifice" contest.

55
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,812
I am this close to putting
a new lab in Oncology.

56
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,022
You do not want to
know what came in first.

57
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,250
House.

58
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,585
It rhymes with fucchini.

59
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,687
Give me his pills.

60
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,094
Where's my prescription?

61
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,633
No more free-floating
prescriptions.

62
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,797
Princeton P.D. has already
forced Wilson to shut down.

63
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,272
A cop says, "Boo,"
Wilson shuts down.

64
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,673
Every doctor in
this place is afraid

65
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,176
to make a move
without covering his ass.

66
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,770
You think maybe you're
shouting at the wrong person?

67
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,817
Tritter's obviously out
to get me. He doesn't...

68
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,146
You forged prescriptions!

69
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,218
Allegedly.

70
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,353
Your pain has become my pain.

71
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,750
From now on, you get reasonable
doses at reasonable times.

72
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,794
But I hurt in an
unreasonable way.

73
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,141
Then dip into your secret stash.

74
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,424
Tritter took it.

75
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,241
Then move on to your
secret, secret stash.

76
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,597
I ran out.

77
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,999
Then move on to your
secret, secret, secret stash.

78
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,007
Parents say she's
not on any meds.

79
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,985
If the pancreatitis wasn't set off
by drugs, and she hasn't been sick,

80
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,783
that leaves trauma or some
kind of structural defect.

81
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,346
Put up the CT.

82
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,753
What's that density there?

83
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,921
Shadow. Looks normal to me.

84
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,026
We got a referral from...

85
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,430
Excuse me.

86
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,902
You stash your drugs
in a lupus textbook?

87
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,440
It's never lupus.

88
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,085
Who's got gallstones,
and why do we care?

89
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,441
Gallstones?

90
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,708
Biliary duct is dilated, probably
from a stone lodged in it.

91
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,578
Must've caused a nasty
case of pancreatitis.

92
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,016
She's six. Six-year-olds
don't get gallstones.

93
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,950
So, she didn't
have pancreatitis?

94
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,952
Your theory is an
invisible gallstone?

95
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,685
His theory correctly
predicted pancreatitis.

96
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,103
You might want to wait until
he actually tells us his theory

97
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,062
before you start
kissing his theory's ass.

98
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,995
My theory is...

99
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,898
Vanishing gallstone.

100
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,099
She had it and it passed.

101
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,534
Those things travel in packs.

102
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,196
The rest of them are
probably hiding out

103
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,762
in her gallbladder.
Do an ultrasound.

104
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,208
If I'm right, take out the organ,
so we can analyze the stones.

105
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,417
I wasn't kissing his ass.

106
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,397
It must have just looked
that way from our angle,

107
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,515
you on your knees,
House bending over.

108
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,422
He predicted the pancreatitis.

109
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,550
It's his dad's fault.

110
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,786
My dad was an ass.

111
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,454
But you did everything
he wanted you to,

112
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,395
and in return, you got
everything you wanted.

113
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,023
Yeah, it's that simple.

114
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,362
The strategy worked.

115
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,598
Dad got him a cushy
job, paid for his cushy life.

116
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,900
Cut me out of his cushy will.

117
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,172
Told you. It's just his nature.

118
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,444
Poor guy's
hard-wired to kiss ass.

119
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,003
House was right. Gallstones.

120
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,582
I didn't know a kid
could get gallstones.

121
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,280
It's unusual.

122
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,131
That's why we need
to see what's causing it.

123
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,216
We'd like to remove Alice's
gallbladder and analyze the stones.

124
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,385
Sure. No.

125
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,519
Just 'cause I said sure?

126
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,805
I am capable of my own thoughts.

127
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,888
It's a simple procedure.

128
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,140
The gallbladder
isn't essential to...

129
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,208
The doctor thinks
we should do it.

130
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,232
We should do it, Edie.

131
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,677
You think maybe we
should get a second opinion

132
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,637
before we start removing
our child's organs?

133
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,850
It's an effective use
of taxpayer's money.

134
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,854
I'm actually off this week.

135
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,516
I'm guessing you
don't have a family.

136
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,401
Most people have enough
going on in their lives

137
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,792
that they don't have to
personalize every slight.

138
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,659
This isn't personal.

139
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,296
Not anymore.

140
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,458
My head of Oncology
had to shut down.

141
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,402
My entire staff are afraid to make
a move without covering their ass.

142
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:20,338
I think you're angry
at the wrong person.

143
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,302
You think Dr. Wilson deserved
to have his assets seized,

144
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,346
his entire practice ruined?

145
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,574
No.

146
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,616
So, you just don't care?

147
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,444
This is how I get what I want.

148
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,720
I put pressure on people,
and if it doesn't work on Wilson,

149
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,994
it'll work on you.

150
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,798
You punish the innocent.

151
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,991
None of you are innocent.

152
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,592
Not one of you.

153
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,262
Not one of you has told me
the truth about Dr. House.

154
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,968
The pills allow him
to cope with the pain.

155
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,945
No. The pills distort
reality. He is an addict.

156
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,006
He's not out robbing
a liquor store, or...

157
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,346
No, he's treating people.

158
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:09,754
He needs to find a different way
to cope before he kills somebody.

159
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,549
If he hasn't done that already.

160
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,321
If you're right, he has
a medical problem.

161
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,090
It should be dealt
with by doctors.

162
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,187
Not by...

163
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,308
It's not being dealt
with by doctors.

164
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,961
Doctors are covering it up.

165
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,900
The whole point of the
criminal justice system

166
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,240
is to make things right
when everything else fails.

167
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,609
With all due respect,

168
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,874
you have failed.

169
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,821
Sorry, didn't know you
wanted your kid dead.

170
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,197
Although, for a couple of
G's, I can still make it happen.

171
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,267
Who the hell are you?

172
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:56,735
I am a complete stranger,

173
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,382
who apparently cares more about
whether your kid dies than you do.

174
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,499
You're Dr. House.

175
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,201
You've seen my stage show.

176
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,835
She's not dying.
She has pancreatitis.

177
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,743
Once you've treated
that, I'm taking her home.

178
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,111
And do what, burn sage?

179
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,546
I want you to do the surgery.

180
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,845
My father had gallstones.

181
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,247
They were totally harmless.

182
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,786
Alice had one bad
one, but it passed.

183
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,388
For all we know, this is over.

184
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,333
And for all we know, she
could get sick again tomorrow.

185
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,877
Then I'll take her
to her pediatrician.

186
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,517
She's six, Rob.

187
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,323
She shouldn't have
unnecessary surgery.

188
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,194
Or a moron for a mom,
but what can you do?

189
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,734
You're the doctor.
I'm the mother.

190
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,635
I outrank you. Live with it.

191
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,675
I've read the file.
You've got 15 minutes.

192
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,443
It's people like this
who killed Copernicus.

193
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,574
Galileo.

194
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,845
Either way.

195
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,228
And they just locked Galileo up.

196
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,347
They killed his spirit, and
nobody likes a show-off.

197
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,982
Luckily, Alice Hartmann has a
dad who's willing to see reason.

198
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,153
Reason, as defined by
slavishly deferring to you.

199
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,389
Their doctor.

200
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,773
Your Honor, I've
had no opportunity

201
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:58,890
to consult my attorney.

202
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,159
There's no time.

203
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,793
All I want is a second
opinion before...

204
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,494
No time.

205
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,036
Your testimony is
their child will die

206
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,505
if I don't grant this
motion right now?

207
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,837
Am I under oath?

208
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,400
Let's say yes.

209
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,577
My testimony is that this child

210
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,672
might die if you don't
grant this motion right now.

211
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,717
Literally no time for
a second opinion?

212
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,446
Wouldn't be as good
as the first opinion.

213
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,679
Dr. Cuddy, what do you think?

214
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,416
She's not a
specialist in this area.

215
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,285
Her opinion is worthless.

216
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,191
Dr. Cuddy, what do
you think of Dr. House?

217
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,891
Is he as big a jerk
as I think he is?

218
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,158
Bigger.

219
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:34,091
But he knows what
he's talking about.

220
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,521
Got a page.

221
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,007
She's complaining
about her stitches.

222
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,863
The nurse just said
that's completely normal.

223
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,744
Did you get the test
results for the gallstones?

224
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,792
Any minute now.

225
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,814
No time for a second opinion,
but the test takes three...

226
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,329
My skin hurts.

227
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,274
I know I no longer
have the right

228
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,853
to demand it but could
you please take a look?

229
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,901
Sure.

230
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,023
She's pissed, so now she's just
looking for things to go wrong.

231
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,451
You're right, I'm so petty I hope
she dies so it vindicates my opinion.

232
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,246
I didn't mean that, sweetie.

233
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,915
Mommy was being sarcastic.

234
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,688
She's a few years away from
grasping sarcasm, don't you think?

235
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:35,854
Guys.

236
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,037
I already gave you that number.

237
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,444
Simple surgical procedure turns
a little girl into <i>The English Patient.</i>

238
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,538
What gives?

239
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,914
Must be allergic to something
we used in the surgery.

240
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,384
Cameron,

241
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,716
C-A-M-E-R-O-N.

242
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,484
This is my office. I'm talking.

243
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,319
There are people
here who work for me.

244
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,257
They're not listening.
Explain this to me.

245
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,955
Tritter froze my account.

246
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,519
They're checking theirs.

247
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,154
I'm on hold with a lawyer.

248
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,291
Call Wilson's lawyer.

249
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,494
He'll tell you exactly how
and why you're screwed.

250
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,079
This kid has no
history of allergies so...

251
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,537
You gotta talk to Tritter.

252
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,682
You gotta make this go away.

253
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,004
Yeah, great plan.

254
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,565
The man is obviously
open to reason.

255
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,736
Well, here's the
plan, we do nothing.

256
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,713
We while away the time
diagnosing the patient.

257
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,158
The stones were
calcium bilirubinate.

258
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,480
Pigment stones.

259
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,018
Which are non-conclusive.

260
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,351
Kid presented with
low-grade fever, mild anemia.

261
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,822
That, plus the stones,
indicates bacterial infection.

262
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,019
Bacterial infections don't
cause a vesicular rash,

263
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,393
and doing nothing is not a plan.

264
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,091
It's specifically
a lack of a plan.

265
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,396
We cut into her belly,
the bad boys escape.

266
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:52,496
They swarm over, colonize the
wounds, and kaplow, vesicular rash.

267
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,804
Allergic reaction is 100 times
more likely, with or without a history.

268
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,368
Fever and anemia could have
been symptoms of pancreatitis.

269
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,606
Hello?

270
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,783
Thank you for your help.

271
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,378
They froze my accounts.

272
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,749
"Thank you for your help"?

273
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,378
It's not her fault.

274
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,979
He hasn't gotten to mine, yet.

275
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,184
I'm gonna withdraw as
much as I can, as fast as I can.

276
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,783
Lunch is on me.

277
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,291
Do a scratch test.
Check for allergies.

278
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,197
When it comes back negative,
start broad-spectrum antibiotics.

279
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,566
Bullies bully.

280
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,535
They don't get a
reaction, they lose interest.

281
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,071
Now go do what I ask before
I stick your heads in toilets.

282
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,115
How'd Otter get here?

283
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,176
Daddy got him last night.

284
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,730
It was at the dry cleaner.
They close at 6:00.

285
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,120
How'd you get it?

286
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,384
I drove over there,

287
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:48,724
and I knocked for about 10
minutes, and then I begged.

288
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,928
How about some ice cream
for when this is through?

289
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,564
My tummy hurts.

290
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,273
Ginger ale?

291
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,169
Yeah?

292
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:05,977
I'll take over.

293
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,536
Be right back.

294
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,745
He's always been really good
at the big romantic gestures,

295
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:21,159
but ask him to do the dishes, or show
up for a meal on time, or drive her...

296
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,889
Almost done here.

297
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:41,837
What are you doing here?

298
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,914
I work here.

299
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,451
You passively-aggressively
gave up your practice.

300
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,611
I have clinic hours.

301
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,656
And now you're passively-aggressively
spreading peanut butter

302
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,282
with a big sign around
your neck saying,

303
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,622
"Wilson doesn't have
enough cash for the cafeteria."

304
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,390
You know, before Lenny
Bruce died of a drug overdose...

305
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,627
If you're going to confront me

306
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,530
with everyone who
ever abused narcotics,

307
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,112
I think I'm gonna have
to get something to read.

308
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,900
He was arrested on
obscenity charges.

309
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,963
He went through a
series of arrests and trials,

310
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,153
because he just couldn't
stop challenging the police.

311
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,677
He became obsessed
with his own legal problems,

312
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,578
and his act turned into
long, humorless rants

313
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,515
about fascist cops and
the violation of his rights.

314
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,881
I get it, I get it.

315
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,338
I need to change
my nightclub act.

316
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,820
You think more props?

317
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:25,484
House, scratch test is
getting results, a lot of results.

318
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,167
How can she be
allergic to everything?

319
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,712
She can't be.

320
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,771
It has to be an infection.

321
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,909
You see a positive allergy
test and decide it's infection?

322
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,317
The bacteria got into
the scratches in her back.

323
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,855
The infection's radial.

324
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,823
The shape of
this isn't. Eat this.

325
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,983
I don't feel like eating.

326
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,117
It'll make you better.

327
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,217
A sandwich?

328
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,294
Magic sandwich.

329
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,227
There's no such thing as...

330
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,231
Just take a damn
bite, okay, kid?

331
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,183
Amazing how she didn't
go into anaphylactic shock.

332
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,914
That's diagnostically
ridiculous.

333
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,354
Right, she's allergic to
everything except peanuts.

334
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:34,224
If she is allergic, antibiotics could
cause a massive systemic reaction.

335
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,728
If she's allergic,
but she's not.

336
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,395
Chase, you're right.

337
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,763
The shape indicates allergy.

338
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,232
The tests indicate allergy.

339
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,997
Just because she's
not allergic to peanuts,

340
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,030
doesn't mean she's not
allergic to lidocaine or...

341
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,836
Chase, hang the bag.

342
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,299
You can grow a
backbone tomorrow.

343
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,810
No, I'm not giving
my daughter drugs

344
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,412
that could shut her system down.

345
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,914
You know what else
shuts down systems?

346
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,177
Death.

347
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,109
Sorry. I can't let you do this.

348
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:09,495
Luckily, Alice Hartmann has a
mom, who is willing to see reason.

349
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,261
You were in here
yesterday, telling me

350
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,731
her father's guardianship
was best for her.

351
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,827
I honestly figured I'd get
a different judge today.

352
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,702
You agree with Dr. House now?

353
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,900
Now my kid actually is sick.

354
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,101
She was sick yesterday.

355
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,653
Her pediatrician doesn't
know what's wrong

356
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,088
with her, says
Dr. House is the best.

357
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,223
She loses guardianship, and
all of a sudden House is a hero.

358
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,525
It's got nothing to
do with me deciding...

359
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,710
Hey, zip it!

360
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,012
I've heard enough.

361
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,195
This lawyering thing is easy.

362
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,278
You shut up, too.

363
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:38,757
Arguing over every decision
is a waste of her time and mine.

364
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,861
Since her parents
can't, or won't, agree,

365
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,191
I'm awarding temporary
guardianship to a doctor,

366
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,865
who'll place the health of
the child above all else...

367
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,114
I don't think Dr. House
is capable of...

368
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,197
Dr. Cuddy.

369
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,831
Yes, Your Honor.

370
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,533
No, I was finishing my sentence.

371
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,441
The kid's all yours.

372
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,150
<i>HOUSE: 3:00, give me the pills.</i>

373
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,377
I don't even know this kid.

374
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,352
How am I supposed to
decide what's best for her?

375
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,547
Fine, I'll choose.

376
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,566
I'm going to side with
the angry doctor's opinion.

377
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,649
Give me my pills.

378
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,158
We're not gonna
go broad-spectrum.

379
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,503
If there's any chance
that she's allergic...

380
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,527
There is no chance.

381
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,461
Of course there's a
chance. I'm appealing.

382
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,657
No, you're not.

383
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,509
If you think it's bacterial,
pick one antibiotic.

384
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,577
It's not going to be enough.

385
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,570
We need to go broad-spectrum.

386
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,672
It kills bugs. That's
what you want.

387
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,866
We'll go with metronidazole.

388
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:34,472
<i>You don't have to testify
he's broken any laws,</i>

389
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,444
though I'm sure you could.

390
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,450
Just how many pills
he takes in a day.

391
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:42,352
'Cause I'm fairly confident
I can prove that he didn't

392
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,915
have that many
legitimate prescriptions.

393
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:50,395
I really hope no one dies while
I'm sitting here not talking to you.

394
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,825
I, uh, I had a, uh...

395
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,068
Had a buddy at Trenton P.D.

396
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,765
do some digging.

397
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,331
Your brother,
locked up for drugs.

398
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:06,245
Your own flesh and blood,
and you don't even visit.

399
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,805
But your boss practices
medicine on drugs,

400
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,784
time to start lying to the cops.

401
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,084
If I run out for coffee, will I get
back before you make your point?

402
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,784
You testify,

403
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,720
I can make sure that
Marcus goes free on parole

404
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,302
in less than two months.

405
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,499
My brother and I, uh...

406
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,669
We grew up in the same home.

407
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,639
But...

408
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,009
I made something of myself.

409
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,215
He didn't.

410
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,948
Dr. Foreman, the way you talk,

411
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,321
you'd think you never
committed any crimes yourself.

412
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:57,060
Now, you and Dr. House,
you are both cold bastards.

413
00:19:57,463 --> 00:20:01,662
You don't give a damn about your
brother, and you can't stand House.

414
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:08,899
But I do expect
you to take this deal,

415
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,676
because you hate hypocrisy more.

416
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,975
House has had 1,000 chances.

417
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,844
You've got two chances.

418
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,750
Why is your
brother stuck at one?

419
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:30,024
Well, if she were allergic to this
antibiotic, we would have seen it by now.

420
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:33,396
I think we are out of the
woods as far as that goes.

421
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,428
Guess they
occasionally get one right.

422
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,667
You're going to
be glib about this?

423
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,762
You almost killed her.

424
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:40,863
I made a choice.

425
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,284
The same choice
you made yesterday,

426
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,685
only when I make
it I'm an imbecile.

427
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,610
Every decision you have
made has been wrong.

428
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,613
When this is over, I'm
suing for sole custody.

429
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,808
Because I trusted
doctors when you didn't?

430
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,442
Because it's not just
about the past two days.

431
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,297
Like you have the hotline on
what's best for Alice. She loves me.

432
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:57,065
She never does her
homework when she's with you.

433
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,182
She never brushes her hair.

434
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,123
Her heart's racing,
pressure's rising.

435
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,125
The two of you get out.

436
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,490
I'm her mother.
You can't just...

437
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,793
You fight, she has
an anxiety attack.

438
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,194
The two of you are
making her worse.

439
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,430
Get out, and don't come back.

440
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,543
How's the kid doing?

441
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,206
Much better as of
about two hours ago.

442
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:23,941
You got any money for lunch?

443
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,882
If you like parsley
and croutons.

444
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,884
Tritter finally
froze my accounts.

445
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,953
Really?

446
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,165
You surprised? Why wouldn't he?

447
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,782
I figured if he was
singling you out,

448
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,517
you must have done
something different.

449
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,254
What? Like talking? Yeah.

450
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,024
And now that he's frozen your
accounts, you probably will.

451
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,429
You need the cash, right?

452
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,558
He doesn't freeze my
accounts, I'm guilty.

453
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,760
He does freeze my
accounts, I'm guilty.

454
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,737
Is Alice having some
procedure done?

455
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,068
She's fine. She's resting.

456
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,266
Where? In her room.

457
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,152
Where you're not supposed...
I was just at the window.

458
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,474
There's no one in there.

459
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:52,910
Her backpack
wasn't there, either.

460
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,856
You don't think her
father could have...

461
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,371
Call Security.

462
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,026
Get a gurney.

463
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,800
She's stiff. She can't move.

464
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,228
I don't know what happened.

465
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,763
She seemed fine.

466
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,361
Help her. Please.

467
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,170
On the plus side, she
could medal in luge.

468
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:30,114
Muscle rigidity is almost
exclusively neurological.

469
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,344
Neuroaxonal dystrophy?
She's the right age.

470
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,162
Except that her liver's
starting to shut down.

471
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,245
No dystrophy would...

472
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,620
Metronidazole, great idea.

473
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,090
"Let's not go broad-spectrum.

474
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,169
"Let's not take any chances
on actually curing her."

475
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,718
House, can you
focus on the case?

476
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,889
No, because I'm in pain,

477
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:47,275
'cause you think that compromise
is the answer to everything.

478
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,426
I need more pills.

479
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,026
Muscle rigidity plus liver
involvement means Wilson's.

480
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,572
No. No corneal rings,
no mental changes.

481
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,004
Then what?

482
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,411
I need more pills!

483
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,471
No! You are on a reasonable...

484
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,177
What the hell does
"reasonable" mean?

485
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,657
Keep it quiet.

486
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,282
Her BP reacts to stress
and yelling is not...

487
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,923
If you think that I'm not in pain,
then don't give me anything.

488
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,466
Keep me away from the aspirin,

489
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,024
but if I'm in a butt-load of
pain, I need a butt-load of pills.

490
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,627
Fine. You need more pills.

491
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,329
You're not getting them.

492
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,034
You can have all
the aspirin you want.

493
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,109
I say we draw straws.

494
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,880
Loser drives down to Trenton
and scores him an eight ball.

495
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,033
Which one of you two
gave her an aspirin?

496
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,889
What? Her symptoms
fit Reye's Syndrome.

497
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,554
Which doesn't make any
sense, unless she took aspirin.

498
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,926
Rob? No way. She's a kid.

499
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,464
I've read the 800
warning labels.

500
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,531
I'm not even angry.

501
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,643
I just want her to be okay.

502
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,896
She's lying.

503
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,312
She's angry, 'cause
you kidnapped her kid.

504
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,066
She'll be angrier
if the kid dies.

505
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,696
I didn't. One aspirin

506
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,293
combined with a
pre-existing infection,

507
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:03,818
that's all it takes
to set off an attack.

508
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:04,935
I'm not lying.

509
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,639
Well, sure, you've
certainly earned our trust.

510
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:09,682
Where was Alice the
night before she came in?

511
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,717
With me. Well, at my house.

512
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,819
I went out. She stayed
with the babysitter.

513
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,366
Where were you?
None of your business.

514
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,299
You hired someone that might
have poisoned our daughter.

515
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:20,589
She's 15. She's
very responsible.

516
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,218
Is she a 15-year-old pharmacist?

517
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,705
Or just some kid
from down the street

518
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,027
who needed 20
bucks for lip gloss

519
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:27,225
and a couple of <i>Tiger Beats?</i>

520
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,103
Put your kid on
charcoal hemoperfusion.

521
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,881
Shouldn't we see what
the babysitter has to say?

522
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,237
I know what she's gonna say.

523
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,784
She's gonna lie to
save her business.

524
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,470
I need more pills.

525
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,309
We are going to use this
machine to clean your blood.

526
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,514
It goes out of you
and through a filter,

527
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,817
like the filter in a fish tank.

528
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,817
It's kind of cool, actually.

529
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:00,798
I'm scared.

530
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,794
It won't hurt.

531
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:10,637
It takes a while, so it'll
be boring, but it won't hurt.

532
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,642
It's going to make you better.

533
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,150
They hate each
other, don't they?

534
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,915
We're never going
to be together again.

535
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,987
Well, you never know.

536
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,566
You're going to break out the
rubber hoses, the bright lights?

537
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,401
I'm not going to testify just because
I have to borrow lunch money.

538
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:45,308
I know. Women don't give up
guys that they're in love with.

539
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,542
I'm not in love with House.

540
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:50,845
The guy is unhinged
and unethical,

541
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,511
does what he wants
with no concern for others,

542
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,076
but you stand by him.

543
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,487
It can't just be
loyalty and respect?

544
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,252
No.

545
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,087
I'm a girl, so I must
be in love with him.

546
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,186
Not because you're a girl.

547
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,691
Because 10 years ago

548
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,394
you got an A in calculus,
until you ratted yourself out.

549
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,439
Showed your professor
a mistake he missed.

550
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,873
Because you married a man...

551
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,409
Don't go there.

552
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,172
You used to be someone
who did the right thing.

553
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,082
House has changed you.

554
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,487
Do you think it's all
been for the better?

555
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:42,894
How's it going?

556
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,061
Boring.

557
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,604
Told you. FOREMAN:
So far so good.

558
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:48,436
Just like five minutes ago,
and 10 minutes before that.

559
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,203
What's the matter?

560
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,680
She's thrown a clot.

561
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,537
Let's get her out of
here. I'll call the OR.

562
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,321
You said it wouldn't hurt.

563
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,965
Found it. She's burning up.

564
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,092
Give me a sec.

565
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,328
Foreman, she is on fire.

566
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,426
Almost there.

567
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:19,784
Get me some
cooling blankets now.

568
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,203
Right away.

569
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,251
Every time we touch this
kid, something goes wrong.

570
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,574
Bad mojo is not a diagnosis.

571
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,843
You really have to flash your
private stash in front of me?

572
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,913
You find it easier to lie
for me if it's more subtle?

573
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,078
Fine.

574
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,920
You told your associates
that I had frozen your accounts.

575
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,054
Yes.

576
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,461
Smart lie.

577
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,624
You figured they'd think there was
a reason that you'd been singled out.

578
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,502
Like that you'd agreed
to testify against House.

579
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:56,603
Yeah, I assume
that's why you did it.

580
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:02,237
You have a reputation
as a bit of an opportunist.

581
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,442
You already gave your boss
up once from what I heard.

582
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,075
To save my job.

583
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:07,811
He goes down now, I lose my job.

584
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,821
You lose your job,
you find another one.

585
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,447
You get fired,

586
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,451
your chances don't look so hot.

587
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,789
Why would he fire me?

588
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,056
Because you rolled on him.

589
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,529
I haven't rolled on him.

590
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,064
I think you will.

591
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,896
And he's gonna
think you already did.

592
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,265
As far as he knows,

593
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,338
my accounts are frozen
just like everyone else's.

594
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:30,467
In 24 hours, all three of you will
have access to your accounts again.

595
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,272
Why would you do...

596
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:36,912
If I was looking at
this as an outsider,

597
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:39,380
I would say

598
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,750
it was because
Detective Tritter had

599
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,382
what appeared to be a very
pleasant lunch with Dr. Chase.

600
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,491
Yeah.

601
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:01,797
The two of them appear
to be working together.

602
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,592
How the hell are there
no ice packs in the OR?

603
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:11,675
Clot's out.

604
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,860
Ice packs aren't
gonna hold it for long.

605
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:13,928
Where are the blankets?

606
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,215
In the ER.

607
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,631
They're dealing with
a four-car collision.

608
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:20,114
We need to cool this kid
down before her brain melts.

609
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,393
What are you doing?

610
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,439
She got a major dose of heparin

611
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,777
to thin her blood
for the procedure.

612
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,599
Could have induced
thrombocytopenia.

613
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,933
That's unlikely.

614
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:35,770
The charcoal would have
absorbed a lot of the heparin.

615
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,332
She's been anemic.

616
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:39,001
Could be a primary
blood disorder.

617
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,909
Or we never cured the infection.

618
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,572
Are you saying she
never had Reye's?

619
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,913
We just put that little girl
through excruciating pain.

620
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,183
The pain wasn't House's fault.

621
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,458
Even if the clot was a reaction

622
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,730
to what we gave
her, we still had to...

623
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,155
I don't need you
to cover my ass!

624
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,319
What I need is my Vicodin!

625
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:56,692
Two pills every six hours,
like I'm on an allowance.

626
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,559
She's giving a cop leverage
over medical decisions.

627
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,327
What the hell? Why don't we get

628
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,196
a plumber in here,
ask his opinion?

629
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:07,100
Hey, Cuddy, you know any
rodeo clowns who can weigh in...

630
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,875
Where the hell is she?

631
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,446
Look at her arm.

632
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,327
I told you it was an infection.

633
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,617
We fixed the infection.

634
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:25,918
Well, apparently not.

635
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,231
I asked you for broad-spectrum.

636
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,636
You put her on the bare minimum.

637
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,893
It's a good thing you failed to
become a mom, because you suck at it.

638
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,011
What's so good about this rash?

639
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,550
Good guesses, but no.

640
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,292
It's on parts of her body
that we haven't touched.

641
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,925
She's got a fever of 103. She's
in and out of consciousness,

642
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,093
but it's not a reaction
to anything we did.

643
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,864
Our mojo is off the table.

644
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:13,428
Which means...

645
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,006
Oh, so close.

646
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,672
Means thanks to Cuddy's
candy-ass approach,

647
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:24,012
broad-spectrum antibiotics
are no longer an option.

648
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,978
This thing has grown
horns and fangs.

649
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,648
We've gotta figure
out what species it is,

650
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:32,019
go in with a spear to the heart.

651
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,254
Okay, you guys are sulking.

652
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,297
I don't really care
why, but apparently

653
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,399
I can't do my job
without finding out.

654
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,990
Tritter released
our bank accounts.

655
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,400
Horrible, horrible news.

656
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,062
Wow, I'm glad we
didn't let that fester.

657
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,630
If she did have
Reye's, then it could

658
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,299
be varicella.
They're associated.

659
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,673
He released our money.

660
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,108
You do know what that means?

661
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,113
The correct question is,

662
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,773
how could it be varicella
given that she's not itchy?

663
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,114
Rickettsial pox causes
rash, fever and muscle pain.

664
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,585
Pain, not paralysis.

665
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,464
Rocky Mountain spotted
fever, on the other hand,

666
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,286
rash, fever, anemia, paralysis.

667
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,734
And I didn't say
anything to Tritter.

668
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,021
Neither did I.

669
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,824
Maybe he wants us to
think that one of us talked.

670
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:12,489
It worked. You were with him.

671
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,623
We were all with him.

672
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,257
We weren't laughing with him.

673
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,926
Maybe he just gave up.

674
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,971
Start the kid on chloramphenicol

675
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,073
for Rocky Mountain
spotted fever.

676
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:24,935
Can we talk?

677
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,979
No. I really think we...

678
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,045
Either you screwed me

679
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,810
and you want absolution, or
you didn't and you want applause.

680
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,181
Either way, I'm not interested.

681
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:46,962
I'm busy.

682
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,002
You okay?

683
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,070
Yeah, sure.

684
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,266
What I meant by "Are you okay?"

685
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,535
is "What the hell did House do?"

686
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,577
Nothing. What did he say?

687
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,604
I've seen House be rude 1,000
times, usually to achieve something.

688
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:07,380
I have never seen him be
mean just because he can.

689
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:09,285
Seriously?

690
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,551
What did he say?

691
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,887
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

692
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,062
Well, I've seen House
be rude to you 1,000 times,

693
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,495
but I've never
seen it get to you.

694
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:23,695
People think House
has no inner censor,

695
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,102
but the fact is he
holds himself back.

696
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,333
Because when he wants to hurt,

697
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,635
he knows just where
to poke a sharp stick.

698
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:37,913
I have been trying to get
pregnant, and House knew.

699
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,676
He told me I would
fail as a mother.

700
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,921
And you're this upset
because you think he's right?

701
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,891
I've had three
separate implantations.

702
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,960
The first two never took.

703
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,993
The last one, I lost.

704
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,196
I'm sorry.

705
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,733
You didn't fail. Those
were physical events.

706
00:33:57,936 --> 00:34:03,398
A little girl is
scared and in pain.

707
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,477
I was awkward, terrified
of doing the wrong thing.

708
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,914
That's normal. That's...

709
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,144
I didn't hug her.

710
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,481
I didn't even reach
out and hold her hand.

711
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,216
I told her it was gonna be okay.

712
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,518
She needed reassurance.

713
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,651
I told her, her folks
might get back together.

714
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,890
When I see people with
their kids, it's so natural.

715
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,534
It's like they have an instruction
book imprinted on their genes.

716
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,471
Maybe I just didn't get a copy.

717
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,669
Maybe my wanting
to be a mother is like

718
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,871
a tone-deaf person
wanting to sing opera,

719
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,674
or a paraplegic who wants to...

720
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,747
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

721
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:50,717
Well, I see what you mean
about House poking the right spot.

722
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,378
Chloramphenicol isn't working.

723
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,913
What dose did you give her?

724
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:25,184
Yeah, maybe Chase screwed up.

725
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,226
You always end up there.

726
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,851
Just getting a jump on it.

727
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,556
I doubled her up.

728
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,433
The infection's morphed.

729
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,830
It's moved into
her muscle sheath.

730
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,699
Necrotizing fasciitis?

731
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,465
That's impervious to drugs.

732
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:45,567
The only treatment is to
cut away the infected area.

733
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:47,837
So, we amputate.

734
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,346
Arm and leg?

735
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,315
We can't cut a
six-year-old kid in half

736
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,384
without a confirmed diagnosis.

737
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:56,250
Moves too quickly,
and we waited too long.

738
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,949
We don't have
time for a culture.

739
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,787
We can at least observe
her for a few hours,

740
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,654
confirm the rash is spreading.

741
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,025
It spreads, she dies.

742
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,825
You're talking
about crippling her.

743
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,092
We're not even certain
this was an infection.

744
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,499
Right! She's six! She's cute!

745
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,002
She can't have
flesh-eating bacteria!

746
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,034
It's just wrong!

747
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,937
Let's cure her with
sunshine and puppies.

748
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:21,079
Cute kids die of terrible illnesses,
innocent doctors go to jail,

749
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,842
and it's because
cowards like you

750
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,677
won't stand up and
do what's required.

751
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,742
You can sit around and moan
about who's the bigger weakling.

752
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:29,754
I'm going to go do my job.

753
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,985
<i>What kind of quality of
life will she have without...</i>

754
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:54,537
<i>Great thing about
life, it's got qualities.</i>

755
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,180
<i>And if we can't agree?</i>

756
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,819
I don't know.

757
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,947
He's yelled at us before.

758
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,428
Because he thought
our theories were dumb.

759
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,196
Not because our theories
were sending him to jail.

760
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,813
He's going through withdrawal.

761
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,548
Could be causing mild paranoia.

762
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,490
It'll pass. We just
have to suffer through it.

763
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,686
We never ruled out allergy.

764
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,638
We gave her drugs. She
had no negative reaction.

765
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,893
We cut open her belly,
she got a rash on her belly.

766
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,593
We did a scratch test on her
back, she got a rash on her back.

767
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,159
I know House ruled out mojo,
but it can't be a coincidence...

768
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,206
A little late to play
differential games, isn't it?

769
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:29,383
Get that thing away from me.

770
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,451
I don't want to get burned.

771
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,501
Laser pointers don't
burn you, genius.

772
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,045
Skin, no. Retina, yes.

773
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,978
You don't trust my aim?

774
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,015
Maybe you should
cover any sensitive...

775
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,285
He was wrong about the puppies.

776
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,486
House! You got
to stop the surgery.

777
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,259
She doesn't have
necrotizing fasciitis.

778
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,331
Oh, good.

779
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,095
She's got erythropoietic
protoporphyria.

780
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:57,964
She's allergic to light.

781
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,713
It's genetic. Either parent
could have carried it.

782
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,899
I know what it is.
Infection fits better.

783
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:05,068
She gets worse every time
she goes under surgical lights,

784
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:06,372
dad takes her outside...

785
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,776
Her liver's shot, too.

786
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,278
Did she swallow a flashlight?

787
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,508
Stop the surgery.

788
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:11,845
Get the hell out of my way.

789
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:12,916
No, I'm...

790
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,857
Light damages the blood cells,

791
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,486
the damaged blood cells
contain protoporphyrin,

792
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,396
the protoporphyrin
builds up in the liver.

793
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,094
That's why the
liver's shutting down.

794
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,357
Stop.

795
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,165
How can she be
allergic to light?

796
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,034
She's never had
this problem before.

797
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,473
The negative
reaction starts at birth.

798
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,975
It reaches critical
mass around this age.

799
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:17,340
<i>Her blood cells create
chemicals in reaction to light.</i>

800
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:21,576
<i>When they reach the liver, it
tries to filter out the bad cells.</i>

801
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,713
<i>The chemicals damage the liver,</i>

802
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,915
<i>and one byproduct is gallstones.</i>

803
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:29,425
So, she'll just
keep getting worse?

804
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,019
EP can be managed.

805
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,721
We'll give her beta-carotene.

806
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,892
She's gonna need special light
bulbs and filters on the windows.

807
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,711
She's probably gonna
need to be home-schooled.

808
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,194
Her life will be
complicated, but she will live.

809
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,572
How do you get
something like this?

810
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:44,802
It's genetic.

811
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,367
So, one of us...

812
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53,113
Both of you must be carriers.

813
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:58,623
She's gonna want to see
you when she wakes up.

814
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,785
So, don't screw it up.

815
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,413
So, what's new?

816
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,252
House missed one.

817
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,023
That's happened before.

818
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,892
He nearly maimed a little girl.

819
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,961
And I got it right.

820
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,795
And I told him,
and it didn't matter.

821
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,034
Chase, you solved one.

822
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:51,201
You helped a patient, that
better be enough for you.

823
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,486
Beckett was going
to call his play

824
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,503
<i>Waiting for House's Approval,</i>
but decided it was too grim.

825
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,809
Trust me,

826
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,674
I'm not waiting anymore.

827
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,288
I'm gonna need
30 pieces of silver.
