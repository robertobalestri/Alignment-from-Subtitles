1
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:05,736
I'm okay. Let's just go home.

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,775
You're getting checked out.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,539
I tripped on the ice. Eight other
kids tripped. This is embarrassing.

4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,172
You said you were just
gonna hang with your friends.

5
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:17,548
I turn around, and
you're out there on the ice.

6
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:18,916
I'm fine.

7
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:20,511
You don't know that.

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,022
You fell awkwardly.

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,319
No, I didn't.

10
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,757
You don't know how to fall.

11
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,761
I'm 16. I've been falling a lot.

12
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:31,026
I think I'm getting the
hang of it. And I checked.

13
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,462
And now the doctors
are gonna check.

14
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,870
You don't think that
you're overreacting?

15
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,067
I don't need you
to fix every booboo.

16
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,507
Then stop getting them.

17
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,936
I was just playing around with
my friends. I was having fun.

18
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,344
You know you can't do that.

19
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,676
Oh, I can't have fun.

20
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:52,186
You know what I mean. I'm going
to have a talk with your friends.

21
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,550
No! They need to stop.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,283
No, I don't want you
freaking them out.

23
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,058
Fine. Fine, we'll go to the hospital, but
they're going to tell you that I'm fine,

24
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,566
and they're going to tell you that
you don't need to worry about...

25
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,123
Mom!

26
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:44,832
Mom?

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,599
Mom?

28
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,809
Hello?

29
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:09,428
Mom, you gotta wake
up. No one's coming. Mom!

30
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,735
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

31
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,470
We got into an accident along the
Canal Road just outside Kingston.

32
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,046
My mom's unconscious.

33
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,445
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

34
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,309
I'm fine.

35
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,390
Mom? Mom?

36
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,094
Where's Foreman?

37
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,658
He's down here somewhere.

38
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,102
"Somewhere." Very helpful.

39
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:27,107
Do you have any idea
when he's getting out tonight?

40
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,472
Sometime.

41
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,840
I realize you can't predict.

42
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,506
I just thought you might be able
to estimate. It's Valentines Day.

43
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,208
I've planned a surprise getaway.

44
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,511
Get away.

45
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,410
Get away.

46
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,188
Get away.

47
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,527
Is my mom okay?

48
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,224
She's gone to surgery.

49
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:59,130
Foreman, your girlfriend wants to
know if you're available for Valentine's.

50
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,540
Act surprised. What are
you doing down here?

51
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,737
There's a snowstorm. ER's short-staffed.
We're all supposed to be here.

52
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,941
You're supposed to be here.
You're an ass. Act surprised.

53
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,878
This could sting a little.

54
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,882
Can we hurry this
up? Make sure that...

55
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,451
Take your time.
What's your name?

56
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,723
Hannah Morganthal.

57
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,991
You have CIPA,
Hannah Morganthal.

58
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,297
No, I don't.

59
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,533
We have to do x-rays to make
sure you don't have internal injuries,

60
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,268
blood tests to make
sure no infections.

61
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:39,780
EEG for neurological anomalies
and biopsy a spinal nerve.

62
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,612
Congenital insensitivity to pain is one
of the rarest conditions on the planet.

63
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,051
There's only been about
60 documented cases.

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,353
Yeah, and I have seven reasons
to think that she's one of them.

65
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,619
She says she's not.

66
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,558
And that's reason number one.

67
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,961
She knew what it was
without us telling her.

68
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,491
Two, she's still wet from the snow.
She's not shivering. That's odd,

69
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,231
unless she can't sweat
or feel hot and cold.

70
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,205
The ambulance was warm.

71
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,832
I want to see my mother.

72
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,968
Three, scarring around
the lips and tongue.

73
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,569
When she was a baby, she
chewed on herself without feeling it.

74
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,342
I fell through a window
when I was a kid.

75
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,178
Four, when you
cleaned the wound,

76
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,946
she flexed into the cleaner
instead of away from it.

77
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,921
It's hard to fake pain
when you've never felt it.

78
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:27,359
It takes an imaginative leap, Ms.
Morganthal. That's one of them Jew names.

79
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,623
Ashkenazis are a
higher-risk group.

80
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,893
On the other hand, she
says she doesn't have it,

81
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,561
and she'd be dead by now if
she'd never been diagnosed.

82
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:39,128
They killed our Lord.
You're gonna trust them?

83
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,003
She wants to see her mom.
She admits having CIPA,

84
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,944
she knows we're not letting her go
anywhere without a battery of tests.

85
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,446
You said you had seven reasons.

86
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,312
I pulled a number
out of the air.

87
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,645
What, five isn't enough?

88
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,618
Five lame reasons aren't.

89
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,746
I'm taking her to see
her mom as soon as...

90
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,921
I can hit her again
if six isn't enough.

91
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,720
Do the tests.

92
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,329
Need to bail on
the ER. I got a case.

93
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,000
Why are you wearing perfume?

94
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,167
Is this a real case

95
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,144
or one of those imaginary cases
that happen when you're bored?

96
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,736
CIPA.

97
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,248
CIPA is a diagnosis.

98
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,678
Diagnoses happen
at the end of cases.

99
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,948
She's got no idea what's
going on in her body.

100
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,421
There's bound to
be something wrong.

101
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,300
In other words, she
could be perfectly healthy,

102
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,089
but you're curious about
someone who can't feel pain

103
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,892
because you always feel pain,
so you want to go exploring.

104
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,796
She was in a car accident.

105
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,268
She needs x-rays, blood
tests, EEG, nerve biopsy.

106
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,738
I also note that, although snow is
coming down in sheets this morning,

107
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,867
you left your hat at home,
and you used earmuffs.

108
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,411
Do your tests, except for the...

109
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,689
So while everyone else was
just worrying about getting in,

110
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,046
you were concerned
with hat head.

111
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,520
Blind dates are
never a good idea.

112
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:05,789
Only reason to wear a scarf like that is
as a beacon to identify you in a crowd.

113
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,124
Do your tests, except
for the nerve biopsy.

114
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,288
I need the nerve biopsy.
You'd risk paralyzing her.

115
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,524
It's neurological.

116
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,533
You have no evidence of that.

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,330
She tripped.

118
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,237
Do you have any
evidence, other than the fact

119
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,742
that a typically clumsy CIPA
patient tripped on an icy day?

120
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,314
If the EEG reveals a
problem, we can talk then.

121
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,596
Could have left the scarf
at home and just told him

122
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,680
you'd be wearing a
look of desperation.

123
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,787
Spiking on leads C-3 and O-2.

124
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,172
She could be
going into a seizure.

125
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,461
Hello? I think there's
a simpler explanation.

126
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:50,402
You're not gonna find anything.
I'm fine! I want to see my mom!

127
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,465
So sedate her.

128
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,871
She won't consent.

129
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,306
She's a teenager.

130
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,310
No dad. Mom's still in surgery.

131
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,437
What do you want us
to do? Hold her down?

132
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,392
Well, only until you inject her with
a sedative. Then you can let her go.

133
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,644
We tried.

134
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:04,946
Seriously?

135
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,749
She's strong and doesn't care.
We'd have broken something

136
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,999
before we can get her to
sit still enough to inject her.

137
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,118
So break her arm.
She won't mind.

138
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,458
You're cranky. I'm in pain.

139
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,229
Come on, let's go break her arm.

140
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,738
Nurse Shortie, your biznitch, how
long are you going to waste her time?

141
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,569
I'm so glad we're
walking somewhere.

142
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,480
Another 60 feet, and
this conversation is over.

143
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,138
When you guys are out of this
program, Cameron will find somebody,

144
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,705
Chase will find eight
somebodies, and you'll be alone.

145
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,013
Thirty feet. You'll
date, and you'll date,

146
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,730
but you're the ultimate Darwinian.
You have to fight for everything.

147
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,723
Anybody else would
just slow you down. Yeah.

148
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,984
I'm still with her, aren't I?

149
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,150
Yeah.

150
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,104
I can only imagine it's because she
hasn't given you an excuse to break up,

151
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,530
and you don't have the guts
to recognize your own reality.

152
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,800
I want to see my mother.

153
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,097
Hi again.

154
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,215
I'm sure I could say this
without being condescending,

155
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,384
but then you'd get the false
impression that I respect you,

156
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,846
so you're a kid, you're
scared, you're stalling, grow up.

157
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,976
I'm not scared.
I'm never scared.

158
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,450
See? How juvenile was that?

159
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,579
You can't feel pain.
Nothing left but pleasure.

160
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,520
Why don't you tell me
how wonderful that is?

161
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,682
It sucks.

162
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,282
Better than being
in pain all the time.

163
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,055
Get in the chair.

164
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,028
Every morning, I
have to check my eyes

165
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,096
to make sure I didn't
scratch a cornea in my sleep.

166
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,533
Oh, God, stop. I'm
in a pool of tears here.

167
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,601
I can't cry.

168
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,967
Neither can I.

169
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:35,674
Every morning, I check
my eyes for jaundice

170
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,337
in case the Vicodin's
finally shot my liver.

171
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,676
I can't run anywhere
without examining all my toes

172
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,739
for swelling. I can't run.

173
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,411
Boys can't hold me for too
long because I can overheat.

174
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:48,649
Girls can't hold me for too long
because I only pay for an hour.

175
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,522
I need an alarm on my watch to
remind me to go to the bathroom.

176
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,152
Know how many humiliating
experiences before I thought of that?

177
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,959
Bathroom is 50 feet from
my office. Every drink of water,

178
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,465
I weigh the pros and cons.

179
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,660
After everything
I do, I self-check.

180
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:05,102
Mouth, tongue, gums for cuts,
count teeth, check temperature,

181
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,141
fingers, toes and joints
for swelling, skin for bruises.

182
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,904
I got shot.

183
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,377
I sat on a stove when I was
three. Want to see the coil marks?

184
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,885
Yeah. You think I'm lying?

185
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,864
You think I would just want
to check out your <i>tuchus,</i>

186
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,823
as your people would say?

187
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:37,470
Put her in the chair and run the damn
test. If she moves again, give her nitrous.

188
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,116
You weren't shot because of leg pain.
You were shot because you're a jerk.

189
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,541
Some think the
two are connected.

190
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,948
He didn't have to do that.

191
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,646
Yeah, he did.

192
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,983
I'm sick?

193
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,148
No, your EEG was normal.

194
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,885
X-ray showed no break.

195
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,118
Blood tests showed no
infections. Urine indicated no...

196
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,524
Hannah?

197
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,833
Call a code! Oh, God.

198
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,027
Need ice packs
and cooling blankets.

199
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,772
Got saline in there?
She's not flushed.

200
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,240
She's not sweating.
You must be...

201
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,368
She has a temperature of 105.

202
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,060
Wow, she's actually sick.

203
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,689
We got her temperature down
below boiling. It could be infection.

204
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,168
No, LP showed normal
proteins and no white blood cells.

205
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,466
High bilirubin. Could
be a liver problem.

206
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,371
Nope, transaminases were
normal. Could be drugs.

207
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,874
She's smoked pot
since she was 11.

208
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,638
No again. Tox screen was clean.

209
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,990
We're doing this case backwards.

210
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,605
We do the tests, and
then she gets sick?

211
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,673
Maybe we did something to her.
Maybe she got sick after the tests.

212
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,615
We should rerun them.

213
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,715
And biopsy a spinal nerve.

214
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,816
You want to risk paralysis
because she's got a fever?

215
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,295
I want to risk paralysis because I
don't know what's causing the fever.

216
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,956
If it's neurological...
It's a fever.

217
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:16,662
In a CIPA patient. Obviously things are
a little different in her upstairs wiring.

218
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,466
And have been since
the day she was born.

219
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,938
Yeah, it's much more likely

220
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,703
that whatever it is was
cleverly waiting and hiding

221
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,141
until you guys
were done testing.

222
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,303
Where are you going?

223
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,904
You're all against this, right?

224
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:31,975
And you're all gonna stand on
principle and refuse to do it, right?

225
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,854
I'm going to get
Cuddy's approval.

226
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,791
How long are we going to keep
Hannah in the dark about her mother?

227
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,955
Long as possible.

228
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,965
Side airbags should be standard.

229
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,933
I'm sure she'll agree.

230
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,333
She should know
her mother's situation.

231
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,104
Breaking that news is
that surgeon's problem.

232
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,305
Any word from House?

233
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,471
No.

234
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,673
Well, maybe Cuddy will say no.

235
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,316
Cuddy never says no.

236
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,579
That's not true.

237
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,622
Nobody ever says
no. We don't say no.

238
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,020
You don't say no.

239
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,955
He'll come back.
He'll browbeat us.

240
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:16,326
He'll give us seven reasons, and eventually
we'll fold. We all will, not just me.

241
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,397
The only way we can avoid
biopsying this kid's spine

242
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,906
is to find the answer
some other way.

243
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,096
All the tests were negative.

244
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,536
We need a better history.

245
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,130
How much more
paperwork do you need?

246
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,937
We've got pediatric records,
a few dozen ER records,

247
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,342
our own admission questionnaire.

248
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,072
What's the first question?

249
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,843
Insurance coverage.

250
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,213
Okay, second question.

251
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,945
Just make your point.

252
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,217
"Where does it hurt?"

253
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,423
If we knew where it hurt,
we could diagnose her.

254
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,686
You do know CIPA
means she can't feel pain.

255
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,593
No, CIPA means
she's insensitive to pain.

256
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,131
She still has scattered nerve
fibers that could conduct pain,

257
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,565
but the signals don't
make it to the brain.

258
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:59,163
What if we give her more pain
signals, a lot more pain signals?

259
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,002
Maybe some of them
will make it through.

260
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,337
You want to torture her?

261
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,274
No.

262
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,246
Yes, we do this to
anybody else, it's torture.

263
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,249
Doing it to her is no
different than pricking a finger.

264
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,217
We keep poking
sharp sticks into her,

265
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,845
eventually we'll find the
part that's already tender.

266
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,621
So what does a
Dean of Medicine do?

267
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,130
Oh, can we please
not talk about that?

268
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,259
I will talk about anything else. I'm
just trying to get away from work.

269
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:32,567
Metaphorically, because
geographically, the coffee place

270
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,767
around the corner from the hospital
probably isn't the furthest you could get.

271
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,276
Well, the snow!

272
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,403
The roads are clearing,

273
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,608
but it's a good place
to beat a retreat from.

274
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,649
You usually expect
your dates to go wrong?

275
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,881
Experience has taught
me to have an escape route.

276
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,515
Well, low expectations,
that's in my favor.

277
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,633
Whatever happens, I
need you to understand

278
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,503
that there are certain aspects
to my life I'm not happy about.

279
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,339
Need a nerve biopsy.

280
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,502
And you had to come here
personally to tell me that?

281
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,137
And how did you
even know I was here?

282
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,205
I had to bring the file,

283
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:20,242
and this was the most noncommittal
location in walking distance.

284
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,787
You left your car keys in
your desk. Greg House.

285
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,959
You two must have met online.

286
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,258
Either that, or you've got a
friend who secretly hates you.

287
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,864
Don Herrick.

288
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,735
Yeah, we connected through
SingleBallroomDanceLovers.com.

289
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,839
Why would he volunteer
that information?

290
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,173
Why would I hide it?

291
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,772
You didn't tell him that anything
he said would be held against you?

292
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,817
So what line of work are you in?

293
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,183
Auto maintenance,
changing oil and filters.

294
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:58,122
Great, 'cause my place overcharges.
Can't trust anything you guys say.

295
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,215
Where are you located?

296
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,319
In 14 states. I
own Eastern Lube.

297
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,892
Most CIPA complications are
infection, and she's got a fever.

298
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,098
LP? Urine?

299
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,697
Clean. Normal.

300
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,675
Same with the
white-blood-cell count.

301
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,677
Cancer? Nothing on the scan.

302
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,089
I think it's her nerves messing
with the temperature control.

303
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,878
Amyloid, sarcoid,
there's a lot of candidates.

304
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,441
I want a biopsy.

305
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,317
Fine, if that's what
you need, go get it.

306
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:36,795
He seems a lot nicer than that one
from WiccaNeedsADaddyFigure.com.

307
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,103
One of these is warm,

308
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,144
and the other is very hot.

309
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:56,775
Start here. Move to the hot one.
Just a few seconds, then back.

310
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,251
We're gonna monitor activity
in your brain while you do it.

311
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,882
If you feel any response to the heat,
it could indicate a vascular problem.

312
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,522
How's my mom doing?

313
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,363
<i>She's okay. Do
you feel anything?</i>

314
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,400
No.

315
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,233
What does "okay" mean?

316
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,501
<i>She's still in surgery.</i>

317
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,042
They tell me it's going okay.

318
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,737
<i>Can you take your hand out?</i>

319
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,177
And you didn't
ask anything else?

320
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,338
Take your hand out of the water.

321
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,384
What's going on with my mother?

322
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,682
Hannah!

323
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,557
You just got
second-degree burns.

324
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:44,486
I'll be fine. What's going on with
my mother? Is she gonna die?

325
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,931
They said she's
okay. Surgery this long

326
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,468
is typical when there
are internal injuries.

327
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,966
Naloxone and kinase proteins in.

328
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,134
And that's gonna
make me feel pain?

329
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,720
I didn't feel anything when you
guys screwed this thing into my head.

330
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,237
It'll replace missing chemicals in
your nerves, heighten sensitivity.

331
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,614
We're gonna be drilling
directly into your skull.

332
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,313
A response should
indicate sarcoma.

333
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,048
What does it feel like?

334
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,113
It hurts.

335
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,350
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,260
Bone pain is the worst
there is, so you need

337
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,801
to let me know as soon
as you feel anything.

338
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,267
She's ready.

339
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,202
So, what, I just sit here while
you guys drill a hole in me?

340
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,303
You wanna talk?

341
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:36,274
Just you and your mom, huh?
You two must be pretty close.

342
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,753
We were, until I got
arrested. Third time.

343
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,988
Drugs? Fights.

344
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:44,749
You got an advantage.

345
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,419
Not really. Never
know when to stop.

346
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:51,555
You piss a lot of people off, or are
you just trying to piss off your mom?

347
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,931
Those are pretty much the
only two choices you have.

348
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:03,899
Hannah? You want us to
stop? Stop the drill! Stop the drill!

349
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,221
It's okay. What did you feel?

350
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:20,058
Where did you feel it? Hannah,
I need to know how it hurt.

351
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,064
Hannah!

352
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,442
I am so tired of
this. Did you know

353
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,343
that the new nurse from Cardiology
is sleeping with that weird lawyer

354
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,436
from the board?

355
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,277
The guy with 11 fingers?

356
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,340
He has 11 fingers?

357
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,386
How do you not notice that?

358
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,713
The nurse used to be a man.

359
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,088
She's not anymore? But
we can't talk about that.

360
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,070
I thought we were. We were
supposed to talk about that.

361
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:58,553
I came here to talk about that, but
on the way up, I ran into Cameron.

362
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:01,100
You've got a CIPA patient?

363
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,931
Tranny nurse is
more interesting.

364
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,404
Oh, it's way more interesting, but instead
I've got to be your damn conscience.

365
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,984
I'm tired of being your conscience.
I don't enjoy being your conscience.

366
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,909
No one enjoys...
You're studying her.

367
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,069
She's actually sick.

368
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,340
Which you found out
after you took her on.

369
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,508
I was curious. Since I'm not
a cat, that's not dangerous.

370
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,985
I don't think that metaphor was
designed to actually warn cats.

371
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,181
You don't care about her
illness. You care about CIPA,

372
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,521
which means your focus is gonna
be on getting your answers, not hers.

373
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,187
Thank you. Forewarned
is forearmed.

374
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,059
What do you think
you're gonna figure out?

375
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,965
Do you think her lack of pain is
somehow the answer to your pain?

376
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,629
I think if you'd stop
talking to Cameron,

377
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:41,868
then right now we could be
ranking nurses in order of do-ability.

378
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,705
I need you. What did
the nerve biopsy show?

379
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,108
Never did it. Well, then do it.

380
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,509
Can't. Why?

381
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,081
She's gonna jump
off the lobby balcony.

382
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,946
You think I can catch her?

383
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,213
Get away from me!
I'm not gonna hurt you.

384
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,884
Yes, you are. You're just
jealous I can do anything.

385
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,860
Hannah, you're having
a paranoid delusion.

386
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,054
I don't believe you.

387
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,427
Did you think she would?

388
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,831
This is real. You want me to
be in pain. You even said so.

389
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,529
If we wanted to hurt
you, we'd let you jump.

390
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,367
Just let me see my mother.

391
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,169
Fine, we'll take you to
our OR observation room.

392
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,176
I don't believe you!
Your mother is fine.

393
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,337
I just spoke to her
surgeon. I don't believe you!

394
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,143
Hannah, what do you want from
us? What do you want us to do?

395
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,607
I can't feel my legs.

396
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,924
You're trying to pull the
same stunt twice in 10 minutes.

397
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:32,584
I'm not pretending. They don't
hurt. They're just... They're...

398
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,443
Anything? We're
not looking for pain.

399
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,773
Anything at all? Pressure?

400
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:53,972
Nothing.

401
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,744
You have six broken bones, a fever,
a concussion, erratic heart rhythms

402
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,446
and a complete lack of
sensation below the waist.

403
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,545
I feel fine.

404
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,253
Is my mother out of surgery yet?

405
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,657
Not yet.

406
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,119
This is excellent.

407
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,961
The paranoia seems
to have dissipated,

408
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,524
but her vitals keep getting
worse. She could be dead in hours.

409
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,554
But if you're gonna die
a miserable, lingering

410
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:20,972
death, pain-free
is the way to do it.

411
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,975
Are we sure the fall
didn't cause the paralysis?

412
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:27,571
The paralysis caused the fall.
Spine's clean. No vertebral fractures

413
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,114
or spinal cord compression.

414
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,649
Even better.

415
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:34,710
The nuttiness and paralysis mean there's
definitely a neurological component.

416
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,153
Could be a nerve disease.

417
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:39,056
Which is why we need to look at
the nerve that you didn't biopsy.

418
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,319
There are other tests.

419
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,293
HIV? Syphilis?

420
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:47,230
She was negative for all STDs.
Vascular? No, ANA was negative.

421
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,325
Cerebral clot? No, MRI was...

422
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,029
Thyroid storm.

423
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:57,839
Makes sense given her glucose
reaction was slow, and potassium's down.

424
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:03,309
Yeah, I'll check with
an endocrinologist.

425
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,611
Bennett's on call.

426
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,844
Perfect.

427
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,558
No. Need a consult.

428
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,728
I already okayed
your nerve biopsy.

429
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,293
Need an endocrinologist.

430
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,371
Bennett's on call.

431
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,565
Won't pick up.

432
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,972
His cell phone must be broken.

433
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,475
Mine's working.

434
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,101
Had to give you the file.

435
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,279
I assume you're thinking thyroid
storm. Have you done a hormone panel?

436
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,843
Normal. TSH was on the low side.

437
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,252
Is that a cheery fire I
hear crackling nearby?

438
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:49,056
No, what about CPK enzymes?

439
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:50,790
Elevated, 275.

440
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:56,492
People light fires for themselves,
but then they don't deny it.

441
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,064
He's here?

442
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,401
CPK isn't high enough.

443
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,874
Potassium's what you'd expect
because of the bronchodilators.

444
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,004
Oh, my God! You're
not wearing a bra.

445
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,479
It's not thyroid storm.

446
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,606
You just met him.

447
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,877
I like him,

448
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,546
and I like sex. Do I need
to stitch a letter on my tops?

449
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,284
No. Might be worth taking
out an ad in the local papers.

450
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,894
Do you like me, House?

451
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:30,233
I was on the phone with Bennett 15
minutes ago. His cell phone's working.

452
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,397
Your MO is to
avoid me at all costs,

453
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,500
and suddenly you need my input on
every move you make. I can only assume

454
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,942
it's because I'm on a date.

455
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,172
When we met, I noticed...

456
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,791
You noticed he was a Shriner
because of the way he parted his hair.

457
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,427
You noticed he was a mama's boy
because of the way he blinked his left eye.

458
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,943
I'm not interested.
I'm not impressed.

459
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,047
There are only two reasons anyone
would want to screw with me tonight.

460
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,853
Either they're an
altruistic decent person

461
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:57,920
who's worried about my well-being,
or they want me for themselves.

462
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,563
You left out the third option.

463
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:06,127
Evil bastard who just wants to
mess with other people's happiness.

464
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,077
Good night, House.

465
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,916
We won't be bothered again.

466
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,963
It's late. I should go.

467
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,157
Why?

468
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,995
I part my hair on the
left, and I'm a Shriner?

469
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,799
You heard the conversation?

470
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,004
I'm not interested in him.

471
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,268
I don't blame you.

472
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:45,573
I only said those things so
that he wouldn't come back.

473
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:52,580
I don't really care
about my job. I do it well.

474
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,985
I provide a service, but my goal
was always to make enough money

475
00:25:56,055 --> 00:26:00,686
to do the things I really
like. Music, travel...

476
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,853
I like those things, too.

477
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,387
You like them, but they're
not really important to you.

478
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:11,960
I don't know whether it's House,
your job, or you just thrive on conflict,

479
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,838
but you should hear yourself
when you're talking to him.

480
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:23,977
Nothing else in the world's going on.
You're focused, confident, compelling.

481
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:32,955
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'd like to go out with that woman.

482
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,655
I can get her on the phone.

483
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,510
Where did you go?
She's getting worse.

484
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,480
It's not thyroid storm.
Give me a spinal nerve.

485
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,106
There are still other tests.

486
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,626
She just said the
girl is getting worse.

487
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,642
You really want to wait?

488
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,405
We'll be risking infection,
maybe make the paralysis worse.

489
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,763
It is worse, and we're making it
worse than worse? Do the biopsy.

490
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,324
We could paralyze her and
get no useful information.

491
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,767
Do the biopsy.

492
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,247
If you're thinking
peripheral neuropathy,

493
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,082
we should take a nerve a
little further away from the spine.

494
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,666
A little further from the
truth. We're talking paralysis.

495
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,870
There's a good chance
the spine is relevant.

496
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:29,108
If this thing is progressing,
it could kill her in hours.

497
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,411
Give me back my papers.

498
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,112
Is he asking for a spinal nerve?

499
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,717
How did you know?

500
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,051
Give us a minute.

501
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:48,398
Did you know they recently found a
protein that speeds up nerve growth?

502
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,198
Fascinating stuff. If
you put that protein

503
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,966
with the insulation
from a spinal nerve,

504
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,906
you could grow your own little
garden. If that spinal nerve...

505
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:59,206
Yeah, yeah, yeah, if it happened
to come from a person with CIPA,

506
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,477
I can grow pain-free nerves and graft
them into my own leg. What an evil plan!

507
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,848
You'd have to be on
immunosuppressors for life.

508
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,978
Risk of infection,
shorter lifespan...

509
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,954
Shorter but normal.

510
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:15,417
Usually jealousy expresses itself by
trying to destroy what someone has.

511
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:19,226
You're more ambitious. You
actually want to change medical fact

512
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,391
to get this thing...

513
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,093
Medical fact
changes all the time.

514
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,527
You're risking
your patient's life.

515
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,367
That's how medical fact changes.

516
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,461
A doctor risks...

517
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,803
To serve their patient's health,

518
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:29,898
not their own.

519
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,238
This is medically justified.

520
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:36,840
Are you sure? Are you sure that you're
the right one to be making this call?

521
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,955
Biopsy whatever nerve you
figure you could safely get at.

522
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,564
God, Wilson's annoying.

523
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:00,295
Past 3:00 a.m. on
Valentine's Day night.

524
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,864
I assume you had
a date with Wendy.

525
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,910
She'll survive. She
knows the deal.

526
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:07,105
You're lucky. I know.

527
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,648
Someday, when there's time, I
would like to actually have a social life.

528
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,050
Someday? Come on.

529
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,987
If there's one thing a good-looking
woman can have whenever she wants,

530
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,079
it's a social life.

531
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,749
You mean a sex life.

532
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,953
There's nothing wrong
with a little companionship

533
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,359
until the real
thing comes along.

534
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,657
I had the real thing.

535
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,199
Forgive me if I
don't want to settle.

536
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,826
Right. What does that mean?

537
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:31,469
Nothing.

538
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,528
You think I didn't
have the real thing?

539
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,938
I have no idea what you had.

540
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,874
And yet you're judging it.

541
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,411
It's late. I'm cranky. Sorry.

542
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,040
I didn't have the real thing.

543
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,345
How could you even know?

544
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,352
You married a dying man.

545
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,588
You thought, "Six months,
a year, it'll be tough,

546
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,126
"but then I'll recover, and
I'll have the rest of my life."

547
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,220
It's like willingly getting the flu or
joining the Peace Corps, short-term.

548
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:02,701
Wow, you nailed it. It's
basically like a wasted weekend.

549
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:07,900
The sacrifices you made were huge, but they
were at the height of your love for him.

550
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,434
Commitment is only commitment
because it has no expiration date.

551
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:17,176
You stand next to someone and watch them
floss for 30 years like my parents have,

552
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:20,686
then ask for sacrifices. That's
how you know the real thing.

553
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,794
Cameron, I wasn't
criticizing you.

554
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:39,904
People who avoid commitment are
people who know what a big thing it is.

555
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,541
This isn't right.

556
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,284
CIPA can't cause this
much degeneration.

557
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,587
A few nerve fibers we teased out of
the center have some insulation left,

558
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,287
but the insulation around the
bundles has been stripped bare.

559
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,401
Means the damage must
be coming from the outside in.

560
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:08,400
Which means it's secondary demyelination,
which means the source is somewhere else,

561
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:10,129
which tells us it's
not a nerve disease.

562
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,400
It's something systemic
that's affecting the nerves,

563
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:16,271
which means that we need to...

564
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,105
Where are you going?

565
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,042
Kid's mom is
finally out of surgery.

566
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,645
I'll be right back.

567
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,278
So what?

568
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,753
Hannah should see her.

569
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,917
Yes, immediately after we're
done chatting about saving her life.

570
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,484
Most likely causes
are metabolic.

571
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,521
They found brain swelling. They're
prepping her mother for another surgery.

572
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:43,399
Again, so what? Get
a nurse to take the kid.

573
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,098
There are more than 60
different metabolic conditions

574
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,616
that could account for what she's
got. There's only three of you guys.

575
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,166
She's scared. She should be.

576
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,973
She'll die if we
don't diagnose her.

577
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,740
So diagnose her.

578
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,122
Mom?

579
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:30,340
How bad is it? Are you okay?

580
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,352
I'm okay, Mom.

581
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,651
I'll get better. I
always get better.

582
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:40,453
Are you checking
yourself, your temperature?

583
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,098
Mom, could you just let it
go? You shouldn't be worrying.

584
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,769
Baby, I'm sorry.

585
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,829
I should have seen
that car coming.

586
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:58,366
No, Mom, I did this to
myself. I screwed up.

587
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:03,345
You were right. You were
right, and I was wrong.

588
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,180
No. No.

589
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:11,382
I shouldn't have gone out on the
ice. I shouldn't have fallen down,

590
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:17,060
and I shouldn't have made you rush
me to an ER for the 10th time this year.

591
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,668
Mom?

592
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,666
Mom? You okay?

593
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,272
They have to take
her back to surgery.

594
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:37,077
Hannah, your BP is way up.
We need to get you some rest.

595
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,013
My hand's wet.

596
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,812
You're crying.

597
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,414
I can't cry.

598
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,296
My head's killing me.

599
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,910
So what does the pain tell us?

600
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,969
No tingling or itching,
so we can rule out...

601
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,982
It tells us nothing. It wasn't
physical pain. It was emotional.

602
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,281
Exactly. What were they doing
when she got the headache?

603
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,411
Saying goodbye.

604
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,955
You said they were arguing.

605
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,116
They weren't really arguing.
She was just frustrated.

606
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,658
What were they arguing about?

607
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,284
Whose fault it was.

608
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:28,396
Peripheral neuropathy, fever
and intermittent paranoia.

609
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:33,063
Lots of metabolic conditions can
explain those things. What if we add guilt?

610
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,640
Guilt? As a symptom?

611
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:40,076
Alzheimer's can cause
euphoria, pain causes depression,

612
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:44,480
and B12 deficiency causes
guilt, along with all that other stuff.

613
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,519
If she felt guilty, she wouldn't be
making her mother's life miserable.

614
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,463
She wouldn't be getting
in fights, getting arrested.

615
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,683
Maybe she's fighting
because she feels guilty.

616
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,302
She's showing her mom she can
take stupid risks and still be safe.

617
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,385
Means mom can let go.

618
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,723
Which is rational.

619
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,821
If guilt is a symptom,
it's caused by the illness,

620
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:01,196
not by a thought process,
and it would have to be new.

621
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,777
Couple years ago, she
was a model student.

622
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,779
This is pointless. If the
headache was caused by guilt,

623
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,237
she has a B12 deficiency.

624
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,304
If it's just because she
was sad, it's meaningless.

625
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,653
How the hell do
we test for that?

626
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,835
We don't.

627
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:14,903
Give her a shot of B12. When
she gets better, I was right.

628
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,111
We already did. ER gave her
B12 when she was admitted,

629
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:24,088
part of a multivitamin supplement.
Apparently, she's just sad.

630
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,492
Why are you still here?

631
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:35,125
Trying to get a couple pages into a
drug trial. Paperwork's due tomorrow.

632
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,293
Why are you here?

633
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:38,337
Still haven't figured out why.

634
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:40,770
No, I meant here, in my office.

635
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:45,470
Just dumped a cool B12
theory. Moved on to leukemia.

636
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,336
Very pedestrian.

637
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,881
I'm not happy.

638
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,051
Her white-blood-cell
count was low.

639
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:56,919
The ones she's got, it's
just a lot of eosinophils.

640
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,284
The immunoglobulin
E-level's borderline.

641
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,826
If you want to be 100%
sure, check the bone marrow.

642
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,419
The team's doing
a biopsy right now.

643
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:10,429
It turns out the
weird lawyer knew

644
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,993
that she used to be a man.

645
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,265
And he's cool with that?

646
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,934
Turns out that his previous
girlfriend also used to be a man.

647
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,669
Yeah.

648
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,714
Is it possible for you
to just watch me eat,

649
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:34,925
or do you get some primeval thrill out
of beating the other hunters to the food?

650
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,193
See you later.

651
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,906
You still haven't figured out
that I don't need sedation?

652
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,909
It's so you don't move
during the procedure.

653
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,905
Is that nitrous? What,
are you trying to kill her?

654
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,946
We gave her nitrous
during the EEG.

655
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,461
That's what made
this thing rear its ugly...

656
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:01,646
What thing?

657
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,915
B12 deficiency.

658
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,114
Are you having déjà vu?

659
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:07,284
We've had this conversation. She
was given B12. She didn't get better.

660
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,886
Because someone else
ate it. Get an abdominal MRI.

661
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:15,297
What? What are you
doing? Don't touch me!

662
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,197
Don't touch me! See?
There's she goes.

663
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,464
Don't touch me! Another
paranoid delusion.

664
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:24,169
At the rate she's going downhill,
forget the MRI. We need an OR.

665
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,301
Leave me alone!

666
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,004
Occupied!

667
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,240
Her hernia can wait.

668
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:31,044
Help! They're trying to kill me!

669
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:34,484
Okay, you can either believe
that we really are trying to kill her,

670
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,181
or you can assume she's
suffering from a medical condition.

671
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,850
Seeing as this is a hospital,
and we're all dressed like doctors,

672
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,790
and there are easier
ways to kill somebody...

673
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,125
Bev, help them. I'm
gonna need iodine,

674
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:48,189
scalpel numbers 10 and 15,
forceps and a largish salad bowl.

675
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,533
Okay, hold her down.

676
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,273
Come on, weenie,
she's in a cast.

677
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,473
Swab.

678
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,444
Fifteen.

679
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,073
You're not gonna
anesthetize her?

680
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,414
Relax. It's just a magic trick.

681
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:14,123
She's faking it. We're
not falling for it this time.

682
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,096
Okay, keep that retracted.

683
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,031
Forceps.

684
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:43,853
Lake fishing can be fun. It can
bring the generations together.

685
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:47,586
But if you don't cook
that trout or perch well,

686
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,686
you'll be giving room
and board to this fellow,

687
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,991
and by "free board," I mean
all the B12 you can take in.

688
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,796
I could have a tapeworm in me?

689
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,394
Not likely. You'd
be in a lot of pain.

690
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,539
It's gotta be 25 feet long.

691
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,583
Damn it. World record's over 60.

692
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:25,020
Hannah, wake up.
Somebody here to see you.

693
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,033
She's got limited
motion on her left side.

694
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,369
You might have to take
care of her for a while.

695
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,669
You don't feel it, but you're
about to rip your stitches out.

696
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:44,079
Take care of yourself. Then
you can take care of her.

697
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,589
You haven't gone home.

698
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,994
Sorry I screwed
up Valentine's day.

699
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:04,434
I'm dating a doctor. I'd be an
idiot to expect anything else.

700
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:08,598
I did get you a gift. MGH.

701
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,377
Best teaching
hospital in Boston.

702
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:16,346
You want to be a nurse
practitioner? That's as good as it gets.

703
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:20,515
I made a few calls, and
you're in if you want in.

704
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:24,746
This is why you've been helping me
get my surgical hours for accreditation.

705
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,121
I thought you wanted... Stupid.

706
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,629
You've got 10 feet of
personal space around you.

707
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:36,167
I step forward, you step back.

708
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,964
I've shared a lot
of things with you.

709
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,198
Which is why you're
breaking up with me.

710
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,275
You can't stand to be close.

711
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:48,040
Wendy, you think I'll stay with
you because you're angry with me?

712
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,774
I'm upset

713
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,283
because I care.

714
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,721
Only you'd expect an
argument to be rational,

715
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,256
you and that ass boss of yours.

716
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:28,247
Well, you could ask
her for the spinal nerve.

717
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,811
She's got no reason to give it.

718
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,117
She owes you.

719
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,725
The hospital will
send her a bill.

720
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:40,722
I'm just saying, if you want to do
it, do it while her B12 is still low.

721
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,892
Guilt can be your friend.

722
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,965
Breakfast?

723
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,541
Yeah.

724
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,850
Happy Valentine's Day.

725
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,546
Holiday that only applies to
people who are already paired up.

726
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,646
For everyone else,
it's Wednesday.

727
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:08,022
Wow, thank you for
that dash of cold water.

728
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,391
Don't get me wrong. I still
think true love's out there.

729
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,863
It's just very far away,
possibly in another galaxy.

730
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,127
We may need to develop
faster-than-light travel

731
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,294
before we can make contact.

732
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,897
So I'm thinking we
should have sex.

733
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,674
That makes sense.

734
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,042
Despite the wisdom of pop songs,

735
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:31,105
there's no point putting our lives
on hold until love comes along.

736
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:35,984
We're both healthy and busy people.
We work together so it's convenient.

737
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,613
Like microwave pizza.

738
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:38,899
And of all the
people I work with,

739
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,722
you're the one I'm least
likely to fall in love with.

740
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,989
Like microwave pizza.

741
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,897
The point here is to make things
simpler, not more complicated.

742
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,560
Someday, there'll be time to
get serious about someone.

743
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:54,197
Meanwhile, we already had sex
once and didn't get weird about it, so...

744
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:59,609
I get it. I get it. So what if I'm
offended by your judgment?

745
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,044
Then you're not the
man I'm looking for.
