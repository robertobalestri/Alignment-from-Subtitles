1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:05,067
Adam, eyes here.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,868
Follow my finger.

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:14,176
Adam, show me a bicycle.

4
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,587
Eyes here.

5
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:31,295
Adam, show me a bicycle.

6
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,506
No, buddy, that's a ball.

7
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,286
Adam, look at me.
Are you hungry?

8
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,083
Show me what you want for lunch.

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,177
He's still drawing those lines
instead of looking at the cards.

10
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,714
More juice?

11
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,376
If he wants more juice,
he has to ask for it.

12
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,087
Adam, buddy, eyes here.

13
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,317
He's tired, Dom.

14
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,985
He wouldn't be if we
stuck to the schedule.

15
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,763
Show me the juice, buddy.

16
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,474
I think we've reached the
point of diminishing returns.

17
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,763
He has to ask for it. Adam.

18
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,227
He's choking.

19
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,769
That's impossible.
It's mac and cheese.

20
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,849
Ten-year-old boy who
screams for his life for no reason.

21
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,512
He's autistic.
Severely autistic.

22
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,617
Can't talk, can't
make eye contact.

23
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,955
Screaming is probably
his way of communicating.

24
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,962
And he went to three different
doctors who all said just that.

25
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,328
So, clearly that
can't be the answer.

26
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,957
His brain can't
filter information.

27
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:49,492
It's a constant assault on
his senses. I'd scream, too.

28
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:53,062
Or it's something
medical-sounding, like dysesthesia.

29
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,406
Parents are convinced that there's
something wrong with their son.

30
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,372
Since when did we start believing
parents? Or anyone? Where are we going?

31
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,845
Elevator.

32
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,582
Dad was on Wall Street, Mom
was a partner in an accounting firm.

33
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,832
When their son was diagnosed
with autism, they both quit.

34
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,835
So they're over-protective and scared.
That's all the more reason to discount...

35
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,088
They study this kid.

36
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,427
Heard him scream a million times,
but in ten years of caring for him,

37
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,175
this is the first time they've
brought him to a hospital.

38
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,634
ER checked his throat.
No obstructions, nothing.

39
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,212
Which means the only
symptom was a scream,

40
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,727
which is diagnostic of nothing.

41
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,934
Kid clutched his chest, BP was
elevated, maybe there was chest pain.

42
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,977
ER said the heart was fine.

43
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,602
Don't be so quick
to dismiss pain.

44
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,840
Where are we going? Down.

45
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,883
Stool sample to
check for parasites,

46
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,885
blood culture to rule out
infection, and ANA for lupus.

47
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,352
Because he screamed?

48
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,389
Could also be an
environmental reaction.

49
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,982
An allergy. Dust, wheat, pollen,

50
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,220
a toxin or something
he ate. Check the house.

51
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,126
And run a lung ventilation scan.

52
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,596
Lungs are in the
chest, too, right?

53
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,141
I had a date last
night, she screamed.

54
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,976
Should we spend a hundred
thousand dollars testing her?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,765
Of course not. This
isn't a veterinary hospital.

56
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,749
Look, if you don't think
this kid is worth saving...

57
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,071
That's not what I'm saying.

58
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,632
That's too bad. It
was a good point.

59
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,610
Kid's just a lump with tonsils.

60
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:05,822
You know what
it's going to be like

61
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,338
trying to put an autistic
kid into a nuclear scanner?

62
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,281
I don't envy you guys.

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,352
I want my old carpet back.

64
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:22,285
We're going to have to do this later.
A kid in the clinic had an accident.

65
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,923
Generally, when people
are on the phone...

66
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,694
I want my old carpet back.

67
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,099
It was stained with blood.

68
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,728
Yeah, my blood, which
makes the carpet part of me.

69
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,966
I want it back. I want
to be buried with it.

70
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,167
You think you can get me
to do anything you want,

71
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,177
regardless of how stupid it is?

72
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,304
It's my office.
It's where I work,

73
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,544
where I think, where I save lives,
allowing you to brag to rich people,

74
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,076
so they'll give you more money
to spend on MRIs and low-cut tops.

75
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,918
I want it back the way it was.

76
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,515
It's identical to
the old carpet.

77
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,026
Except without the
hazardous biological waste.

78
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:58,498
I shall not return to my office until
every patented, durable micro-fiber

79
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,261
has been restored
to its rightful place.

80
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,665
Inspiring.

81
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,747
If you don't want to work in
your office, work in the clinic.

82
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,230
If you don't want to work in the
clinic, go home. And don't get paid.

83
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:13,940
Attica! Attica!
Attica! Attica! Attica!

84
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,145
Attica?

85
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,650
He just needs
to finish this level.

86
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,784
We only have the scanner
for the next half hour.

87
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,419
After that... Trust me,

88
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,055
you don't want to move
him until he's finished.

89
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:35,091
The sooner we do this test, the
sooner we can get you guys home.

90
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,300
Adam, do you think that...

91
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:45,937
No.

92
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,815
Ten minutes. Tops.

93
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,580
If he has a vascular
disorder, he might not have...

94
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,917
He might not have ten minutes?

95
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,547
I don't have ten minutes.

96
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,992
No! No! You don't want
to do that. Adam? Adam?

97
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,396
I used Metamucil
like the doctor told me

98
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,166
and finally I was able
to use the bathroom.

99
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:17,667
But I saw something in
the toilet I couldn't identify.

100
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:22,209
I wrapped it in tissue paper,
so you could take a look.

101
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,815
Can't you sedate
him or something?

102
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,587
I could if I didn't want the
test results to mean anything.

103
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,402
Painkillers, exercising,

104
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:53,004
we even did that puncture
thing, nothing works.

105
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,941
Then this morning, I get
up, my back feels great.

106
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,778
I figured I'd better get
down here, right away.

107
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,126
Big shocker, Dad's depressed.

108
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,258
Save your time.

109
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,599
SSRIs don't cause chest pain.

110
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,472
Wow.

111
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,606
Every minute of
every day is booked.

112
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,202
When he eats, sleeps,
plays his handheld.

113
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,372
Not much of a life for them.

114
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,567
They chose to have a family.

115
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,143
You don't get to decide what
your kid's going to be like.

116
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,016
Nobody chooses this.

117
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,118
It's funny, you get a
normal kid, the parent works.

118
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,061
You get a special
kid that costs more,

119
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,032
you quit and turn the
backyard into a therapy circuit.

120
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,569
Yes, if only you
were handicapped.

121
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,797
All the good times you
could have had with Dad.

122
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,282
Hi, Doctor House.

123
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,717
Hello, girl whose
name I don't remember,

124
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,660
but whose dad I treated, so I
don't really know why she's here.

125
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:21,066
Ali. I think I caught what
my dad has. The rhino thing.

126
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,797
Right.

127
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,502
Does that hurt?

128
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,700
Little.

129
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,668
It's in my chest, too.

130
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,076
Of course it is.

131
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:45,456
Kind of had access through
the shirt, but this'll work.

132
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,424
That feels good.

133
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:57,530
Exactly when did New Jersey
run out of horny 17-year-old boys?

134
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:01,606
About five weeks ago.
It's been very lonely.

135
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:08,975
The...

136
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,718
The ventilation scan was
normal. Time to send him home.

137
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,383
Can't leave right now.
Well, congratulations.

138
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,017
You are the proud owner of
your very own "rhino thing."

139
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,790
A rhinovirus? You can't
leave because she has a cold?

140
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,798
I can't leave because
Cuddy says I can't leave.

141
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:30,731
All the tests are normal.

142
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,533
Okay, don't start with
me. We're backed up.

143
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,534
I know this is hard for all of
us, but thanks to Doctor Cuddy,

144
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,545
I don't have an office,
so I have to work here.

145
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,171
What did she do to your office?

146
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,715
It's unusable.

147
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,347
So whatever's bothering
him, it wasn't his lungs.

148
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,511
What about the kid's house?

149
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,498
There were some pesticides and some
alcohol, but the tox screen was negative.

150
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,801
Which means there's nothing
physically wrong with this kid.

151
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,624
We already had that
discussion. We get a fecal smear?

152
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,424
Should we do this
someplace else?

153
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,522
No, Cuddy says I
have to work here.

154
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,558
No, I said you can work in your
office, or you had to work here.

155
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,261
And since I can't
work in my office...

156
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,273
Is this your master plan?

157
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,209
Disrupt hospital business
until I replace your carpet?

158
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,247
Devious. Saw it in a
James Bond movie.

159
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,942
Fecal smear! Talk to me.

160
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,540
Get out of here.

161
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,641
Put back my carpet?

162
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,209
No. Get out of here.

163
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,653
Fecal matter. Is there a
sample we can look at?

164
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,419
The parents have a smear
kit. The kid is constipated.

165
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,394
Do what you want. Not
replacing your carpet.

166
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,162
Go up his rear and get a smear.

167
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,859
Which reminds me, I
kind of feel like a bagel.

168
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,770
Carpets.

169
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,007
Need a stool sample.

170
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:50,611
We should probably wait until
he's finished playing that level, huh?

171
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,909
I actually think he's
a bit better today.

172
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,682
He seems more like his old self.

173
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,655
It's possible that
he was never sick.

174
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,158
I guess, we
could've overreacted.

175
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,799
Adam? Adam? Adam? Adam?

176
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,870
So what makes fluid fill
the lining of a kid's lungs?

177
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,847
Why are we in here? Is
this some sort of power play?

178
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:22,939
Yeah.

179
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,885
So, you stuck your finger in the
kid and gave him a pleural effusion?

180
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,013
Have you ever considered
getting a manicure?

181
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,284
I took the stool sample
after his lungs failed.

182
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,135
Or do you really have a
problem with the carpeting?

183
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,491
Change sets you off...

184
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,189
I said it was a power play.

185
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,096
If someone answers yes to option
A, you don't move on to option B.

186
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,710
If there's a pleural effusion,
we have to rule out heart failure.

187
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,033
Why now? Why a power play now?

188
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,571
I smelled weakness.

189
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,204
Get the kid an echocardiogram.

190
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,782
That's funny. It
says, "James Wilson."

191
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,316
That's a strange typo.

192
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,857
The fluid comes back and exudates,
get him on broad spectrum antibiotics.

193
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,194
Thank you for
coming. No problem.

194
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,988
Thought you wouldn't mind
sharing offices for a while.

195
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:18,437
You share stories, feelings,
toys, you don't share offices.

196
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,870
That is so not Zen.

197
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,500
It was a gift.

198
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,378
Some doctors get those.

199
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,879
So, you want
mornings or afternoons?

200
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,644
You couldn't make Cuddy miserable,
so you're going to make me miserable,

201
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,686
so I can make Cuddy
miserable on your behalf?

202
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,776
Yeah.

203
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,913
What makes you think I
can make her miserable?

204
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,480
'Cause you're
good at that stuff.

205
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,116
I'm nothing compared to you.

206
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,402
Is there anything
you'll throw out?

207
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,622
That's a gift from an
eleven-year-old patient of mine.

208
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,893
She and I both knew it was a piece of
junk, and that's what made her laugh.

209
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,560
So you gotta
keep it until she...

210
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,228
She already did.

211
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,175
Adam, I need you
to stay still, buddy.

212
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,616
It's okay. It's okay. I got him.

213
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,354
There we go.

214
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,763
What? What is it?
Is his heart okay?

215
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,227
No.

216
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:32,008
Echo suggested a conduction
abnormality, EKG confirmed it.

217
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,311
Still doesn't explain the effusion.
The pleural fluid was an exudate.

218
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,361
We should be looking for something that
explains both the heart and lung problems.

219
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,752
An infection, parasite, cancer.

220
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,986
Microbiology showed no organisms
in the fluids, so forget infection.

221
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,393
It's not a power play.

222
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,327
Doing a differential in the clinic
makes sense, piss Cuddy off.

223
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,630
Same thing with Wilson's
office, works indirectly.

224
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,399
But now we're in office space

225
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,168
because you don't want
to be in your own office.

226
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,573
Which means this has
nothing to do with Cuddy.

227
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,044
You really are obsessed
with your carpets.

228
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,707
Which means... What
are you doing here?

229
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,148
I have this room
booked from two to three.

230
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,482
Two, East Coast Time?

231
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:19,723
I thought you meant Pacific.
Which is stupid of me, I guess.

232
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,026
What about parasites?

233
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,696
Stool sample's negative.

234
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,891
It's two o'clock.

235
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:30,096
Oh, well. We should go
then. That just leaves cancer.

236
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,797
Get a lung biopsy.

237
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,705
It took a half an hour to get the
mask on the kid for the lung scan.

238
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,903
I'm sorry. Was there
somewhere you needed to be?

239
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,409
House, can we talk?

240
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,324
Carpet? Never.

241
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,518
Nothing to talk about.

242
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,688
Your girlfriend called the clinic
15 times, looking for you today.

243
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,524
Lot to discuss,
china patterns...

244
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,089
House. She's a stalker.

245
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,190
Right.

246
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,829
Couldn't be that she finds me interesting,
attractive, has to be that she's insane.

247
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,874
She's called you 15 times. Your
mother's not that interested in you.

248
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,068
Well maybe I'd be
better adjusted if she was.

249
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,305
I'm notifying security.
Is this about the carpet?

250
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,123
Do you think I'll back
off if you block all my fun?

251
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,638
You better not be having fun.

252
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,377
I'm having fun.
I'm not having sex.

253
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,146
She's dangerous.
She's not dangerous.

254
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,743
She's pretty. She's pretty.

255
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,948
Men are stupid.
I'm with you so far.

256
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,923
I'm notifying security.

257
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,954
Give her a break. She's not
dangerous, she's insightful.

258
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,362
You can't stop our love!

259
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,474
Hey, you got a minute? Yeah.

260
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,339
We have a ten-year-old
with pleural effusion

261
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,640
and conduction abnormality,
but no heart failure.

262
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,236
Was there protein
in the pleural fluid?

263
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,305
Yeah. That's why
we're thinking cancer.

264
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,648
Non-Hodgkin's probably. So
we want to do a lung biopsy.

265
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,416
Lung biopsies usually come back negative,
so biopsy a lymph node under the arm.

266
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,890
That's probably something
an oncologist should do, right?

267
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,927
There's nothing real
tricky to it. It's a biopsy.

268
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,929
Still, just to be
safe. You mind?

269
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:16,565
For the love of God, can't
somebody shut that kid up?

270
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,201
People are trying
to work around here.

271
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,088
Why don't you show him
a teddy bear or something?

272
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,341
Who are you?

273
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,110
Somebody you'll
never send a gift to.

274
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,742
This is Doctor House,
your son's doctor.

275
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,514
High test, please.

276
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,451
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

277
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,585
Out of Vicodin?

278
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,193
What are you doing?

279
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,032
Eating the red berries.

280
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,319
He trusted you.

281
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,796
No, that wasn't trust.
That was self-preservation.

282
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,858
No. That was huge.

283
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,398
It was like a conversation.

284
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:25,174
A monkey's afraid to eat the red berries
until he sees another monkey eat 'em.

285
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,246
Monkey see, monkey
do. That's all it was.

286
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:33,113
Your kid's still just as messed
up as when we admitted him.

287
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,865
That was sensitive.

288
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,527
You have pretty hair.

289
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,069
Hope is all those parents
have going for them.

290
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,939
No, hope is what's
making them miserable.

291
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,678
What they should do
is get a cocker spaniel.

292
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,211
A dog would look
them in the eye,

293
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,615
wag his tail when he's happy,
lick their face, show them love.

294
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,984
Is it so wrong for them to
want to have a normal child?

295
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,114
It's normal to
want to be normal.

296
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,522
Spoken like a true Circle Queen.

297
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,527
See, skinny,
socially-privileged white people

298
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,690
get to draw this
neat little circle.

299
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,529
Everyone inside
the circle is normal.

300
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,866
Everyone outside the
circle should be beaten,

301
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,737
broken and reset, so they
can be brought into the circle.

302
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:31,938
Failing that, they should be
institutionalized, or worse, pitied.

303
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,242
So, it's wrong to feel
sorry for this little boy?

304
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,557
Why would you feel
sorry for someone

305
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,312
who gets to opt out of the
inane courteous formalities,

306
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,877
which are utterly meaningless,
insincere, and therefore, degrading?

307
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,890
This kid doesn't have to pretend
to be interested in your back pain,

308
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,325
or your excretions, or
your grandma's itchy place.

309
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,972
Can you imagine how
liberating it would be

310
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:54,058
to live a life free of all the
mind-numbing social niceties?

311
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,434
I don't pity this
kid. I envy him.

312
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,974
No cancer because
these aren't lymph cells.

313
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,308
Then what are they?

314
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,614
Liver cells.

315
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,691
Wow, liver cells under his arm.

316
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,599
Wonder what he's got where
his liver's supposed to be?

317
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:44,178
Anyone got a clue how liver
cells got into the kid's armpit?

318
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,422
Make yourself at home.

319
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,753
So, you think maybe Gray's
<i>Anatomy</i> got it all wrong?

320
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,422
Lymph system circulates
fluid, not organ cells.

321
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,777
Cancer cells break into the
lymphatic system all the time.

322
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,376
But we're not talking
about cancer cells.

323
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,960
So what's the difference between
cancer cells and liver cells?

324
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,232
Why can one pass through
walls, but the other can't?

325
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,316
Cancer cells are damaged, it
lets them grow into blood vessels,

326
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,433
go wherever they want.

327
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,886
So if the liver cells
are damaged...

328
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,106
The liver isn't damaged.
The tests were normal.

329
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,580
So if the liver
cells are damaged,

330
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,345
it's theoretically possible they
passed into the lymphatic system.

331
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,512
Liver failure could also explain
pleural effusion, even the heart issues.

332
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,816
The liver cells are fine.

333
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,367
He was immunized for Hep A and
B, and do you really think this kid

334
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,225
is having unprotected
sex, or sharing needles?

335
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,963
Daddy does seem the
type to use a rubber.

336
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,627
So it's not viral. That just
leaves a lot of booze-irrhosis.

337
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,662
Our 10-year-old boy does not
have a drinking problem, or cirrhosis.

338
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,017
House, when we echoed his heart,

339
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,752
we got a piece of his
liver. There was no scarring.

340
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,473
Cirrhosis explains the
symptoms, heart problems, lungs...

341
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,014
Look up cirrhosis in the
dictionary, it means scarring.

342
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,414
Parents aren't doing
or dosing this kid.

343
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,713
How would you know that?

344
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,118
The kid can't talk. Why do
you think I took this case?

345
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,665
He's not going to
give away the ending.

346
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,157
They quit their jobs for him.

347
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:01,683
Yes, they are everything
you'd want in a parent.

348
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,822
Unfortunately, their kid
is nothing you'd want.

349
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,598
When a baby is
born, it's perfect.

350
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,899
Little fingers, little toes,
plump, perfect, pink,

351
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,634
and brimming with
unbridled potential.

352
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:18,805
Then it's downhill. Some
hills steeper than others.

353
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,411
Parents get off on their
kids' accomplishments.

354
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,244
<i>Bend over and relax.</i>

355
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,709
Cute.

356
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,651
They'll annoy you with
trophy rooms and report cards.

357
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,690
Hell, they'll even
show you a purple cow

358
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,954
and tell what a keen
eye for color their kid has.

359
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,001
But this kid, he doesn't smile,

360
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,901
he doesn't hug them,
he doesn't laugh.

361
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,200
His parents get nothing

362
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:50,175
but the right to brag that their kid
picked orange juice out of a lineup.

363
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,872
So you figure they slip the kid a
mickey so they don't have to deal.

364
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,142
Do a biopsy to
confirm cirrhosis.

365
00:21:56,215 --> 00:22:00,448
Don't try to pawn it off on Wilson,
he's going to be busy with Cuddy.

366
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,826
My parents love me
unconditionally. Get out of here.

367
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:15,057
Don't you think the
restraining order's a little much?

368
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,694
He's not actually going to have
sex with a 17-year-old patient.

369
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,363
I didn't think he
was going to ask me

370
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,907
to dig a bloodstained carpet
out of a dumpster, either.

371
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,466
It might be easier
in the long run.

372
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,740
Are we stopping here,
so House doesn't find us?

373
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,978
Unless you want to make out.

374
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,488
You want me to
surrender to House's coup?

375
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:42,051
No, no. You pro-actively
give him what he wants.

376
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,394
I defeat him by
surrendering to him.

377
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,524
He'll never see it coming.
Look, I'll pay for it myself.

378
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,626
What is it, a thousand
bucks to carpet a room?

379
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,466
Actually, it's 400.

380
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,005
Not doing it.

381
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,103
Liver biopsy?

382
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,273
They're doing it now.

383
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,577
How's it going?

384
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:04,844
Like a biopsy.

385
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,386
Needles, cells, screaming.

386
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,349
What did you find
in the stool sample?

387
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,652
You were too busy
bothering Cuddy.

388
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,659
But as discussed, it was
negative for parasites.

389
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,092
Can we get out of here?

390
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,338
I didn't ask what
you didn't find,

391
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,456
I asked what you did
find in the stool sample.

392
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,465
Stool

393
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:24,127
and traces of iron, zinc,
calcium carbonate. Can we leave?

394
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:27,037
What's the matter?
You afraid of the man?

395
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,399
Yeah.

396
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,473
Too late.

397
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,970
Leave my stuff alone.

398
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:38,575
You have a meeting with a Guggenheim
in 15 minutes. You're wearing that?

399
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:42,088
I'm going to count to three and
then I'm going to fire you. One.

400
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,953
Calcium carbonate? That's
an anti-diarrheal, right?

401
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,652
Two. Think that's significant?

402
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,058
Think hard poops is significant?

403
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,887
Two and a half.

404
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,891
Never threaten unless
you're ready to deliver.

405
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,401
Makes you look weak.

406
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,494
Thank God you
don't have children.

407
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,175
Doctor Cuddy.

408
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,535
Take a message.

409
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:11,249
Your patient is being
rushed to cardiac ICU.

410
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:15,480
Wow. That's like the one thing
that would get me out of here.

411
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,022
I'm sorry, you
can't come in here.

412
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,616
What's going on?

413
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,293
One, two, three.

414
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,528
He's in V fib.

415
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,527
Charged.

416
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,935
Clear.

417
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,663
Charging, clear.

418
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:39,340
Charging, clear.
Charging, clear.

419
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:55,193
He's stable for the moment.
First-degree atrial ventricular block.

420
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,525
Okay, what else do we know?

421
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,532
His liver's damaged. Pleural
effusion compromised his lung function.

422
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,034
Biopsy was
negative for cirrhosis.

423
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,230
Parents didn't poison their son.

424
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,308
It's not his liver, his
heart, or his lungs.

425
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,137
It's the calcium
carbonate in his stool.

426
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,976
Kid was constipated.
Parents probably just overdid it.

427
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,175
Or they didn't do it at all.

428
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,342
Calcium carbonate
is also what's in chalk.

429
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:20,681
So he ate some chalk.

430
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,245
It isn't toxic, it sure didn't
cause the pleural effusion.

431
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:24,415
Forget the chalk.

432
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,834
You just said it
was about the chalk.

433
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,656
Yes, and then I said,
"Forget the chalk."

434
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,753
You must be very
confused. The kid's got pica.

435
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,408
You take him to a buffet,
he's going to eat the table.

436
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:34,593
Or lead paint.

437
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,178
Level of lead in the blood was
normal. His tox screen was clean.

438
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,680
We're not looking
for typical poisons.

439
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,682
We're looking for anything
that he could put in his mouth.

440
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,732
Matches, spiders, bricks.

441
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,368
Pressure-treated wood
used to contain arsenic.

442
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:46,639
Even better.

443
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:50,546
Hansel, get samples of the
Gingerbread House. Bag everything.

444
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:00,885
Hey.

445
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:08,158
You could get into a
lot of trouble being here.

446
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,730
I wanted to see you.

447
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,168
Yeah, I got that.

448
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,231
So did everyone else.
They think you're a stalker.

449
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,506
One could argue those people
might be jealous of your attention.

450
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,070
Yes, I actually
made that argument.

451
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,008
You going home? That's the plan.

452
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,381
In Iceland, the age
of consent is 14.

453
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,155
I'm surprised that tourism
isn't a bigger industry up there.

454
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,496
Today I'm jailbait,
but in 22 weeks,

455
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,267
anybody can do anything to me.

456
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,361
Will I be so different
in 22 weeks?

457
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,702
Twenty-two weeks is enough for
an embryo to grow arms and legs.

458
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,937
It's just a line.

459
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,572
An arbitrary line drawn by a
bunch of sad, old men in robes.

460
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,116
Yeah, who cares
what judges think?

461
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:04,717
I didn't think of you as a guy who followed
rules just because they were rules.

462
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,124
You are over ten
years younger than me.

463
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,764
I said, "Over."

464
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,099
Gotta go! House.

465
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:22,969
Doctor Cuddy.

466
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,510
Do you happen to know the
way to the Icelandic consulate?

467
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,446
This young woman, a stranger
to me, was just asking directions.

468
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:32,713
Security was going to call the
police. I don't want to do that to you.

469
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,685
Go home. She needed a ride.

470
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,121
She got here on her own,
she can get home on her own.

471
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,888
Now.

472
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:45,353
If I see you on hospital grounds
again, I will call the police.

473
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:03,372
After that look, I'm feeling a
little frisky. Looks like you're up.

474
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,484
I'm ovulating. Let's go.

475
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,921
The frisky, it went away.

476
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,218
House, this isn't a game.

477
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,223
If I leave her alone, can
I have my carpet back?

478
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,457
No.

479
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:24,135
If I forget about my
carpet can I have her?

480
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:53,523
Jimsonweed. I found a small
patch of it in his backyard.

481
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,358
Jimsonweed contains
atropine, poor man's acid.

482
00:28:57,536 --> 00:29:00,995
Our kid's been tripping on "Lucy
in the Sky with cubic zirconium."

483
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,338
Explains the pleural
effusion, the heart arrhythmias.

484
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,274
Meeting here will do
nothing to upset Cuddy.

485
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:06,642
I'm not trying to upset Cuddy.

486
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:10,149
I'm trying to figure out what's
wrong with the patient. Continue.

487
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,239
I'm done.

488
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,478
Jimsonweed doesn't
explain the screaming.

489
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,032
You've obviously
never had a bad trip.

490
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,488
I would've thought you'd try to
accomplish two goals at once.

491
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,834
Why can't you be more like
the other age-inappropriate girls

492
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,953
who have a thing for me?
Just accept me for me.

493
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,089
Continue.

494
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,497
Treatment for jimsonweed
OD is physostigmine.

495
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,832
Kid's got heart issues.
The two don't mix.

496
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,513
We'd better make sure
that's what he's got.

497
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,598
Serum from the lab in
Patterson is three days minimum.

498
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,870
He won't survive three days.

499
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,434
What time does he wake up?

500
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,877
7:35 a.m.

501
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,211
Then what? Walk me through it.

502
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,218
7:40 to 7:50 he goes to
the toilet, washes his face.

503
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,285
What does this matter?

504
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,563
I'm trying to prove
he ate the plant.

505
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,522
His schedule has nothing
to do with jimsonweed.

506
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:51,750
There are two possibilities.

507
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:55,590
Either the parents saw him eat the
plant or the kid has unsupervised time,

508
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,892
and eats plants instead
of playing with blocks.

509
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,398
Even if you find 15
minutes of free time outside,

510
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,105
it doesn't mean he
spent it eating a bush.

511
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:06,003
So, what do we do? Nothing?
Wait for the kid to tell us? What?

512
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,075
Where are you going?

513
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,305
To talk to him.

514
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,386
Ever see your son eat a bush?

515
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,721
I haven't.

516
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,261
I've only ever seen him eat...

517
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,422
Adam, you ate
something at your house.

518
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,490
Something that made you sick. I
need you to show me what you ate.

519
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:37,233
He can't answer you.

520
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,895
Neither can you.

521
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,732
This is your backyard.

522
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:46,912
You may know it as Mel's
Diner. This is your sandbox.

523
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:51,313
Your jungle gym.
And under it is this.

524
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,480
I need to know if
you ate this, Adam.

525
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,118
He doesn't know what you want.

526
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:03,287
Adam, you have to tell
me because if you don't,

527
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,925
game over. You'll be dead.

528
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,992
What the hell are you doing?

529
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,867
Show me what you ate.

530
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,503
Adam, show me what you ate.

531
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,364
Adam? Honey?

532
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:40,791
Adam!

533
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,378
Come on in, brothers and sister,

534
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,278
welcome to the
house of the Lord!

535
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,709
House, come on. The Chapel?

536
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:02,744
We have been blessed with
the miracle of a new symptom.

537
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,619
Brother, can you testify

538
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:08,148
as to why this poor child's
eyeball rolled back into his head?

539
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:13,456
It's consistent with jimsonweed
poisoning, ocular paralysis. I'm sorry.

540
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,194
The wicked shall deceive ye

541
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,328
because they have turned
from the Lord and are idiots.

542
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,872
His ocular muscle didn't
paralyze, it pirouetted.

543
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,602
MS? It is easier for a wise man

544
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,940
to gain access to heaven...
Will you stop doing that?

545
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,377
Just say, "Not MS."

546
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,677
A stroke, bleed in the brain.

547
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:33,549
We'd be seeing other symptoms besides
a single eye misalignment. Like a coma.

548
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,881
And you've already testified.

549
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,444
It's a tumor.

550
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,553
And all the imaging
just missed it?

551
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,182
It's a micro-tumor.

552
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,503
It started in his lung, which
caused the pleural effusion.

553
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,497
Then it metastasized to his
liver, which made it slough cells.

554
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,775
And then it went to his
brain behind the eye,

555
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,934
which caused it to
roll back into his head.

556
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,233
So, he had three tumors
and we missed all of them?

557
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:54,803
What's the opposite
of a miracle?

558
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:58,708
I have a better chance of finding it,
now that I know exactly where to look.

559
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:02,441
So, unless you
have a better idea,

560
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:08,010
I'm going to go CT his head and
then, if I have to, remove his eye.

561
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,222
You remove this kid's eye,

562
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:17,126
he's only going to be half as
good at not making eye contact.

563
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,401
Hello?

564
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,303
Hello?

565
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,273
Hello?

566
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,509
I have sad news for
you. She doesn't love you.

567
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,582
You're ugly when you're jealous.

568
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:45,988
She showed up at my house
last night. Came on to me.

569
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,323
She's even more
perfect than I thought.

570
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,329
House, she's sick.

571
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,865
You say, "Sick," I
say, "Freestylin'."

572
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,196
The girl will have sex
with an invertebrate.

573
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:58,499
Come on, you're not that bad.

574
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,563
She has a problem.

575
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,483
You're not doing her any
favors by indulging her.

576
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,237
How could you lie like this?

577
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,278
Do you not have room
in your heart for love?

578
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,471
You don't believe me.

579
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,391
I didn't believe the kids when they
said that Susie was sleeping with Johnny.

580
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,893
I didn't believe them then.
I don't believe them now.

581
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:15,183
I don't care that Susie
married Johnny. She's mine.

582
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,316
She has a mole on her right
breast, just below the nipple.

583
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,484
No, she doesn't.

584
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,754
You've seen her breasts?

585
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,261
It was a medical exam. I
was listening to her heart.

586
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,696
It went, "Greg-House.
Greg-House. Greg-House."

587
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,795
Fine. I'm lying.

588
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,066
But she did come back.
She's locked up in my office.

589
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,799
I was hoping you could
talk to her, put an end to this.

590
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,960
Listen to me.

591
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,327
Do you have any
idea what you'd have

592
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,730
to look forward to if
you stayed with me?

593
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,168
Nine chances out of ten,
we'd both wind up in a jail.

594
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:09,034
You're only saying
that to make me go.

595
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,440
I'm saying it 'cause it's true.

596
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,538
Inside of us, we both know
that you belong with Victor.

597
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,617
Is there a Victor in your class?

598
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:28,985
If you're not with someone
your age, you'll regret it.

599
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:34,294
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

600
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,692
What about us?

601
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:40,095
We'll always have Fresno.

602
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,876
I'm no good at being noble,
but it doesn't take much to see

603
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,388
that the problems
of two little people

604
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:50,746
don't amount to a hill of
beans in this crazy world.

605
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,516
Someday you'll understand that.

606
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,559
Now, now, here's looking at you.

607
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,192
Damn.

608
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,371
Was there an earthquake
when you were in Fresno?

609
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:14,531
What?

610
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,302
I ask all my girlfriends that.

611
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,575
Yeah, a little one.

612
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:23,841
Damn.

613
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,745
What? What?

614
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,911
What is it? It's not love.

615
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,116
You have spore in your brain.

616
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,326
Coccidioides immitis.
California's full of them.

617
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,470
They get an earthquake,
they get released into the air,

618
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,258
you breath it in,
you get a cold.

619
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:43,700
Turns into sinus congestion, aches,
weakness, milky tears, and sometimes

620
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,430
loss of inhibition and judgment.

621
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,035
Damn!

622
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,573
So, loving you,

623
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:59,308
wanting to have sex with you
was all just the spores talking?

624
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,587
You'll probably live.

625
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,223
Damn!

626
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:37,417
Hey! Don't touch his eye!

627
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,215
This is an appendectomy.

628
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:45,295
Like I said, don't
touch his eye.

629
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,429
Why isn't he in surgery?

630
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:51,765
Some emergency bumped him.

631
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,214
We've got another
room in ten minutes.

632
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,763
You're not taking him in.

633
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,432
Kill the lights.

634
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,977
He was seeing them all the time.

635
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,970
What are you looking for?

636
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,391
He was telling us
what he was seeing.

637
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:09,615
Telling us exactly what was wrong with him.
Drawing them for us over and over again.

638
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,282
But nobody knew
how to speak autistic.

639
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,724
When I asked him what
he ate, he even told me that.

640
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,854
What are you talking
about? What was he seeing?

641
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,864
Hello, my pretties. It's
not a tumor, Foreman.

642
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,928
It's worms swimming in his eye.

643
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:32,043
Animal makes potty in the
sandbox, boy plays in the sandbox.

644
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,703
Boy eats the sand.

645
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,838
You can probably tell
where this is going by now.

646
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,554
Stool samples were
negative for parasites.

647
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,484
Raccoon roundworms are not
excreted by their human host.

648
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,747
Cameron tested the sand.

649
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,083
All of it?

650
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,415
Worms spread from his
gut to the rest of his body.

651
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,655
They attacked his lungs, that's what
made him scream and caused the effusion.

652
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:53,391
They invade his liver, sending dead
liver cells coursing through his system.

653
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,797
They attacked his eye and
the muscles surrounding it,

654
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,336
making his eyeball
do a back flip.

655
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,364
Laser photocoagulation
to fix the eye,

656
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,102
and a high dose of
benzimidazole to kill the worms.

657
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:08,044
Wait a minute, that's it?
He's going to be okay?

658
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:09,945
Good news.

659
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:14,344
He's going to be with
you for a long, long time.

660
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,354
I'm going to read you something.

661
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:26,626
"Asperger Syndrome is a
mild and rare form of autism.

662
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,998
"It is typically characterized by
difficulty establishing friendships,

663
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:34,199
"and playing with peers, trouble
accepting conventional social rules,

664
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:38,300
"and they dislike any
change in setting or routine."

665
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,844
Or broadloom.

666
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,251
It doesn't say that last
part, but you get my point.

667
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:46,751
House doesn't have Asperger's. The
diagnosis is much simpler, he's a jerk.

668
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,787
Why do you think
he took this case?

669
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,515
Because he believes
these parents?

670
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,819
Because he wants
to help a young boy?

671
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:58,421
He sees himself in this kid,
and he's trying to help himself.

672
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:02,991
He doesn't want
this, he needs it.

673
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,948
You're not autistic. You
don't even have Asperger's.

674
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,283
You wish you did.

675
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,324
That would exempt you from
the rules, give you freedom,

676
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:30,624
absolve you of responsibility,
let you date 17-year-olds.

677
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:34,291
But most important, it would
mean that you're not just a jerk.

678
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:39,828
At what point does a person endlessly
lecturing someone make him a jerk?

679
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:52,374
First tongue kiss is an
eight on the happiness scale.

680
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:58,118
Child being snatched back from
the brink of death, that's a ten.

681
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,428
They're clocking in at a
very tepid six point five,

682
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,458
because they know what
they have to go back to.

683
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,534
Listen,

684
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,171
thanks.

685
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,043
You saved his life.

686
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,081
Yeah, I know. See ya.

687
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,733
That was so good.

688
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,778
That was a ten.

689
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,037
All change is bad?

690
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:02,347
It's not true, you know.
