1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,563
I'm gonna tickle you!

2
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,539
I need a refill.

3
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,384
You've already had three.
So what? They're free.

4
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,444
I got a birthday.
Get it yourself.

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,683
No wonder he
doesn't get any tips.

6
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,122
All right.

7
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,958
Who's ready to sing the Ralphie's
Rumpus birthday rump shake?

8
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,994
Let's sing, let's ride,
let's bling, let's slide

9
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,562
It's time for Ralphie

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,236
We'll dance, eat cake
and do the rump shake

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,711
It's time for Ralphie

12
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,441
You okay, man?

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,949
You okay?

14
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,703
Okay. All right. Let's
get you in the back.

15
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,798
It's gonna be okay, kids. Sorry.

16
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,611
Got a heartbeat. Jack? Jack?

17
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,518
I need you to step
back. He's my brother.

18
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,386
Jack, wake up!
Call your parents.

19
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,334
Tell them to go to
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.

20
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,624
Our parents died.
He's all we've got.

21
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:14,526
I was not parked
illegally. I live here.

22
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,968
Love note. From
Detective Tritter.

23
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,374
Heart attack.

24
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,537
His cath was clean and echo
showed no structural abnormalities.

25
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,673
Fatigue, night sweats, weight
loss preceded the heart attack.

26
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,583
Eighteen-year-old kid's suddenly
an orphan and a single father of two.

27
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,144
<i>Party of Five.</i> Powerful stuff.

28
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,883
<i>The O.C.</i> of its day.

29
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,958
Stress explains everything
except the itchy feet.

30
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,427
Athlete's foot covers that.

31
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,055
Waiters work 12 hours
a day in old sneakers.

32
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,961
Good idea. Ignore the
symptoms. Makes our job easy.

33
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,731
I'm not ignoring a symptom.
I'm explaining a symptom.

34
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,967
Kid's been hanging over a
toilet despite antiemetic therapy.

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,474
Persistent vomiting
could indicate

36
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,407
increased intracranial
pressure, tumor...

37
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,241
Sure. Heart problems.
It's gotta be the brain.

38
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,247
Thank God there's a
neurologist in the room.

39
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,375
Right. It's the feet. If
only I were a podiatrist.

40
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,910
Probably caught an intestinal virus from
one of those feral kids running around.

41
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,514
Repeated vomiting causes
an electrolyte imbalance,

42
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,560
which leads to an arrhythmia,
which leads to the heart attack.

43
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,960
And itchy feet. Nope.

44
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,364
That's it? Nope? I've
said too much already.

45
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:23,666
This isn't a game, House.
No, it's not. But it could be.

46
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,964
What are you writing? Nothing.

47
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,634
If you know the
diagnosis, why don't...

48
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,269
How are you gonna learn to swim

49
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,678
unless I take off your floaties and
throw you into shark-infested waters?

50
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,513
You can't know what's wrong
after a 30-second perusal of his file.

51
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,748
Apparently, you can't. Now,
what's a game without rules?

52
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:45,521
No tag-backs. No biting.
You get one test each.

53
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:50,257
And the clock runs until lunch.
If I'm right, he'll still be alive.

54
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,395
If I'm wrong, this is
a very cruel game.

55
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,326
You're late.

56
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,281
I charge for the time you
were supposed to be here.

57
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,171
Tritter towed my car.

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,471
He's frozen my assets.
He's on a crusade.

59
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,444
You're a person of interest
in a narcotics investigation.

60
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,256
You're linked to their
suspect and his activities.

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,581
I'm not Pablo Escobar's evil henchman
cruising into Miami in a Cigarette boat.

62
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,097
I'm a physician who prescribed
Vicodin to a pain patient.

63
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,751
This police report you faxed me says
they found 600 pills in his apartment.

64
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,985
You prescribe those?

65
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,893
He's in chronic pain. This is
obviously an abuse of power.

66
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,021
Is that a yes or no?

67
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,361
Patients build up a
tolerance over the years.

68
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,901
Perfect motive for him
to forge those scripts.

69
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,527
Still don't have an answer.

70
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,504
What are we, like,
role-playing? Yeah.

71
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,800
And you suck at it.

72
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:36,503
Which is really unfortunate,
because you're pretending to be you.

73
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,306
I gotta get to court.

74
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,189
Michael told me you could
help me get my car back.

75
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,547
Yeah, divorce lawyers usually know
the ins and outs of drug enforcement.

76
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,676
You want your car back?

77
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,429
You're gonna have to give
the cops what they want.

78
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:50,413
Thanks. Usually people feel
helpless in these situations.

79
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,925
Dr. House is
probably going to jail.

80
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:56,225
You keep on lying for him,
you'll go right along with him.

81
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,562
House was on this page when he got
that annoying "I'm such a genius" look.

82
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,227
What's there? Patient history.

83
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,272
He's 18. Probably drinks,
smokes, does drugs.

84
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,367
How close am I?

85
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,501
Quit drugs when his
parents died. Quit smoking.

86
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:16,244
House didn't mock my viral
idea. He just said it was wrong.

87
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,927
Which means he didn't
want to give reasons.

88
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,318
Which means I must
have been close.

89
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,050
I'm thinking bacterial.

90
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,921
I'm doing a blood culture.

91
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,083
I am doing an MRI.

92
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
If it was a tumor,

93
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,907
intracranial pressure could cause
his brain to herniate before lunch.

94
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,263
Same thing with the stress test.

95
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,961
Which is why I'm ditching it.
What are you doing instead?

96
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,162
Not telling.

97
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,137
Seriously? You're
playing his game?

98
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,073
We're all playing his
game. Might as well enjoy it.

99
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,538
Anybody else sick at work?

100
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,544
I had a stomachache before him.

101
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,946
This isn't your fault,
Will. Keep working.

102
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,506
My brother's in the hospital.

103
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,281
Mrs. Collier won't care
if I finish my homework.

104
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,050
Your brother cares if
you finish your homework.

105
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,433
Can I be your imaginary friend?

106
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,696
He's a doctor.

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,368
How are the feet? Still itch?

108
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,509
Is that important?
I don't know. Is it?

109
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,094
What kinds of drugs you into?

110
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,729
You don't have to talk
about that right now.

111
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,777
No, it's okay.

112
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,065
I don't keep secrets from them.

113
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,320
They know I did drugs
before our parents died.

114
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,123
Clever. Admit the
past. Deny the present.

115
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,424
I'm clean.

116
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,193
I'm raising two kids. It'd be
pretty irresponsible, wouldn't it?

117
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,667
But confiding in an
eight-year-old is okay.

118
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,897
If I'm open with them,
then they'll be open with me.

119
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,873
Yeah. Turning the other
cheek's a good strategy in boxing.

120
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,739
Kids don't lie because
they got trust issues.

121
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,869
They lie because they've
got something to hide.

122
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:52,969
Look at him.

123
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,413
He's sitting there doing
nothing and he's still lying.

124
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,451
We don't lie to Jack.

125
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,679
Spelling test you
failed and forgot to... No.

126
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,777
Math test? No.

127
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,552
Fight with the kid sitting next to
you? He doesn't sit next to me.

128
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,456
And the other one's
probably having sex.

129
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,326
I am not. Yet.

130
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,060
But when you start,
you're gonna lie about it.

131
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,636
Colder. I'm not playing.

132
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,980
Keep very still for me,
Jack. This won't take long.

133
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,748
How much dope did you smoke?

134
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,914
Does he have to be
here? No. Ignore him.

135
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,957
It's not his lungs.
I never said it was.

136
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,517
What about the
cigarettes? How'd you quit?

137
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,859
Gum? The patch? Hypnosis?

138
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,761
He went from two packs
to nothing, cold turkey.

139
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,832
Or we could just
make small talk.

140
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,838
You still seeing
that nurse in Pedes?

141
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,425
I just don't think
she's right for you.

142
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,501
You need someone detached,
calculating, ambitious.

143
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,512
You need yourself in a skirt.

144
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,639
Jack, he asked you a question.

145
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,981
I didn't really quit. I just
sort of lost taste for it.

146
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:08,446
Interesting. Sounds like one
of those symptom thingies.

147
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:12,515
He's still puking, and he had
a heart attack and itchy feet.

148
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,591
It's not his lungs.
I never said it was.

149
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,557
Ice cold.

150
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,065
I'm injecting ergonovine
to see if your heart attack

151
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,840
was caused by a spasm in the
vessels surrounding your heart.

152
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,144
Let me know if
anything feels... unusual.

153
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:41,720
If the problems are at my heart, why
did that other doctor look at my brain?

154
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,622
Yeah. Why did that other
doctor look at his brain?

155
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,426
We're just trying to eliminate
as many possibilities as we can.

156
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,488
So because you think that a
spasm caused his heart attack,

157
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,863
you're gonna induce
another spasm?

158
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,629
Did you consent to this?

159
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,346
Everything's under control.

160
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,898
Tests are gonna identify which arteries
are affected so we can repair them.

161
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,102
Your meds don't seem
to be doing anything.

162
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,872
So either you're wrong,

163
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,676
or his system hasn't been
pushed enough to set anything off.

164
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,222
You wanna get back home, right?

165
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,285
I mean, you're probably already falling
behind with the housework and the bills.

166
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:26,060
How many sick days you think
you'll get before they replace you?

167
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,160
Heart rate's up. Nothing else.

168
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,066
They can't fire me if I'm sick.

169
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,199
Right. You're irreplaceable.

170
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,938
Who else would they find
qualified to dance with a rodent?

171
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,809
How can you even
support your family?

172
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,475
What happens when those kids grow
out of their clothes? When they get sick?

173
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,178
Still no spasm.

174
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,182
They'll take those kids
away from you, Jack.

175
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,520
Maybe I should bring them in here right
now so that you can kiss them goodbye.

176
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:55,590
Can't you see his heart
is fine! Stop torturing him!

177
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,790
What kind of doctor are you?

178
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,429
Wonderful. Thank you
so much. Okay, bye.

179
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,735
You're just getting
here? Busses suck.

180
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,240
Where's your
car? It's a hostage.

181
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,539
Tritter wants me to
testify against House.

182
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,873
You're not going to.

183
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,777
Is that a question or an order?

184
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,646
Any sort of conviction will
cost House his license...

185
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,184
Which will cost
this hospital. Relax.

186
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,152
I'm not gonna mess with
your precious resource.

187
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,657
I told my lawyer to tell
Tritter to go to hell. Marco!

188
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,503
Why are all my prescriptions
getting bounced back?

189
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:30,224
Sorry, Dr. Wilson. I was trying
to call you. Where's your phone?

190
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,296
In my car.

191
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,475
My patients, on the other hand,

192
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,024
are here and needed
their medications.

193
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,298
I'm sorry. I can't. Your DEA
number's been suspended.

194
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,774
<i>Why so sad?</i>

195
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,678
There's still a chance
that Chase got it right.

196
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,609
That was suspenseful
for about two seconds.

197
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,617
Blood culture was
negative for bacteria.

198
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,254
But positive for hepatitis A?

199
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,652
I wonder who could've
ordered that extra test.

200
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,990
Must be somebody who
knew what persistent vomiting,

201
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,205
sudden distaste for nicotine
and itchy feet have in common.

202
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,959
Hep A doesn't explain
the heart attack.

203
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,866
No. But as Chase so deftly
pointed out earlier, puking does.

204
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,767
And hep A explains the puking.

205
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,103
If this had been real life
instead of just a game...

206
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,041
The DEA just revoked
my prescription privileges.

207
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,712
Well, who's gonna
prescribe my Vicodin?

208
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,114
Yes, well, that's why I'm here.

209
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,652
This is a disaster for you.

210
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,016
Relax.

211
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,532
Tritter's just getting desperate.
He's got no real evidence.

212
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,100
He's trying to squeeze
you into ratting.

213
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,457
I'm not gonna let him
squeeze my patients.

214
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,860
They'll be fine. Most of your
cancer medicine sucks anyway.

215
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,827
I'm gonna use your team to do my
prescribing until this is straightened out.

216
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,305
Suddenly this doesn't
seem nearly as dramatic.

217
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,139
Go pump IVIG into the kid,
cure him and get him out of here.

218
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,575
Hep A? No.

219
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,316
"Chase, blood test for bacteria.

220
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,477
"Foreman, MRI, too
stubborn to check the lungs.

221
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,714
"Cameron, nice try. No spasm."

222
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,020
"But the princess
sat and sat and sat,

223
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,055
"pretending not to listen."

224
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:18,028
Pretending to write in her
journal with the flowers on it.

225
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,040
Pretending she didn't like stories
about eight-year-olds who save the world.

226
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,168
I'm 11.

227
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,821
Which is why you can
no longer save the world.

228
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,643
I'm eight! Yeah.

229
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,210
We're all completely
dependent on you.

230
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,581
Morning. Morning.

231
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,917
Good news. We can
take you off the IVIG.

232
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:39,187
The hep A has cleared your system.
You'll be good to go by tomorrow.

233
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,358
How do you think I got it?

234
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,005
Well, it could've been
contaminated food.

235
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,364
It could've been from cleaning the
bathrooms at work. Or it could've been...

236
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,967
Don't worry.
They've heard it all.

237
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,767
Anilingus is a common way.

238
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,017
You should just tell the
people that you've dated

239
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,203
they should get
themselves checked.

240
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,636
Don't worry.

241
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,203
I've been too busy chasing
after these guys to go spelunking.

242
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,647
You're gross.

243
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,384
I think. Does your arm hurt?

244
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,545
Arm's fine, bro.

245
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,351
Then why's it
bleeding? It's not. It's...

246
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,551
Raise your arm above your head.

247
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,457
Your ear... And your nose...

248
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:32,644
High PT and PTT on Jack's
blood panel confirm a coagulopathy.

249
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,343
So, we cure the hep A,
something else pops up.

250
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,012
Interesting.

251
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,285
What infections cause DIC?

252
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:45,991
You okay?

253
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,518
Hurt my shoulder
playing fantasy football.

254
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,223
Shall we discuss
what causes DIC,

255
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,926
or should we just send the
kid back to his miserable life?

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,026
He's not miserable. Right.

257
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,480
He's thrilled that his parents
are dead and his life is over.

258
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,736
The restaurant's probably teeming
with E. coli, Eikenella and strep.

259
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,320
Kids don't wash their hands
between the potty and the party and...

260
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,855
Or it's a food-borne toxin. Jack
eats at that cesspool every day.

261
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,780
And Jack's the only
one who got sick?

262
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,908
Kid's got tattoos, piercings

263
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,295
and probably some nasty little
girl who loaned him the hep A.

264
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,413
Could've also given
him syphilis or gonorrhea.

265
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,252
I need one of you. Take Cameron.

266
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,349
Your idea was dumb anyway.

267
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,860
Chase, I need you to head back to
that cesspool and get me the kid's puke.

268
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,662
Foreman, do an LP and have
Cameron run down that potty-party theory.

269
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,794
Why don't I just test him?

270
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,673
Let's not discuss this
in front of the help.

271
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,380
The amount of
vomiting that kid did,

272
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,474
there wouldn't be enough toxins left
in his system to show up in his blood.

273
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,042
And since he vomited in the
toilet here instead of on somebody,

274
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,056
that restaurant is our only
source of essential vomit.

275
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,800
And you couldn't say
that in front of Foreman?

276
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:56,626
No, I couldn't say this in
front of Foreman. I need a refill.

277
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,598
Detective Tritter knows
about the scripts I wrote before.

278
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,760
Exactly. If you stop
now, it'll look suspicious.

279
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,061
Does anyone fall
for that argument?

280
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,107
Write the script.

281
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:08,774
No.

282
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,400
One prescription
isn't gonna make...

283
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,105
We both know it's
not gonna be just one.

284
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,009
I'd rather lose my job
than lose my license.

285
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:29,123
Daniel Silvers, prostate cancer.
Needs filgrastim, two-week supply.

286
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,858
Andrea Donovan, breast cancer.

287
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,366
Just needs her refill
on her megestrol.

288
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,397
You're not writing.
You want me to write?

289
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,304
Well, you could phone
them in. But eventually, yeah,

290
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,343
probably somebody's gonna
want something written down.

291
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,901
I haven't met these
people. I have.

292
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,146
I've diagnosed them
and everything. I know.

293
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,150
I know. I'm not
saying I don't trust you.

294
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,652
Just my diagnoses.

295
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,348
These are gonna be my
prescriptions. I... They're my patients.

296
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,414
My prescriptions. My name!

297
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,628
That Tritter will
read on the script.

298
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:07,926
He wants to make you miserable. You
don't think he's gonna ask questions?

299
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,898
Is there anything Jack does that no
one else does? Any special duties?

300
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,203
No, we got lots of bussers.

301
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,536
What kind of cleaning
products do you use?

302
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,570
We got a bunch of kids running around,
sticking everything in their mouths,

303
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,777
so we can't use anything toxic.

304
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,878
This is it. Monday's trash.

305
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:36,355
So there's no one who can
maybe help get the bags out?

306
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,920
Sorry. Short-handed.

307
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,727
I can tip.

308
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,294
I'm pretty sure Jack's puke is in a
blue trash bag with the wrapped gifts,

309
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,533
but if you find spaghetti
that's the wrong vomit.

310
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:57,941
How much longer do I have
to stay on this medication?

311
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,145
I mean, I'm
nauseous all the time.

312
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,112
Maybe I should go
back on the tamoxifen.

313
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,267
You're doing so much better
on the anastrozole, Beth.

314
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,953
I'm reluctant to make a change.

315
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,929
I can't play with my daughter
or pick her up from school.

316
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,774
I can barely get up
and tuck her in at night.

317
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,393
There's got to be
something else.

318
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,766
Who is she?

319
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,533
Well, as you know, this
is a teaching hospital.

320
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,037
She's a student?
No, I'm a doctor.

321
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,770
I'm assisting Dr. Wilson today.

322
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,869
Why? Do you think he
got my diagnosis wrong?

323
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,346
No. I'm sure... No. No.

324
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,407
She's just consulting
regarding my prescriptions.

325
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,147
You think he got my
meds wrong? No. It's just...

326
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,519
No. Then why is she here?

327
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,326
What are you doing now?

328
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,757
I'm gonna get a sample of
your brother's spinal fluid.

329
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,866
Where's Will? School.

330
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,534
Is that gonna hurt?

331
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,599
It's gonna help us figure
out what's making him sick.

332
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,305
Shouldn't you be in class,
too? Teacher work day.

333
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,846
For you but not Will?

334
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,212
Yeah, didn't make
sense to me, either.

335
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,746
Can I help?

336
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:13,555
Well, I guess it's quicker than
calling a nurse and a truant officer.

337
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:17,594
Okay, grab his shins and push
his knees up towards his chest.

338
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,495
Now hold him there tight.

339
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,398
This all nurses do?

340
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,268
My boss doesn't trust
them to do anything else.

341
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,541
Is he gonna die?

342
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,613
No. No one's gonna die.

343
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,155
In the whole world
ever? That's so great.

344
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:47,052
I meant... I know
what you meant.

345
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,928
But I also know bad
things do happen.

346
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,632
My dad always had a few
drinks when they went out.

347
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,470
Always said he'd
be okay to drive.

348
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,764
Until he wasn't.

349
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,969
I would just like some
warning this time.

350
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:15,882
We're nowhere near anything
like that happening right now. Okay?

351
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,651
Let's get him back over.

352
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,227
What was that?

353
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,462
What did you do?

354
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,770
You broke his rib? I
barely touched him.

355
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,097
Which means...

356
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,171
Found it. Fix it.

357
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,977
Osteomyelitis. Means the
infection's spread to his bones,

358
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,107
which means it's either
bacterial or viral and not...

359
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,647
I hired you to take away the
pain. Was there some confusion?

360
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,316
Ever thought about using
your cane on the proper side?

361
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,756
Yeah, that's the issue.

362
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,284
Friday night my cane suddenly
noticed it was on the wrong side.

363
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,764
Can you score me
some Vicodin? No.

364
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,859
I did a needle aspiration to confirm
which... How long till the culture's...

365
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,168
Why do you only do
that when I'm talking?

366
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,140
You gotta rest your shoulder.

367
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,477
And we're gonna get you
on some different equipment.

368
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,689
Nice cane. If I know
what you mean.

369
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,430
Chase, you can stop doing
that. I'm almost finished.

370
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,398
He's got osteomyelitis.

371
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,958
Means you're wrong
about food-borne toxins.

372
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,567
And you can stop,
too. It's syphilis.

373
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,133
You sure? Read the print out.

374
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,414
He's also positive
for Eikenella.

375
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,150
One of you two screwed up. No.

376
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,714
Not a chance.

377
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:04,994
Or this kid is a lot sicker than
we thought. Finish that test.

378
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:08,398
Should be impossible to get
two right answers to one question.

379
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,529
It's okay to have
three? Apparently.

380
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,571
He's positive for botulism, too.

381
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:21,012
So, we knock down one
infection and three more pop up.

382
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,545
I think this game is rigged.

383
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,787
Jack?

384
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:37,886
Somebody help!

385
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,509
We've managed to clear all
three infections out of his system,

386
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,399
but now he's having
seizures every few hours.

387
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,937
He's gotta be
immunocompromised. No.

388
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,337
White count was normal,
and he was negative for HIV.

389
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,650
Well, if he's not
immunocompromised,

390
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,438
why is he acting like he's
immunocompromised?

391
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,307
What do the seizures
tell us? Nothing.

392
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,438
There were no structural
abnormalities on the CT,

393
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,540
nonfocal neuro exam, no
electrolyte imbalance. Nothing.

394
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:01,883
What do unexplained seizures and
really sick 18-year-olds have in common?

395
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,322
You thinking trauma?
I'm thinking drugs.

396
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:09,422
He's an admitted user. The
drugs trashed his immune system.

397
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,225
Tox screen was clean.

398
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:14,597
Clean tox screen means there's
no drugs in his blood or urine.

399
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,763
There could still be drugs trapped
in his fat cells from the good old days.

400
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,398
If they're in his fat, why would
they be affecting him now?

401
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,308
The keen observer would notice that
he's had some digestive issues lately.

402
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,676
His weight loss could've
burned off fat cells

403
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,375
and released the drugs
back into his system.

404
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,613
There's no way to know. It's
impossible to test fat cells for drugs.

405
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,145
But it's not impossible to
make him lose more weight.

406
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,591
You want us to starve him so we
can drive him into another seizure?

407
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,424
Maybe a heart attack? Just so
we can run another tox screen?

408
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,465
That'd be cruel. Just
sweat it out of him.

409
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,399
I haven't touched a thing
since the night my parents died.

410
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,873
Drugs stay in your
system a long time.

411
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,882
I was high the night the cops
came to tell us what happened.

412
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,420
You know the first thing
I did when they told me?

413
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:16,727
I laughed.

414
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,734
I'm not the person I
was when they died.

415
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,599
I wish they could see that.

416
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,902
Well, I'm sure they're watching,
and I'm sure they're proud.

417
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,768
That's what Will's guidance
counselor keeps telling him.

418
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,837
What do you tell him?

419
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,774
I tell him it's crap.

420
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:43,217
Our parents live on in our
memories, but they don't live on.

421
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,993
- Jack?
- Hold him still.

422
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,996
- Don't break his arm.
- We'll fix it.

423
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,832
We need to get a sample.

424
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,099
House.

425
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,865
Bad news.

426
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,343
Look at you.

427
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,985
You couldn't have sent Cameron
down here to this air-conditioned hallway

428
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,014
to deliver the bad news?

429
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:13,519
Jack seized again, but his blood
was clean. Completely drug free.

430
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,577
So he just happened
to have a seizure at

431
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:17,818
the exact time that we
stuck him in a sauna?

432
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,017
It's not a coincidence.

433
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:22,926
He's still seizing every few hours
whether we stick him in a sauna or not.

434
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,261
Oh, my God! Why
are you using that?

435
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,393
I've had it for years.

436
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,636
No, that's... That's gonna
make your shoulder hurt.

437
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,298
You need one of these.

438
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,775
He's a doctor.

439
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,010
Is he still infection-free?
I'm sure not for long.

440
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,709
My point being that something other than
those infections caused these seizures.

441
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,393
Means there's something
in his head. Scan him.

442
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,285
We scanned him. Well, that
was then. This is not then.

443
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,585
Kid keeps changing.
Scan him again.

444
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,147
Where is Cameron?

445
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,352
I am not writing you
a script for Vicodin.

446
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,657
I've only got two pills left.

447
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,292
Cut them in half.
Then you'll have four.

448
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:02,028
You're prescribing for Wilson.
Wilson prescribes for me.

449
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,467
Write up a script.

450
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,504
You know you have
a problem. Yeah.

451
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:06,869
It's got a badge and everything.

452
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:09,670
You're taking too
much... Fine! You're right.

453
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:13,474
What's the correct amount? Write
up a script for the correct amount.

454
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:17,579
No answer? That's 'cause
we're having the wrong debate.

455
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,761
This has got nothing
to do with my problem

456
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,463
and everything to do with
you avoiding a problem.

457
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,264
You're afraid that if you
write me a prescription

458
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,466
you're gonna
wind up like Wilson.

459
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,015
Of course I am.

460
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,262
Tritter wants to
win by giving pain.

461
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,526
Do you really want
to be a part of that?

462
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,728
As a doctor, how do you do that?

463
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,043
Here.

464
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,379
This'll tide you over.
Takes the edge off my PMS.

465
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,279
Should do wonders for you.

466
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,153
Why are you looking
at my head again?

467
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:01,258
Seizures usually indicate
something neurological.

468
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,352
I'm not gonna get better.

469
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,222
Am I?

470
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,723
We'll know more after the test.

471
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,893
I've gotta find out who can
take care of Will and Kama.

472
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,337
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

473
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:19,101
You'll be home yelling at them and
kicking their butts before you know it.

474
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,612
This kid might be
facing a terminal disease,

475
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,689
and he's more worried
about his brother and sister.

476
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,488
Brain stem's clean.

477
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,294
Nothing in the
midbrain. What's that?

478
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,397
The frontal lobe,
upper-right quadrant.

479
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,961
I don't see anything. There.

480
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,803
It's tiny, but I
think it's a tumor.

481
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:50,570
That size should be excisable. Why
didn't we see it earlier? How could...

482
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,974
Oh, God!

483
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,113
Axial view. There's another one.

484
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,876
Bring up the next slice.

485
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,950
They're everywhere.

486
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,960
Jack's brain is
riddled with tumors.

487
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,761
And you know what
he's doing? Moaning?

488
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,465
Setting up play dates.
Wow, what a guy. Theories?

489
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,833
The obvious one, brain cancer
destroyed his immune system,

490
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,735
left him wide open
for these infections.

491
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,001
House, you're pathetic.

492
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,775
You'll analyze anyone's
faults, hypocrisies, weaknesses,

493
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,088
but this kid's got
some strength,

494
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,112
and all of a sudden there's no time to
talk about anything but the medicine.

495
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:34,278
He's teaching pre-pubescent kids that
truth matters, God doesn't and life sucks.

496
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,049
I like him. Treatment?

497
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,022
We need to start
him on radiation.

498
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,184
That'll destroy whatever's
left of his immune system.

499
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,285
And save his life!

500
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,830
I know the notion of
self-sacrifice is foreign to you...

501
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:48,595
You wanna think that he's sacrificing
himself because if one person can do it,

502
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,536
then maybe the world isn't the
cold, selfish place you know that it is.

503
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,199
Radiation could kill
him. Alternatives?

504
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,709
There aren't any.
We saw the tumors...

505
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,245
We could choose to
say they aren't tumors.

506
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:03,510
They're just pus, which would explain
why they weren't there yesterday.

507
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,245
It can't be an
infection. He got IVIG,

508
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,014
broad-spectrum
antibiotics... Exactly.

509
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,716
Creates a perfect world for
fungus, moves in, gets married,

510
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,814
has little fungi...

511
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:16,487
If you're wrong about the fungus, you're
wasting what little time he has left.

512
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:19,088
Not a big sacrifice.
His life sucks.

513
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:23,331
So let's be right. Go stick
a needle in the kid's head.

514
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:24,461
If you suck out a liquid,

515
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,080
then I'm right and we
haven't answered anything.

516
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:30,200
If you suck out a solid, you're right
and no more worrying about play dates.

517
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,407
Okay. Fine. I'll
father your child.

518
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,577
First, you got to write
me a Vicodin prescription,

519
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,281
just so I can get
through the foreplay.

520
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,618
How many days do you have left?

521
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,387
Could probably get through
maybe the next minute or so.

522
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,952
And your coming to me means
your lackeys actually stood up to you.

523
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,122
I'm impressed.

524
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,257
Yes, their cowardice
is inspiring.

525
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,234
Well, you should
be thanking them.

526
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,327
If they caved, it'd
give the cops evidence

527
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,464
that you intimidated
underlings to feed your addiction.

528
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,370
I hate writing thank-you notes.

529
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:07,311
Would it be weird if I asked Cameron
to write them? You're hooking me up?

530
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,372
Unfortunately, if I cut you
off, it'd give the cops evidence

531
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,859
that you don't really
need the pain meds.

532
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:15,445
I knew that cleavage was a
smokescreen. You're a genius.

533
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,958
You can't lift your arm.
You can't pee standing up.

534
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:22,256
Gimme. You been doing physio?

535
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:23,952
Maybe you pulled... Yeah.

536
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,464
Been training for <i>Pants-Off
Dance-Off.</i> Give me the script.

537
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:29,023
Your shoulder
problem isn't physical.

538
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,162
We'll find out if you ever
give me that... What's new?

539
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,468
What's different? Any big
changes in your life recently?

540
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,269
Fight with the wife maybe?

541
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,639
It's good. Means your
shoulder's a human being.

542
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,941
It's a start.

543
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,210
I'm right. Right? Yeah.

544
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,248
Just not about me.

545
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,191
I was right, right?

546
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,963
They were abscesses from
a fungal infection. Aspergillus.

547
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,005
But we still have no idea why.

548
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,973
Our kid's immune system
has a factory defect.

549
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,976
It's genetic. It
can't be genetic.

550
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,154
He would've been getting
infections since he was an infant.

551
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,478
Not if he grew up in a bubble.
Or if he grew up on Mars.

552
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,484
No germs there, either. I
don't mean a literal bubble.

553
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,010
A sweet suburban bubble where
mommies and daddies protect their children.

554
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,114
They die. Bubble bursts.

555
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,750
Continuing emotional trauma
triggers the genetic illness.

556
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,317
Question is, which one?

557
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:33,058
The infections he's contracted
narrow down the possibilities.

558
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,326
Hep A indicates a
problem with his B cells.

559
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,836
Bruton's
Agammaglobulinemia? Eikenella.

560
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,338
Points to a
complement deficiency.

561
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,101
I have a patient.
I need... Not now.

562
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,410
I'll go. You'll stay.

563
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,641
Patient's dying. So is mine.

564
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,547
Not in the next hour.

565
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,182
What does the syphilis tell us?

566
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,619
What does it tell us?

567
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,792
It could mean chronic
granulomatous disease.

568
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,796
And the aspergillus is a T cell issue.
Common variable immunodeficiency.

569
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,725
Genetic testing's
gonna take time.

570
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,345
Given the rate he's
picking up infections...

571
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,735
Why don't we
turn it into a race?

572
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,363
Little late to be
playing games with us.

573
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:16,432
Not you guys. The
infections. What infections?

574
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,706
The infections we're
gonna give him.

575
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,578
The only way to cure
me is to make me sicker?

576
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,845
Each of the four possible
genetic conditions

577
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,548
is most susceptible to
different types of infection.

578
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,756
What's that?

579
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:38,592
This is a cocktail of serratia,
meningococcus, cepacia and rhinovirus.

580
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,064
Whichever germ
gains the most ground

581
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,160
plants the flag of its
leader, gives us our answer.

582
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,400
And how are you gonna know
which one gains the most ground?

583
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,373
Well, that's the fun part.

584
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:53,708
See, if the meningococcus is king of
the hill, you get to have another seizure.

585
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:57,773
Serratia will shut down your lungs. If
it's cepacia, you'll have a heart attack.

586
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,683
And if it's the
rhinovirus, you'll sneeze.

587
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,723
They can't all be
dramatic. We good?

588
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,951
Hell, no.

589
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:10,155
Well, the alternative is we guess,
and there's a three out of four chance

590
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:14,495
that your little brother and sister
will get to cry over another coffin.

591
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:17,764
You study fractions
in school? We good?

592
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:35,047
And this test isn't
exactly FDA approved,

593
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,749
so let's just keep it
our little secret, okay?

594
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,921
Little Orphan Annie and Oliver
Twist slept in our hallways last night.

595
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,185
Are they singing?

596
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,693
They're children.
They need a guardian.

597
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,490
Couldn't find a babysitter

598
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,642
on account of not being
able to make any phone calls,

599
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,008
on account of not
being able to breathe,

600
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,592
on account of his lungs
filling up with serratia.

601
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,263
He has chronic
granulomatous disease.

602
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,999
Game over. Our work is done.

603
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,973
Then he's gonna
keep getting sick.

604
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,805
You gotta call Social Services.

605
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,778
Bone marrow transplant would
re-boot his whole immune system.

606
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:10,509
He'll be healthy enough to win
Miserable Daddy of the Year.

607
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,312
So see if one of
his kids is a match.

608
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,013
My kids are already
testing his kids.

609
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,654
Will's a match. You tested him?

610
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,358
I never consented for
that. It's just a blood draw.

611
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,795
There's no danger. To the
testing. What about the surgery?

612
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:27,162
The risk for Will
is next to nothing.

613
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,604
What if I don't do it?
What are my other options?

614
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,673
Your immune system
can't fight off the germs

615
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,974
we all come into
contact with every day.

616
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:44,210
Now that we know, we can
use more targeted medications,

617
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,946
but you'll still get
sick all the time.

618
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,315
You'll be in and
out of hospitals...

619
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,050
But I'll live.

620
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,855
Jack,

621
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:04,059
your lifespan will be
substantially shortened.

622
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,800
And you'll be too sick to care for
your brother and sister anymore.

623
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,152
You shouldn't have pressured
him into... There was no pressure.

624
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,168
He's eight years old!

625
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,156
You tell him his brother's
dying unless he helps.

626
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,257
What do you think he's gonna do?

627
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,944
He wants to help
you. He has no idea.

628
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:24,751
It's like you asked him to let me play
with one of his toys. This is surgery.

629
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,485
He could die. He'll be fine.

630
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,753
But you...

631
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:34,229
You're gonna have a hard time
protecting him like this if you're dead.

632
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,031
I'll do it...

633
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,337
when Will's 18 and
can decide for himself.

634
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,614
Noble. Moronic.

635
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,555
It's a synonym.

636
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,421
Why can't you accept he
wants to protect his brother?

637
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,018
Has to protect his
brother. Doesn't want to.

638
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,189
Wants to run screaming
from protecting his brother.

639
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,566
You're a hypocrite.

640
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:16,039
"Evidence is everything.
Truth is all that matters."

641
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,172
Except when it comes to people.

642
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:23,210
Everything we've learned
about this kid says you're wrong.

643
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,512
But you can't accept that.

644
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,052
It's easy to reject
the diagnosis.

645
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,782
Not so easy to reject
your misanthropy,

646
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:35,084
because then you'd have to
give people a fighting chance.

647
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,062
And that scares
the crap out of you.

648
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,298
Okay.

649
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,600
Let's get some evidence.

650
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,801
It's your lucky day.

651
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,280
Just found another donor
in the registry. Perfect match.

652
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:00,146
We can do the transplant
with no danger to the rug rat.

653
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,846
Just have to sign here.

654
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,120
Unless there's another
reason you don't want it.

655
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,488
There's a chance I'd die.

656
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,291
A chance you'll be cured.

657
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,558
Maybe you don't
want that, either.

658
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,834
Maybe hanging out in a hospital
getting waited on hand and foot

659
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:22,135
reminds you of what life used to be like
before you were forced to play Mister Mom.

660
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,039
I don't like being sick.

661
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,578
But you don't want
to be healthy, either.

662
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,770
This is your way out.

663
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,346
Guilt free.

664
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,745
I said I'd do it when Will's 18.

665
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,652
And he's able to take
care of himself without you.

666
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:41,853
Jack, your brother and
sister need you. I know!

667
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,327
I know every second of
every day that they need me,

668
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,489
but I'm too young
to be their dad.

669
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,072
Good for you.

670
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,507
Don't pretend you're surprised.

671
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,831
Want to go throw stuff
at people off the balcony?

672
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,502
Come on. Mail can wait.

673
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,472
I'm referring my patients
to other oncologists.

674
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,011
I'm shutting down
my practice. Oh, good.

675
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:34,822
'Cause I was afraid
you might overreact.

676
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,508
I can't just ask
my patients to wait

677
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,244
because Dr. Cameron's boss
won't let her come out and play!

678
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,151
I kept you waiting for
maybe an hour... Three hours!

679
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,423
Anybody die? Not this time.

680
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,551
Cameron's available
now. Use her all you want.

681
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,152
So now's a better time for
me to have my life taken away?

682
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:54,063
It fits into your schedule
better? Oh, poor you.

683
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,402
Think if you suffer loudly
enough... You committed a crime!

684
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,013
What do you want me
to do? Turn myself in?

685
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:02,530
Yes! Yes! Do something!
Go in! Show some remorse!

686
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,007
Tell Tritter you'll
get some help!

687
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,668
I don't need help!

688
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:10,612
House, get out of
here. Get out of here.

689
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:17,045
You are not gonna make me feel
guilty about what Tritter is doing to us.

690
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,316
You already feel guilty.

691
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:24,021
Your mysterious shoulder
pain isn't coming from your cane.

692
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,189
It's coming from
your conscience.

693
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,759
That used to be enough.

694
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,063
Despite all your smartass
remarks, I knew you gave a damn.

695
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,536
This time...

696
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,240
You were either gonna help
me through this or you weren't.

697
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,103
I got my answer.

698
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,156
Who's gonna drive me to school,

699
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,196
help me with my homework?

700
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,531
There'll be a mom
where they take you.

701
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,799
A real mom, someone
who can cook.

702
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,708
Don't worry. I'll still be
able to see you guys.

703
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,154
You said you'd make him better.

704
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:05,762
I'm sorry.

705
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:20,335
Thank you for not telling them.

706
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,580
You're a good kid.

707
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:29,080
Three months from
now, six months from now,

708
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:34,156
you'll be visiting them and you
won't be able to say goodbye.

709
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,953
You're gonna know
you screwed up.

710
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:41,789
You'll take his bone marrow
and you'll take them back.

711
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,993
And they'll be a
burden and a pain,

712
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:51,034
and your life will never be
what it was supposed to be.

713
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,569
But you'll be proud of yourself.

714
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:00,481
And your parents,
they'll be proud of you.

715
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,721
I don't think so.

716
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,590
It's what I wanna believe.
