1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,035
<i>Coming up to 50 feet.</i>

2
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,269
<i>Roger that.</i>

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,945
<i>We're light on fuel.
Two minutes to bingo.</i>

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,912
<i>Come on, Fisher, we got
places to go, people to see.</i>

5
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,145
<i>Working on it!</i>

6
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,949
<i>So I've heard.
What's taking so long?</i>

7
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,493
Let go of the suitcase!

8
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,161
Let go of the suitcase!

9
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,761
You're gonna have
to hold on to me!

10
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,367
Sir, whatever it
is, it's not worth it!

11
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,574
<i>We're at bingo fuel, sir.</i>

12
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,274
<i>You hear that, Fisher? Bingo!</i>

13
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,441
<i>Either reel him in or we're
leaving them both here!</i>

14
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,109
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

15
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,497
Ditch the damn luggage!

16
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,230
Marina.

17
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,560
Marina! Marina!

18
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,347
Tell him if he was so worried
about his wife's clothes,

19
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,043
he should have stayed in Cuba!

20
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:37,091
He says it wasn't her clothes,
it was her medical records.

21
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,353
Says she's sick and
needs to go home.

22
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,956
No home, House! I
need to see Dr. House!

23
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,132
You don't answer
your phone anymore.

24
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,900
I'm world-famous now.
Press won't leave me alone.

25
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,133
It's Cuddy. I know.

26
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,551
If it was the press,
I'd be answering.

27
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,908
And since you're not
taking her calls, I am.

28
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,878
Your patient's been
waiting for hours.

29
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,471
She didn't book an appointment.

30
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,072
No, she risked her life.

31
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,447
If you don't reach terra firma,

32
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,627
you don't get any milk or honey.

33
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,815
The woman has 10 different
things wrong with her,

34
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,790
including pains
all over her body.

35
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,194
Admittedly, not as interesting

36
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,423
as staring uselessly at Foreman.

37
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,158
You know why I find a
goodbye party fascinating?

38
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,999
I think it's kind of insulting to
celebrate when someone leaves you.

39
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,971
What are you gonna
do to keep him? Nothing.

40
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,974
He really is gonna leave.
You know that, right?

41
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,408
Yeah. So what are you gonna do?

42
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,501
Nothing I can do.

43
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,138
He doesn't want more money,
better working conditions,

44
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,342
doesn't even want a better job.

45
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,884
He wants to not be me.

46
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,920
Because he thinks you're
a cold-hearted bastard

47
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,979
without any regard
for anyone but yourself.

48
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,250
He's right.

49
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,316
You need to show him
that you really do care.

50
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,554
Don't!

51
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:58,793
Foreman's not the only
chocolate-covered cherry in the box.

52
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,202
House, you play a guitar
you got in ninth grade.

53
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,269
Eighth.

54
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,568
You're living in the same
apartment for 15 years,

55
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,575
you drive a 10 year-old car,
you are not good with change.

56
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,407
That used to be
true, but I changed.

57
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:16,041
He's not afraid to be you, he's
afraid to be who he thinks you are.

58
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,681
Rheumatic fever would
explain the skin rash.

59
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,368
But not the double
vision or bloody urine.

60
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:26,951
They were lost at
sea for three days.

61
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,689
Severe dehydration
causes kidney problems.

62
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,321
And the double vision?

63
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,332
Concussion during the shipwreck.

64
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,134
It all fits as long as each symptom
started when you think it started.

65
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,666
This would be a lot easier if
we had her medical records.

66
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,868
Any of you certified
deep-sea divers?

67
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,208
She's from a dirt-poor
country in the tropics.

68
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,009
Infectious disease and
parasites are the most likely cause

69
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,540
of unexplained pain, fever and skin
rash. We might as well start there.

70
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,678
If there's one
thing Castro knows,

71
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,813
it's how to look great in green.

72
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,400
And if there are two
things Castro knows,

73
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,258
it's how to look great in
green and train doctors.

74
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,727
Even without the
medical records,

75
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,855
we can assume she
was drowned in antibiotics

76
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,161
before she risked
drowning to see me.

77
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,031
So what doesn't Castro know?

78
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,400
How to lay his hands on
high-tech scanning equipment.

79
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,440
Pain, double vision
point us toward the head.

80
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,872
Cameron, get an MRI.

81
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,001
See what's cooking
in the old <i>cabeza.</i>

82
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,213
Chase, check out the husband.

83
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,771
Why? He hasn't
complained of any pain.

84
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,148
Basic math. Take all of her
symptoms, subtract his sea symptoms,

85
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,483
the remainder equals
her original symptoms.

86
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,730
Are you in any pain?

87
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,105
No, I'm just sunburned.

88
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,475
Any blurred vision?

89
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,774
No.

90
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,511
So my wife, she
is with Dr. House?

91
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,144
She's with another doctor
who is part of Dr. House's team.

92
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,246
No, she's supposed
to see Dr. House.

93
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,688
We have permission.

94
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,692
That's the way it
works with Dr. House.

95
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,421
I came 1,000 miles to see him!

96
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,190
He doesn't care.

97
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,991
I'm sorry, but that's who he is,

98
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,360
that's who you
risked your life to see.

99
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,731
And you made the right choice.

100
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,171
Any other metal?

101
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,870
Must have been
difficult on the boat.

102
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,816
When the storm
came, yes, very much.

103
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,985
I pray while my husband, he...

104
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,420
With the paddles?

105
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,084
You were on a boat
without a motor?

106
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,561
No, no, we start with a motor,

107
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,723
but it break on the first night.

108
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,900
My husband, he can fix anything.

109
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,167
A washing machine,
a car, a computer.

110
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,535
But that is stupid motor.

111
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,676
And me.

112
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,850
These two he cannot fix.

113
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,749
He got you to us.

114
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,412
He never gave up.

115
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,715
No matter what happen,

116
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,955
he kept saying to
me, "Don't worry,

117
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,492
"we will make it.

118
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,724
"I'll take care of you."

119
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,036
That's Esteban.

120
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,632
He refuses to worry or pray.

121
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,878
He believe if you
don't have one,

122
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,744
that you don't need the other.

123
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,014
Husband has a pulled
muscle in his shoulder,

124
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,319
but no other pains
or double vision.

125
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:48,192
He does have a fever, fungal
rash, cough, and elevated bilirubin.

126
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,356
Foreman's not going anywhere.

127
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,492
He said that to you?

128
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,677
He doesn't really wanna leave.

129
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,101
And you don't
really wanna let him.

130
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,229
You'll cave, just like
you did with Cameron.

131
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,296
Foreman's not as
easy as Cameron.

132
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,001
But, of course, who is?

133
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,672
I'm in the room.

134
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,646
He may not want a date,
but he does want something.

135
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,258
Well, maybe it's
something I can't offer.

136
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,409
Then you'll just lie.

137
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,746
He'd see through it. Maybe.

138
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,083
Or maybe he'll just see
what he wants to see.

139
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,619
She has MS.

140
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,159
Explains the pain, fatigue,

141
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,956
double vision, kidney problems.

142
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,468
The kidney problems
aren't connected.

143
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,362
Her husband has the same issues.

144
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,025
It is possible for
two people to have

145
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,711
the same symptom for
two different reasons.

146
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,912
If we're gonna
take that approach,

147
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,047
then we may as
well just throw out

148
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,031
everything we got from
the husband and start over.

149
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,474
We could do that, or we
could do something productive.

150
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,238
Start her on
Interferon for the MS,

151
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,778
see if she improves.

152
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,310
I do like being productive.

153
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,514
Well done. Do it.

154
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,218
"Well done"? Is that what you
think he wants, a pat on the head?

155
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,023
Go do your job.

156
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,498
She does not have MS.

157
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,774
I know it's not a pleasant
diagnosis to hear...

158
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,472
But, no! The doctors in
Cuba would have found MS.

159
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,314
What's that?

160
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,584
It's all right. Her
pulse ox just came off.

161
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:22,821
Marina, you can't...

162
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,889
But it hurts.

163
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,186
Her pain is getting worse!

164
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,818
Your treatment isn't
working because it's not MS.

165
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,226
Does this hurt?

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,201
Wow! Well, either Foreman's way
stronger than he thinks he is or...

167
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,966
Seriously. Or?

168
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,444
She's too young for
osteoporosis that severe.

169
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,311
And too old for
osteogenesis imperfecta.

170
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,815
Which leaves bone cancer.

171
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,545
Cancer's a long shot. - Why?

172
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,486
Because metastatic tumors
don't explain the abnormal MRI,

173
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,955
kidney damage, cotton
mouth, double vision.

174
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,184
Oh, wait, they do!

175
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,535
Infection could
do all that, too.

176
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,686
It's not an infection.

177
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,960
Because you know the
nonexistent medical records confirm

178
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,125
that the brilliant doctors in
Cuba treated her for infection,

179
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,566
or because you're trying
to kiss up to Foreman?

180
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,031
Because an infection
would cause a fever,

181
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,816
and the brilliant doctors
who work in my office

182
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,985
have already crossed that off
the list because the husband...

183
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,987
You're the one who said
it's possible for two people

184
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,989
to have the same symptom
for two different reasons.

185
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,914
And you're the one
who said if we do that,

186
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,126
we might as well throw out
everything we got from the husband.

187
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,431
Right, and then you said we
should do something productive

188
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,182
like breaking her arm?

189
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,688
Foreman didn't break her arm.

190
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,952
Of course he didn't. Cancer did.

191
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,893
Put her in a PET scan,
see what else it's breaking.

192
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,564
This isn't gonna
work! He's not a moron!

193
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,101
You can't just agree with
everything he says for two days

194
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,832
and hope he forgets the last three
years and how much he hates you!

195
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,469
Anything else?

196
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,774
When you get the results of
the PET scan, let me know.

197
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,336
I don't really care if
Foreman stays or goes, but...

198
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,502
You're fired.

199
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,848
What, because I yelled at you?

200
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,411
Because you've
been here the longest,

201
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:39,084
learned all you can or you
haven't learned anything at all.

202
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,027
Either way, it's
time for a change.

203
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,967
Fine.

204
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,316
No tumors in her arm.

205
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,917
Synovial membrane
is working fine.

206
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,553
No hot spots, no bone cancer.

207
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,825
Maybe we should be
looking for something else.

208
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,726
Is it raining out?

209
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,071
House fired me. What?

210
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,903
Because you yelled at him?

211
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,910
"Time for a change" was
the official explanation.

212
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,605
It makes no sense.

213
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,204
Since when does
House make sense?

214
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,304
He always makes sense.

215
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,381
He's angry.

216
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,111
Yes, it's all about
you, Foreman.

217
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,085
He's upset you're
leaving, so he fires Chase.

218
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,678
Excuse me.

219
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,848
On the humerus,
she's got a hot spot.

220
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,151
Why'd you fire Chase?

221
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,250
Sure thing.

222
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,159
First you tell me the
results of the PET scan.

223
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,458
Did you fire him for me?

224
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,725
Would you stay if I did?

225
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,164
You asked him to fire Chase?

226
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,599
No! Yes!

227
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,159
You're frustrated with Foreman

228
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,898
so you lash out, kick the dog?

229
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,237
He's not gone five minutes
and the name-calling starts.

230
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,537
What's on the PET scan?

231
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,609
Why'd you fire Chase?

232
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,236
Do you know what's
on the PET scan?

233
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,507
You two, out.

234
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,808
Wait! What's on the PET scan?

235
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,943
You can't dump your
entire department

236
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,544
just because you don't know
how to deal with an issue.

237
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,749
Yes, they are all irreplaceable.

238
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,858
If only in this country
we'd figure out a way

239
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,951
to somehow teach people
to interpret PET scans.

240
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,428
What the hell's wrong
with you? You fired Chase?

241
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,508
I don't suppose you know
what's on my patient's PET scan.

242
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,694
I told you to show
Foreman you have a heart.

243
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,688
How does that translate
into you being a bastard?

244
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,795
So that's a no.

245
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,636
Pick up the phone and tell
Chase you made a mistake.

246
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,208
Un-fire him.

247
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:17,778
Chase, if you know what's
on the PET scan, call me back.

248
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,679
Cut the crap.

249
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,220
Chase is a good doctor.

250
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,017
Sorry, you're in the wrong room.

251
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,422
My name on the door,
my team, my decisions.

252
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,824
My building, my
floor, my people.

253
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,224
Hold that reprimand. House.

254
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,860
Dr. Chase! How are you?

255
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:42,433
Thank you. You
are indispensable.

256
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,169
You're still fired. Sorry.

257
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,173
Wow, that was awkward.

258
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,615
PET scan revealed a blood
clot in my patient's arm.

259
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,676
Which means goodbye.

260
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,278
Still got two people
working for me,

261
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,152
gotta get one of
them to do my job.

262
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,591
A clot means a heart problem.

263
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,893
We have to do an
emergency angiogram.

264
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,442
But you're not sure
it's a blood clot?

265
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,527
PET scan can't determine
that with certainty.

266
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,147
So you have no better idea what's
wrong with her than when we first got here?

267
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,731
We've ruled out MS. I
told you it wasn't MS.

268
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,070
Where is Dr. House?

269
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,633
Dr. House has
left for the night.

270
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,906
He'll be here in the
morning to review the results,

271
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,244
if you sign the consent.

272
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:33,449
But, you know, you
could call him at home.

273
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,761
He doesn't always
pick up, so keep calling.

274
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,498
Thank you.

275
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,734
<i>Dr. House, it's Esteban
Hernandez again.</i>

276
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,936
<i>As soon as you get home,
it's very important you call me.</i>

277
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,783
<i>Hello, yes, Dr. House,
it's Esteban Hernandez.</i>

278
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,452
<i>As soon as you get home,
if can you please call me?</i>

279
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,659
The catheter is in
her femoral artery.

280
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,258
Why are you telling me that?

281
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,026
Because you're assisting.

282
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,299
Do I look like I'm assisting?

283
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,274
I had nothing to do
with Chase's termination.

284
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,037
Is everything okay?

285
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,872
You're doing fine, Marina.

286
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,390
The dye will take a minute to
work its way through your system.

287
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,425
Why would you tell House
you're leaving because he's a jerk?

288
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,849
Because it's the truth.

289
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,217
Did you give an angry
Cuban my home number?

290
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,348
Why would you do that?

291
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,468
You're not turning into
House, you're worse than him.

292
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,436
Let me get this straight.
Instead of picking up the phone

293
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,986
and talking to a
patient for five minutes,

294
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,555
you gave up on sleep
and drove in here.

295
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,895
My chest!

296
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,869
She's in V-Tach.

297
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,303
What did you do? Nothing!

298
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,533
Must have hit something.
You nick an artery?

299
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,975
She has no pulse.

300
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,277
It hurts.

301
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,714
She has no pulse,
but she's talking.

302
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:11,024
Cough! Cough
again! Keep coughing!

303
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,734
It'll push blood into your
head, keep you conscious.

304
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,454
Push one milligram Epinephrine.

305
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,986
Will that help?

306
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,034
No. But it is amazingly cool.

307
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,345
We need to get her on bypass!

308
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,428
We need to keep her here.

309
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,014
If this was a clot,
the force of bypass

310
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,516
will blow it into
her brain, kill her.

311
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,017
If we continue CPR,
she'll lose blood flow,

312
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,118
which will cause brain damage.

313
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,735
What caused the heart to stop?

314
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,336
Let's assume it
wasn't human error.

315
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,890
I didn't nick an
artery, it just stopped.

316
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,143
I said let's assume.

317
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,960
The only other option
is electrical instability.

318
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,816
No ST segment changes.

319
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:41,984
We need to tell the husband.

320
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,319
Tell him what? We have
no idea what happened.

321
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,324
House?

322
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,721
Keep going until
I figure this out.

323
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,833
House!

324
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,267
Jeez.

325
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,037
At 47, I hope my colon
looks better than this guy's.

326
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,272
Isolating the
first transverse...

327
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,810
<i>Help! I'm trapped
inside a monitor!</i>

328
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,915
Not a good time, House.

329
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,447
My patient lost her heartbeat during
routine cardiac catheterization, so...

330
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,754
Human error.

331
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,953
<i>It's not human error.</i>

332
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,223
Electrical instability?

333
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,628
Pre-procedure EKG
was normal, no syncope.

334
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,698
Ischemia?

335
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,632
<i>Foreman said no
ST segment changes.</i>

336
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,499
Human error is the
only other possible...

337
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,037
<i>It's not human error.</i>

338
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,834
Of course it's human error!

339
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,651
You don't want Foreman
to have made a mistake

340
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,852
because then you'd
have to mock him.

341
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,396
And that would put a crimp in
your brilliant plan of keeping him

342
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,539
by having a breakdown
and firing Chase.

343
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,708
<i>Did you just spit
on the monitor?</i>

344
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,574
<i>You know I can't see you.</i>

345
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,088
<i>Human error would not
explain her symptoms.</i>

346
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,949
You mean her heart stopping?

347
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,719
<i>I mean her foot
pain, her back pain.</i>

348
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,455
House! I'm busy!
You have a team,

349
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,121
run your differential with them.

350
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,432
<i>Foreman and Cameron
are doing CPR.</i>

351
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,364
Then you shouldn't
have fired Chase.

352
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:03,993
Change is fun, huh?

353
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,899
Five, six, seven, eight!

354
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:10,999
Go!

355
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,578
Someone's gotta
talk to the husband.

356
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,724
He thought this whole thing
was gonna last 45 minutes!

357
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,649
A half hour more of
this, nothing to talk about,

358
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,209
we won't be able to bring her
back. We gotta get her on bypass.

359
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,982
House still isn't
answering his phone.

360
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,545
You, get in here.

361
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,214
Go!

362
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:31,722
Excuse me, my wife was
supposed to be back an hour ago...

363
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,993
As soon as we know
anything, we'll call you.

364
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,398
Thank you.

365
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:43,172
Human Behavior
finals will also get into

366
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,269
clinical presentations of mania,

367
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,312
and we'll touch on Stanislas
Dehaene's PET scans.

368
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,613
Excuse me, Professor.

369
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,654
House, when we're
done with our rounds...

370
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,279
My patient has no heartbeat.

371
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,792
Stopped when we inserted a
catheter during a routine angiogram.

372
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,328
Anyone tells me
why her heart stopped

373
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,556
gets an A in Dr. Cuddy's class.

374
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,759
Anyone?

375
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,490
Human error?

376
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,365
Yeah. I'm polling
first-year medical students

377
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,996
because I hadn't
considered human error.

378
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,369
Marfan's Syndrome?

379
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,670
Structural abnormalities
would show up on the echo.

380
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,903
You get a C. Yeah?

381
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:18,910
Botox injections.

382
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,037
F.

383
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,173
If the injection was tainted
with live botulism, it'd fit.

384
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,978
B-plus.

385
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,383
Unfortunately, she missed
her last Botox appointment

386
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,786
due to a boating accident,
but send me your résumé.

387
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,323
House, time's up.

388
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,189
Good Lord, you
smell like musk ox.

389
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,786
Either our patient goes on
bypass, or I call time of death.

390
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,694
Your patient isn't
already on bypass?

391
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,993
I was worried about a clot.

392
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,499
How long? Three hours.

393
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,536
House. Bypass, now!

394
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,818
Clear the hall!

395
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,286
Out of the way, please!

396
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,720
Let's go! Excuse us!

397
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,953
Dr. Foreman! My wife!
What has happened?

398
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,995
Her heart stopped. We
have to get her on bypass.

399
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,290
He needs to wait outside.

400
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,523
Got it?

401
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,612
Dr. House.

402
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,150
You can vacuum later.

403
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,377
I am not the janitor, I
am Esteban Hernandez.

404
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,183
What happened to my wife?

405
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,784
Her heart stopped.

406
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,554
Why did her heart stop?

407
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,306
Well, if I knew that,
I'd be coming to you.

408
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,727
Tell me where you take her.

409
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,128
Tell me what is happen to her?

410
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,361
"Happening." It's
a present participle.

411
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,793
Not a particularly
interesting form of speech.

412
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,634
Kind of like this conversation.

413
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,333
But I risk my life to see you.

414
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,375
I looked you up. You fix people.

415
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,104
When everyone else
gives up, you don't!

416
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,146
And now you insult me?

417
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,672
Ignore my wife?

418
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:02,806
Helps my process.

419
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,544
You do not ignore my wife, okay?

420
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,812
She is everything to me.

421
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,979
Well, then you do
not ignore your wife.

422
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,989
You just sit here! You
don't talk to people.

423
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,753
How do you fix something
if you don't look at it?

424
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,638
Turn on bypass, please.

425
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,939
Good. Good distal flow.

426
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,942
Need to look at the heart.

427
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:39,076
Why?

428
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,643
I can't find my wallet.
Pick it up. Turn it over.

429
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,732
I don't see anything
physically wrong with her heart.

430
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,520
Hearts don't stop for no reason.

431
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,083
Okay. Take your look.

432
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,690
You see anything wrong?

433
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,964
Give her a jump-start.

434
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,641
Clear. Clear.

435
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,307
Clear.

436
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,612
And again.

437
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,351
Clear! Clear! Clear!

438
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,490
Again.

439
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,358
Yeah, seventh time
is the charm. Sorry.

440
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:26,422
I'll keep her on bypass until the
husband has a chance to say goodbye.

441
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,842
I'm not telling the
husband anything

442
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,129
until I can tell him why his...

443
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,430
It doesn't matter.

444
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,336
Her heart can't
start. She's dead.

445
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,479
I got you something.

446
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,398
I'll miss you.

447
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,566
I know you won't miss me, but...

448
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,766
I just thought it would be
nice for you to have that.

449
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,579
I will miss you.

450
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,509
Can I have a hug, too?

451
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,213
The surgeon found nothing.

452
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,086
He can't start her heart.

453
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,286
What a thoughtful gift.

454
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,988
Nice reminder of
intellectual theft

455
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,655
to hang at your new
place of employment.

456
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,495
You two can go. Say
hi to Chase for me.

457
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,228
You're wearing lipstick.

458
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,302
We can stay. We can
run another differential.

459
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,567
You two have no theories
about why the heart stopped,

460
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,884
which means I
don't need you. Go.

461
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,537
It's too late for theories.
We need to tell the husband.

462
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:47,136
Tell him what? That it's over.

463
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,147
Why? Because
her heart won't start!

464
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,910
How can we tell
him there's no hope

465
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:53,009
if we don't know
why there's no hope?

466
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,919
He's not gonna pull
the plug on his wife.

467
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,445
He risked his life
to get her to me.

468
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:59,034
If he pulls the plug,
it means he's failed.

469
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,027
If he pulls the plug, it
means you've failed.

470
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,527
And you're okay with that?

471
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,321
Go.

472
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,613
Hey. Hey.

473
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:26,914
You look great.

474
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,545
You know House firing you
has nothing to do with you.

475
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,615
The why doesn't matter.

476
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,468
Foreman will end up
staying, House will call you,

477
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,358
probably yell at you
for not showing up.

478
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,055
It's okay.

479
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,626
He's right. It's
time for a change.

480
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:43,925
You were right, too.

481
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:49,236
The whole "It's Tuesday,
I like you." It was silly.

482
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,973
Oh, don't give me that look.

483
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,741
Don't feel sorry for me.

484
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,773
Getting this job was the best
thing that has ever happened to me.

485
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,786
Everything about
it. And losing it?

486
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:08,249
Well, I think it's
gonna be good, too.

487
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,087
I'll miss you.

488
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,896
Have you got time for
a drink or something?

489
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,093
I think I should go.

490
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,269
Yeah.

491
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,098
How's it going?

492
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,268
The way the security
light hits your legs,

493
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,146
looks good.

494
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,848
Thank you.

495
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,615
If you're here to
yell at me about

496
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,851
the Foreman-Chase
situation, it can wait.

497
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,723
When do you plan
on telling the husband

498
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,455
it's time to say
goodbye to his wife?

499
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,258
Haven't put a clock on it.

500
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:23,735
Other than your curiosity, do you
have any reason to keep her on bypass?

501
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,101
Patient's husband
prefers her not dead.

502
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,571
Or you want a storybook ending

503
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,131
for the young man who
crossed the ocean for his wife.

504
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,802
This is not an act.

505
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,539
I don't care.
Then pull the plug!

506
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,911
What if I can fix it, but
I just don't know it yet?

507
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,142
I know you care.

508
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,582
I don't care!

509
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,276
I really don't care.

510
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,119
My motives are pure.

511
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,122
If we do an autopsy
and we see, "Oops,

512
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:55,431
"if I'd thought of that crazy
idea, we could have saved her,"

513
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:58,364
then the husband might be upset.

514
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,531
You've done all you can do.

515
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,837
It's time to let go.

516
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,023
I was told you
didn't believe in God.

517
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,928
I don't.

518
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:30,469
I promise my wife I'll do
everything I can to fix her.

519
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:35,766
If I don't pray, then I
don't do everything.

520
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:42,573
It's not working.
She's not coming back.

521
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:46,051
If you want to say goodbye,
you can come down to the ICU,

522
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,451
and then I'll take
her off bypass.

523
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,720
I'm sorry. I should have...

524
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:07,133
Marina, I am so sorry.

525
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,711
When you turn the
machine off, that's it?

526
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,808
Yeah.

527
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,053
Right now, is her brain working?

528
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,783
Probably. Just not her heart.

529
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,254
She seems like
she's just sleeping.

530
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,022
She's not sleeping.

531
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,021
We double-checked.

532
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,812
Her heart? It beat?

533
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,723
No, it's residual
flow from the bypass.

534
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,823
No, I can feel it. Look!

535
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,305
That is her heart, no?

536
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:01,213
P wave, Q, R, S, T wave.
That's a normal normal.

537
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,319
Esteban?

538
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,188
Marina!

539
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,390
Holy crap.

540
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,256
Is this heaven?

541
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,233
No, it's New Jersey.

542
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,063
God sent you back to me.

543
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,235
It's a miracle.

544
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,578
It's impossible.

545
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,745
Apparently not.

546
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,289
Live hearts don't
stop for no reason.

547
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,756
Dead hearts don't
start for no reason.

548
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,020
Apparently they do.

549
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,023
She's three hours off
bypass and still stable.

550
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,563
And the pain is gone.

551
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,630
No, it's not.

552
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,429
You think she's lying
about feeling better?

553
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,612
Just because it's not there
now doesn't mean it's gone.

554
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,914
Just because it was there before

555
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,138
doesn't mean it's coming back.

556
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,073
Chase was probably right.

557
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,905
She had some sort
of tropical infection

558
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,536
that cleared when we put her
on antibiotics during the bypass.

559
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:03,207
Antibiotics did not
bring her back to life.

560
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,711
Other than a miracle,

561
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,911
it's the only explanation
for her symptoms.

562
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:11,281
How come God gets credit
whenever something good happens?

563
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,850
Where was he when
her heart stopped?

564
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,260
What if it wasn't human error?

565
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,799
What if it was God's error?

566
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:29,274
A congenital defect in an artery
making it susceptible to inflammation.

567
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,968
We need to do another angiogram.

568
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,945
We've looked at her heart 100
different ways. There was no evidence...

569
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,357
The one time we
looked inside her heart,

570
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,859
we stopped before
we could see anything.

571
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,579
Because it stopped.

572
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,454
Good news.

573
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,698
I think we know
what the problem is.

574
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,265
You mean "was."

575
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,634
Hey, it's my first
language, not yours.

576
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,163
If she wants to outlive
Castro, we need to fix her heart.

577
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,705
In case no one's filled you in,

578
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,474
today is Monday, which means
you've been dead for a day.

579
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,449
If that kind of symptom
comes back, it can get serious.

580
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,487
I need to do another angiogram.

581
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,615
Wait. Wasn't that what
caused her heart to stop before?

582
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,717
No, God caused that.
He's all-powerful, you know.

583
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,025
He was watching
over us in the ocean

584
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,894
and he's watching over us now.

585
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:31,528
Your rescuers didn't have
wings, they had a helicopter.

586
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:32,627
Esteban prayed.

587
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,572
Do you know how many little
boys are praying for jetpacks?

588
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,802
How many priests
are praying for...

589
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,007
Well, that one actually works.

590
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,479
You didn't bring me back to him.

591
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,091
And I'm not gonna
take you away from him,

592
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,584
but if we don't do
this test, God will.

593
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:50,953
You said there was no
chance, no hope, which means...

594
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,490
Which means I was wrong.

595
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,219
But I'm wrong all the time.

596
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,490
My mistakes don't
prove there's a God.

597
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,955
You came a long way to see me.

598
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,597
You gonna put her life in
God's hands or in mine?

599
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:16,245
Ready?

600
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,081
I better not see you praying.

601
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,184
I don't want to have to
fight for credit on this.

602
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:28,824
Exiting the femoral,
entering the aortic arch.

603
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:29,893
This is where...

604
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,953
Where we stopped to
have a picnic last week.

605
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,623
Her blood pressure's rising!

606
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:37,066
Mine's rising, too. Of course,
I am doing battle with a deity.

607
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,962
In the heart.

608
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:44,701
Injecting the dye.

609
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,374
Right coronary
flow is unobstructed.

610
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,109
Left coronary flow looks normal.

611
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,206
Looks like you're wrong.

612
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:56,618
Either I'm right or this
test is about to go very bad.

613
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,285
What's that?

614
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:12,427
She has one,
two, a third ostium!

615
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:16,071
How many is she
supposed to have? <i>Dos.</i>

616
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:19,600
All the third one's doing is causing
inflammation, throwing off clots,

617
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,374
getting in the way
of the angiogram.

618
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,506
No human would
screw up that big.

619
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,140
Don't worry.

620
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,481
Just one more
surgery, it'll be fine.

621
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,280
Thank God!

622
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:31,954
Don't make me slap you!

623
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,699
Hi.

624
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,371
It's Tuesday.

625
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,840
No, it's Monday.

626
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,074
I know, I just...

627
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,646
I didn't feel like waiting.

628
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,900
I hear you got another
satisfied customer.

629
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:22,641
One more and I get
a set of steak knives.

630
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,908
Well, this is it.

631
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,115
I appreciate the
opportunity you gave me.

632
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:37,784
Didn't do it for you.

633
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,823
Thought you were
the best guy for the job.

634
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,224
Thanks, I guess.

635
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,828
Which is why I want you to stay.

636
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,969
You're an important
part of the team.

637
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,766
I need you.

638
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:02,275
I know. But I don't need you.

639
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,248
And I definitely
don't wanna be you.

640
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:05,408
You're miserable.

641
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,714
I just solved a
case by predicting

642
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,119
a never-before-seen
heart defect.

643
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:11,755
A case you couldn't solve.

644
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:13,155
A case you gave up on.

645
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,590
I couldn't be happier.

646
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,991
For two minutes, maybe.

647
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,722
Until the next case comes along.

648
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,765
Until you're jonesing
for your next fix.

649
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,698
This woman talks
while in full cardiac arrest

650
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,146
and you're more excited about
the talking than the heart dying!

651
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,331
The two were connected.

652
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,236
I don't wanna solve cases.

653
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,739
I wanna save lives.

654
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,538
Do you think she cares?

655
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,536
Do you think the husband cares?

656
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,022
You think the children
she can now have

657
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,447
because of me are gonna
care why I saved her?

658
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,643
I care. About yourself!

659
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,413
About your own ego! House.

660
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,921
You're the selfish
bastard, not me,

661
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,733
which is why you took so
much pleasure in drawing out

662
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,877
this little goodbye of yours
for the last three weeks.

663
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,690
It wasn't for me, it
wasn't for anyone!

664
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,730
It sure as hell
didn't help anyone!

665
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:09,778
Nice try.

666
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,480
Nice tries are worthless.

667
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,642
You now have a
bigger office than I do.

668
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,379
Why don't you go enjoy it?

669
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,517
Better be naked pictures.

670
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,480
My resignation letter.

671
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,434
I've gotten all I
can from this job.

672
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,796
What do you expect me to do?

673
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,542
Break down and apologize?
Beg Chase to come back?

674
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:11,871
No.

675
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,870
I expect you to do
what you always do.

676
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,006
I expect you to make
a joke and go on.

677
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,082
I expect you to be just fine.

678
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:26,989
I'll miss you.

679
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,196
Genuine American cigars.

680
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,336
You guys can't get them in Cuba.

681
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,899
100% healthy.

682
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,808
Shouldn't you go home?

683
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,609
Patient follow-up.
Very important.

684
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,643
She looks great. I
think she's sleeping.

685
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,153
She is sleeping, I double-check.

686
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,753
So, they all quit?

687
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,290
Two of them quit.
I fired the third.

688
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,233
It must be very hard
to lose your people.

689
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,533
You must be very upset.

690
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,570
Yeah, I must be.

691
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,471
But you're not?

692
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,237
I don't think I am.

693
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,749
I think I'm okay.

694
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:30,278
What are you going to do?

695
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:33,985
God only knows.
