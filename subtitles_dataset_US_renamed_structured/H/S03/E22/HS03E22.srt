1
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,175
She almost took my head off.

2
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,149
Your fault. You didn't
guard your left side.

3
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,090
Point.

4
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,543
Stop, stop, stop!

5
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:56,014
Addie, you're bleeding.

6
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,157
I never even hit her.

7
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,923
Good morning.

8
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,035
This is funny. People don't...

9
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,264
Not done reading. Go away.

10
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,538
Most likely, she coughed it up.

11
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,839
Which would mean it's from her
lungs. Drugs, toxins, infection...

12
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,573
No fever and no elevated white
count. Which rules out infection.

13
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,512
And blood panels found
no drugs, no toxins.

14
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,608
The bronchoscopy was
pristine. So much for the lungs.

15
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,482
Good morning. Not yet.

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,965
So then, the blood
came from her stomach.

17
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,958
Which would mean it's
an ulcer or a GI bleed.

18
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:07,859
ER also did an upper and lower
GI. No <i>occult</i> blood in her stool.

19
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,760
Which means no
ulcer or GI bleed.

20
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,474
Which means it's not
from the stomach, either.

21
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,058
Which means it didn't
come from anywhere.

22
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,766
You guys get to the point where
the blood didn't come from anywhere?

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,571
Rupture in her sinus cavity?
Drip through the back?

24
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,703
Not that much blood.
Trauma from karate?

25
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,111
No trauma. She kicked
the other guy's ass.

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,443
Now a good time?

27
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,882
If you can tell me how blood
can mysteriously appear in a...

28
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,479
Now. This includes you.

29
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,655
What's going on?

30
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,718
Feel free to speculate
amongst yourselves.

31
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,563
Are you sure? Yeah.

32
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,667
Why?

33
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,327
He's afraid of turning into me.

34
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,706
Well, that's a good
enough reason.

35
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,333
Sign here.

36
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,878
Doesn't look promising.

37
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,177
Good luck.

38
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,048
Thank you. That's it?

39
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,896
You're not going to tell
him that we're a family

40
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,616
and families don't
abandon each other?

41
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,351
You want me to? No.

42
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,256
Would it make
any difference? No.

43
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,657
Good luck, Dr. Foreman.

44
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,099
So, where were we?

45
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,267
College sophomore
coughing up blood.

46
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:34,144
Not the case. The speculation. The
palace intrigue. The rising self-doubts.

47
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,558
Did Foreman get a promotion?

48
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,914
I resigned.

49
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,151
What?

50
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,452
Personally, I can't believe I've had the
same three employees for three years.

51
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,050
Patient could have
a heart problem.

52
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:53,295
Yes. Life goes on. Look at the
eager beaver combing his hair.

53
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,204
Hyper-dynamic heart could force
too much blood into her lungs.

54
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,534
She coughed up the overflow.

55
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,441
Wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs because
it's traveling through normal plumbing.

56
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,571
Foreman, go do a stress
echo test to see if he's right.

57
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:10,281
Cameron? Check out the
dorm, then re-do the ER labs.

58
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,683
I'll get going on
Foreman's farewell party.

59
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,349
Everybody good with a
"Mermaid Under the Stars" theme?

60
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,030
So, why are you leaving?

61
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,132
Or is it just some
sort of power play?

62
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,937
You can have my
parking space, my locker.

63
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,671
Is it about House?

64
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,272
Let me get all sensitive
and confide in you.

65
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,512
Addie? Pedal harder.
Need your heart rate at 170.

66
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,820
Why wouldn't you
want to tell me?

67
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,283
I don't like you.
Never have. Never will.

68
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,691
You want me to share some more?

69
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,633
Even if you do hate me, if you'd
found another job, you'd tell me.

70
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,159
If House did something to drive
you out of here, you'd tell me.

71
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:08,698
The fact that you won't tell me
means that whatever the real reason is

72
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,334
you're ashamed of it.

73
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,111
Guys? I'm at 170.

74
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,430
Pulmonary artery looks
good. It's not a heart problem.

75
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,760
Are you cold? No.

76
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,238
Scared? I'm okay. Why?

77
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,832
On your arm.

78
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,542
Addie has goose bumps.

79
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,144
No recovering from those babies.

80
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,565
You don't have goose
bumps for no reason.

81
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,500
They're a reaction to
the body thinking it's cold.

82
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,135
She wasn't cold. Her
temperature was normal.

83
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,094
But her body thought
it was. Which means...

84
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,857
What? A brain problem?

85
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,989
A messed up hypothalamus
could cause goose bumps

86
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,143
but they're not going to
cause her to cough up blood.

87
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,193
She has no neurological
issues. She had a shiver.

88
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,464
I think there's an infection.

89
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,234
We've ruled out infection
because no fever, no white count.

90
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,172
I think there's an infection.

91
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,644
Blood goes where it's needed. Infection
likes nice, wet places. Her lungs.

92
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:23,013
Start treatment. All that cool stuff for
bacterial, fungal, and atypical infections.

93
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:27,043
Get a lung biopsy. I want to
see the little bugger up close.

94
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,192
Why is Foreman quitting?

95
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,491
He wants to breed llamas.

96
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,865
Interesting.

97
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,902
You're ashamed
of the reason, too.

98
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,884
No one writes
tamoxifen like you.

99
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,183
Well, I use a "G."

100
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,084
Foreman resigned.

101
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,955
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,690
It's okay. No biggie.

103
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,494
Right. He give a reason?

104
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:17,798
He said he didn't want to end
up like me. I had a brilliant retort.

105
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,203
I can't remember what
it was at the moment.

106
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,902
You don't want
to end up like you.

107
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,808
Good point. Can I resign?

108
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,178
What's up with that?

109
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,841
With what? You yawned.

110
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,498
I just told you something
interesting, so you're not bored.

111
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,267
It's 11:00 in the morning, you're
drinking coffee, so you're not tired.

112
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,227
I didn't yawn, so it's not
a mirror-neuron reaction.

113
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,425
Which leaves symptom. Vasovagal
issue, maybe a heart problem.

114
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,296
My heart's fine. I was up late.

115
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,962
You're just deflecting having
a conversation about Foreman.

116
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,732
I'm okay with Foreman leaving.

117
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,125
Either you're lying, or you
don't really think he's leaving

118
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:57,144
or you just jumped
right to acceptance.

119
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:02,105
I'm sorry. I yawned because I
was trying to communicate boredom.

120
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,849
You could try bargaining
with him. Give him a raise.

121
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:10,485
How much do you think it would
cost to make him want to be like me?

122
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,394
Thanks for the coffee.

123
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,362
She seems fine.

124
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,559
She is fine. She
coughed up blood.

125
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,433
Past tense. She has diarrhea.

126
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,029
From the antibiotics
for the infection.

127
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,234
Lung biopsy says she
doesn't have an infection.

128
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,752
Well, then, you
screwed up the biopsy.

129
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,404
Or you're wrong about infection.

130
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,208
If I'm wrong, then
so is her body.

131
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,991
Because it obviously
thinks she's got an infection,

132
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,726
or it wouldn't have gotten
better from the antibiotics.

133
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,878
What is pandiculation
symptomatic of?

134
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:42,013
Yawning is a symptom of
fatigue or cholinergic excitation.

135
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,432
Does this have anything
to do with Addie?

136
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,685
Let's say yes.

137
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,624
Cerebral tumor, epilepsy...

138
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,322
Could also be a medication
reaction to antidepressants

139
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,456
or some meds for
end-stage liver failure.

140
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,124
Let's say no.

141
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,670
You don't want
to leave this job.

142
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,071
Three years you've been here.

143
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,474
You've never once
laughed at anything he said.

144
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,569
Because I wasn't
kissing his ass.

145
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,047
But now, you are? No.
Now, you're nervous.

146
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,880
Uncomfortable about your decision.
Wasn't even that good a joke.

147
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,351
Oh, crap.

148
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,821
Most of your jokes are excellent.
I just meant in comparison.

149
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,088
Shut up. I think she
may not have an infection.

150
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,492
Better deal with her
before she crashes.

151
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,097
She can't breathe.
Get off the bed.

152
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,568
Need a crash cart.

153
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,735
What's happening?

154
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,171
Let's get her down. Now.

155
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:38,078
Pressure's collapsing her
lungs. She's not getting any air.

156
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,913
Oh, my God.

157
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,135
She couldn't breathe because
she had a pleural effusion.

158
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,832
Thoracentesis revealed low protein
count, effusion was transudative,

159
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,704
which means she has cirrhosis
of the liver, or she's in heart failure.

160
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,142
Heart was fine, liver
enzymes were normal.

161
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,511
There's something called
"blude" in the pleural effusion.

162
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,509
Oh. It's not
"blude," it's blood.

163
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:23,220
Which is great. Not for her, but for me.
Because it means I think it's an infection.

164
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,020
Labs indicated
minute traces of blood.

165
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,324
You can't ignore the blood because
it's a minority. Can you, Foreman?

166
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,235
If we count the traces
of blood as significant,

167
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,596
the differential
isn't just infection.

168
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,098
Could be lung cancer,
breast cancer, lymphoma...

169
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,400
Great. Go tell her
she's got one of those.

170
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:43,205
Or you can tell her that we haven't given
her enough antibiotics for her infection.

171
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,438
Double the dose.
Then check her lungs.

172
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,504
We checked her
lungs. They're clean.

173
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,039
On the outside. She
needs an arteriogram.

174
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,954
It's about my bowel movements.

175
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,586
What isn't, these days?

176
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,774
You sure you want
to be here for this?

177
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,733
We do everything together.

178
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,293
Of course. A toilet
can be a lonely place.

179
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,169
Drop your pants. I'll suit up.

180
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,811
They float. Huh?

181
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:22,315
My bowel movements. Honey
says they're not supposed to?

182
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,813
I'm a nutritionist.

183
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:28,513
Yes, I could tell from
the cool toe-loop sandals.

184
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,382
Thank you. You're welcome.

185
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,423
And the natural fiber
clothing, I assume,

186
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,488
means some kind of
vegetarian denomination?

187
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,729
We're vegans. At first, I was a little
concerned about the lack of protein

188
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,100
but Honey showed me
you can get it from lots...

189
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,366
Well, whatever floats your poop.

190
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,432
And you've been together
how long? Six months?

191
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,235
How did you know?

192
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,906
Because after six
months, poop love fades

193
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,415
and if you'd been together
shorter than that, then...

194
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,677
I'll explain right
after this break.

195
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:10,222
Three 10-milligram pills of
your finest amphetamines.

196
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,229
Arteriogram was normal.

197
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,291
Which means her lungs are fine.

198
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,529
What if the clear
arteriogram is significant?

199
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,269
It is significant. It means
there's no infection.

200
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,674
I think there's an infection.

201
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,087
Infections don't come and go.

202
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,989
People don't get better then
worse on the same treatment.

203
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,743
Unless her body
can't finish off the fight.

204
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,750
Maybe goes a couple
of rounds, then gives up.

205
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,876
Why would it give up?

206
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,886
Maybe its name is Foreman.

207
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,320
Come on. Where's that smile?

208
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,290
That laugh that makes
the whole world sunny

209
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,918
without contributing
to global warming?

210
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,727
Maybe she's missing a protein.

211
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,959
Blood panel and enzymes
show her proteins are normal.

212
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,477
You can't have tested
for every protein.

213
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,061
I can think of at least
one you can't test for at all.

214
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:55,700
Complement factor-H deficiency.
If she has that, she's dead.

215
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,107
No way to fend off bacteria.

216
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,113
She'll get one infection after
another until her body shuts down.

217
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,947
Maybe we can get ahead of the game.
Manage each symptom as it comes up.

218
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,750
Give her five miserable years
instead of six miserable months.

219
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,155
There's no diagnostic test for
complement factor-H deficiency.

220
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,559
So we isolate the cells
that are yummiest for it.

221
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,759
Stick a needle in her eye.

222
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,700
You're cheating on Honey.

223
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,898
What? No. I'm not.

224
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,138
Oh, yes, you are.

225
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,574
It's okay. I get it.

226
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,384
Well, I was going to say relax.

227
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,579
But, oddly enough, you
seem pretty relaxed already.

228
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,645
You're accomplished.
You're funny.

229
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,400
You can have whatever you
want. Women are gonna...

230
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,655
He's not cheating
with another woman.

231
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,093
He's cheating with
another food group.

232
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,289
What?

233
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:53,094
His floaters float
because they're full of fat.

234
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,034
Probably had a big
cheeseburger for lunch.

235
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,263
You're eating flesh?

236
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,515
It's just a hamburger.
Not all the time...

237
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,167
You're disgusting.

238
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,200
Soy cakes taste like
cardboard. Unsalted cardboard.

239
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,373
I'm accomplished. I'm funny.

240
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,683
Can I have whatever I want?

241
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,388
Can we wait a second?

242
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,160
What's wrong? I feel good.

243
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,742
Do you really need
to put that needle in?

244
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,326
You felt good yesterday, and
then you almost suffocated.

245
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,928
And you know that,
that thing is in my eye?

246
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,529
We think it could be.

247
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,235
If we find it, the hope
is that we can treat it.

248
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,938
You hope? Mom. Don't
hang on every word.

249
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,004
He said he hopes. That
means he doesn't know.

250
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,212
I just want to understand
what's going on.

251
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,809
We won't know anything
until we do the test.

252
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:51,315
Addie, this all looks really scary,
but you'll feel nothing. Okay?

253
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,552
Okay.

254
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,867
You rang? You called me.

255
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,140
I bought you an espresso.

256
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,957
You've been buying me
coffee for a couple of weeks.

257
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,280
I thought I'd pay
you back with one.

258
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:57,113
How did you walk with the
cane and the two coffees?

259
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,718
Why are you suspicious?

260
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,538
Because it's either that, or accept the
fact that you've done something nice.

261
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:06,192
And then I have to deal with the horsemen
and the rain of fire and the end of days.

262
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,824
You think I spat in yours?

263
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,368
Or worse.

264
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,867
I stacked them.

265
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:38,458
What do you think of me hiring a
nutritionist instead of a neurologist?

266
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,124
I mean, they sound
almost the same.

267
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,225
I take it you've met
a hot nutritionist.

268
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,667
Don't cheapen this.

269
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,503
We had an in-depth conversation
about proteins and fats.

270
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,144
I was about to examine
her boyfriend's rectum.

271
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,840
You asked for a date while
your finger was in her boyfriend?

272
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,109
I got her number.

273
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,208
No. No. No way.

274
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,350
This is an employment
application.

275
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,414
She doesn't want to go out
with you. She's looking for a job.

276
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,551
Oh, God. She's 26.

277
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,788
But with the wisdom of
a much younger woman.

278
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,401
Have you spoken to Foreman?

279
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,404
Several times. We laughed...

280
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:19,666
You're going to lose him.

281
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,207
And that will be depressing.

282
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:25,644
But it will only make me appreciate
all the good things that I do have.

283
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,019
Macular biopsy was negative.
Which means you're wrong.

284
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,145
There's no complement
factor-H deficiency.

285
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,851
Most likely cause of altering blood
flow in the brain is a clot or a tumor.

286
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,370
We can rule out a clotting issue
because she has a bleeding issue.

287
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,138
Which means we should
be looking for a tumor.

288
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,358
I think there's an infection.

289
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,594
Just 'cause the cells in her eye aren't
dead yet doesn't mean they're working.

290
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,898
So, why did we do the test?

291
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,804
Because if it had been positive,
it would have proved I was right.

292
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:56,468
But negative doesn't
prove you wrong?

293
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,309
That's the beauty of the test.

294
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,471
She needs an MRI of her brain.

295
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,639
Absolutely.

296
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,385
As long as you're scanning, you
mind having a boo for an abscess

297
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,716
for something caused
by an infection?

298
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,690
I didn't expect House
to beg me to stay.

299
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,134
But it seems like he's in
a better mood since I quit.

300
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,100
Nothing in the axial view.

301
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,806
You haven't asked
me why I'm leaving.

302
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,004
I figured you'd tell me
when you wanted to.

303
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,845
I don't want to be like him.

304
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,476
You're not a jerk.

305
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,678
Thank you.

306
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,755
I mean, sometimes you are.

307
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,526
But I don't think we
can pin that on House.

308
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,870
And you're a better doctor than
when you came through the door.

309
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,090
I'm better at some
things. Worse at others.

310
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,065
Again, not House's
fault. It's a job.

311
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,731
We're supposed to take
the good and leave the bad.

312
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,634
It's easier for you.

313
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,632
Why? Because you think
I need to toughen up?

314
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,404
You think I'm weak?

315
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:06,673
Yeah.

316
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,610
See? I am a jerk. I've
got to get out of here.

317
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,083
What's wrong, Addie?

318
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,419
My head hurts!

319
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,687
Her brain's clean. No
tumor and no abscess.

320
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,623
We're all wrong. My head!

321
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,168
My head!

322
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,668
My head!

323
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,147
Grody.

324
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,119
Looks like massive tissue death.

325
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,715
Who cares? Her head blew up.

326
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,520
- How cool is that?
- It's not pussy.

327
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,926
Meaning you don't think it's an infection
and you'd be right, if you weren't wrong.

328
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,089
Here we go again.

329
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,723
She's got infections
that come and go.

330
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,030
Which means... It means
it has to be something else.

331
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,036
Good guess. But no.

332
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,038
It either she's got a
leprechaun in her colon,

333
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,938
which is playing
with the doggie door,

334
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:13,275
letting bacteria in and out, or she's
got complement factor-H deficiency.

335
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,438
You enjoying this?

336
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:15,845
I'm saving a woman's life.

337
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,352
I'm saving a woman's life!
Actually, I'm diagnosing her.

338
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,897
Technically, I'm diagnosing her
with something that's going to kill her.

339
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,550
But, other than that,
I'm saving her life.

340
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,819
An autoimmune problem
makes more sense.

341
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,760
You can't explain a
transudative pleural effusion

342
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,320
with giant cell arteritis.

343
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,196
You'd need three whiteboards
and 100 different colored markers.

344
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:37,794
No, it's much more likely
she has an invisible protein

345
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,395
that allowed bacteria to
arbitrarily invade her lungs

346
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:44,171
then arbitrarily invade her pleura,
then arbitrarily jump into her head.

347
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,109
If it's autoimmune,
she can live.

348
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,273
But we have to give her steroids,
now. Before her heart ruptures.

349
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:53,513
If you're wrong, and you give
her steroids she dies, now.

350
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,951
Foreman. Want to run down how it feels
to go with your gut and kill a person?

351
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,255
You can get into the whole
spiraling out of control,

352
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,388
and the self-doubt,
and the resigning thing.

353
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,765
Do it.

354
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,136
Worst that can
happen is you quit.

355
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,704
Cameron, want to
explain to the parents

356
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,244
why you'll be holding
paddles while he's doing it?

357
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,610
Because if her heart goes
"boom", it will "boom" right away.

358
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,117
She really has to
be awake for this?

359
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,585
If there's a problem, she
could tell us what she feels.

360
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,661
Relax.

361
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,926
We're scared.

362
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,897
I don't want you to be scared.

363
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,995
Then, get better. Okay, sweetie?

364
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,501
We love you.

365
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,043
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:57,680
Ready?

367
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,881
Ready.

368
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,111
My patient's about to have a
heart attack. It's going to be massive.

369
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,208
Oh, wow. That's too bad.

370
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,153
Because I just got tickets
to a stroke on the third floor.

371
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,748
Have you had a
conversation with Foreman?

372
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:40,949
Do me a favor?

373
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,221
You haven't.

374
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,728
Because then you would have
to confront your own emotions.

375
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:48,359
Is bile an emotion? Because I
definitely feel something here.

376
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,932
Get me some liquorice. This is going
to be the best heart attack of all time.

377
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,269
Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
She's going to shock her.

378
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,230
There's always tomorrow.

379
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,101
You wanted to see me?

380
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,116
Pretty sure the
label is straight.

381
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,996
Are you really going to
leave? Where are you going?

382
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,660
You lined up interviews
yet? I'm not sure.

383
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:46,648
You're pissed at House. I get it.
You're symbolicating killing him.

384
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,557
Symbolicating.
What? Symbolicalating.

385
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,527
Gosh, that's a hard
word. Are you okay?

386
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,227
Hey, I'm not the
one... I'm not the one...

387
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,236
I'm not the one
pretending to kill someone.

388
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:00,102
What would it take for you to stay?
Is it money? He wants you to stay.

389
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,640
He said that? If I
said he said that,

390
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,451
would that make a difference?

391
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,876
Are you sure you're okay? Hello?

392
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,537
I'm leaving now.

393
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:12,844
I'm late for a breast thing.
You know he wants you.

394
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,080
You know he's good. You
know he can make you good.

395
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,966
I don't know what I'm saying. You know...
I don't... You know what I'm saying.

396
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,357
And you know I'm
right. I've got to go.

397
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,071
Sorry it took me so long to
get down here. I'm Dr. Wilson.

398
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,572
I guess Dr. Stein is
gone. Don't worry about it.

399
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,462
I'll talk to him
when we're done.

400
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,865
Dr. Stein said they're
probably calcium deposits.

401
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,336
But with your medical history,
you don't want to take chances.

402
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,542
I can't seem to put my
gloves on today. That's weird.

403
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:42,537
Okay. Well, that's fine. One's
enough. Well, let's have a look.

404
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,610
You sure talk fast.

405
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,814
This is nothing. You should
see me when we're busy.

406
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,101
I just winked at you. I just... I've
never winked at a patient in my life.

407
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,537
I have no... I am so sorry. I
have no idea what I was thinking.

408
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,530
It's okay. No, it's not.
I was hitting on you.

409
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,141
I mean, I wasn't... I wasn't
consciously hitting on you, but I...

410
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,277
What else could you think?
That you were being reassuring?

411
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,328
Yeah. That would make
sense. On the other hand, I...

412
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,435
I feel like my heart's
going to explode.

413
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,838
Are you okay?

414
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,432
I feel a little sweaty.
Am I sweating?

415
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,568
Yeah.

416
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,237
Is something wrong? I can't...

417
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,178
I put on gloves to do a
breast exam. Perfect. Sorry.

418
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,123
It's 185.

419
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,959
One eighty-five.

420
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,389
One eighty-five?

421
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,629
Excuse me. I have
to go kill someone.

422
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,035
You dosed me!

423
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,473
Yes, I did. But only
because you didn't trust me.

424
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,566
Your best friend!

425
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,872
You could have killed me!

426
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,503
Amphetamines
aren't going to kill you.

427
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,138
You don't know
my medical history!

428
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,376
I could have... I could have...

429
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,395
You could have given
me a heart attack!

430
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,947
A heart attack is not going to
kill you. You were in a hospital.

431
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,580
You yawned!

432
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:00,686
You tried to kill me!

433
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,524
I put you on uppers
and you still yawned.

434
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,723
Means it's a symptom
of being a big, fat liar.

435
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,427
Yawning is a side effect
of some anti-depressants.

436
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,901
Apparently, the ones you're on.

437
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,905
I'm not on anti-depressants,
I'm on speed.

438
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,141
That means it's a symptom
of a cerebral tumor.

439
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,938
You got six weeks to live.

440
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,872
Mr. Well-adjusted is as
messed up as the rest of us.

441
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,391
Why... Why would
you keep that a secret?

442
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,146
Are you ashamed of recognizing
how pathetic your life is?

443
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,915
It's not a secret.
House, it's... It's...

444
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,617
It's personal.

445
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,750
How long has it been
personal? It's personal.

446
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,352
Yawning is recent. So,
either you just started,

447
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,373
or you changed prescriptions.
This is why I take them.

448
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,299
They're anti-depressants,
not anti-annoyance-ants.

449
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,411
You'd think this would naturally
come up in conversation.

450
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,597
Oh, don't act hurt.
You don't care.

451
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:48,016
On one of the occasions when
you were pompously lecturing me

452
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,184
on what to do to fix my life.

453
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,473
You wouldn't take them.
You'd rather OD on Vicodin

454
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,843
or stick electrodes in your head, because
you could say you did it to get high.

455
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:58,179
The only reason to take anti-depressants
is because you're depressed.

456
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,549
You... You have to admit
that you're depressed.

457
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,882
Give me.

458
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:03,917
Are you going to admit that...

459
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,788
No, I'm gonna prove
that I'm not depressed.

460
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,864
Well, I can't give you my prescription.
You've got to meet with a psychiatrist.

461
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,265
You... You need a whole work-up.

462
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,403
Give me a Vicodin
so I don't stroke.

463
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,908
I wouldn't drink that.

464
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,685
My leg hurt, and I...

465
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:23,198
House, why didn't
you pick up the phone?

466
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,061
We've been calling.
I was sleeping.

467
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,008
What did you do?

468
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,378
Nothing.

469
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,975
This is how regular people
look when you wake them up.

470
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,752
Chase was wrong.
Addie's kidneys shut down.

471
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:59,037
Hemolytic uremic syndrome
shut down Addie's kidneys.

472
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:02,074
Peripheral smear of red
cells had schistocytes.

473
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:08,172
HUS is usually caused by an
infection or protein deficiency.

474
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,875
What a coincidence.

475
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:13,214
I know a patient with an
infection and a protein deficiency.

476
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,617
Do you think it's possible
there's a connection?

477
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,987
I want to hear you say it,
Chase. It will please me.

478
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,291
Doesn't mean you're right.
You predicted cardiac arrest,

479
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,022
instant cardiac arrest.

480
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,825
There were only two choices.

481
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,092
Since yours was wrong,
mine must have been right.

482
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,710
Either that, or we
missed the leprechaun.

483
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,245
If you're right, there's
nothing to be done.

484
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,033
The steroid treatment
we gave her means

485
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:36,007
when the next infection hits, it will
hit hard. Liver failure, cardiac arrest.

486
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,238
On the bright side it
confirms my diagnosis.

487
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:46,512
Don't you see how incredible
this call was? A protein deficiency.

488
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,349
It can't be tested.
Can't be seen.

489
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,514
I called it based
on coughing blood.

490
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,648
You're happy about this.

491
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,022
She's going to die.

492
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,526
That's not my fault.

493
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,495
She was going to die, anyway.

494
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,827
And now, thanks to me,
at least she'll know why.

495
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:03,300
I'm sure you'll see that gratitude
in her eyes when you tell her.

496
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,392
I'm not telling her.

497
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,528
I'm not telling her.

498
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:08,233
No one's telling her. Not
until we're sure I'm right.

499
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,596
But we're waiting for
her to stroke or have

500
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,041
a heart attack to confirm
before we tell her?

501
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,342
Seems like the humane approach.

502
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,688
Her heart went into V-fib.
Brought her back, barely.

503
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:06,731
Congratulations, you
have your confirmation.

504
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,303
What's her name?

505
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,105
Who? The co-ed? Sure.

506
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,015
Dead sophomore girl?

507
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,182
You know her father's name?

508
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,723
Dad. Her mother's name is Mommy.

509
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,693
Ben and Jody are about to
lose their only daughter, Addie.

510
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,458
You think that they're gonna
give a crap if I know their names?

511
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,090
Five years from now, when the
father's looking at photographs

512
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,260
of his daughter graduating
from high school,

513
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,213
they're not going to
remember the nice black doctor

514
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,433
who called them
by their first name.

515
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,239
You don't wanna quit.

516
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,448
You saying you
don't want me to quit?

517
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,279
Didn't sound like I said that.

518
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:03,413
I'm saying that suddenly you're trying
to turn me into a kinder, gentler ass.

519
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,821
Because you know who you are.

520
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,391
And you figure if you can make me decent
and caring, then maybe there's hope for...

521
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:13,831
You're about to tell a girl she's
dying and you think it's about you.

522
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,360
God, I hope I'm not you.

523
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,555
I'm sorry.

524
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,758
Addie, you're dying.

525
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,558
Are you sure?

526
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,328
Yes.

527
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,767
Your infections will get worse.
The toxins will spill into your blood.

528
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,300
How long?

529
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,709
Two days, maybe less.

530
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,112
You have a condition called...

531
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,115
Does it matter?

532
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:08,816
It's a very rare protein
deficiency that only manifests...

533
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,583
I don't want to hear it.

534
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,189
Okay.

535
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,547
It's what's killing you.
This is what's killing you.

536
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,643
You're not interested
in what's killing you?

537
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:44,087
Will it make any difference?
Will I live any longer?

538
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,953
Please, could you just leave?

539
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,483
What's the point in living without
curiosity? Without craving the...

540
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:53,862
So, I'm screwing up my last few
hours because I won't listen to you?

541
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,427
Get out of here.

542
00:33:56,501 --> 00:34:00,233
It's... It's like the dark
matter in the universe.

543
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,333
You're smiling.

544
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:04,633
No, I'm not.

545
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:09,178
You can only diagnose a
problem by looking at what's...

546
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,118
Missing.

547
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,553
Oh, God.

548
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,959
I have to go.

549
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:30,361
Nineteen-year-old didn't want
to hear the coolest explanation

550
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,633
of why she's going to
die, begged me to shut up.

551
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,937
If you can't shut up,
at least talk quietly.

552
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:41,302
Amphetamine withdrawal's a
bitch. She thought that I was happy.

553
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,819
You were happy? No, I was hazy.

554
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:52,046
And I don't get hazy on Vicodin,
or anything else I throw down.

555
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,601
Which means I was
throwing down something

556
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,220
I didn't know I was throwing
down. Which got me to wondering...

557
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,286
Why didn't you give
me those happy pills?

558
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,007
I told you. You've got
to be checked out by...

559
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,523
No, you just didn't
want me double-dosing.

560
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,267
You dosed me!

561
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,736
Those coffees... They worked!

562
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,538
You've been smiling,
relaxed, happy.

563
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,875
A dying girl
thought I was happy.

564
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,241
A moron thought I was happy.

565
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,959
Who the hell doesn't want
to know why she's dying?

566
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,111
House was happy. Hazy.

567
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,209
Happy. Hazy!

568
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,552
Oh, right. A dying girl
mistook hazy for happy.

569
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,683
Because dying people
see happiness everywhere.

570
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,590
She's miserable.
She wasn't miserable.

571
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,504
Of course she was
miserable. You just told her...

572
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,997
She was no different
than she'd ever been.

573
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,227
She was no different
than she'd ever been.

574
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,505
Oh, God.

575
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,908
I gotta go.

576
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,385
Need a minute
with your daughter.

577
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,115
Dr. House, get
out of here before...

578
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,952
She's gonna live.

579
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:02,227
Does that help? Now, get out.

580
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,404
Are you jerking us around...

581
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,021
Get out.

582
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,434
You have got leprechauns in you.

583
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:23,741
Depression manifests
in lots of different ways.

584
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,947
Some people can't
get out of bed all day,

585
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,819
others have serial relationships
and become oncologists.

586
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,382
I'm dying, I'm not depressed.

587
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,324
Wrong. And wrong.

588
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:39,629
You tried to kill yourself by
throwing down kitchen cleanser.

589
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:45,528
Now, most normal suicidal morons
would have just drank the stuff.

590
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,930
Burned the hell out of
their mouth and throat.

591
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,998
<i>Painful, but not deadly.</i>

592
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:53,136
<i>But being a college-educated
suicidal moron,</i>

593
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,238
<i>you wrapped it in
gel caps or gum.</i>

594
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,944
Which left no trace, but it
burned a hole in your intestine.

595
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:04,216
But the body can repair
almost anything, which is cool.

596
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,382
In your case, scar
tissue closed up the hole.

597
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:11,055
<i>But it also formed a bridge
between a vein and an artery.</i>

598
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:15,164
Now, veins are supposed to help
the intestine flush bacteria away.

599
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,863
<i>But the bridge allowed the
bacteria entrance to the artery.</i>

600
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:22,203
Where they got a
free ride everywhere.

601
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,972
Can you fix me?

602
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,616
Surgery to fix the bridge'll
take about two hours.

603
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,622
The psychotherapy's
going to take a little longer.

604
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,790
Why'd you do it?

605
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,758
I don't know.

606
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,939
I've just

607
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:57,938
never been happy.

608
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,211
Please don't tell my parents.

609
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,450
They'll blame themselves
and it's not their fault.

610
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,420
Please, you can't tell them.

611
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:19,092
Technically, all you have to do is
promise me that you won't do it again.

612
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,967
Then, legally, I
can't tell them.

613
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,808
I promise.

614
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,811
Yeah, sure.

615
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:10,676
We can't thank you...

616
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,217
Your daughter
tried to kill herself.

617
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,454
That's why she's here.

618
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,185
Legally, I'm supposed to
keep that between me and her.

619
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:23,626
Which makes sense,
she's obviously an adult,

620
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,563
capable of her own
well-reasoned decisions.

621
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,901
You're sure?

622
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,635
If she doesn't die in
the next couple of hours,

623
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,731
yeah, I'm right.

624
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,133
How could she hide this?

625
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,278
Everyone has secrets.

626
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:49,221
We'll take care of
her. Figure it out.

627
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,253
Make her happy?

628
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,986
We'll get her into therapy.

629
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,760
Might want to try
some meds, too.

630
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,199
Can we call you?

631
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,306
If we have any questions?

632
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:12,503
No.

633
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,317
What's up? Nothing.

634
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:27,152
You wanted to see me? Yeah.

635
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,422
House's patient? Yeah.

636
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,125
The one that would
have died, if not for him.

637
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,228
Subtle. Thanks.

638
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,673
You're really scared
you'll turn into him.

639
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,286
Don't tell me I'm
better than him.

640
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,087
Don't tell me, take the
good and leave the bad.

641
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,704
Cameron already tried.

642
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:53,314
I'm telling you there are
worse things to turn into.

643
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,985
It's not worth it.

644
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,541
I didn't think you
were going to show.

645
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:28,017
Sorry, surgery
went a little late.

646
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:32,288
So, you really think I have all
the necessary qualifications?

647
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:37,720
I can't discuss this with a dry
mouth. What do you got there?

648
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,460
Peppermint tea.

649
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,563
I'm going to have a mug
of peppermint tea, please.

650
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,306
This isn't a job
interview, is it?

651
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,703
It's some kind of interview.

652
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,380
You're judging
me. I'm judging you.

653
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,972
You have the upper hand.

654
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,983
I don't know anything about you.

655
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,051
I'm on antidepressants

656
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,252
because a doctor friend of
mine thinks I'm miserable.

657
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:13,060
I don't like them, they make
me hazy. I eat meat, I like drugs.

658
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:17,098
And I'm not always
faithful to the women I date.

659
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,003
You don't seem depressed.

660
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:25,008
You do realize you just skipped
over several deep character flaws

661
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:27,739
that most women would
run screaming from.

662
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:29,405
You told the truth.

663
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,609
Yeah, I don't always
do that, either.

664
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:35,863
Well, how miserable can you be,

665
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,584
saving lives, sleeping
around, and doing drugs?

666
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,689
Were you on the debating
team in high school?

667
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,796
Also, I hate

668
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,530
tea.
