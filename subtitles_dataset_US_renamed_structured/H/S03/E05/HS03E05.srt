1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,335
Here you go.

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,837
That fried crap
will kill you. See?

3
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,081
Good night.

4
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,320
Time to make the donuts.

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,624
Hands in the air!
Right now! Get them up!

6
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,992
Move out here. Get up!
Move out here! Let's go!

7
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,427
Move it. Put them up!

8
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,431
Purses and wallets on
the counter, right now.

9
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,662
Yo! Your watches, your
jewelry! Take it all off!

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,706
Yeah, all right. Keep
the girl. Keep the girl.

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,797
Yeah.

12
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,835
We're moving to the
back room. Let's go!

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,936
Go! Let's go! Move it!

14
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,106
Go on! Not you.

15
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,544
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.

16
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,810
She's staying right here.

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,146
You're not going to do this.

18
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,743
Whoa, whoa, kid.

19
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,122
No, Jeremy. Please, just
do what they say. Please!

20
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,286
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Move!

21
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,167
Son of a bitch!

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,335
You thought I was going
to let you hurt my wife?

23
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:19,242
Hey! Hey, sir. Your wife!

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,675
What did he do to her?

25
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,148
Nothing.

26
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,389
Tracy!

27
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,706
Twenty-year-old married
African-American female.

28
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,858
Couldn't breathe.
Anaphylaxis-like throat swelling.

29
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,710
Children? You think
pregnancy would explain...

30
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,895
Explains the marriage.

31
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,402
Who the hell gets married at 20?

32
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,938
I'm guessing, people in love?

33
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,099
Show me a 20-year-old
who's not in love.

34
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,319
You get married at 20, you're going to
be shocked at who you're living with at 30.

35
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,355
It's not allergies.
Negative on the skin test.

36
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,405
Four days of
antihistamines and steroids.

37
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,915
Who's he talking to? What?

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,180
It's got an ass. Technically,
that makes it a "who."

39
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,780
New nurse in peds.
Wendy something.

40
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,381
Swelling just
started to go down...

41
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,857
You seen her here before?

42
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,158
A couple times. I tried following
her home, but she gave me the slip.

43
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,088
Swelling's...

44
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,233
You think that's funny?

45
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,365
Ask him about the time
he sabotaged my cane.

46
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,076
Are you serious?

47
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,074
There was a point to
it. Wendy, this is House.

48
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:04,414
Something about not getting too
uppity with normal folks who walk good.

49
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:09,214
You're everything I'd
heard. Nice to meet you.

50
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,194
Why so rude?

51
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,754
You've sprinted through
three bad marriages

52
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,199
into an affair with a dying
patient. Now a naughty nurse?

53
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,029
How many more failed relationships
are we both gonna have to deal with

54
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,596
before you learn
to love yourself?

55
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:26,983
And I mean that
in the literal way.

56
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,499
It's amazing how you can
not only know it's a relationship,

57
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:34,537
but that it's a bad relationship,
based on nothing but nothing.

58
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,912
I know you.

59
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,974
I'm not with her,
not even trying.

60
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,417
You're lying to me.
That's interesting.

61
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,958
Well, as long
as it's interesting.

62
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,989
Swelling is... Why is
she hanging out here?

63
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,942
Anyone interested in what
happened with the swelling?

64
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,764
She's in peds. That's
the next wing over.

65
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,946
If you're wondering if
Wilson's dating her, ask Wilson.

66
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,031
Clearly he did, and Wilson denied
it. And House doesn't believe it.

67
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,236
That's gotta hurt. That's why it pays
to have more than one friend, House.

68
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,279
If he's not hitting
that, why is she here?

69
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,474
Because I'm hitting
that and it's totally hot.

70
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,541
Swelling took four
days to resolve.

71
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,677
Patient has unexplained
intense abdominal pains.

72
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,415
So explain them.

73
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,684
Wake me when they've done
an exploratory laparotomy.

74
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,350
Anybody know
her? Know her story?

75
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,859
Up and at 'em.

76
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,451
They did a laparotomy.

77
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,259
Liver, bowel, gall bladder,
appendix, all clean.

78
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,197
Belly pain plus throat swelling.

79
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,862
She was in some sort of
assault, right? Simple neck trauma.

80
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,615
It says no one touched her neck,
and if they did, it would resolve by now.

81
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,584
Didn't need to touch her.
Some guy coughed on her, right?

82
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,509
He's in jail and he's
completely healthy,

83
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,740
except for the broken head
he got from the beating he took.

84
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,975
There's pot on her tox screen.

85
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,745
Salmonella from the pot would
explain the stomach pains.

86
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,582
It's a stretch.
She'd have a fever.

87
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,350
She's on steroids for the
swelling, therefore no fever.

88
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,890
And the smoking
explains the throat.

89
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,789
Sorry, take it back.
That's a stretch.

90
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,657
Got a better idea?

91
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,525
Then stretch away.

92
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,692
Start her on fluoroquinolone
for the salmonella.

93
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,072
I was waiting two
hours out there.

94
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,511
Fascinating.

95
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,550
Have you considered a
career as a memoirist?

96
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,050
Let's see it.

97
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,278
You don't introduce yourself?

98
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,932
Sorry, I thought you
were waiting two hours.

99
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,481
Didn't know you wanted to chat.

100
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,460
Hi, I'm Greg. How about
that local sports team?

101
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,627
It's not an infection.

102
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,776
How can you tell without...

103
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,029
You want me to touch you?

104
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,967
It's your private place.

105
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:41,304
You're chewing nicotine gum, which causes
dehydration, which causes wear and tear.

106
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,344
Try a lubricant, or
foreplay if you're cheap.

107
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,775
Just take a swab and
get it tested, okay?

108
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:51,512
Sorry, I already met this month's
quota of useless tests for stubborn idiots.

109
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,412
You're rude.

110
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,092
Wow. You're like a
detective or something.

111
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,062
And you're smart
and you're funny.

112
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,692
But you are bitter
and you're lonely,

113
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,496
so you treat everyone
around like they're idiots,

114
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,703
and you get away with
it 'cause of your cane.

115
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,479
Please stop. It's hard to write
through the haze of bitter tears.

116
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,812
But you're not actually
getting away with it.

117
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:27,753
Last nurse you made fun of, she probably
slipped some crap into your coffee.

118
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:31,258
Yeah, I asked for
decrapinated coffee.

119
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,295
Treat people like jerks,
you get treated like a jerk.

120
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,688
Thank you.

121
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,690
Bend over.

122
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,459
You kidding me? If you have
an infection, you'd have a fever.

123
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,057
But you're chewing nicotine gum,

124
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,778
which messes with the
weather in your mouth,

125
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,203
so I need to vacation elsewhere.

126
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,346
And wait till I put
the thermometer in.

127
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,518
You break it, you bought it.

128
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,228
Leaving early today.

129
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,297
Do you ever get that thing where
you're sure you forgot something,

130
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,635
but you can't figure out what?

131
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,907
Guess it can't
be that important.

132
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:00,343
Salmonella is a bacterial infection
that you can get from pot plants.

133
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,437
It causes stomach pain.

134
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,675
And my throat?

135
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,651
The thinking is it's an inflammatory
reaction to the smoking.

136
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,431
How much would you need to smoke
for your throat to go nuts like that?

137
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,684
Most cases, a lot.

138
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,224
We don't smoke a lot.

139
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,864
Let's just start the treatment.

140
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,861
You think we're liars,
as well as druggies?

141
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,473
Actually, I'm wondering if you'd
mind getting her a cup of ice chips.

142
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,308
You're not gonna get any
different answer from her.

143
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,699
No, no. He can stay.

144
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,829
No offense, but this place is
scary. I feel better when he's around.

145
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,202
Tracy, I need to talk to you.

146
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,070
We don't do a lot of drugs.

147
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,633
I need to know your answers
aren't being pressured.

148
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,738
Look, if you think the antibiotics are
a good idea, you can give them to me.

149
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,774
Okay. Worst-case scenario,
it'll help us rule out a few things.

150
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,246
He's a good guy.

151
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,415
He just has a hard time
holding in his emotions.

152
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,254
You don't have to
apologize for me.

153
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,003
That mean you're going
to do it for yourself?

154
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,757
I got nothing to apologize for.

155
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,126
He's young.

156
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,759
Itchy.

157
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,594
Allergic reaction to
the fluoroquinolone.

158
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,230
We should switch to a
different antibiotic. Why?

159
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,105
We can't treat the salmonella
unless... Salmonella?

160
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,337
That was a total stretch.

161
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,346
Oh, man, why does
that sound so familiar?

162
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,024
You think it's 'cause
I said it an hour ago?

163
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,847
Then it was a dumb
thing to say. Now it's smart.

164
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,511
She's got the rash,
so we know she's

165
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,513
unusually susceptible
to allergic reactions,

166
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,850
so that's what brought her in.

167
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,602
Probably the peanut
butter in her sandwich.

168
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,968
Stick test was
negative for peanuts.

169
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,689
That's because you foolishly
tested her while she was lying down.

170
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,993
Exercise-based anaphylaxis?
I think that requires exercise.

171
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,709
When her throat closed,
they'd just got done eating.

172
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,962
Not even competitive eating.

173
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,436
And getting robbed. That
always gets my heart rate up.

174
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,982
Give her the same
food she ate at the diner

175
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,116
and stick her on the treadmill.

176
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,508
Better yet, put a gun to her
head, threaten to rape her.

177
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,255
You don't think I'm
going to get a response?

178
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,679
No.

179
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,340
You're on. Fifty bucks.

180
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,695
I'm not betting
on a patient's...

181
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,549
A hundred bucks. If you say so.

182
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,863
<i>Tracy, I'm increasing
the speed a little.</i>

183
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,297
My stomach really hurts.

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,993
Jeremy, you out
there? Talk to... Talk...

185
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,437
You're doing great.
Isn't this enough?

186
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,498
We're not getting any
allergic response yet.

187
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,873
Shut it off.

188
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,986
We don't complete the test,

189
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,721
my boss will just come
down here and do it himself.

190
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,043
You do not want that.

191
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,707
She's in pain. Look at her.

192
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,478
I don't want to have
to ask you to leave.

193
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,895
You're gonna ask me to leave?
Are you kidding me? This is my wife!

194
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,164
You guys aren't helping her.
You're just hurting her. What?

195
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,834
You guys have all this equipment
here, and you're not doing anything!

196
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,850
You guys can't even
figure out what's...

197
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,455
God, it hurts.

198
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,431
Where? In my
stomach. And my chest.

199
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,230
Oh, God! It's Foreman.
Get me a wheelchair.

200
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,171
He's as sick as she is now.

201
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,439
I told you it wouldn't work.

202
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,037
It worked on the wrong patient.

203
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,708
We could spend all day
arguing right or wrong.

204
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,806
Give me the 100 bucks.

205
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,318
We didn't bet.

206
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,980
We could spend all day
arguing whether we bet or not.

207
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,319
Give me the 100 bucks.

208
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,294
Come on, Foreman, pay up. He won.
Or we could just never finish the DDX.

209
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,829
Husband's test showed no MI, no
aortic dissection. It's not his heart.

210
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,303
It's just nonspecific
chest and abdominal pain.

211
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:15,775
So, psychosomatic? Panic attack?

212
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,271
Pain persisted after he got
lorazepam and morphine.

213
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,973
Whose locker is that?

214
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,208
Mine.

215
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,347
Chest, stomach, throat.

216
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,252
What does it all mean? We're
in the nurses' locker room.

217
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,755
I know that.

218
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,489
Oh, that is so annoying.

219
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,793
Wilson's girlfriend's left
her stuff in my locker again.

220
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,629
Great. I hadn't committed
any felonies yet today.

221
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,464
Relax. You know who
they're going to blame.

222
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,004
House, you want to mess
with Wilson, no problem.

223
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,549
But you got no reason
to screw around with...

224
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,804
Can we get back to the medicine?
- Okay.

225
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,538
Why assume one disease?
His chest, her throat.

226
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,843
So it's just a coincidence that they've
both got crippling stomach pains?

227
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,316
Wow, they really are a great
couple. So much in common.

228
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,849
One blue shoe. What
do you think that means?

229
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,823
It means you're insane.
Wilson's not dating her.

230
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:05,915
You feeling luckier?

231
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,483
It doesn't matter what I answer.

232
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,789
Two hundred it is.

233
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,662
If they're married and caught the
same disease, then it means they...

234
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,563
Brochure to a jazz festival
in the Poconos this weekend.

235
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,698
Wilson likes jazz.
Foreman, pay the man.

236
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:25,336
Four, five, six novels, no
music. What does that mean?

237
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,470
She's literate.

238
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,277
It means she spends her
leisure time reading, not listening.

239
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:32,786
She'd only want to go and watch
jazz if the other person wanted to go.

240
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,981
She has a martyr
complex, issues of inferiority.

241
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,580
Married couple, same disease.

242
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,217
They either got it from each
other or in the same place.

243
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,421
Infectious or environmental?

244
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:46,288
What we have to do is check out
parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi,

245
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:50,770
prions, radiation, toxins, chemicals.
Or it's Internet porn-related.

246
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,239
I'll check the Internet. You
guys cover the rest of the stuff.

247
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,404
If they can live here without killing
each other, they must really be in love.

248
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,745
It's tiny.

249
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,082
How come it's taking
you so long to search it?

250
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,016
Box of condoms in his jacket.

251
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,786
I know you're poor
now, but buy your own.

252
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,794
She's on the pill.

253
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,989
Why would he need condoms?

254
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,293
No, no, no. Put that back.

255
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,560
Why?

256
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,467
We show that to House, he'll
just call the guy a cheating bastard.

257
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,663
Look how he is with Wilson.

258
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,899
He'd be right. Could be an STD.

259
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,341
One that doesn't give them any
symptoms in their sexual organs?

260
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,073
They never mentioned anything.
Maybe they're embarrassed.

261
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,170
What else could it be?

262
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,217
You think they just like the sexy
feel of latex against their genitals?

263
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,583
Maybe the wife just
wants to be extra-cautious.

264
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,645
Come on. You really
believe that? Yeah.

265
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:46,420
Good. Then I'm sure you'll have
no problem convincing House.

266
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,997
That cheating bastard!

267
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,498
He loves her.

268
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,831
Right, I bet he told you
that she's the love of his life.

269
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,427
People lie. I get it.

270
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,996
But they don't go up against two armed
gunmen to save someone unless they...

271
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:06,638
There's a reason that we don't let
kids vote or drink or work in salt mines.

272
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,443
They're idiots.

273
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,812
Twenty-year-olds fall
in and out of love more

274
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:12,952
often than they
change their oil filters,

275
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,229
which they should do more often.

276
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,484
Sorry. Ridiculous of
me to draw a conclusion

277
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,422
based on actually
observing them.

278
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,290
I should have just depended on your
misanthropic view of human nature.

279
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,387
Gonorrhea explains
all their symptoms.

280
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,557
Fitzhugh-Curtis
syndrome for her belly pain,

281
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,567
costochondritis and bladder infection
for his chest and abdominal pain.

282
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,658
Good.

283
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:33,639
Now go rub their lying, cheating
privates with a cotton swab.

284
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,903
Why would you
want to look at our...

285
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,814
Is this because of the condoms?

286
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,445
You found them in his jacket, figured
he was hiding something from me.

287
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,251
I thought I was pregnant last
month. It kind of freaked me out.

288
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,690
I'm way too young to have kids.

289
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,887
So you just wanted
to be extra-cautious?

290
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:58,329
Wish one of us had figured
that out, stuck to his guns.

291
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,678
We've still gotta
check you both.

292
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,598
She's the only
girlfriend I've ever had.

293
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,245
She's the love of...
Please don't say it.

294
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,430
I can't say I love my wife?

295
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,704
We're still going to test you.

296
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,070
What is it? I'm white?

297
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,699
Yeah, that's it.

298
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,472
Jer, I wish you would stop
it. You're really embarrassing.

299
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,537
Everybody thinks they're so
liberal, but I see how they look at us.

300
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,345
White and black,
especially black.

301
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,415
I'm sorry, Trace, but it's true.

302
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,318
Great. Prove us all wrong.

303
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:25,481
Stupid...

304
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,687
No scarring, no purulent discharge,
and the NAATs were negative.

305
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,839
- They don't have an STD.
- What's that you say?

306
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,264
You've got a problem
with interracial couples?

307
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,664
Thank you, Chase. No!

308
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,566
Have any of your
shorties ever been whities?

309
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,697
I'm not sure I understand
your ghetto slang, Dr. House.

310
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,707
How many black women
have you dated, by the way?

311
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,905
I don't care about color, as long as
they can help me breed a superior race.

312
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,540
Yeah, my exes have
usually been black. So what?

313
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,710
It's not a racial thing. It's cultural.
I have more in common with them.

314
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,483
Like I assume you only date
emotionally stunted bigots.

315
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,818
Sorry, you're right. That
kind of prejudice is totally fine.

316
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,330
The abdominal pain's getting worse.
We've had to up their morphine twice.

317
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,637
Take the wife off the steroids.

318
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,443
She spikes a fever,
we'll know it's an infection.

319
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,993
She doesn't, it's environmental.

320
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,908
He got off easy. I almost
gave him a colonoscopy.

321
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,539
That was one of the stupidest
things you have ever done,

322
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,084
and there is heavy
competition for...

323
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,517
What are you doing?

324
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,714
You only ate half
your breakfast.

325
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,620
Feeling a little
sick this morning?

326
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,818
I'm not pregnant.
They burnt my omelet.

327
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,417
You need to
apologize to this guy.

328
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,019
I am a man of principle.

329
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,894
I don't care how much time and
money it costs you to defend me.

330
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,228
He wants to kill you.

331
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,701
No empty coffee cups. Off
the caffeine. Good for baby.

332
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,864
Cups are in the other
wastebasket. Baby's in your mind.

333
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,431
You can berate
patients all you want.

334
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,968
Shoving objects into
their rectums is assault.

335
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,809
Pay attention to me.

336
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,184
Sorry, that would make
it harder to ignore you.

337
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,380
Can't ignore that rapidly
expanding first-trimester ass, though.

338
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,117
Sometimes an ass is just an ass.

339
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:09,660
You are not always right,
House. Apologize to the guy.

340
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,637
What are you doing here?
Stay away from my son.

341
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,704
How did you find us?

342
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,744
Stay away from that girl.

343
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,117
Please! Please! Please!
You leave him alone!

344
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,354
What happened? She's
dreaming. She started yelling.

345
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,954
You're breaking Jeremy's arm.
Please! No one's hurting him.

346
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,297
Baby, it's me. It's
Jeremy. Tracy, Tracy.

347
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:54,206
She's okay. Baby, it was just a
bad dream. Everything's okay.

348
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,505
Tracy. Tracy?

349
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,513
It was an acute delirium.

350
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,525
Well, she's talking, right? I
mean, she's coming out of it.

351
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,562
No, she's not really
talking, just making sounds.

352
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,460
Okay. When's she gonna come out?

353
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,762
Jeremy, she's in a coma.

354
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,909
<i>So her vitals are pretty stable,</i>

355
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,811
but her response to
stimuli is getting weaker,

356
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,677
which means the
coma's getting worse.

357
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,217
Her brain is slowly
shutting down.

358
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,877
Can I see her?

359
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,354
We're getting some more images
to check for masses or infections.

360
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,385
I'll increase your morphine.

361
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,623
Her hallucination.

362
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,634
If you knew what it was,
would that make any difference?

363
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,960
Medically, I mean.

364
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,732
Not usually.

365
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,330
Some cases, the form of
a hallucination can tell us

366
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,138
what part of the
brain is being hit.

367
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,974
I think it was about my dad.

368
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,038
Your dad was breaking your arm?

369
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,951
He was a drunk,
pill-popping racist.

370
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,920
He caught me sneaking into
her house when we were 13.

371
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,857
She lived next door.

372
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,254
He broke my arm
and threatened her.

373
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,391
We ran off when we were 16.

374
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,297
You still in touch with him?

375
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,502
He killed himself
a couple years ago.

376
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:42,240
Oh, it's not medical. I just
thought blacks were the racist ones.

377
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,354
Some generalized
edema throughout,

378
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:55,122
and areas of increased signal
here, here, here and here.

379
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,459
Damn, all over her brain stem.

380
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,432
Could be plaques, maybe
hyperdensities from the edema.

381
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,195
Or tumors or anything.

382
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:05,864
We add brain involvement to the
chest, stomach, throat, what do we got?

383
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,983
Didn't spike a fever when
we took her off the steroids,

384
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,135
so it's not an infection.
Leaving environmental.

385
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,474
What flavor? Environmental
doesn't make sense, either.

386
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,385
If it was a toxin, we'd
see it in their livers.

387
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,245
None of the neighbors
are sick, no coworkers.

388
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,374
They both got it.

389
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,352
That means infection or environmental,
and since it's not an infection...

390
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,684
What if they didn't both get it?

391
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:25,782
Maybe we got our basic assumption
wrong and it's two different diseases.

392
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:29,317
Maybe we didn't
and it's sarcoidosis.

393
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,830
Sarcoidosis isn't
infectious or environmental.

394
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,765
Tell that to the clusters
of sarcoidosis cases.

395
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,895
Firefighters and residents
of pine tar forests?

396
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,202
I did see these two putting out
that blaze in the Pine Barrens.

397
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,970
If sarcoidosis has two
environmental causes,

398
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,841
it has environmental causes.

399
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,575
We just don't know all of
them yet. Husband's chest.

400
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,681
He has slightly enlarged
hilar lymph nodes.

401
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,855
Sarcoidosis explains
almost all of their symptoms,

402
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,914
including her getting
worse off the steroids.

403
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,653
Doesn't explain
his throat swelling.

404
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,092
That's what "almost" means.

405
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,596
90% of sarcoidosis
cases have lung scarring.

406
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,791
Oh, 90? Oh, "almost"?

407
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,827
Fine.

408
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,335
Consult a specialist.

409
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,442
If this is more dating advice...

410
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,488
Love to gossip,
but I got work to do.

411
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,820
Is this sarcoidosis?

412
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,557
It's pretty nonspecific.

413
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,861
It could be granulomas,
could be plaques. What's this?

414
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,925
Oh! Oh! You stole
Wendy's personnel file?

415
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,929
In a way, aren't we
all guilty of bribing the

416
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:49,772
janitor to take her
file and give it to me?

417
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,936
Yes, I take my share of
the blame, but society's...

418
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,707
First of all, I'm
not dating her.

419
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,248
She is so wrong for you.

420
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,343
You know she filed a form so the
hospital would take extra withholding?

421
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,650
Who does that? She's
much too cautious for me.

422
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,156
Point taken. I'll
start dating her

423
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:08,126
so I can break up with her
and start dating a stripper.

424
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:11,255
You're a miserable jerk
who can't stand to be alone.

425
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,323
I didn't try to break up your
marriages. You did that yourself.

426
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,700
My marriages were so crappy, I
was spending all my time with you.

427
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,069
Your real fear is me
having a good relationship.

428
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,267
Yes, it keeps me up at night.

429
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,209
That and the Loch Ness
monster, global warming, evolution

430
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,439
and other fictional concepts.

431
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:31,883
Although, big romantic weekend in
the Poconos could change everything.

432
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,485
You don't... No.

433
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,189
I don't think it's sarcoidosis.

434
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,923
He says it's sarcoidosis.

435
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,559
Start them both on methotrexate.

436
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:50,694
And if you're wrong?

437
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,366
If Wilson's wrong, we'll
biopsy her just to be sure.

438
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:56,807
Her brain stem?

439
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,277
Brain damage is not
only possible, it's likely.

440
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:03,373
Good point. Let's biopsy
something safer, like her shoes.

441
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,854
The husband. He'd have to
give consent. He can't right now.

442
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,891
Why? Does this guy
write with his stomach?

443
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,687
He has a conflict of interest.

444
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,638
It's not his brain we're cutting
open, but he still gets all the benefit.

445
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:17,960
He'd do it just to save himself.

446
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,464
Or save her.

447
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,971
She's the love of
his life, remember?

448
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,263
He never said that.

449
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,463
She needs a guardian ad
litem. I can't let you do this.

450
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,097
Well, how are you going
to stop me? Call Cuddy?

451
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,607
Cameron's right.
There's a conflict.

452
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,041
No, there isn't.

453
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,909
Not unless one of them wants
to die a horrible, painful death.

454
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,490
I'm sure the guardian
will figure that out.

455
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,210
In a couple days.

456
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,895
Will the guardian convince the
disease to hold off eating her brain

457
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,388
until we can get the
legalities worked out?

458
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,253
I just don't want some plaintiff's
lawyer owning my hospital.

459
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,156
Legalities help.

460
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,404
Speaking of which, did you
get your thermometer back yet?

461
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,830
We had a nice chat. Did
you know he's a Rotarian?

462
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,292
Listen, she'll die
without the biopsy.

463
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,865
I need to cover the hospital's
ass. You're too biased.

464
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,637
I send you in there,
you'll steamroll over him.

465
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,577
Something goes wrong, he'll
sue us for not disclosing the risks.

466
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,443
Then have Wilson
talk to the husband.

467
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,882
Wilson kills people left and
right. No one ever sues him.

468
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,515
Fine, but only if you
apologize to the clinic guy.

469
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,056
No. Probably better to
just let that couple die.

470
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,820
I don't care if you
mean it. Just do it.

471
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,099
Unfortunately, we don't
see any way around a biopsy.

472
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,692
We'll do all we can to
minimize any damage.

473
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:30,963
No.

474
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,767
The methotrexate isn't
showing any effects yet.

475
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,898
You could both be...

476
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,567
She's brilliant.

477
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,970
All A's in college
while working full-time.

478
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,737
I can't do that to her.

479
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:45,046
And if you both die, you
think she'd want that?

480
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,187
Do it on me instead.

481
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,621
It's not in your
brain. It will be.

482
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,489
It's the same disease,
right? Do it then.

483
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,887
She could die before
you show the symptoms.

484
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,795
Then stop treating me.

485
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,564
Great job. Why didn't you
just shoot him in the head?

486
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:06,815
Hold on. That gives me an idea.

487
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,439
You know what could save this
couple? Lots of misdirected sarcasm.

488
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,206
They're dead! Yelling at you might
prevent you from screwing up...

489
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,555
I didn't screw up. I did my job.

490
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,013
Your job was to
get me the biopsy.

491
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,992
No, it was to present the
patient with his options.

492
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,882
Two options,
biopsy or no biopsy.

493
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,580
He chose a third, no treatment.
How do you even do that?

494
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,253
Remember when you used to just
weave elaborate conspiracy theories

495
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,586
about my love life?

496
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,956
Those were such good times.

497
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,821
How much morphine
is the husband on?

498
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,357
We can't increase it any more.
His respirations are depressed.

499
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,371
Increase it? Drugs
cloud people's judgment.

500
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,598
Cold-turkey the sucker.

501
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,767
No.

502
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,777
Good point.

503
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,757
Did I ask you guys to follow me?

504
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,158
No, which made us nervous.

505
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,787
He'll catch on if he notices
he's off the morphine drip.

506
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,856
Shoot him up with one
of these puppies instead.

507
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,060
No!

508
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,612
You do understand
it's not really a puppy.

509
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:11,934
It's naloxone.

510
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:15,031
An opiate blocker? He'll feel
like he's swallowing a bonfire.

511
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,871
That's pretty
unethical, even for you.

512
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,934
How is that unethical?
It'll lead to a diagnosis.

513
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,422
It's leading to the
torture of the husband

514
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,791
on the off-chance he'll allow a
procedure on another person.

515
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,959
Which will lead to a
diagnosis. Didn't I just say that?

516
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:25,983
Give it up.

517
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,891
Foreman and Cameron are too ethical,
and I'm too scared of getting sued.

518
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,391
Fine. Now, I'm just going to
find someplace safe to hide this

519
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,983
so I won't be tempted to use it.

520
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,153
You're not doing it, either.

521
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,796
What, are you
going to run for it?

522
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:44,963
If they die now, they'll never be able
to grow old and tired of each other.

523
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,375
We can't baby-sit House all day.

524
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,973
Tell Cuddy to put a
nurse by his room.

525
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,416
Damn it!

526
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,953
Atropine? What happened to...

527
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:10,626
He knew we'd stop him. He
stuck both of them in his pocket.

528
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,459
That's actually pretty clever.

529
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,729
Guess I can't use
that trick again, huh?

530
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,135
My stomach!

531
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,943
It was a pretty smart plan,
Jerry, but I'm onto you.

532
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,572
There's only one good
reason to kill the biopsy.

533
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,743
You poisoned your wife, and you
don't want the coppers to get wise.

534
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:36,084
No! Oh, all right. Then
you're just a moron.

535
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,714
Biopsy me!

536
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,782
Only if this thing hits
your brain, you moron.

537
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,192
And I can't stress that
"moron" part enough.

538
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,423
You're killing your wife.

539
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,727
She is the love of my life.

540
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:50,330
Careful. When she's dead
and you're on wife number two,

541
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,031
you're gonna feel real
guilty about saying that.

542
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,939
Feel that? Get used to it.

543
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,285
Pain's going to get a lot worse.

544
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,572
No, it won't.

545
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,637
Morphine just isn't working
right now for some reason.

546
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:05,081
I'm putting you on a tranquilizer in
the meantime. It'll work again soon.

547
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,150
Want to bet?

548
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,551
I don't care about the pain.

549
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,782
I need to be in pain,
because I have to get worse.

550
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,882
It means you can
do the biopsy on me.

551
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:16,224
Dude, she's in a coma. Who
are you trying to impress?

552
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,255
I'd die for her.

553
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:24,497
Give up. Or are we going to wait for
him to get all grown up and cynical?

554
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,485
I was just going to call you.

555
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,240
I need a court order to
biopsy this woman's brain.

556
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,213
Speaking of litigation...

557
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:40,418
Michael Tritter,
you know Dr. House.

558
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,289
You guys can talk here.

559
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,825
I don't want to sue you.

560
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:50,954
Good.

561
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,362
I want to beat the
crap out of you.

562
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,867
Less good. And
I'll tell you why.

563
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,795
You're a bully,

564
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,599
and bullies, they
don't back down

565
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,804
until they run into someone
stronger and meaner.

566
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,272
But you'll accept an apology?

567
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,714
Yes.

568
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,149
Not really a
recipe for sincerity.

569
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,119
I'm not looking for sincerity.

570
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,088
I'm looking for humiliation,

571
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,336
something that will
make you think twice

572
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,786
before you treat the
next patient like crap.

573
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,756
Here's what's going to happen.

574
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,093
You go brag to your friends

575
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,929
about how you made the big,
nasty doctor poop in his pants.

576
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:32,494
I get Cuddy off my back by
telling her that I humiliated myself.

577
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:35,666
Here's the catch. We're
both going to be lying.

578
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,007
I'm not apologizing.

579
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,839
If anything, you deserved
a bigger thermometer.

580
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,919
What's wrong? Jeremy's worse.

581
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,653
And that's what's right.

582
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,594
Cut the stubborn jerk's
head open and take a slice.

583
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:58,858
It's not his brain.

584
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,559
Lactic acid's up to 39.
His intestines are rotting.

585
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,329
This isn't sarcoidosis.

586
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,428
Then he'll get his wish.

587
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:10,536
He's dying, just not in a way
that's going to help his wife.

588
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,242
Coma's worse. She's
losing response to stimuli.

589
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,580
He's vomiting blood
and his lactic acid's 45.

590
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,710
He's got to have
ischemic bowel. So what?

591
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:24,120
Well, let's see. Lack of blood
flow's causing his guts to die,

592
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,309
which will cause him to die,

593
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:28,036
unless we cut out a few feet of
small intestine and reattach the ends.

594
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,494
I don't know, seems
worth a mention.

595
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,393
Why does he have
it? What does it tell us?

596
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:32,624
Small-cell vasculitis?

597
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,257
Good. Now let's hear it again,

598
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,825
but this time with a more
environmental or infectious feeling.

599
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:40,498
Or, like I said before, it might
not be environmental or infectious.

600
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,473
He has vasculitis,
she has porphyria.

601
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,170
Belly pain plus hallucination,
classic symptoms.

602
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,371
It could even cause a coma.

603
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,075
Fine. Start her on
hematin for porphyria.

604
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,481
What about him?

605
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,884
Take out the dead
bowel. It's all we can do.

606
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,354
And biopsy it. If Foreman's
right, it might save him.

607
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,551
If Foreman's wrong, the dead
bowel might save both of them.

608
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:06,890
Bowel's not dead.

609
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:11,403
Unless he's been tossing down
frosty cans of lactic acid, bowel is dead.

610
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,230
What we're looking
for is a reason it's dead.

611
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,637
Bowel's not dead.

612
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:19,041
Just general swelling and edema.
High lactate was probably from stress.

613
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:22,479
We just sliced him open from
chest to pubic bone for nothing.

614
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,380
Nothing's something.

615
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,314
Forget the ischemia. Add
the edema and swelling.

616
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,823
Probably from cutting him open.

617
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,121
Probably, not definitely.

618
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,421
Okay, back to the beginning.

619
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,225
What did we talk about?
Anything. I want to hear it all again.

620
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,390
Allergies. Doesn't
fit at all now.

621
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,934
STDs. Maybe we
got the wrong one.

622
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,001
What about syphilis?

623
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,980
Neurological symptoms.
He wasn't cheating on her.

624
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:49,202
Yeah, love of his life. Don't
you have to wait till he's dead

625
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,634
before you make
that determination?

626
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,439
She's his only girlfriend ever.

627
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,811
They grew up next door,
ran off together as teenagers.

628
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,983
Sarcoidosis. We only ruled it out
because we thought he had ischemic...

629
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,814
Why did they run off?
What difference does...

630
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,787
Kids talk about running
off. How many do it?

631
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:03,878
What was the reason?

632
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,891
They were trying to escape
his evil, pill-popping, racist dad.

633
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,189
You would've liked him.
We should do another...

634
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,923
How do you know
the dad was racist?

635
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:14,262
He beat up his son for dating a
black girl. I extrapolated from that.

636
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,358
You see racism everywhere.

637
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,297
Maybe he just didn't
like this black girl.

638
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,449
It's not sarcoid. We would
have seen granulomas in his...

639
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,237
She has pretty eyes.

640
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:31,006
Forget infectious.
Forget environmental.

641
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:35,178
Defective DNA is keeping them
from making a critical protein,

642
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,188
hence the fluid build-up.

643
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,724
Hits the throat,
stomach, chest and brain.

644
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,350
Angioedema?

645
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:45,329
Hereditary angioedema.
Symptoms fit perfectly.

646
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:49,232
It's an incredibly rare disease. They
both would have to have a parent...

647
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,635
Is it a coincidence that
your sister has great hair,

648
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:55,697
or that these two
have green eyes?

649
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:01,240
You're not saying... They're
not brother and sister.

650
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,476
God, no. That would be sick.

651
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,587
Half brother and
sister. Different moms.

652
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,357
Dad must have had
an affair with her mom.

653
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,702
That's why he flipped out
when the kids started dating.

654
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,524
He had it himself.
Probably why the pills.

655
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,824
We won't know for sure...

656
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:21,458
Testing for HAE or paternity
is going to take a day.

657
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:25,368
She doesn't have a day. Start
treating and see what happens.

658
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:34,337
Any change?

659
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,007
Her response to stimuli
is still just as weak.

660
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,377
I almost hope she
stays in a coma.

661
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,044
That's sweet, Cameron.

662
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,111
I'd like to avoid shattering
both of their lives.

663
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,350
You don't think
dying will do that?

664
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:53,926
It's just her oximeter.

665
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,302
Tracy.

666
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,737
Tracy.

667
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,145
She's awake.

668
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,810
Oh, God, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

669
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,252
Awesome. Can I tell them?

670
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,661
We've obviously got to let
them know what's wrong.

671
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,997
But the cause, the
brother-sister thing...

672
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:34,438
Good plan. We just gotta keep
them away from doctors, the Internet

673
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:37,032
and anyone who's
not a total moron.

674
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,333
Tell them.

675
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:43,246
Yesterday he was willing to die to save
her. We've gotta give him time to recover.

676
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,578
He might be a little
vexed that you kept

677
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:48,117
letting him hump his
sister in the meantime.

678
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,711
Tell them.

679
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:53,054
Look, unless their dad was also
the product of an incestuous union,

680
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,923
the chances of serious
complications are minimal.

681
00:34:55,994 --> 00:35:00,728
Noble of you to take that
risk. Tell them, or I will.

682
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,999
So we just need
to take these pills?

683
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,596
Twice a day.

684
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,665
Angioedema is very
treatable. You'll be fine.

685
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,342
So, what? We, like,
caught this from each other?

686
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,610
No, it's a condition
you've both always had.

687
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,884
The onset of symptoms are
sometimes caused by stress or trauma.

688
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,993
The incident at the diner.

689
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,285
So we got it as kids?

690
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:29,988
It's a genetic
disease. It's not...

691
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:36,163
There's no good reason two
unrelated people would get it.

692
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,304
We think you guys
should take a DNA test.

693
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,141
How can we be related?

694
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,514
We think you have the same dad.

695
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,717
We won't know for
sure until we do the test.

696
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,347
Oh, God!

697
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,358
Your father.

698
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,196
No. No, this can't be true.

699
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,760
Yeah. Yeah, Jer, I'm lighter.

700
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,897
You know, I'm lighter
than both my parents.

701
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:19,434
And our eyes. Everyone always talks
about how we have the same eyes.

702
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,742
You're not really siblings.

703
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,178
We have the same father!

704
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,189
You didn't fight in the
backseat on car trips.

705
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,316
You didn't change
each other's diapers.

706
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:37,158
You guys just
met and fell in love.

707
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:43,897
The way you feel,
that hasn't changed.

708
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:16,393
Hey, Foreman, can you wear the
beeper for a couple of hours this weekend?

709
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:17,697
What?

710
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,499
We just destroyed
two people's lives.

711
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,369
So I'm not allowed to
run errands anymore?

712
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,217
I'd like to see some
sign that it affects you,

713
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,506
or that you recognize
it affects other people.

714
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,257
So are you going to
wear the beeper or not?

715
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:28,837
Sorry, I can't.

716
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,308
You just want to punish me.

717
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,819
I'm busy.

718
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,184
With what?

719
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,684
Going out of town.

720
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,857
Where are you going?

721
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,859
Foreman, you're not
missing a blue shoe, are you?

722
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,301
Come...

723
00:37:57,075 --> 00:38:00,045
You can't bet when you
know the answer beforehand.

724
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,512
We could spend all day
arguing whether you can bet

725
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,139
when you know the
answer beforehand.

726
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,480
Give me the 200 bucks.

727
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,459
What?

728
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,071
Hey. Hey.

729
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,782
You okay?

730
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:44,914
I was just wondering,
do you really like jazz?

731
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,688
I love it.

732
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,418
Are you lying?

733
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,295
I'm lying.

734
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,499
I want to spend time with you.

735
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,567
Is that so terrible?

736
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,662
No.

737
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:10,778
Maybe we shouldn't walk out
together. If people see us leaving...

738
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,444
Everybody's got to
find out sometime.

739
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,250
Let me just meet
you at your place.

740
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,003
She got her own room.

741
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,474
She just needs some time alone.

742
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,782
Do you want me to
hang out here a bit?

743
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,743
If you've come to return the
thermometer, don't bother. I've moved on.

744
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,881
If you'd actually read my chart,
you'd have known that I'm a cop.

745
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,658
You were going 40 in a 25 zone.

746
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,424
Oh, come on.

747
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:42,190
This isn't because I was
speeding, this is because I'm Latino.

748
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,497
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

749
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:48,097
Sorry, cool jacket. Only
pockets for important stuff.

750
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,697
That's a shame.

751
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,143
A 50 buck ticket?

752
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,237
Is that your way
of beating me up,

753
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:57,513
or is that just the price for
sticking something in you?

754
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:00,381
You took a pill while you
were examining a patient.

755
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,717
That's serious
addictive behavior.

756
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,993
I'm betting that you're
holding right now.

757
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,994
I wasn't weaving. I'm not drunk.

758
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:15,966
You've got no reason
to... Pupils dilated.

759
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,765
Appear to be under the
influence of a narcotic.

760
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:23,035
Would you mind turning around, please,
and putting your hands behind your head?

761
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,941
Does that polite crap
ever work on people?

762
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:33,480
Most people realize
there's only one answer.

763
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:42,654
You got a prescription?

764
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,094
I'm a cripple who
works in a hospital.

765
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:47,155
You don't think I can
get a valid prescription?

766
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,824
Arrogant son of
a bitch like you?

767
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,597
I'm going to bet
you didn't bother.

768
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:57,734
You are under arrest for
possession of narcotics.

769
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,741
You have the right
to remain silent,

770
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:04,408
which you should take
advantage of for once in your life.

771
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,122
If you give up the
right to remain silent,

772
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:09,382
anything you say can and
will be used against you...
