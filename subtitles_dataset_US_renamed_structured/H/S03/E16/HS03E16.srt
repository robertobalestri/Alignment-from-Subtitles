1
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,215
Take it, Sarge.
Take it. Oh, I'll take it.

2
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:25,925
Yeah.

3
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,960
Yo! Yo! Turn that back on.

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,368
Yeah, man, what'd you do?

5
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,516
Don't look at me, 'cause you
know I didn't do it. All right?

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,218
Hey! You better have put fresh
batteries in that thing like I told you.

7
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:45,144
No. I did, Sarge. Right when
you gave them to me. I did.

8
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,943
I put them in. Well,
then hit it or something.

9
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,985
Otherwise you all are gonna
have to listen to me sing!

10
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,013
Here.

11
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,789
Don't panic. Don't
shoot us. Don't die.

12
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,758
You got it, G?

13
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,132
Go! Go! Go!

14
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,745
Up and at them.

15
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,950
You're supposed
to be in clinic duty.

16
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:08,155
Yeah, like I can sleep down there
with all the crying and coughing.

17
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,695
Here.

18
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,597
Ex-Marine thinks he
has Gulf War syndrome.

19
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,395
There's no such
thing. So he's been told.

20
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,930
It hasn't stopped the unexplained
fatigue, rashes and joint pain.

21
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,875
And just so you know, he's the
nephew of a benefactor I owe a favor,

22
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:25,742
so you're gonna take this
case whether you like it or not.

23
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,338
Why wouldn't I want
to take the case?

24
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,416
The guy's tired and sore. It's
gonna be chapter one in my...

25
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,186
Don't panic. Don't
shoot us. Don't die.

26
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,700
You know him?

27
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,993
Never met him before in my life.

28
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,937
Okay. Well, you're about
to. He's on his way here.

29
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,699
Get your ass up and get your
team together. You have work to do.

30
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,258
That's amazing. No, it's not.

31
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,994
It's not? I can play the
harmonica with my nose,

32
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,090
make a penny come out of a child's
ear, or any other orifice for that matter,

33
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,728
and given the right circumstances can
bring two women to simultaneous ecstasy.

34
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,931
The right circumstances
being their agreement

35
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,496
to bill you on the
same credit card.

36
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:05,342
But what I absolutely can not do is dream
about someone I've never seen before.

37
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,148
Well, just because you don't
understand it doesn't mean it can't happen.

38
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,709
True. It can't happen
because it can't happen!

39
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,249
Well, maybe you didn't dream
about this guy specifically.

40
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,316
Right. Just some other guy
who looks exactly like him.

41
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,760
No. You imagined
some generic Marine,

42
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,322
then you placed his face in the
dream after you saw the picture.

43
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,868
Sort of a coincidence
mixed with a little déjà vu.

44
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,461
There's no record of him
ever coming into the clinic,

45
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,404
so I must've seen him
before somewhere else.

46
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,601
Fine. You've known
him since Cub Scouts.

47
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,873
The more interesting question
isn't what you dreamed, but why.

48
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:43,542
I'm guessing you're longing for either
a renewed relationship with your dad,

49
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,214
or a new relationship with
one of the Village People.

50
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,256
He was in the Navy,
not the Marines.

51
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,689
I thought your dad
was in the Marines.

52
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,989
The guy in the Village People.

53
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,689
Actually he's only in the Navy
when they sing <i>In the Navy.</i>

54
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,927
The rest of the time he's
just in generic fatigue.

55
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,527
What?

56
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,099
You brought it up!

57
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,309
You didn't flush. I didn't pee.

58
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:17,277
Male, 34, just got out of the
Marines after two years in Iraq.

59
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,749
Admitted complaining
of chronic fatigue,

60
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,313
joint pains, intermittent
rashes and sore throats.

61
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,154
Thinks he has Gulf War syndrome.

62
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,557
Why is he here
instead of the VA?

63
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,687
Because he has a rich uncle
Cuddy's trying to avoid fellating,

64
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:33,029
who doesn't buy the VA's
diagnosis of nothingswrongatosis.

65
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,431
The VA's right.

66
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,212
There's no such thing
as Gulf War syndrome,

67
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,548
especially in veterans who've
never served in the Gulf War.

68
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,040
Different war, same place.

69
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,575
Whatever was there
in 1990 is still there.

70
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,474
What's there can send
you home in a pine box

71
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,104
but it can't make you sick three
months after you've gotten home.

72
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,776
What, so thousands of soldiers
are lying about their symptoms?

73
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,946
You send 700,000 people
on a vacation to Hawaii,

74
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,198
some are gonna come back sick.

75
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,521
Doesn't mean it was caused
by snorkeling. He's right.

76
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,735
The studies all show the same
pattern of symptoms in veterans

77
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,126
who were sent to the
Gulf and those who weren't.

78
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,195
That's it?

79
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,663
You believe her but not me?

80
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,563
Stick to your guns, Chase.

81
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,693
Just 'cause there isn't a
single unifying symptom

82
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,446
doesn't mean there
isn't something going on.

83
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,981
It could just affect
everyone differently.

84
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,167
You think this guy has
Gulf War syndrome?

85
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,539
Of course not.

86
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,942
He's depressed and he's
looking for a disability check,

87
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,209
most likely because he's just realized
that knowing how to barter for sex

88
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,149
in six languages and open a
beer bottle with your eye socket

89
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,845
are not the most
marketable skills.

90
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,012
Why did you take this case?

91
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,056
'Cause a good scientist
continually questions

92
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,182
his own theories
and assumptions.

93
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,160
Cuddy's making him.
And now I'm making you.

94
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,197
Do a full physical and recheck
his blood for HIV, hep C,

95
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:40,063
malaria, schistosomiasis,
and T strain A. Baumannii,

96
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,227
just to make sure the
VA's dotted their I's.

97
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,703
And find out every hospital
and clinic he's ever visited,

98
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:49,971
every city he's ever lived in and
whether he's ever been on TV.

99
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,341
TV?

100
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,539
Problem could be neurological.

101
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,048
Everyone knows
TV rots your brain.

102
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,016
Well, it's usually the worst on my
palms and the bottom of my feet.

103
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,148
I get these black dots all over.

104
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,049
I don't see anything.
It comes and goes.

105
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,961
You're sure it's not just
scrapes and bruises.

106
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,431
I know the difference
between a rash and a bruise.

107
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,261
Sometimes it's harder than you
realize to distinguish between the two.

108
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,033
You obviously exercise.

109
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,704
My problems aren't
caused by my workouts.

110
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,207
But you do work out.

111
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,140
And by the look of
you, pretty strenuously.

112
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,235
That's not usually
the case with patients

113
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,747
whose principal complaint is
chronic fatigue and joint pain.

114
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,546
I was in the Marines for 12 years.
I'm used to doing PT every day.

115
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,349
Just because I can push through
the pain doesn't mean it's not there.

116
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,185
We're not saying
we don't believe you.

117
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:37,724
The hell you aren't.

118
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,387
We just need to be specific about
what exactly the problems are.

119
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,761
I sleep 10 hours a night
but I feel tired all the time.

120
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,826
I constantly get coughs,
rashes, sore throats.

121
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,135
My knees and hips feel like
someone poured sand in my joints.

122
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,402
Get these weird tingling
sensations in my legs.

123
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,640
Sometimes they're cold. Other
times, feels like my blood is boiling.

124
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,073
Specific enough?

125
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,678
Look, I don't care
what you guys call it.

126
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:10,656
Gulf War syndrome, Iraq
fever, or just crappy sickness X.

127
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:14,718
I just want someone to figure
out what it is so they can cure it.

128
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,792
Except for the supposed
pain in his joints,

129
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,609
none of the other symptoms he's
complaining about are currently evident.

130
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,966
And besides low potassium,
probably caused by him

131
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,664
over-hydrating
after working out.

132
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,036
His blood work's all normal.

133
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,804
Low potassium could also probably
be caused by the experimental vaccines

134
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,335
and anti-chemical warfare pills he
was given before he deployed to Iraq.

135
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,224
Not to mention the fact
that whole country is littered

136
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,878
with hundreds of tons of radioactive
shrapnel from depleted uranium munitions.

137
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:42,286
You go to medical school in France?
There's no trace of uranium in his urine.

138
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,483
And he was given the vaccines
and meds two years ago

139
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,992
without any allergic
or adverse reaction.

140
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,154
Has he ever done any modeling?

141
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,925
We forgot to ask.

142
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,009
We should send his urine
to the University of Leicester.

143
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,276
There's a professor
there who's developed

144
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,326
a more advanced screening
technique for uranium.

145
00:08:56,403 --> 00:09:01,467
If the levels are too low for us to detect,
they're way too low to cause any damage.

146
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,772
Where are you going?

147
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,706
This way.

148
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,578
You find out about any television
or other media exposure?

149
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,093
Do you really care or are you just
trying to waste hospital resources

150
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,245
to get back at Cuddy for
making you take the case?

151
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,981
Of course, I care.

152
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,217
What a horrible thing to say.

153
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,885
Do a Lexis-Nexis search and
get a copy of his credit report.

154
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,987
Before or after we tell him to eat a banana
and discharge him with a psych referral?

155
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,157
I say before.

156
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,099
And I say in between
give him a polysomnogram.

157
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:31,570
Sleep apnea could cause
chronic fatigue and paranoia.

158
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,437
And find out where he
went to summer camp.

159
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,209
You okay?

160
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,945
Yeah. Just a little too
much coffee this morning.

161
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,951
Were we walking
you to the bathroom?

162
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,179
I wish.

163
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,551
Wilson was just in there. These
guys know what I'm talking about.

164
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,748
That's his third REM cycle and
his breathing's completely normal.

165
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,942
There's obviously nothing
wrong with his sleep pattern.

166
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,806
If it's not the uranium, it's got
to be some other sort of toxin.

167
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,236
Or nothing at all.

168
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,706
You really think there's something wrong,
or you just want Foreman to be wrong?

169
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,003
Both.

170
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,566
Well, it's not his
sleep pattern.

171
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,636
If you really think it's a toxin, you
can do a liver biopsy in the morning.

172
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,011
We can't leave.

173
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,846
If we don't monitor the whole
test, House won't accept the results.

174
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,028
He'll just make us do it over.

175
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,429
It doesn't take two
doctors to monitor

176
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,355
what's clearly gonna be
a normal polysomnogram.

177
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,756
Oh, so you want me to stay?

178
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,369
You're the one that thought
there was something wrong.

179
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,191
I never said it was
a sleep disorder.

180
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,958
You wanna flip for it?

181
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,725
Just go.

182
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,629
Oh, come on. Don't be a baby.

183
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,742
Fine. I'll stay.

184
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,882
You know what we could do?

185
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,620
Here? Why not?

186
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,717
We're surrounded by empty
rooms with beds in them.

187
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,262
Yeah. And video cameras, too.

188
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,355
So we turn them off.
Yeah, that's all I need is

189
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,024
House or Foreman
walking in on us.

190
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,693
We have the keys.

191
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,938
No. What if he wakes up?

192
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,338
All right.

193
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,603
Suit yourself.

194
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,295
Damn it.

195
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,847
<i>Hello? Is anybody out there?</i>

196
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,154
<i>I think there's a
problem in here!</i>

197
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,615
What's wrong?

198
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,252
What do you mean, "What's
wrong?" You don't smell that?

199
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,523
Nothing smells, John.

200
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,065
Oh, are you kidding
me? It's disgusting.

201
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,000
How long have
you thought... Wait.

202
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,065
Open your mouth.

203
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,737
The smell's not in the
room. It's in your mouth.

204
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,840
What's going on?

205
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,241
Good question.

206
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,289
What?

207
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,952
You were wrong about
the nothingswrongatosis.

208
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,722
You can fake
fatigue and joint pain,

209
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,560
but you can't fake bacterial
vaginosis in your mouth.

210
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,675
<i>Where's his mouth been?</i>

211
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,168
Says he hasn't performed oral
sex on anyone in over a year.

212
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,464
Selfish bastard.

213
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,564
Because he hasn't been with anyone
since his last girlfriend dumped him

214
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,472
after he deployed to
Iraq the second time.

215
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,805
Selfish bitch.

216
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,242
We've ruled out HIV, diabetes
and any other endocrine abnormality.

217
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,579
Could be autoimmune.
Sjögren's decreases salivary flow,

218
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,312
creates a hospitable
home for bacteria.

219
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,081
No. His eyes and
tear ducts are fine.

220
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,485
Who was his last girlfriend?

221
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,718
Yeah, we'll get right on that.

222
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,058
Chronic fatigue, joint pain and
opportunistic infection spells cancer.

223
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,524
Probably lymphoma.

224
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,726
<i>We should biopsy his tonsilar
and submandibular lymph nodes.</i>

225
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,269
Right about cancer,
wrong about lymphoma.

226
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,638
<i>Unless you're simply hiding the
fact that his lymph nodes are swollen.</i>

227
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,802
Get Wilson to biopsy his salivary
glands. He's got parotid cancer.

228
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,289
And see if you can get to the
truth about who he's been dating.

229
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,806
<i>No way, a Marine goes a year without
getting some blood on his bayonet.</i>

230
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,784
It's not an STD.
You just said...

231
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:46,945
Just do it.

232
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,192
The antibiotics should at
least relieve the infection,

233
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,524
which will reduce the odor
and taste in your mouth.

234
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,188
Not soon enough.

235
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,670
All right. You're
gonna feel a little burn.

236
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,467
You know I never even dipped?

237
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,969
Chewing tobacco. Practically
everyone in my unit did it.

238
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,502
But me. I was so
paranoid about cancer.

239
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:20,111
Well, if it's parotid cancer, it's
very treatable if diagnosed early.

240
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,949
My mom had cancer, which is why
I know that diagnosing cancer early

241
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,823
means before there's
any serious symptoms.

242
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,334
Certainly tastes like a pretty
serious symptom, you know?

243
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,735
We'll know more after the test.

244
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,006
If he was just trying to mess
with Cuddy for wasting his time,

245
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,087
this would have stopped as soon as the
patient started exhibiting actual symptoms.

246
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,637
So the question is, why
is he wasting our time?

247
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,272
Or is he wasting our time?

248
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,409
You think he's got a medical reason
for asking for the guy's credit report?

249
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:53,714
I don't.

250
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,018
Where were you two
when the guy woke up?

251
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,853
We just stepped
out for a second.

252
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,658
To do what?

253
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,496
To get a coffee. We'd
been up most of the night.

254
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,866
He's just pushing to make
sure we have a complete history.

255
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:13,600
Obviously we're missing
something or we'd have the answer.

256
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,666
You didn't have any
coffee when you came back.

257
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,340
All right already. We
confess. You caught us.

258
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,391
We snuck into one of the
sleep lab rooms to have sex.

259
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,975
We shouldn't have done it while
we were working and we're sorry.

260
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,781
Now can we move on?

261
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,214
House would do Wilson
before you'd do Chase.

262
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,955
No. You would do House
and Wilson before I'd do Chase.

263
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,731
Now can we get back to work.

264
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,232
She did me once.

265
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,661
She was stoned!

266
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,572
Biopsy's inconclusive.

267
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,828
I'm gonna do a sialogram while we wait
for results from the additional blood work.

268
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,911
No hurry.

269
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,731
Probably nothing we can
do at this point anyway.

270
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,314
As long as the
cancer hasn't spread...

271
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,952
He's spitting stink. You
should focus on the living.

272
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,894
I need a prescription.

273
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,988
I just wrote you a prescription.

274
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,534
For Vicodin. I need alfuzosin.

275
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,359
No, you don't.

276
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,239
You figured out where
you met your Marine?

277
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,399
What?

278
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,977
Oh, that. Haven't
really thought about it.

279
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,638
I can't pee.

280
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,204
You can't remember him, can you?

281
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,773
I can't pee.

282
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,512
So stop taking the Vicodin.

283
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,679
I want to pee
and not be in pain.

284
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,450
Why don't you go to sleep?

285
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,820
I don't pee when I'm asleep.

286
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,951
Maybe you'll dream about him
again. Maybe he'll give you an address.

287
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,518
I haven't peed in three days.

288
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,531
I read that REM sleep is the
brain's way of working out problems.

289
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,499
Very useful. Did you
hear what I just said?

290
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,731
Yeah. You lied because you want
to avoid talking about your obsession.

291
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,432
I'm not obsessing. Why
don't you just ask him?

292
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,135
I haven't peed in three
days! You'd be dead.

293
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,200
I'm not counting
intermittent drips.

294
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,438
You'd be in agony.

295
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,845
I passed agony
yesterday around 4:00.

296
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,863
His mother, brother,
uncle and best friend

297
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,460
all confirm he hasn't
had a date in over a year.

298
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,369
Which means it's not an STD.

299
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,671
If you come up with something
medically relevant, page me.

300
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,312
What did you want me
to tell him? The truth?

301
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:41,013
No. You didn't have
to be so convincing.

302
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,283
Don't worry. I'll
make it up to you.

303
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,185
This is getting out of control.

304
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,386
Don't pout.

305
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,888
Our patient woke up with an infection
while we were getting our rocks off.

306
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,535
Do you want to stop?

307
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,831
No.

308
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,498
But I don't want to
get caught, either.

309
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,041
You think I do?

310
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,553
You certainly didn't go out of
your way to keep the volume down

311
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:05,777
when we were in the sleep lab.

312
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,643
I couldn't help that.

313
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,178
Why would I want to get caught?

314
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,551
Maybe you want to give
House a reason to be jealous.

315
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,047
I'm over House.

316
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:22,093
All this is, is uncomplicated sex.
Don't try to make it more than that.

317
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,653
We're not doing it
at work anymore.

318
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,525
Fine.

319
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,201
Wanna go grab some lunch?

320
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,145
I think the pill
is the way to go.

321
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,152
We haven't had a condom
break yet. Thank God.

322
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,179
But it's bound to happen, especially
the way we've been doing it.

323
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,856
On a bed of nails? No.

324
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,921
He's not kinky.
He's just insatiable.

325
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,230
I can barely make it to
any of my morning classes.

326
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,928
You smoke? No way.

327
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,438
Stop it!

328
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,304
Sorry.

329
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,612
Any history of hypertension,
blood clots, strokes?

330
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,674
Nope. Besides my
OCD, I'm fit as a fiddle.

331
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,587
You have OCD? Can't you tell?

332
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:28,094
Any other compulsions besides
drinking massive amounts of water?

333
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,685
No, that's it. Thank God.

334
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,958
My therapist says it
could be a lot worse.

335
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,871
You get up in the middle
of the night to drink?

336
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,061
Yeah. Every couple of hours.

337
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,629
Then your therapist is an idiot.

338
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,935
Unconscious people
don't have OCD.

339
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,373
They can, whoever,
have diabetes insipidus.

340
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,412
That's impossible. I
eat candy all the time.

341
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:50,109
Different kind of diabetes. This
kind is caused by banged up pituitary.

342
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,060
You're obviously more
of a lover than a fighter.

343
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:57,045
I'm guessing either a car accident or you
cracked your skull on the balance beam.

344
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,015
How'd you know?

345
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:04,530
Easy. Nice ass. No boobs. And
you've got palms like a longshoreman.

346
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,657
Wait here. You need a CAT scan.

347
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,860
Oh, my God... Don't worry.

348
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,803
Just means you'll be taking two
hormone supplements instead of one.

349
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,789
Okay, this time you're
gonna feel a little pressure.

350
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,078
We're injecting the
contrast material.

351
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,115
Could you turn up the music?

352
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,415
Sure.

353
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,521
Looks pretty good so far.

354
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,859
Still can't hear it that well.

355
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,698
Can you hear it now?

356
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,696
John?

357
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,034
John!

358
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,943
John, can you hear me?

359
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,676
Still no relief?

360
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,345
I got relief.

361
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,218
I just got no pee.

362
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,985
If the pills didn't work,
you may need a catheter.

363
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,425
You didn't come here to
talk to me about my pee.

364
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,122
What's going on?

365
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,597
He's got cancer all right.

366
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,067
But it's not in his salivary
glands. It's in his brain.

367
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:20,801
And it's bad. At least
six tumors. Maybe more.

368
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,274
He lost his hearing.
His sight's probably next.

369
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,080
Death is probably next.

370
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,880
No way he could've
grown all these in a week.

371
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,981
They can't be older. The VA
couldn't have missed all these.

372
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,526
Maybe they didn't miss
them. Just mixed them up.

373
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,654
Switched his films with
another patient's by mistake.

374
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,095
Maybe.

375
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:49,192
It'd mean some poor sap's getting his
melon sliced at the VA for no reason.

376
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:52,727
And this poor sergeant's gonna
be dead by the end of the week.

377
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,635
Where've you two been? - Lunch.

378
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,267
Why? What happened?

379
00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:01,678
Wilson's found some fast-growing,
elusive or magic brain tumors.

380
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,147
What did you find?

381
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,446
Nothing. He's telling the truth.

382
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,911
About what? CHASE:
About everything.

383
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,649
Where he's lived,
who he's dated.

384
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,055
Besides forgetting to
mention his dad's shin splints,

385
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,390
his granddad's nosebleeds,
and to return a few rented DVDs,

386
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,362
everything he's told
us has checked out.

387
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,830
You have them
researching your dream?

388
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,596
No. I have them
researching my patient.

389
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,030
You had a dream about a patient?

390
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,693
This poor guy's brain
is riddled with tumors

391
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:29,974
and you're checking
his credit report?

392
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,475
Come on. I need you guys.

393
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,914
Where are you
going? To do my job.

394
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,474
He's not your patient.

395
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,645
He is now. Go home
and go to sleep.

396
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,884
Maybe you'll dream a cure
to late-stage brain cancer.

397
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,265
How is he?

398
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,233
He's dead.

399
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,797
Oh, God. At least he
will be in a few days.

400
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,506
Question is why.

401
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,740
The only explanation is that
the VA hospital screwed up.

402
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,840
There was definitely no
mix up. I had them recheck.

403
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:15,445
Yes. Why would a government
agency lie to cover up a mistake

404
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,121
that might have caused
the death of a guy

405
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,267
they'd been trying to kill for
the last two years anyway?

406
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,919
They didn't lie.

407
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,420
Did you just take two Vicodin?

408
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,556
No. Just an antidepressant.

409
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,830
I was told to take two every
time you walked into the room.

410
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,803
The VA's scan of
his brain. No tumors.

411
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:41,414
Yes. This is proof positive that
someone didn't have tumors in their brain.

412
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,813
You see that bright
spot below his left orbit?

413
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,375
That is a titanium pin your
patient had inserted 20 years ago.

414
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:50,651
Unless you think the VA happened
to mix up his scans with someone

415
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,852
who had the exact same
pin, they didn't screw up.

416
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,798
You paged us?

417
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,829
Why didn't you send his urine
to Leicester like I told you?

418
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,303
Because you told me not to.

419
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,864
Why did you choose that
moment to listen to me?

420
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,934
You think depleted uranium might
have something to do with his tumors?

421
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,356
Radiation's the only thing that
will make tumors grow that fast.

422
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,110
High doses of radiation!

423
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,259
Even if he ate depleted
uranium bullets for breakfast,

424
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,894
he still would've been
exposed to less radiation

425
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,558
than we've given him
in the last two days.

426
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:25,649
Do it anyway. And
you, call his uncle back.

427
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:29,456
Find out if he ever brought his nephew
to any hospital parties or fundraisers.

428
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,997
No. Not until you
give me a reason.

429
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,256
Because I'm your boss?

430
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,631
A rational reason.

431
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,795
Or at least admit that
you don't have one.

432
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,135
I've got a full bladder
and I'm not afraid to use it.

433
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,764
But you are apparently afraid

434
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,019
of discovering something
you can't rationally explain...

435
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,306
Shut up!

436
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,243
Do what you're told.

437
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:52,541
Cuddy and Wilson may not
have to listen to me, but you do.

438
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,880
What the hell
was that all about?

439
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,220
I don't care.

440
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,132
Which is why I didn't feel the need
to ask him eight personal questions.

441
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,687
I'm over him.

442
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,360
Just making an observation.

443
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,832
All right. Ready
whenever you are.

444
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,034
I'm ready.

445
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,710
Wait a minute. Zoom in.

446
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,844
I don't see it. You sure you
got the right coordinates?

447
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,514
Yeah. She's in the right place.

448
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:34,293
Go 10 millimeters above
the AC-PC line on the Z axis.

449
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,760
Ten mil above AC-PC on Z.

450
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,589
It's not there anymore.

451
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,377
Are you sure you got
the gantry angle right?

452
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:45,269
Yeah, I'm sure. It's not there.

453
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,306
It disappeared.

454
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,275
Six tumors don't just disappear.

455
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,209
Unless they were
never there to begin with.

456
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,871
The VA didn't screw up.

457
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,415
Maybe someone else did.

458
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,110
Maybe it was Dr. Self-Righteous.

459
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,846
I saw the tumors.
There was no mix up.

460
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,364
Maybe there's something wrong
with the portable imager in the OR.

461
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,119
Something that would cause it to
show brain tissue in perfect detail

462
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,626
but completely miss
neoplastic tissue?

463
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,672
Then they were never
tumors to begin with.

464
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:11,891
I told you I saw...

465
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:16,561
Oh, you saw something that looked
like tumors. We all did. We were all wrong.

466
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,712
Or maybe he doesn't have cancer.

467
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,365
Maybe he has a brain infection
that's causing multiple abscesses.

468
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,771
That miraculously healed?

469
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,468
No. They were healed
by the antibiotics

470
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,422
we're giving him for the
vaginosis in his mouth.

471
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,845
If it's an infection, why didn't
it show up in his blood work?

472
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,906
I don't know yet.

473
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:33,848
Dr. Wilson, we have a problem.

474
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,251
What did you do?

475
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,722
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

476
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,834
John... What did you guys do?

477
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,369
John! Calm down!
We didn't even operate.

478
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,673
Could this be a regional effect?

479
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,906
- I can't move my legs!
- It's not the anesthesia.

480
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,626
John! John!

481
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,309
We're gonna figure out
what's wrong with you.

482
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:54,500
But first we need to know one thing,
have you ever appeared in any pornos?

483
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,176
Chronic fatigue,
sore throats, rashes,

484
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,375
putrid discharge in the mouth,
multiple abscesses in the brain,

485
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:09,046
hearing loss, and last but
not least, lower limb paralysis.

486
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,056
He's certainly given
us plenty of clues.

487
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,490
It's got to be some
sort of infection.

488
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,792
That's miraculously improving in his brain
but getting worse in his ears and legs?

489
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,162
Could be an
infection and cancer.

490
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,701
A neoplastic syndrome could
depress his immune system

491
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,327
and cause the other symptoms.

492
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,599
You're basing this theory
on the negative biopsy,

493
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,368
the lymph nodes
that aren't swollen,

494
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,807
or the tumors that were
never there to begin with?

495
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,674
And what are you gonna
base your theory on?

496
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,770
His favorite restaurants?

497
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,609
I was right.

498
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:39,846
He's excreting depleted
uranium in his urine.

499
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,854
We should start him on an IV
infusion of isotonic sodium bicarbonate...

500
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,480
It's not depleted uranium.

501
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,767
You're the one...
Who asked for the test

502
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,885
when we were thinking
cancer. We no longer are.

503
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,293
Depleted uranium doesn't
just cause cells to mutate.

504
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,642
It can cause cell death as well.

505
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,393
Not spinal cord cells.

506
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,867
At least not before the dose is high
enough to kill all his other cells first.

507
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,599
So you're saying the radioactive
uranium in his urine is irrelevant.

508
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,641
The sun's radioactive.
The earth is radioactive.

509
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,974
This hospital is
filled with radiation.

510
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,741
The issue is not where it
is, but how much there is,

511
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:12,046
and what damage that amount
can cause in someone's spinal cord.

512
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,746
As I've already
stated quite clearly.

513
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,756
Got it. We're all idiots.
What's your theory?

514
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,689
Give me your keys. Why?

515
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,388
You ever tried to ride a
motorcycle with a distended bladder?

516
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:29,023
Keep him on antibiotics, check
his hearing and paralysis every hour.

517
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,933
So you basically
want us to do nothing?

518
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,904
No. I basically
want to do nothing.

519
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,599
I want you to keep
him on antibiotics

520
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,734
and check his hearing
and paralysis every hour.

521
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,841
Wait. You can't go home now.

522
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,005
Actually, I have to go home now.

523
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,174
Its two days past my bedtime.

524
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,911
House, he needs your help.

525
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,475
And I need sleep!

526
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,613
Hey, it's the brain's way
of working out problems

527
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,989
that the conscious mind can't
solve during the day, remember?

528
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,531
No. Nothing.

529
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,613
I'm gonna die. Aren't I?

530
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,118
No, we're not.

531
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,985
We should start treatment for
the uranium toxicity like you said.

532
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,082
But House... Isn't here.

533
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,088
If House wanted to be
involved in the case...

534
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,110
he wanted us to
start this treatment,

535
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,313
he would have told us to do it
the last time you brought it up.

536
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,465
You have a better idea? No.

537
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,440
Then we're going with Chase's.

538
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,678
Tell him not to get
the lines tangled.

539
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,310
With an infusion this slow we
can't have any kinks in the line.

540
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:36,287
I went to medical school, too.

541
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,624
Keep your arms on your
body. Above your heart.

542
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,734
I can't feel my stomach!

543
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:55,030
I don't feel that! I
don't feel anything!

544
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,699
Paralysis is ascending.

545
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,586
If it keeps going we're
gonna need a respirator.

546
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,444
What? What are you
saying? Can you breathe?

547
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,177
No. Not yet.

548
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,830
<i>Incident on the Garden State
Parkway, southbound at exit 91...</i>

549
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,167
So, where were we?

550
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,603
You have a nice night? No.

551
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,338
The paralysis is ascending.

552
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,778
Last check it was
nearly to his diaphragm.

553
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,078
Tells us something.
Means it's getting worse.

554
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,742
Worse is something.

555
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,082
Also it tells us it's
not the uranium.

556
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,447
Did we think it was?

557
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:22,324
We started him on sodium bicarb to
try to flush the uranium out of his system.

558
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,592
Great. Now the fact that he's
getting worse tells us nothing.

559
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,132
Never thought it was uranium.

560
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,210
For all we know, the uranium
treatment is what's making him...

561
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,601
A sodium bicarb infusion
wouldn't have any affect on...

562
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,195
On what?

563
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,882
Kind of hard to say what it
wouldn't have an effect on

564
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,534
if you've no idea
what's there to affect.

565
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,338
We had to do something.
Well, next time,

566
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,538
go with something that
has a chance of working.

567
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:41,807
Like what?

568
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,191
You come up with some brilliant
idea while you're warm and cozy

569
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,047
in your bed at home?
We need more information.

570
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,518
How much more information
could you possibly want?

571
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,682
We have a medical history going all
the way back to his great grandparents.

572
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,590
A non-medical history
going... It's not enough.

573
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,457
It's all we're gonna get.

574
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,998
Wanna bet?

575
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,407
Who approved a
sodium bicarb infusion?

576
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,306
Don't look at me.
I was home in bed.

577
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,504
What's wrong? He's unconscious.

578
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,810
His skin has lost all color and his
BP and hematocrit are plunging.

579
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,126
He was only on the sodium
bicarb... He's bleeding out.

580
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,162
He can't be bleeding out.
There's no blood in the bed.

581
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,313
Fine. He's bleeding in.

582
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,165
There's no sign of bruising
or internal hemorrhaging.

583
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,900
The paralysis must've
reached his diaphragm.

584
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,364
He's not able to
oxygenate his blood.

585
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,395
He's not able to oxygenate his
blood because he doesn't have any left.

586
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,623
There's no evidence.

587
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:32,974
The only thing
that would explain...

588
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,141
There's no reason
for blood loss.

589
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,428
There has to be a reason!

590
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,800
He needs a transfusion. Get
me four units of O-negative, stat.

591
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,771
Let's elevate his feet.

592
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:43,104
He doesn't need a transfusion.

593
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:46,042
Nobody asked you. In
fact, why are you even here?

594
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:49,081
Because obviously you
need my help. Get out.

595
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,311
House, his blood obviously
didn't just vanish into...

596
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,252
What the hell is this?

597
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,395
Somebody must
have spilled something.

598
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,023
Somebody else should be getting
me four units of O-negative, stat.

599
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,925
What the hell is that?

600
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:09,695
It's a urine catheter
collection bag with a rip in it.

601
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,964
What the hell's it look like?

602
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,068
What?

603
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,276
It's just urine. It's sterile.

604
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:26,514
No one's getting me blood! Why
isn't anybody getting me blood?

605
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,177
You're bleeding.

606
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,980
House, are you all right?

607
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,926
Why are you even here?

608
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,655
I'm always here.

609
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,758
No, you're not.

610
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,469
There's a reason.
There has to be.

611
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,749
<i>Incident on the
Garden State Parkway...</i>

612
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,969
So, where were we?

613
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:26,945
Have a nice night?

614
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,479
Yes, I did. Thank you.

615
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,481
I'm guessing better
than our patient.

616
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:34,076
Probably due to his BP
and hematocrit plunging.

617
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,745
How'd you know?

618
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,297
The answer was staring
right at us the whole time.

619
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,698
As plain as the
nose on our faces.

620
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,361
And the nose on his face.

621
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,268
What's going on?
What did he say?

622
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,035
No hairs and
cauterization scars.

623
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,209
Which means?

624
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,878
He had it cauterized.
How could you know that?

625
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,380
Because it makes sense.

626
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:06,316
Undoubtedly done to stop
the same childhood nosebleeds

627
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,977
that plagued his grandfather.

628
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,955
Undoubtedly because they were both born
with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

629
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,047
What's he saying?

630
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,322
I'm saying you have a genetic
disease that's destroying your capillaries.

631
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,989
That no one in his family's
ever been diagnosed with before?

632
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,498
Not surprising, since the
most common initial symptoms,

633
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,694
skin rashes and nosebleeds
are often written off

634
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,602
as the result of minor
trauma or dry weather.

635
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:30,403
But they can also be the result of his
arteries and veins merging together.

636
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,376
He obviously has AVMs.

637
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,188
<i>AVM near the spine
caused the paralysis.</i>

638
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:37,273
<i>AVM in his lungs prevented
his blood from being filtered.</i>

639
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,647
<i>Dirty blood caused
the joint pain, fatigue,</i>

640
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,948
<i>and the infections in
his mouth and brain.</i>

641
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,580
Nothing that a few
surgeries won't clear up.

642
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,592
Get MR angiograms
of the aforementioned.

643
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,094
The Marines weren't
hiding anything. He was.

644
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,563
Or at least he forgot to
mention his bloody tissue issue.

645
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:58,029
What's going on?
What did he say?

646
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:06,111
Well, looks like solving the
case solved your other problem.

647
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,046
There is no medicine like
happiness. Except maybe laughter.

648
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:13,279
Or rubber tubes
shoved up your urethra.

649
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,420
You cathed yourself?

650
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:19,651
It's actually not that bad after the
first, I don't know, 9 or 10 inches.

651
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,558
The cath relieved the
spasm. I'm good as new.

652
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:27,065
Of course. Just a minor spasm in a muscle
you've been using multiple times a day

653
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,794
without any problems
for the past 45 years.

654
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,188
Not a major side
effect caused by the

655
00:39:32,212 --> 00:39:35,000
overuse of a particular
narcotic painkiller.

656
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:36,905
Yeah. That was my thought, too.

657
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:42,380
So, no reason to think about cutting
back on your use of that particular pill.

658
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,915
Thank God!

659
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,926
Actually, it was the triple
dose of the good stuff

660
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,819
that allowed me to finally get
some sleep and solve the case.

661
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,084
Pills made all my
dreams come true.

662
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,921
You really got the
answer in your sleep?

663
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:58,688
I got one in my sleep. The
other one I got in the shower.

664
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,200
I've been thinking about you.

665
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:09,904
You lied.

666
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:11,703
I didn't lie.

667
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,713
I simply chose not to share
completely irrelevant facts.

668
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,942
Like the fact that you lied.

669
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,749
No wonder I couldn't
place his face.

670
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,219
You were practically
swallowing it on the dance floor.

671
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,586
I was not.

672
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,215
Talk about the cool uncle.

673
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,693
He donates the money and
the nephew gets the write-off.

674
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,306
And of course, by write-off, I
mean he gets to put your ankles...

675
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:36,392
This is exactly why I didn't mention
our one date over two years ago.

676
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,627
Because of my T-shirt.

677
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,105
Because you are
an obnoxious ass.

678
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:44,373
Because you would have
spent the whole time...

679
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,442
That's very smart.

680
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,708
'Cause this way I spent the whole
time completely focused on the patient.

681
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,180
How did you even remember him?

682
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,149
We were only at that
party for like 10 minutes!

683
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,912
Is this a new health plan?

684
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:57,547
Service the Dean of Medicine,
you get free health care for a year?

685
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,154
Why are you smiling?

686
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:04,788
You remembered him
because he made out with me.

687
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,830
I'm good with faces.

688
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,767
So this plan, is it open to
anyone? Is there a co-pay?

689
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,303
You're lousy with faces.

690
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,397
Don't make this about
me. This is your humiliation.

691
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,136
So how much for
private room coverage?

692
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,001
Get over me.

693
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,908
Give me a break. You hired me...

694
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,659
'Cause you're a good doctor who
couldn't get himself hired at a blood bank,

695
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,276
so I got you cheap.

696
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:30,880
You gave me everything I asked for
because one night I gave you everything...

697
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:34,187
Stop staring at my ass
when you think I'm not looking,

698
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,989
showing up at restaurants
where I happen to be on a date,

699
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,792
and fantasizing about
me in the shower.

700
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,299
That ship sailed
long ago, House.

701
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,334
Get over it.

702
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,705
If you're still
referring to your ass,

703
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:51,834
I think that supertanker sailed
would be the more precise metaphor.

704
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:27,201
Sorry.

705
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:30,077
Just looking for an
extra-large trashcan.

706
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,615
Since when does
he clean anything up?
