1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,379
You're not going to
make this easy, are you?

2
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:18,810
Unfortunately, as much
as I admire your spirit...

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,166
Subject anesthetized with .5
CC's of sodium pentobarbital.

4
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,475
Transfected with human
hepatic cancer cells.

5
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:47,539
Underwent six rounds of
intra-abdominal treatment with ES-22.

6
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:54,822
Vertical incision through the rectus
sheath opens the abdominal cavity.

7
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:58,049
Incision extended into...

8
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,824
the thorax.

9
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:09,027
Liver appears normal in
color. No apparent scarring or...

10
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,267
Damn it!

11
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:18,103
Cancerous tumors still
present on the right lobe,

12
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:23,610
1.12 centimeters in
diameter. No reduction.

13
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:41,226
71-year-old cancer
research specialist.

14
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:45,561
Minor tremors, a localized melanoma
removed two years ago, cataracts.

15
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,691
And he can't breathe.

16
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,846
Also, disregard the
facial lacerations.

17
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,296
They're creepy, but
unfortunately irrelevant.

18
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,204
Don't you wanna know why?

19
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,640
You have your cane.

20
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,972
No, why the
lacerations are creepy.

21
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,912
He was about to dissect one of
his lab rats when he collapsed.

22
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:05,578
The little vermin seized the day, so to
speak, and went medieval on his ass.

23
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,452
What? My fly open?

24
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,457
So, the pain's returned?

25
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,390
There was no pain.
He was unconscious.

26
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,303
I'm guessing because
he wasn't able to breathe.

27
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,590
We're talking about you.

28
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,927
Obviously. I'm obviously not.

29
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,292
What is it with you people?

30
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,377
I don't use the cane, you're
shocked. I use the cane...

31
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,494
We're just concerned.

32
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,663
About the wrong
person. I can breathe.

33
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,798
Ezra Powell, on the
other hand, is gonna die.

34
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,637
The Ezra Powell? The researcher?

35
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,952
The guy who wrote that textbook?

36
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,569
"That" textbook? The textbook.

37
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,046
Wait. There's actually
another doctor you admire?

38
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,913
I admire lots of doctors.

39
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,863
Of course, most of them look a lot
better in knee socks than Ezra Powell,

40
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,393
but seeing as they
can all breathe...

41
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,255
Oxygenation is through the
floor and lungs are full of fluid.

42
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,792
Gotta be his heart.

43
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,892
Could be amyloidosis.

44
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,453
Or his lungs, probably from years
of inhaling toxic chemicals in his lab.

45
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,658
It's not the lungs. The
chest x-ray's clean.

46
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,343
So's his EKG.
It's not his heart.

47
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,892
We're being too nice.

48
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,703
Outside the hospital
he can't breathe.

49
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,173
Inside the hospital he
can, because we help,

50
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,472
at least enough to
screw with our test results.

51
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,206
The source of the problem's
either in his heart or his lungs,

52
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,877
so all we gotta
do is stop helping,

53
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,316
put a little pressure on him
and see which gives out first.

54
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,343
At 71, we get his
heart or lungs to give

55
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,549
out, we might not get
them to give in again.

56
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,591
That's why we're
gonna do it in a hospital.

57
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,957
Put him on an inclined
treadmill and do a stress EKG.

58
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,421
So much for the admiration.

59
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,661
Let's get you started.
I'll turn your oxygen up.

60
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,740
I worked with Williams on the
first protocol for this machine.

61
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,643
Everyone still uses it.

62
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,410
Except for Williams.
He died four years ago.

63
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,883
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,117
He was 84. He died parasailing.

65
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,021
He was always an idiot.

66
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,390
You okay?

67
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:59,526
Hang in there. You know the
protocol's only a few minutes.

68
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,159
His heart rate's flat.

69
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,480
If we don't get it past 130,
we're not going to see anything.

70
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,016
And if he falls and breaks a hip,
we're not going to see anything either.

71
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,135
Except an increase in
our malpractice insurance.

72
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,537
I figured House might
go back to the pills,

73
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,812
but if he's using his cane, he's
right back to where he was before.

74
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,977
Maybe even worse.

75
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,147
Luckily, he'll handle it in
a stoic, grown-up fashion.

76
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,418
He'd never take it out on us.

77
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,358
I can't.

78
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,690
I've got to stop.

79
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,998
Just a little longer.

80
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,271
His heart rate's only 90. I'm
going to increase the incline.

81
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,204
I've got to stop.
I've got to get off.

82
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,247
You're doing great.
Just a little faster, okay?

83
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,879
I don't need a
cheerleader, I need oxygen.

84
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,180
Stop. This isn't working.

85
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,731
His heart rate
barely got above 90.

86
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,290
He can't breathe. There's
too much fluid in his lungs.

87
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,859
Really? He's got
fluid in his lungs?

88
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,701
Whatever are we gonna do?
Oh, yeah, now I remember.

89
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,412
Put him on a treadmill and run
him like one of his rats on a wheel.

90
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,875
He can't run. He
can hardly walk.

91
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,354
That's 'cause he's
not trying hard enough.

92
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,856
If he was, his heart
rate would go up.

93
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,679
Exercising with a lung full of
your own bodily fluids tends to hurt.

94
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,446
They don't call it a stress
test for nothing. Do it again.

95
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,518
He's drowning.

96
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,250
Then pull him out of
the pool and do it again.

97
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,528
I'm assuming this isn't your
idea of a long-term solution.

98
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,276
We need to get rid of
the fluid in your lungs,

99
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,700
so you'll be able
to do the test.

100
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,033
To see if it's my
heart or my lungs?

101
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,265
Exactly.

102
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,601
My money's on both.

103
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,869
I've been in and out of the
hospital for the past year.

104
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:55,109
I'm old. I'm sick. And I'm
getting older and sicker.

105
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,716
Not a very interesting
differential but...

106
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,549
I'm in.

107
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,527
You don't need a $400 handbag.

108
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,593
It's kinda hard to check your throat
when you're flapping your gums around.

109
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,796
Sorry.

110
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,430
But it's for the fall formal.

111
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,903
He doesn't care if it's for
the Presidential Inauguration.

112
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,912
But I'm using Marissa'a
old dress. It's free.

113
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,572
You know what else is free?

114
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,015
The roof over your head, the food
you eat, your phone, your computer.

115
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,261
How long have you
been congested?

116
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,686
All week, ever since
we got back from Fresno.

117
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,020
Fresno? That's in France,
right? See the Parthenon?

118
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,091
California.

119
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,258
I've got no appetite, I'm
aching all over, I'm weak.

120
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,559
Does that hurt? Oh, yeah.

121
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:50,161
Does his voice always have
that unattractive nasal tone?

122
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,766
Totally.

123
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,832
I'm gonna take
that giggle as a "no".

124
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,504
Fever, aches, weakness,
loss of appetite.

125
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,309
You been having an anal
sex with IV drug users lately?

126
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,475
Of course not. I'm married.

127
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,194
You think she might
have been having...

128
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,743
No!

129
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,619
Probably a rhinovirus.

130
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,815
What's that?

131
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,585
A cold.

132
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,786
Take this four times a
day, and stay off airplanes.

133
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,888
They're flying cesspools.

134
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,759
Oops!

135
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,802
You dropped something.

136
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:28,197
If there's anything else
you can think of, please call.

137
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,435
Yes?

138
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,140
He's too old and weak.

139
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,283
Yeah, this is way
better. This'll work.

140
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,426
Just try.

141
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,189
There are 20 words
to describe chest pain.

142
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:57,294
Burning, squeezing,
stabbing, tearing...

143
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,703
Each one diagnostically useful.

144
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,241
For that, you have to
thank Dr. Powell's textbook.

145
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,212
But there are no words to describe
degrees of what he's feeling right now.

146
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,044
Shortness of breath.

147
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,013
If he had worked on those
issues, there would be.

148
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,755
He never would have given
up until he had an answer.

149
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,552
This isn't working.

150
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,452
Dr. House...

151
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,656
Please don't get up.

152
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,426
I'm sure you're very busy,

153
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,468
I'm just gonna try and
speed things up a little.

154
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,333
Is that epi? That's
not the protocol.

155
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:35,467
No. The protocol is what you
tried to do and failed each time.

156
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,807
Over 100. Now we're
getting somewhere.

157
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,042
How does it look, Foreman?

158
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,641
No EKG changes.

159
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:46,944
Then we push harder.

160
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,352
House, you're gonna kill him.

161
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,016
No, he's right. Let him do it.

162
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,791
See? That's why he doesn't
have to wear knee socks.

163
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,488
He can't breathe.

164
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,392
130, our magic number.

165
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,396
Nothing here. Foreman?

166
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:06,770
Still no sign of blockage.

167
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,009
Which means it's not the
heart. It must be the lungs.

168
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,514
See, that wasn't
so hard, was it?

169
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,210
No. Just give me the
rest of the epinephrine.

170
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,565
The test is over. It's okay.
We're going to stabilize you.

171
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:23,750
No.

172
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,453
No, just let me die.

173
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:28,527
You're not gonna die.

174
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,393
Yes, I am.

175
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,364
We'll find a treatment.

176
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,735
I don't want to live like this.

177
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,429
Please, I'm begging you.

178
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,903
Kill me.

179
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,972
He says no more tests.

180
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,280
He wants to die and he
wants us to help him do it.

181
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,720
And I wanna play a little game I like
to call Block My Spike with Misty May.

182
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,067
He's thought this through.
It's not an impulsive decision.

183
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,151
Neither is mine. He's depressed.

184
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,704
He'll feel much better
after we cure him.

185
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,356
He's seen all the
tests we've seen.

186
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,642
Even if we figure out what's causing the
lung damage, it's too late to reverse it.

187
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,586
You can't know that without
knowing what's wrong.

188
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,001
It's his call.

189
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,093
So what do we do?

190
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,215
Do we just put a plastic bag
over his head and get it over with?

191
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,141
No, we give him a
syringe full of morphine.

192
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,806
Every doctor I've ever
practiced with has done it.

193
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,542
They don't want
to, they don't like to,

194
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,982
but that's the way it
is. I haven't. I won't.

195
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,110
I couldn't do it either.

196
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,246
You just said we should
respect his decision.

197
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,722
Respect it doesn't
necessarily mean we honor it.

198
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,385
Right. It just means
we talk about it.

199
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,221
At some point, "do no harm" has to
mean allowing nature to take its course,

200
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,897
not stubbornly
standing in the way of it.

201
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:42,300
Sticking a metal syringe into
a plastic IV line and pumping in

202
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,532
a lethal dose of morphine is
not letting nature take its course,

203
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,082
not according to the
State of New Jersey.

204
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,837
So it's better we allow him to
slowly suffocate in his own plasma?

205
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,037
Whose side are you on, Senator?

206
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,206
First respect his wishes, then
invade Iraq, then get the troops home.

207
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,250
Make up your mind. Wow.

208
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,162
There's certainly a lot of
interesting things to consider.

209
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,621
The stress EKG
rules out the heart,

210
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,466
which means something's
gotta be attacking his lungs.

211
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,983
Could be mycoplasma or Strep
pneumo, which probably means

212
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,428
it's too late to do
anything about it.

213
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,328
We could try levofloxacin.

214
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,510
Coming up with a new treatment
isn't gonna do us any good

215
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,799
unless we convince
him it's worth trying.

216
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,829
Come on. He's old
and sick and tiny.

217
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,032
And we can do
whatever we want to him.

218
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,478
What happened?

219
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,852
I don't know.

220
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,185
He must have fallen out of bed

221
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,352
and got the nasal canula
wrapped around his neck somehow.

222
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,395
Ezra, what are you doing?

223
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:47,093
I don't want to live hooked to
machines, too weak to wipe my own ass.

224
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,611
Why would you want
to wipe your own ass

225
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,275
when you could have
someone do it for you?

226
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,771
You're wasting your time.

227
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,069
There must be other patients
you could actually help.

228
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,134
All services rendered on a
first come, first served basis.

229
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,941
I won't consent
to any more tests.

230
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,907
And if anyone tries to
so much as touch me,

231
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,051
I'll press charges for assault.

232
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,487
You heard the man.

233
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,358
He wants everyone to leave
him alone. Why don't you go first?

234
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,858
Get out!

235
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,701
You came to me. I
didn't come to you.

236
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:34,706
I figured you'd have the guts to do
what had to be done if it came to that.

237
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,052
We're nowhere near that.
It's time to test your lungs.

238
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,953
Breathe!

239
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,617
You're gonna have
to exhale sometime.

240
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:47,693
Stop!

241
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,092
House, you're hurting him.

242
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,255
You're hurting me.

243
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,563
Fine. If you don't help
us, we don't help you.

244
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,372
Your lungs
slowly fill with fluid.

245
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,572
You gasp to catch every
breath, but never can.

246
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,672
Every breath is petrifying.

247
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,713
It'll be slow,
painful, torturous.

248
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,720
We don't choose our birth.
And we don't choose our death.

249
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,691
What if you could? How
about we make a deal?

250
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,497
Give me one more day.

251
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:33,065
If I don't find out exactly
what's wrong with you by then,

252
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,235
I'll help you die. House.

253
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,572
Twenty-four hours.

254
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,281
Come on, it's
not gonna kill you.

255
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,719
Old guy, lungs, fluid. Go.

256
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,003
You cannot help
him kill himself.

257
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,051
Of course I can.

258
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,461
Chase says we
do it all the time.

259
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,930
Cuddy is not gonna let you.

260
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,261
Enough!

261
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,961
You don't want
me to kill him. Fine.

262
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,879
Here's a big shock. I
don't want to kill him either.

263
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,101
How do I not kill him? By
you guys doing your job.

264
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,741
We have 24 hours to figure
out what's wrong with him.

265
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,069
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

266
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,910
I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia.
Should be bacteria in his blood.

267
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,501
That's gonna take
longer than 24 hours.

268
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:17,778
Not if I spin down the sample.

269
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,718
Separate off the buffy coat,
then Gram stain for bacteria.

270
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:25,257
Great. Do an amylase, D-dimer,
C-reactive peptide, get a urine,

271
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,225
and do a bronchial
sputum while you're at it.

272
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,888
And you, check his home
and lab for radiation and toxins.

273
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,260
And do a bone marrow biopsy.

274
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,424
All of that in 24 hours? Nah.

275
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:37,197
Whatever you don't get done,
you can finish at the autopsy.

276
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,979
Wow. You guys look like crap.

277
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,407
What have you got?

278
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,677
Purple dye on my fingers.

279
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,127
What did the bone
marrow biopsy show?

280
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,175
I don't have the results.

281
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,245
What? What have you
been doing all night?

282
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,153
Jell-O shots and
wild sex, what else?

283
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,283
There's no bacteria
in the blood cultures.

284
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,521
We still have some
cooking, but so far, nothing.

285
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,618
Nothing in the urine.

286
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,097
Lab was clean enough to do
surgery in, because, well, they do.

287
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,531
And there was no sign of viruses

288
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,345
or fleas on any of the rats.

289
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,462
Yeah.

290
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,097
Who?

291
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,872
Tell her to call the clinic.

292
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:26,174
Then tell her to leave a
message and I'll get back to her.

293
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,942
Then tell her to leave
a personal message.

294
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,039
Who's that?

295
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,414
That's your protégé.

296
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,679
What are these?

297
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,221
Dictation tapes. He
records everything. Why?

298
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,984
Because he's a
diligent researcher?

299
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,547
Or he's losing his memory.

300
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,002
A lot of people
dictate their notes.

301
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:43,121
Yes, we could assume
that and we'd have nothing.

302
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,439
Or we could assume
it's a symptom,

303
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,729
in which case whatever's in
his lungs is also in his brain,

304
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,632
unless you've got
something more promising.

305
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,193
I'll go get an MRI of his head.

306
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,239
Keep testing till
you find something.

307
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,140
I'm going to my office
to rest for a while.

308
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,741
It's been a long time since
I took an anatomy class,

309
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,910
but I'm pretty sure you're moving
farther and farther away from my lungs.

310
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,477
Running out of places
to look, aren't you?

311
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,648
It doesn't mean we're
gonna stop looking.

312
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,988
Oh, no. Not for six more hours.

313
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,220
Do you want us to fail? No.

314
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,530
But you will.

315
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,876
No abnormal nuclei means
no leukemia. He a drinker?

316
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,309
Not according to the history.

317
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,455
Which means yes, he drinks,

318
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,347
which gives us a nice mundane
explanation for the acellularity.

319
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,476
Or he's telling the truth, which
means fungus is still on the table.

320
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,522
But your entire view of
human nature gets destroyed.

321
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,217
Six of one, half a
dozen of the other.

322
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,352
Bad news fast. Good
news, you can take your time.

323
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,964
Head's clean. You were
wrong. His faculties are intact.

324
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,091
Too bad. If his
brain was addled,

325
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,811
we wouldn't have to
listen to anything he says.

326
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,428
Hand me the 10 percent KOH.

327
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,199
It's 4:00. We have
nothing to tell him.

328
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,207
Then we have no reason to talk to
him. We still haven't ruled out fungus.

329
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,903
Yeah, we have.
No bugs, no hyphae.

330
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,682
Okay. Next procedure.

331
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,242
We sneak in, turn
back the clock.

332
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:22,752
Whole team. Must be bad news.

333
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,955
Nope.

334
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,928
Your bone marrow biopsy
revealed multiple myeloma.

335
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,132
It's not good news, but
there are some treatments.

336
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,364
I need to draw some blood.

337
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:33,701
What about my breathing?

338
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:38,143
Associated hyper-viscosity syndrome
gummed up the blood vessels in your lungs.

339
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,045
Dr. Chase said my
calcium is normal.

340
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,442
We call him Dr. Idiot.

341
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,611
There's no M
protein in my urine.

342
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,314
Odd presentation.

343
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,885
It's so odd that Dr. Cameron
doesn't believe it either.

344
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,097
Just give me 12 more hours.

345
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,600
We had a deal. No more tests.

346
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,733
Fair enough. Give
me six more hours.

347
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,634
Listen, there is no evidence
that you are terminal.

348
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,608
You a man of your word or not?

349
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,407
No, as a matter
of fact, I'm not.

350
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,108
Fine. Then discharge me.

351
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,478
My lungs will
slowly fill with fluid.

352
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:25,448
I'll gasp to catch every
breath, but never can.

353
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:30,690
Every breath will be petrifying.
It'll be slow, painful, torturous.

354
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,695
You really gonna
let me die like that?

355
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,538
Where are you going? Nowhere.

356
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,320
Everybody who can walk
should get out of here.

357
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,730
You can't do that.

358
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,098
I can't do what?

359
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:45,729
Administer a prescription pain
killer to a patient who's in pain?

360
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,829
Go.

361
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,432
Make sure somebody sees
you downstairs in the cafeteria.

362
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,477
I can't let you do this.

363
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:55,575
Either I die in
pain or I just die.

364
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,116
That... That's what the
argument is here. No.

365
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,211
It's about whether you
die or we murder you.

366
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:05,748
What's gonna happen here is that
someone's getting a buttload of morphine.

367
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,522
I'm not sure exactly
who at this point.

368
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,970
I can't be a part of this.

369
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,069
Thank you.

370
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:00,810
I always wondered exactly
what was on the other side.

371
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,044
Nothing.

372
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:40,114
What are you doing?

373
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,153
Getting a laryngoscope.

374
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,749
Don't just stand there, help!

375
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,020
But you told him that...

376
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,925
A little something
I like to call a lie.

377
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:54,023
It's bad, I know, but it's way
further down the list than murder.

378
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,771
He's unconscious.
No more whining.

379
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,713
We can keep testing him.

380
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,779
Go get a ventilator. I'm
not gonna do this all night.

381
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,452
We can legally assume
that he'd consent

382
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,021
to whatever a reasonable
person would consent to.

383
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:29,728
And a reasonable person would
obviously consent to being put

384
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,398
in a coma against their will
just to satisfy your curiosity?

385
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,132
I try to kill him, you're mad.
I don't kill him, you're mad.

386
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,507
All he wanted was some dignity.

387
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,011
Were you in that room with him?

388
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,447
Was he wearing a tux while
he choking on his own plasma?

389
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:49,216
Keep doing the tests. Take your
time. Do it right. Go! Get to work.

390
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,984
Wait!

391
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:59,592
Cameron, why did you do these cuts
so far down on this MRI of his head?

392
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,276
I wanted get his brain
stem and his C-spine

393
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,235
to make sure his
diaphragm wasn't paralyzed.

394
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:06,761
You also caught the top of
his lungs. There's scarring.

395
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,068
You do know that you can't
really pierce me with your stares.

396
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:15,672
Lung scarring along with the bad bone
marrow points to an autoimmune disease.

397
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,808
Could be pulmonary
fibrosis. Or lupus.

398
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,818
He can kill himself
after we get him better.

399
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,719
Start him on an IVIG for the
lupus and get a colonoscopy.

400
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,121
The lupus could be hiding there.

401
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,390
I can't do this.

402
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:38,536
Drama queen.

403
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,730
Descending colon's clean.

404
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,834
Moving into the sigmoid...

405
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,346
We sure could use a little
more help around here.

406
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,144
She's doing what
she believes in.

407
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,617
Yeah, if she was acting on principle,
she'd be in here trying to stop us.

408
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,847
All she's doing is running
away from the principle,

409
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,117
so she won't have to feel
uncomfortable facing it.

410
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,401
And if you were
acting on principle,

411
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:02,918
you would have called the cops when
you thought House was killing the guy.

412
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,157
We better hurry up. Why?

413
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:10,035
'Cause I don't think she's gonna have
a problem deciding what to tell Cuddy.

414
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,529
02 sats, 89 and dropping.

415
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,577
I thought you were
only supposed to put on

416
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,344
a pound a week during
your last trimester.

417
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,941
I'm not pregnant.

418
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,647
I heard about your little
stunt with Dr. Powell.

419
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:32,088
Not really a stunt. More of
a trick. A ruse, a hoodwink.

420
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,625
A lie. Okay.

421
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:36,185
Lying is sometimes good, right?

422
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,823
Like when you're trying to teach someone
a lesson about humility or something.

423
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,732
All I'm trying to do is save his
life. He's not gonna learn anything.

424
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,279
I just thought the same
principle might apply.

425
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:45,532
It does.

426
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,829
I could have just let him die.

427
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,068
We're not gonna get
sued for keeping him alive.

428
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:53,078
We could. I completely
disregarded his wishes.

429
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:56,445
Do you want me to disagree with
you? You want me to yell at you?

430
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,539
It is comforting.

431
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,018
We're doctors. We treat
patients, we don't kill them.

432
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,455
How right you are, Dr. Cuddy!

433
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:06,686
We also don't pad our bills,
swipe samples from the pharmacy,

434
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,694
or fantasize about the teenage
daughters of our patients, either.

435
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,822
True. It better be
true, and you're a pig.

436
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,292
I'm sorry about your leg.

437
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:21,066
Yeah. We really should spend
some time talking about that.

438
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,934
The IVIG made him worse.

439
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,806
02 sats plummeted.

440
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,436
So we know it's not lupus.

441
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,837
What else could it be?

442
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,247
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

443
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,411
We're gonna need an
open lung biopsy to confirm.

444
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:37,485
So now we're gonna
operate on the guy?

445
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:41,721
Well, unless you've invented a new
way of doing an open lung biopsy.

446
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,928
When you searched
Dr. Powell's office,

447
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:51,061
did you find a copy of the January
1967 <i>Massachusetts Medical Journal?</i>

448
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,160
Why?

449
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,263
I just figured if you're
not doing any work,

450
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,570
you might like something
to pass the time.

451
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,668
The centerfold's a killer.

452
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,185
How's your leg?

453
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,660
It hurts. And it's
gonna keep on hurting.

454
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:17,923
You gonna keep on asking?

455
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,760
How's Ezra Powell?

456
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,499
Resting comfortably.

457
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,832
That's not what Cameron says.

458
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,997
I hate practicing
medicine in high school.

459
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,702
He's not asking you to help him
kill himself. He's just asking for help.

460
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,244
The disease will kill him.

461
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,678
I know what he was
asking for. I just said, "No."

462
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,181
You've done it
before, plenty of times.

463
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,808
To patients that I
knew were terminal.

464
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,113
Oh, give me a break.

465
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,450
This has nothing to
do with saving a life.

466
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,098
You just can't bear the
thought of a patient dying

467
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,114
before you've been
able to figure out why.

468
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,355
If we're gonna keep refusing to
cure patients just to rein in my ego,

469
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,973
then we might start having a
little problem in patient recruitment.

470
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:55,297
Worried about meeting your
one-patient-a-week quota?

471
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,369
I'm a cripple, remember?
Accommodations must be made.

472
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,339
Wedge of left lobe
isolated, and removed.

473
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,714
Clamp.

474
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,154
Why'd you have me
look up that article?

475
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,489
Did you find it interesting?

476
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,962
He injected newborn
babies with radioactive agents

477
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,692
just to see if they
had urethral reflux.

478
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,858
He was curious.

479
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,402
He didn't even tell their parents
he was doing an experiment.

480
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,404
He wasn't doing anything
his peers weren't doing.

481
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,666
His peers at Tuskegee
and Willowbrook?

482
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,335
He ignored the rights
of a few to save many.

483
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,241
So you're okay with what he did?

484
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,303
It doesn't matter what I think.

485
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,474
It's what you think
that's relevant.

486
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:47,976
Because if I think less
of him, I'll help you more?

487
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,790
You're wrong.

488
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:55,120
The fact that a patient did bad
things doesn't change anything.

489
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:58,027
He still deserves to have
some control over his own body.

490
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,565
If he had any control over
his own body, he'd be dead.

491
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,000
Some control. We can withhold
treatment without killing him.

492
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,197
No, you can't!

493
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:10,766
You either help him live or you help
him die. You can't have it both ways.

494
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:17,543
Well, I guess it's not IPF.

495
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,680
Maybe he'll die right now,
make everything easy for all of us.

496
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,953
Heart rate's fast. BP's low.

497
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,268
No breath sounds on the right
side. He's dropped his right lung.

498
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,772
Air's building up in his
chest, compressing his heart.

499
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,145
Heart rate's decreasing.

500
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,948
BP's stabilizing.

501
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,970
What are you doing?

502
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:26,544
He withdraws from pain stimuli
on the left side but not the right.

503
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,246
Those are just reflex arcs.

504
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,515
He's under anesthesia.

505
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,148
Or he's lost sensation
in some places.

506
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,194
Or the hypoxia from the
arrest stunned his CNS.

507
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,729
Only one way to tell. Do
somatosensory evoked potentials.

508
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:40,425
We can't do that
while he's in a coma.

509
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:43,895
Only two ways to tell. Get a hammer
and check his deep tendon reflexes.

510
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:47,269
It won't work. He needs muscle
relaxants to be on the ventilator.

511
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,035
Only one more way to
tell. Pupillary reflexes.

512
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,475
All that tests is the brain
stem. See, I was right.

513
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:55,275
Only one way to tell. Do
somatosensory evoked potentials.

514
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,407
I just said, we can't do
that while he's in a coma.

515
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,007
So wake him up.

516
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,129
Don't go towards the light.

517
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,935
You'll fall and break your hip.

518
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,160
What's happening? I...

519
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,100
You took a little nap.

520
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,902
I thought I told
you I didn't want...

521
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,136
Sorry. A little deaf in one ear.

522
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,636
Your bone marrow
is hypocellular.

523
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,910
We've ruled out lupus
and pulmonary fibrosis.

524
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:07,178
But it looks like it could
be attacking your nerves.

525
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:11,155
So this is all a
waste? A huge failure?

526
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:16,421
Impossible. You're
Gregory House.

527
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,962
We need to attach some
sensors to your skin.

528
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,030
No.

529
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,794
Look, we can't do what you want.

530
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,699
We've assigned a nurse to
watch you, so you can't do it either.

531
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,514
So you might as well
just let us do the test.

532
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,370
No. I want to be discharged.

533
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,170
You can't be discharged.
You've got two chest tubes in.

534
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,575
Then take them out!

535
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,374
Oh, get over yourself.

536
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,347
The ventilator puffed up your
lungs. You'll be fine for a few hours.

537
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,441
Just let us run the tests.

538
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,213
Okay.

539
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:47,486
But first, let's
clean you up a little.

540
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,297
What... Does that feel nice?

541
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,424
What are you trying to
prove? Just cleaning him up.

542
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,400
What does it look like?

543
00:33:57,302 --> 00:34:00,363
Pay no attention to the
man behind the curtain.

544
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:04,804
Get out!

545
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,108
Okay, I'm going already.
Can't you see I'm a cripple?

546
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,479
Okay, so you've got me curious.

547
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,611
I was right.

548
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:17,178
Whatever is attacking his
lungs is attacking his nerves.

549
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,033
And you got that by
splashing ice water on him?

550
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,754
No sensation in the left
leg, abdomen, right arm.

551
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,192
Technology's overrated.

552
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,025
That means the clean
MRI of his brain means

553
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,641
it's just affecting the
peripheral nerves.

554
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:27,724
And bone marrow.

555
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,477
Kawasaki's would
explain the kidney failure.

556
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,595
So would lymphoma.
So would sarcoidosis.

557
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,765
All potentially treatable.
The question is which?

558
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,775
We need to catch the
little bastards in the act.

559
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,037
What's the largest organ?

560
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,341
Skin. We need to get a piece.

561
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:45,117
Sure. We'll just wait until he
leaves his room without his skin,

562
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,209
sneak in and take a piece.

563
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,179
I want you to get a
skin sample for a biopsy.

564
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,389
And I want to get a foot
massage from Johnny Damon.

565
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:57,452
Kawasaki's disease, lymphoma,
and sarcoidosis are all treatable.

566
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,999
And it could be a hundred other things
that aren't treatable. You have no idea.

567
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:02,466
But you do.

568
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,599
You know everything.
I didn't say that I...

569
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,001
Exactly!

570
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,406
You can't decide if we're
helping or hurting him.

571
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:13,935
If it's good or bad, or if you want
paper, plastic, or a burlap sack.

572
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,375
Do your damn job.

573
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,710
I'm not gonna lie to him.

574
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:29,817
Fine. Tell the truth. Just
get me a pound of flesh.

575
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:38,995
What do you want?

576
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,268
House wants to biopsy your
skin. He sent me to get it.

577
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,399
And you agreed?

578
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:47,207
I had nothing to do with putting you in
a coma or any of the subsequent tests.

579
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,042
Which brings us to now.

580
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,742
I read some of your articles.

581
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,308
There were a lot of them.

582
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:58,121
1967 <i>Massachusetts
Medical Journal.</i>

583
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,289
You radiated babies, just like that.
No forms, no questions, nothing.

584
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,921
Who knows how many
cancers you caused?

585
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,465
I don't know.

586
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,398
But what I do know is, we
discovered techniques that

587
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:14,997
prevent fatal kidney failures in
hundreds of thousands of other kids.

588
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,534
You're not sorry.

589
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,577
I don't regret what I did.

590
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:23,513
Informed consent, patient
rights... Holds back research.

591
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,412
What the hell are you doing?

592
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,549
Informed consent is
holding back our diagnosis.

593
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,860
Good for you.

594
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:42,195
Finally standing up for something.
Acting on what you believe.

595
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,942
Dr. House? Hi. How are you?

596
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,178
Not as good as you think I am.

597
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,623
Don't worry, I'm not stalking
you. My dad just lost his medicine.

598
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,458
I needed to come back
for another prescription.

599
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:58,882
Yeah, right.

600
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:00,743
He's moving it on
the street, isn't he?

601
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,618
Yeah, my dad, the meth kingpin.

602
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,689
Why haven't you
returned any of my calls?

603
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:13,064
I plan to in a couple of years.

604
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,027
I was just calling to say thank you
and to tell you how impressed I was.

605
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:19,833
You diagnosed my dad
by just looking at him.

606
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,805
I felt his glands, too.

607
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,670
Well, there's my
dad. I've got to go.

608
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,339
Yeah, me, too.

609
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:32,282
And, you really don't have to wait
a couple of years to return my calls.

610
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:35,043
Just six months, till I turn 18.

611
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,293
It's not Kawasaki's
either. What next?

612
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,596
Congo red.

613
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:51,961
Amyloidosis?

614
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,232
What the hell else would
I mean by Congo red?

615
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,305
It's not on the list.

616
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,784
There's no reason
for it to be on the list.

617
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:00,040
An abnormal protein is building
up inside the cells of his body,

618
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,922
shutting down his organs one
by one. It explains everything.

619
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,110
The infiltrates on the x-ray,
the bone marrow, kidney failure.

620
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:08,642
We rejected amyloidosis because it
didn't fit the first symptom we found.

621
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,052
It would affect
his heart. It did.

622
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,282
It wasn't on the stress test.

623
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,153
We didn't push him hard enough.

624
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,625
Add the stain
and let's find out.

625
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,788
Congo red added.

626
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:22,524
Change the polarization
of the light already.

627
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,610
That means it
should be treatable.

628
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,488
How the hell did
you pull that out of...

629
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,743
Not out of mine. I had a muse.

630
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:43,952
Oh, God. Protein type AA.

631
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,067
Dr. House...

632
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,575
You have amyloidosis.

633
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,943
It's in your lungs, kidneys,
bone marrow and brain.

634
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,111
Why should I believe you now?

635
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:21,490
If I was lying, I wouldn't
tell you the sub-type is AA.

636
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,896
It's terminal.

637
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,996
Congratulations.

638
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,233
You got your answer.

639
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:09,260
Ezra Powell passed
away last night.

640
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,530
I'm sure you already
knew about that.

641
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,802
No, I just got in.

642
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:18,065
The nurse charted at 2:00 a.m. He
was stable, breathing labored but regular.

643
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,670
Then, at 2:30, he suddenly stopped.
You know anything about that?

644
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,682
If I did, would you
really want to know?

645
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,284
I'm proud of you.
