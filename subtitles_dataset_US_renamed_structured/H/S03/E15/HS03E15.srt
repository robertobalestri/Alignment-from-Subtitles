1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,299
I can't do this button.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,068
You almost got it.

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,507
Almost got it.

4
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,214
The sound

5
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,713
of the people talking...

6
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,049
Mmm?

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,821
It's A-flat. Is it?

8
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,363
Well, look how
smart you are, huh?

9
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,157
Here we go.

10
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,564
Here we go.

11
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,251
Thank you. I am
proud to introduce

12
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:54,288
my son to you, Patrick Obyedkov.

13
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,586
Twenty-five years ago,
Patrick was in the fourth grade,

14
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:01,595
a good student,
played Little League

15
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:04,564
and then there was the accident.

16
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,894
And here we are,

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,060
raising money for people with
similar neurological disabilities.

18
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,636
I hope you enjoy the concert.

19
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,382
You all set?

20
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,919
All set.

21
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,217
He's never missed a note.

22
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,128
Something's wrong.

23
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,301
Patrick, what is it?

24
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,537
My hand, it hurts.

25
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,904
Let me see it.

26
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,184
Oh, Papa.

27
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,963
What's the emergency?

28
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,631
Thirty-five-year-old savant.

29
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,265
Dystonia in his left hand.

30
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,071
He paged us at 5:00
in the morning for that?

31
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,510
I'm going back to bed.
Dystonia's not life threatening.

32
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,944
Clonazepam will take care of it.

33
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,279
He's already on clonazepam
for seizures he has

34
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,978
from a bus accident
when he was 10.

35
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,953
Then we treat with benztropine.

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,249
What's up?

37
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,880
Thirty-five-year-old
savant. Dystonia.

38
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,093
I'm going back to bed.

39
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,160
Where you going?

40
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,220
Bathroom. It can wait.

41
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,890
There is no case, House.

42
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,958
Even if dystonia was some big
medical mystery, it's not this time.

43
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,800
You're not intrigued as to how a
perfectly healthy 10-year-old boy

44
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,033
with no prior musical
training gets into an accident

45
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,372
on his way to school and
can suddenly play the piano?

46
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,880
Do we have to solve a
25-year-old case before breakfast?

47
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,005
You two shower together?

48
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,105
No. No.

49
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,582
Double negative. That's a yes.

50
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,127
Savantism is just
one of those things.

51
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,551
It's inexplicable.

52
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,748
Just because it's inexplicted
doesn't mean it's inexplicable.

53
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,588
I want new labs, CBC
with platelets, chem panel,

54
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,651
thyroid and adrenal
function tests.

55
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,821
For what?

56
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,124
I don't know.

57
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,602
Raise your left hand.

58
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,098
That's your right hand.

59
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,507
What are you looking for?

60
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,773
Just want to make sure whatever
happened doesn't happen again.

61
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,404
Push up. Push up.

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,382
He repeats what people say.
It's a compensation mechanism.

63
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,384
He knows he's supposed
to say something

64
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,317
so he repeats
what he's just heard.

65
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,287
Well, that's good.
Shows he's engaged.

66
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,187
Spine's okay.

67
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,249
All right, stick out
your tongue like this.

68
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,988
Copy me.

69
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,820
You have a big tongue.

70
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:26,333
Hey, I know it's
funny but copy me.

71
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,533
There was construction
on Radcliffe.

72
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,635
So I had to get out of the car

73
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,078
and walk in high
heels for over a mile.

74
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,810
Radcliffe? What
was the cross street?

75
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,146
Does it matter?

76
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,686
I don't know. I'm not the
one who brought it up.

77
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,917
Tie this off. Nice and tight.

78
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,092
Does this have anything
to do with my foot?

79
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,598
You have a blister.

80
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,032
You don't waste a
doctor's time with a blister.

81
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,866
You waste a doctor's time
with more important things,

82
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,497
like the sewer that's being
vented out of your mouth.

83
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,201
My breath?

84
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,275
If you could stop doing
that, we'd all be grateful.

85
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,835
I can't stop breathing.

86
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,403
Nope. But you can stop puking.

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,641
I don't.

88
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,942
Your lips say, "No."

89
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,576
Your gnarly fingers say...

90
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,748
He's good to go.

91
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,286
It's a shame. You
look cute that thin.

92
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,927
Motor cortex looks good.
Everything checks out.

93
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,125
What tests did you run?

94
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,277
Full battery of neurological...

95
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:38,102
I need this blood checked for
cholesterol and glucose levels.

96
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,870
Patient had a foot problem.

97
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,203
Different patient.

98
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,140
There was no one else in there.

99
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,236
You're using the
wrong equipment.

100
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,290
Dr. Foreman, I thought
we were being discharged.

101
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,486
I'm Dr. House,

102
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,553
and on the off chance that
Dr. Foreman didn't mention it,

103
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,065
I have something of a gift, too.

104
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,532
Come on.

105
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,116
Your turn. My turn.

106
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:41,358
Does this have anything
to do with his hand?

107
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,729
It might.

108
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,862
Okay, Patrick. Close your eyes.

109
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,933
What's this?

110
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,966
D, G-flat, A-flat, B.

111
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,477
Yeah. All right, all right.

112
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,843
He's good. Can we let him go?

113
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,506
He's great. He's staying.

114
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,078
Call radiology.

115
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,349
We need a functional
MRI on his brain.

116
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,755
FMRI's not gonna show trauma.

117
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,851
We're not looking for trauma.

118
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,054
I want to see the music.

119
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,464
See the music.

120
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,299
Well, that's dull.

121
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,705
You think the FMRI's
gonna show a big arrow

122
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,744
pointing to a flashing
sign saying "savantism"?

123
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,278
It would be hugely helpful.

124
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,315
Somehow he got rewired
as a music specialist.

125
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,408
I want to know how that happens.

126
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,318
He has access to parts
of the brain that you don't.

127
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,117
His brain's doing nothing.

128
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,019
He looks like
any jerk listening.

129
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,652
He's not a savant at listening,
he's a savant at playing.

130
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,229
Well, listening and playing are

131
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,492
two different
neurological processes.

132
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,501
Turn off the music.

133
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,498
<i>Patrick, I want you to
pretend that your leg's a piano.</i>

134
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,100
<i>My leg's not a piano.</i>

135
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,040
<i>I know. That's why
I said "pretend."</i>

136
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,213
Kid's a moron.

137
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,215
<i>Keep your head
still. Use your fingers.</i>

138
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,400
Wow.

139
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,602
Cool, huh?

140
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,973
His heart rate rose.

141
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,206
Emotional response?

142
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,579
Then why's there no
activity in the limbic system?

143
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,481
Unless there's a
problem with his heart.

144
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,349
Do an echo to confirm.

145
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,150
And scrub up. He's
gonna need surgery.

146
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,982
It wasn't dystonia.

147
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,259
He's got a heart
condition that caused

148
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,126
the arteries in his
arm to constrict.

149
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,395
Do you have any idea why
House would want to go to Boston?

150
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,628
The chowder?

151
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,932
Plane tickets this Friday.

152
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,266
I opened his mail.

153
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,035
I heard there's an opening
at Harvard for Division Chief,

154
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,373
Infectious Disease.

155
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,776
Ambition is not one of
his more prominent traits.

156
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,007
Although...

157
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,515
What?

158
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,814
He was testing
blood in the clinic.

159
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,217
I don't think it was
a patient's blood.

160
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,184
Why? It was green?

161
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,053
No, he was checking
for routine stuff.

162
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,185
Makes sense if he's looking for

163
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,559
basic medical clearance
for employment.

164
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,034
I'm going home.

165
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,131
No, you're not.

166
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,037
He could show up any minute.

167
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,769
Not with a savant
to obsess about.

168
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,620
I'll take in here.
Bedroom's down the hall.

169
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,245
You've been here?

170
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,014
Where else would the bedroom be?

171
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,984
Come with?

172
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,039
You're scared of him catching
us breaking into his home

173
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,363
but you're not scared of him
catching us doing it in his bed?

174
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,398
If I'm gonna get fired anyway...

175
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:18,612
Almost at the heart.
Ablating and done.

176
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,210
Heart rate's 160.
It's accelerating.

177
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,580
He's at 210!

178
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,141
He's in supraventricular
tachycardia.

179
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,686
Paddles!

180
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,085
Charging.

181
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,286
Clear!

182
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,326
We're wasting our time.

183
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,722
His high-school yearbook.

184
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,106
Unless you think
he's going to Boston

185
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,374
to attend a high-school reunion,

186
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,276
put it back and let's get out of
here before he comes home.

187
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,700
He's not smiling.

188
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,598
I wonder if he has teeth.

189
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,002
What's the area code for Boston?

190
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,664
617, why?

191
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,081
<i>Massachusetts
General. May I help you?</i>

192
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,880
Did you think you could
steal Dr. House without a fight?

193
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,095
<i>Steal him for what?</i>

194
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,997
Quit jerking me around. I
know he's coming out there.

195
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,421
<i>We're not looking to hire him.</i>

196
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,219
He's called you six
times in the last month.

197
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,623
<i>We're not looking to hire him.</i>

198
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,871
You think if you keep repeating
it, I'll start believing you?

199
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,659
<i>Dr. Cuddy, there's
nothing else I can say.</i>

200
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,426
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

201
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,361
If he's not coming
there for a job interview,

202
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,961
he's either coming
to your hospital

203
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,597
for a social visit or
because he's a patient.

204
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,069
Is it a social visit, Dr. Medak?

205
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,109
<i>I can't stand House.</i>

206
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,081
<i>Neither can Dr. Coopersmith.</i>

207
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,192
What's up?

208
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,729
Do you know a
Dr. Coopersmith in Boston?

209
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:48,097
Yeah. He's an oncologist.

210
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,195
What's up?

211
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,738
What's his subspecialty?

212
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,397
Brain cancer.

213
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,301
What's going on?

214
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,806
He doesn't look sick.

215
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,351
He should have symptoms.

216
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:10,118
Blurred vision, headaches,
confusion, clumsiness.

217
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,088
Depends how far
along the cancer is.

218
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,922
What kind, how aggressive.

219
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,757
He didn't tell you?

220
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,960
House is House.

221
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,365
He's no different than
anyone else with cancer.

222
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:25,132
Once you tell, then every
conversation is about that.

223
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,817
Cardiac arrest
means we were wrong.

224
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,332
There was a heart problem.

225
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,844
But no vasoconstriction.

226
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,813
The heart problem couldn't
have caused the hand problem.

227
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,373
Unless the bleed
happened suddenly.

228
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,810
Less blood to the brain
explains the dystonia.

229
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,830
Less blood to the heart
explains the heart attack.

230
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,379
Scope him above and below.

231
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,357
If that doesn't work, gut him.

232
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,886
Can't you sedate him?

233
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,055
There's a risk his
throat could collapse.

234
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,599
You look mad, Papa.

235
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,201
No.

236
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,497
No, I'm not mad. I promise you.

237
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,063
It's just that the doctor has to
do something to you and it's...

238
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,506
And it's gonna hurt.

239
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,100
Hurt me? Why hurt me?

240
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,768
Make you better.

241
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,677
What's wrong with me?

242
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,947
Well, they don't know.

243
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,079
Patrick, don't you worry.

244
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,712
Everything is gonna be great.

245
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,120
All right. Here we go, Patrick.

246
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,419
You wanna hurt me.

247
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,585
Hey, open. Like this.

248
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,823
You just look at me and
everything is gonna be okay.

249
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,059
Look at me now.

250
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,929
Patrick.

251
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,406
There you are. It's
okay. It's okay, really.

252
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,912
Dr. Wilson. Wilson!

253
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:41,947
I just spoke to Cuddy.

254
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,380
She can't confirm whether House

255
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,747
is applying for a job in Boston.

256
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,547
Yeah. I'm late for a...

257
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,987
If I have to look for work,
I have a right to know.

258
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,600
Pretty.

259
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,401
I wrote this when I was
in junior high school.

260
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,840
Could never figure
out what came next.

261
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,949
Then dimwit came up with this.

262
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,721
It's good.

263
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,656
It's perfect.

264
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,566
I could set up a tower on the
roof during a lightning storm.

265
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,364
Help you switch
brains with your patient.

266
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,231
Then you would be
the brilliant pianist

267
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,764
and he would be the doctor
hiding brain cancer from his friend.

268
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,945
It's nothing.

269
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,344
You need to talk about it.

270
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,541
You need to talk about it.

271
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,255
At least let me look
at your medical file.

272
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,650
You're making a big
deal out of nothing.

273
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,914
Who else knows?

274
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,615
No one, and
cancer isn't nothing.

275
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,851
Sorry. Didn't mean to
offend your specialty.

276
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,257
Why didn't you come to me?

277
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,521
Stein's good.

278
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,756
Stein's in Africa for
the next six months.

279
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,389
He's given me at
least six months.

280
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,230
I go to Boston. I
get the treatment.

281
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,860
Everything will be fine.

282
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,666
No need to talk about it.

283
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,462
You were right.

284
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,235
Surgeon found a
bleed behind the kidney

285
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,801
in the retroperitoneal
cavity, but no reason for it.

286
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,370
No cancer, no ruptured arteries.

287
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,609
So bleeding explains
the symptoms

288
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,312
but we've got no
explanation for the bleeding.

289
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,952
And while they
were closing him up,

290
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,298
Patrick had a grand mal seizure,

291
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,756
which makes no sense,

292
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,315
since he's on an
anticonvulsant medication.

293
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,423
You told him.

294
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,862
No, I didn't.

295
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,130
I only told Cameron.

296
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,473
Hey!

297
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,508
Okay, you guys have cleverly
deduced that I have cancer.

298
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,915
You have no right to know.

299
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,145
You have no business knowing.

300
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,586
We'd like to run
some blood tests.

301
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,089
As soon as you work up
our patient, who is not me.

302
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,156
We just want to make sure
you weren't misdiagnosed.

303
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,887
I wasn't. Let's move on.

304
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,792
We're just asking
for a couple of vials.

305
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,387
No! Why not?

306
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,696
Okay, we are going to proceed
as if I am perfectly healthy.

307
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,668
How can we do that
if we know you're not?

308
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,796
You don't know anything!

309
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,362
Except, hopefully,

310
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,103
how a patient on anticonvulsant
medication has a seizure.

311
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,754
Anti-seizure meds
don't prevent seizures.

312
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,178
They just make them manageable.

313
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,557
According to the
surgeon's report,

314
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,181
this one wasn't even
close to manageable.

315
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,549
Means the question isn't,
"Why is he having seizures?"

316
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,144
It's, "Why are his
seizures getting worse?"

317
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,553
What's changed?

318
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,682
His brain. It's gotten worse.

319
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,954
So we make it even worser.

320
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,289
We take him off
anticonvulsant medication.

321
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,540
He'll seize even more.

322
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,658
Multiple seizures can
seriously damage a brain.

323
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,291
Dude can't button a shirt.

324
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,145
How much more damage
are we really talking about?

325
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,347
Stronger seizures will light
up different parts of the brain,

326
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,169
which will indicate
which parts are damaged.

327
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,732
Once he gets worse,
do a PET scan.

328
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,909
PET scan done?

329
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,511
No.

330
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,682
Did you come for my feelings?

331
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,782
'Cause I left them
in my other pants.

332
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,520
This is a letter of
recommendation.

333
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,586
I'm applying for a job at Penn.

334
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,130
Thank you for writing your own.

335
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,194
I'm sure my thoughts
are beautifully phrased.

336
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:29,333
Thank you for signing it, saves
me having to fake your signature.

337
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,781
Stay away from Weiss.

338
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,784
He cries with his patients,
holds their hands as they die.

339
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,519
He won't like you.

340
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,626
Your newfound nonchalance
in the face of cancer.

341
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,164
I thought you'd
find it appealing.

342
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,727
20 seconds. Pretty good.

343
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,102
For what?

344
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,700
The time it took you to go
from hard-ass to human being.

345
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,212
You really want to leave?

346
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,115
If you're not here, there's
not much point in staying.

347
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,119
I'm not dead yet.

348
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,124
What are you doing?

349
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,666
I know this must
be a turn-on for you.

350
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,370
A little whorish
to kiss and stab.

351
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,936
You kissed back.

352
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,570
I didn't want you to die
without knowing the feeling.

353
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,115
Actually, no woman should
die without knowing the feeling.

354
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,344
All we need is a few
drops of your blood.

355
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,579
Foreman and Chase's lips
are not gonna get so close,

356
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,144
now that I know your plan.

357
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,247
There's a nurse downstairs
about to risk his job

358
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,934
to steal the blood you drew
from yourself yesterday.

359
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,427
I'm patient number 020406,

360
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:31,328
in the record room, under
the name Luke N. Laura.

361
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,923
There's a whole vial of blood
in there along with CT scans,

362
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,696
MRIs, CSF. Everything you need.

363
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,933
If you need a sperm sample,
come back without the needle.

364
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,754
Six centimeter mass
in his dorsal midbrain,

365
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,221
extending into
the temporal lobe.

366
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,752
That's inoperable.

367
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,827
What kind of time does he have?

368
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,991
He's got a year.

369
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,169
Nurse! Nurse!

370
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,108
Here's the consent from
Boston for the cancer drug trial.

371
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,513
Any description of the
process or previous trials?

372
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,483
Yep. Any chance it'll work?

373
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,417
No. It's not even
designed to work.

374
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,920
Why would he...

375
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:32,049
It's designed to treat depression
in terminal cancer patients.

376
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,319
He doesn't seem depressed.

377
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,460
Okay, let's assume
that I am dying,

378
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,363
which I specifically
told you not to assume.

379
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,495
Can we at least assume
that I'm not dying tomorrow?

380
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:46,664
Whereas this kid...

381
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:50,267
PET revealed several more
hot spots but they're non-specific.

382
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,243
How can you focus on him?

383
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,279
It's the only way I can cope.

384
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,211
PET also showed a left
brain that's working hard.

385
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:58,410
Harder than the right?

386
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,077
Wouldn't be worth
mentioning otherwise.

387
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,417
Bleeding in the brain,
blood would irritate the lining,

388
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,514
might cause the
seizures to get worse.

389
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,049
Yes, he needs an angiogram to
look at the vasculature inside his brain.

390
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:11,564
We'll get right on it as
soon as we're finished here.

391
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:15,330
Don't get up. I got it.
You're busy. Continue.

392
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,000
You know what my
team is doing right now?

393
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,603
No.

394
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,913
They're trying to figure
out what's wrong with me.

395
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,041
What's wrong with you?

396
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,482
Thanks for asking.

397
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,082
They've found
out that I'm dying.

398
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,747
That's sad.

399
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,355
Everyone's dying.

400
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,688
That's sad.

401
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,354
If a meteor lands on my head
tomorrow, it's all academic.

402
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:46,399
I told them to leave
me alone. But did they?

403
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,694
Did they?

404
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,359
That one was rhetorical.

405
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,698
Oh.

406
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:52,999
No, they did not.

407
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,378
Who the hell were you
before you hit your head?

408
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,107
Hell is a bad word.

409
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:02,681
So is "ass" and "bitch."

410
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,876
I could probably
rattle off 50 much more

411
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,782
complicated and disgusting ones,

412
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,253
but then your dad
would get pissed at me.

413
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,788
You like your life?

414
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,725
What life?

415
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,022
Your life.

416
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:20,799
Playing the piano, going on
tour, scoring girls left and right.

417
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,625
I don't like girls.

418
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,897
Boys. Whatever gets you off.

419
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,632
I like the piano.

420
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,011
What's wrong?

421
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:38,415
Dr. Peter Hayes. This is Eric
Foreman, at Princeton-Plainsboro.

422
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:41,249
You're doing a signal
transduction inhibitor clinical trial.

423
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,050
What kind of results
have you been...

424
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,058
Transduction inhibitors
are a decade away.

425
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,091
Bye, Pete.

426
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,098
They've got another
trial going at Duke.

427
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,296
15 percent extend their
lives beyond five years.

428
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,681
If you're positive
for protein PHF...

429
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:02,334
Stop trying to save me.

430
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,400
I'm fine.

431
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,173
MRA confirmed small
collections of blood

432
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,613
throughout the white matter
of Patrick's right hemisphere.

433
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,326
Mind if we chat about
that for a few moments?

434
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,082
Either trauma, an aneurysm,
cancer or autoimmune disease.

435
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,834
We need a biopsy to
figure out which it is.

436
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,482
His EEG was non-specific.

437
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:19,597
Where you going to biopsy?

438
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,558
Everywhere.

439
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,790
Sure, just put on a blindfold and
play "Pin the Tail on the Brain."

440
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,593
He's bleeding into
his brain. He's dying.

441
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,260
You can't just randomly
stab the temporal lobe

442
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:30,735
and hope you hit the right spot.

443
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,323
I'm only gonna
take little tiny pieces.

444
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:33,464
Till what?

445
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,632
Till I find the problem.

446
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:35,731
Or you kill him.

447
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,300
No, I'll keep going,
even if I kill him.

448
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:45,245
Then he's screwed.
Thanks for the chat.

449
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:59,422
What if we do the EEG
from inside his brain?

450
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,125
I'm actually a little insulted.

451
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,654
You were supposed to spend
the last hour worrying about me.

452
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,966
It's risky and invasive.

453
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,030
But that's why God invented
the long consent form.

454
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,905
Can you get to why
this is a brilliant idea?

455
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,001
External EEG could get confused

456
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,204
if there are multiple
structural abnormalities.

457
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,010
If we perform the
EEG inside the skull,

458
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,642
it could show us
where to biopsy.

459
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,846
Brilliant. Go. Do.

460
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,047
I'd also like to
talk to you about...

461
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,491
This is going to
be personal, isn't it?

462
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,822
Yeah.

463
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,705
We'll use a small drill
to get inside his skull.

464
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,011
There's bleeding inside?

465
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:52,142
Yes. Once we have 12 holes,

466
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,118
we'll surgically
implant the electrodes

467
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,485
under the meninges,
against the brain.

468
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,886
And it's either cancer
or autoimmune disease?

469
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,059
Sorry, but yeah.

470
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,835
Which one is better?

471
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,133
Neither.

472
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,299
Hey.

473
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,498
Where do we cut?

474
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:48,632
We don't.

475
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,769
I need to say something.

476
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,878
Something personal?

477
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,005
Yeah.

478
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,606
And I can't leave

479
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,878
because you've got
something interesting in that file.

480
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,146
Sorry.

481
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:10,292
You're an arrogant ass who makes
it impossible for anyone to like him

482
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,126
by punishing people
who don't deserve...

483
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:15,099
Can you get to the
"but" part of this speech?

484
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,197
But I like you.

485
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,498
No, you don't.

486
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,369
You're just reacting to
the perception of my death

487
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,602
and the need to put things
in order. Fear of guilt...

488
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,870
Just shut up.

489
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,037
See? I annoy you.

490
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,549
Now, you gonna give me
the results or are you gonna...

491
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,982
Intracranial EEG showed
no electrical abnormalities.

492
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,785
Which means it's autoimmune. No.

493
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,157
It also showed his entire
right hemisphere is brain-dead.

494
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:53,939
So while you guys were worrying
about me, half this kid's brain died.

495
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:57,675
The only solace you should take
from this is the fact that it didn't.

496
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:00,804
Garden variety EEG sucks
compared to the in-brain variety,

497
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,357
but it's not going
to miss brain death.

498
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,282
He's gotten worse.
Not that much worse.

499
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,715
Respiration is depressed.

500
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,685
Seizures are increasing,
one every five minutes.

501
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,881
Not that much worse.

502
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,917
He can still talk
and he's left-handed,

503
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,550
which means speech
is in the right side.

504
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,993
You don't know how Patrick's
brain reorganized itself 25 years ago.

505
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:20,328
What if the right side
is just a little dead?

506
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,731
Maybe he still has
random neurons firing.

507
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,897
You're just looking for a puzzle to
distract you from your own situation.

508
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,737
You're right, he's
dead. Let's go home.

509
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,037
What did you find out?

510
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,240
Is he gonna be okay?

511
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,341
I'm sorry. Yes!

512
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,351
What's this?

513
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,824
A piano.

514
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,958
What's this?

515
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,095
He's obviously lost use...

516
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,328
Shut up.

517
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,820
Music is a global process.

518
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,381
You can't play the
piano with half a brain.

519
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,291
What's it mean?

520
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,958
Means the right side of
his brain has always sucked.

521
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:29,399
Means it's not relevant
to what's going on now.

522
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,528
Wow. Then it's autoimmune. Yeah.

523
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,333
Question is what
do we do about it?

524
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:34,703
Most likely ones we can fix.

525
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,210
Polyarteritis nodosa,
Takayasu or Sarcoid.

526
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,973
I'll start treatment.

527
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,479
Not what I was talking about.

528
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,174
But, yeah, you do that.

529
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,113
Your turn?

530
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,185
Do you have to do that?

531
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,029
You mean cheapen everyone's
attempt at a human moment

532
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,191
by identifying the real
calculations that go into it?

533
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,460
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

534
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,501
I'm sorry you're dying,
I'm gonna hug you.

535
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,238
Anything to say?

536
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,573
If you're considering
grabbing my ass,

537
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,272
don't start anything
you can't finish.

538
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,862
Well, as long as we're just
standing here, you mind if we work?

539
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,878
How's the kid's treatment going?

540
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,122
Are you crying?

541
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,352
No.

542
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,554
Respiration rate's up.

543
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,031
Seizures are calming
down. It's all good.

544
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,502
Not for what I'm gonna do next.

545
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:40,128
There is no next.
He's gonna be fine.

546
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,073
Only if he wants to remain a
four-year-old who wets his bed.

547
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,242
There's nothing else for him.

548
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,439
There's better.
Thanks for the hug.

549
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,766
It's the middle of the night.

550
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,567
You knew I'd be asleep.

551
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,935
Phone would have
woken you up just as much.

552
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,806
And I can't see what
you're wearing on the phone.

553
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:24,580
My patient with the 55 IQ
has Takayasu syndrome.

554
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,812
Very uncommon.

555
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,853
Happens mostly in Asian women.

556
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:32,683
Takayasu is manageable with
steroids, which you already know.

557
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,626
So I assume you're
here for something else.

558
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,890
My patient also has a
significant seizure problem.

559
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:40,523
Also manageable with
anticonvulsant medication.

560
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,194
Yes, and if he kept taking
his anticonvulsant medication,

561
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,897
he could go back on
tour and play the piano.

562
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:49,066
But a hemispherectomy

563
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,302
would completely stop the
right-brain seizure activity

564
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,902
and he would no
longer need to take

565
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,447
his anticonvulsant medication.

566
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,176
You want to remove
half his brain?

567
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,444
The right half.

568
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,128
It would be irresponsible
to remove the left.

569
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:02,678
You don't remove half a
brain and gain function!

570
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:07,283
Not my brain. But his?
Who knows? What?

571
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,991
Let's say that I'm the
left side of Patrick's brain.

572
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,189
I'm quick-witted, I'm
charming, I'm great looking.

573
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,994
You're the right
side of his brain.

574
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,761
You're useless, old, damaged.

575
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,268
We go to a bar for a drink.

576
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,863
Now, I have the mad skills
to be scoring all the hot babes,

577
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,704
but instead I'm spending my
time wiping drool off your chin

578
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,802
and making sure you
don't eat the tablecloth.

579
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,208
What's the father want to do?

580
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,909
I don't know.

581
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,415
So go wake him up.

582
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,460
House, I'm so sorry.

583
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,722
Forgot I was dying, huh?

584
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,493
I'm here if you need me.

585
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,426
I need you.

586
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:05,617
One small feel for man,
one giant ass for mankind.

587
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,448
Thanks.

588
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,619
Good luck in Boston.

589
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,660
Call the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

590
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,567
Dr. Foreman was just here.

591
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,734
The seizures have almost
completely gone away.

592
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:34,109
Says we might be able to go
home in the next day or two.

593
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,738
Thank you so much.

594
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:39,546
I think we should remove the
right side of your son's brain.

595
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,017
I thought you fixed him.

596
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,180
Does he look fixed?

597
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,600
The right side of his brain is
keeping him walking straight.

598
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,635
Other than that, it's been dead
weight ever since the accident.

599
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:50,993
If we remove it, the seizures
would stop completely.

600
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,758
The seizures are
hardly noticeable.

601
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,493
They don't bother Patrick.

602
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,228
But without the seizures,

603
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:59,567
the left side would have a
chance to actually function.

604
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,903
It could learn to do new things.

605
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:05,671
Only bummer, he'd
never play the piano again.

606
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:09,544
Oh, no. The piano is everything.

607
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,325
I'm not saying he's never
gonna work for NASA,

608
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,818
but flipping burgers
isn't out of the question.

609
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,445
Well, I don't mind taking care
of him so he can play the piano.

610
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,854
No, you're actually lucky.

611
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,501
You don't have to
watch your kid grow up.

612
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,993
You don't have to let go.

613
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,086
You trying to make
this about me?

614
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,496
I love my son,
just the way he is!

615
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,694
He's a monkey
grinder at the circus.

616
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,396
He's worked hard
to get where he...

617
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,028
So does the monkey.

618
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,902
The piano is a
neurological accident.

619
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,205
He has a gift.

620
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,973
I'm offering him a life.

621
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,218
It's up to you.

622
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,200
I've isolated the cancer
proteins in House's CSF.

623
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,262
About time. We can't
let him go to Boston

624
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,308
if he qualifies
for the Duke trial.

625
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,070
You want to do it?

626
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:30,284
Damn. He's negative
for protein PHF.

627
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,354
He doesn't qualify.

628
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,471
What's that? That
shouldn't be there.

629
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:15,772
Patrick?

630
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,912
Hello, Papa.

631
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,650
Patrick, I have a
question for you.

632
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,545
Yes?

633
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,850
Are you happy?

634
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,025
Are you happy?

635
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,183
House! Open up!

636
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,516
Open up! It's important!

637
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,723
I've got a flight
in three hours.

638
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,662
You don't have cancer.

639
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,867
There was an abnormal presence
of lgG and lgM, indicating...

640
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,995
I don't have neurosyphilis.
My MRI showed nothing...

641
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,216
It's a gumma in your brain. It's
very rare not to be in the liver,

642
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,266
and I'm really glad we
never slept together but...

643
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:58,833
We would have used a condom.

644
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,004
And I don't have syphilis.
My VDRL was negative...

645
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,638
We did an FTA antibody test.

646
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,945
The VDRL was a false negative.

647
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,120
You're not going to die.

648
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,178
All you need is IV antibiotics.

649
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,384
Did you send these
results to Mass General?

650
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,026
Of course.

651
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,096
You idiots.

652
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,635
We just told you
you're not gonna die!

653
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,000
You should be making
out with Cameron.

654
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,535
You knew it wasn't cancer?

655
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,302
I was sure it was cancer.

656
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,367
Then why aren't you celebrating?

657
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,844
Because it wasn't my damn file.

658
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,579
You faked cancer?

659
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,148
The real patient is in
the Witherspoon wing.

660
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,415
Feel free to tell his wife
that he's not gonna die

661
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,786
but he is cheating on her.

662
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:46,300
Why would you want
us to think that you...

663
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,587
I didn't!

664
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,094
I wanted the guys in Boston
to think that I had cancer.

665
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,756
I wanted the guys who were
gonna implant a cool drug

666
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,495
right into the pleasure center of
my brain to think that I had cancer!

667
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:59,470
You faked cancer to get high?

668
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,610
I'm going to bed.

669
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:15,282
You're right. I don't like you.

670
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,816
Sure. Now that I'm not dying.

671
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,435
Heard Patrick's
hemispherectomy went well.

672
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,705
He survived the surgery.

673
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,007
He's unconscious but...

674
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,708
How depressed are you?

675
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,249
I'm not depressed.

676
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,747
You faked cancer.

677
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,185
It was an outpatient procedure.

678
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:50,517
I was curious.

679
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,454
Are you curious about heroin?

680
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,788
Not since last year's
Christmas party.

681
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,839
I know this goes
against your nature,

682
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,207
but can we not make
too much of this?

683
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,168
You made people think
that you were going to die!

684
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,328
I didn't make them.

685
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,769
I tried to hide it,

686
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,467
but you idiots needed
to get into my business.

687
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:17,141
I'm sure I'll regret asking,
but why are you laughing?

688
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,716
It's ironic.

689
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,909
Well, I'm sure I'll
regret asking, but why...

690
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,250
Depression in cancer patients...

691
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:24,949
It's not as common as you think.

692
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,582
It's not the dying
that gets to people.

693
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:30,390
It's the dying alone. The
patients with family, with friends,

694
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,327
they tend to do okay.

695
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,496
You don't have cancer.

696
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,524
You do have people
who give a damn.

697
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,069
So what do you do?

698
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:45,938
You fake the cancer, then
push the people who care away.

699
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,471
Because they're boring.

700
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,653
Go home to your hotel
room and laugh at that irony.

701
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,983
Start small, House.
Take a chance.

702
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:04,821
Maybe something that doesn't
involve sticking stuff in your brain.

703
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,694
Pizza with a friend.

704
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,600
A movie. Something.

705
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:33,650
Follow my finger. Do
you know your name?

706
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,163
His speech center
was on the right side.

707
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,666
It'll be a while
before he's talking.

708
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,230
He hasn't really done anything

709
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:48,603
except to stare off
into the distance.

710
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,403
It'll take some time to...

711
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,518
You buttoned your shirt.

712
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,396
He looks happy.
