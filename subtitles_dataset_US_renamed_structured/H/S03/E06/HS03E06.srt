1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:05,939
So, you got a Green Beret, a Navy
SEAL and a sister from Brooklyn.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,101
The general hands each
of them a gun and says,

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,510
"Your spouse is seated
next door in a room in a chair.

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:16,107
"In order to pass this test, you
must go inside and kill them."

5
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,976
Immediately the
Green Beret says,

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,749
"No, sir, I could never kill
my wife. I just can't do it."

7
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,848
The General looks at him
and says, "You know what?

8
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,190
"You ain't got what it takes.
Take your wife and go on home."

9
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,456
Navy Seal then heads in.

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,397
Five minutes later, comes
out, tears strolling down his face.

11
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,559
"I tried, I tried, I
tried, I just can't do it,

12
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,967
"she looked so beautiful
in the chair, I can't do it."

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,868
General looks at him and
says, "You know what?

14
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,406
"You ain't got what it takes."

15
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,841
Finally, sister from Brooklyn
strolls in with a swagger.

16
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,001
Shots rang out,

17
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,789
there's banging, there's
screaming, it's going crazy!

18
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,282
Suddenly,
everything goes silent.

19
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,414
The General says, "Well,
what the hell happened inside?"

20
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,796
The sister from
Brooklyn screams back,

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,812
"The damn gun had blanks in it,

22
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,256
"so I had to beat him
to death with my bare..."

23
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,653
What the hell?

24
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,438
A little bit of warning
would have been nice!

25
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,907
The sound of a saw
cutting a hole in the wall

26
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:04,955
wasn't warning enough?

27
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,227
Bite me.

28
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,979
What, are you kidding me? Tub of
Goo there's gotta be over six bills.

29
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,890
You ain't gonna lift him
with a couple of blankets.

30
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,434
You got a better idea, Einstein?

31
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,144
Yeah, just roll him off.

32
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,829
What? He's already dead,
it ain't like he's gonna feel it.

33
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,185
How the hell's a
guy get that big?

34
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,332
You roll him off from this high,

35
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,167
he's likely to go right through
the floor and take us with him.

36
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,922
Are you ready? All
right, one, two, lift!

37
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,391
Come on, man!

38
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:38,693
Me? You're the kielbasa king.

39
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,233
It wasn't me.

40
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,733
Whoa, it wasn't me, either.

41
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,539
Don't look at me.

42
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,977
Please tell me
dead guys can fart.

43
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,124
Of course. Dead bodies
are full of all sorts of gases.

44
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,559
But a dead body can't
tighten a sphincter.

45
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,313
You need a tight
sphincter to make a fart.

46
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,796
No, you need a loose
sphincter. A tight sphincter...

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,448
You check his femoral?

48
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,355
No. He peed all over himself!

49
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,916
Look, I've heard dead
bodies moan, groan, hiss,

50
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,738
hell, I've even seen them
sit straight up on a gurney.

51
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:12,130
Trust me, his skin's cold, pupils are
fixed and dilated, he's not breathing.

52
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,929
He's got a pulse! No way.

53
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,903
All right, give me an Ambu bag
and an EKG. It's thready, but it's there.

54
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,495
Let's get him in
a basket. Ready?

55
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,632
One, two, lift!

56
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,374
Forty-six-year-old
guy in a coma.

57
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,311
Doesn't appear to be
anything wrong with him

58
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,679
except for the fact that he
weighs over 600 pounds.

59
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,149
What time does
he usually get in?

60
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,810
Any time between 8:00 and 10:00.

61
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,718
Did you say 600? At least.

62
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,552
Biggest scale we got
only goes up to 350

63
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,058
but this guy's waistline
is over seven feet.

64
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,959
Which means he's a diabetic with
blood thicker than pancake batter.

65
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,826
No mystery there,
not much we can do.

66
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,058
Blood sugar's normal.

67
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,624
Cholesterol's lower than mine, tox
screen's clean, no sign of trauma.

68
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,295
Sure there wasn't
a mix-up at the lab?

69
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,770
Three times?

70
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,239
It's almost 11:00,
where is House?

71
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,542
Hello!

72
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,784
It's 11:00.

73
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:20,317
Which means my friend is ready for
his sponge bath and I shouldn't be here!

74
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:26,292
Hey, Gomer Pyle! I
know you can hear me.

75
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,611
I think you mean Barney Fife.

76
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,640
So many great idiot
icons to choose from.

77
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,048
You need time to
think of some more?

78
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,349
Either arraign me or let me go.

79
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,719
No problem. Which do you prefer?

80
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,660
What took you so long?

81
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,899
Sorry. I didn't have 15
grand in my loose change jar.

82
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,372
What the hell did
you do? Nothing.

83
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,807
Your motorcycle was impounded,
that explains the speeding, DUI,

84
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,345
and driving without a license.

85
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,974
The fact that you're you explains
the illegal possession of narcotics

86
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,847
and resisting arrest.

87
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,286
Where's your car?

88
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,447
What happened?

89
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,515
Some idiot cop with
crotch rot obviously thought

90
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,337
that I didn't treat him with the
deference due to a man of his stature.

91
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,989
He trumped up a traffic stop,

92
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,554
next thing I know
I'm sharing a cage

93
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,031
with a guy who
thinks that showers

94
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,500
are the way the
devil gets inside you.

95
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,696
Does Cuddy know?

96
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,739
Everything she needs to.

97
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,208
I'm innocent.
Till proven guilty.

98
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,109
Guy wanted to punish
me, he did it. It's over.

99
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,298
Gotta get yourself a lawyer.

100
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,346
Already got one.

101
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,179
You know what they say about the
lawyer who has himself as a client?

102
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,651
Same thing they say about
the doctor who lends 15 grand

103
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,052
to a friend he knows
can't pay him back.

104
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,455
Relax, you'll get it. Where
am I gonna take off to?

105
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,362
Does Salma Hayek
live in Mexico or Spain?

106
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,296
There's nothing abnormal in
the EEG or the neurological exam.

107
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,397
I'm guessing it's food-related.

108
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,873
Improperly prepared puffer fish

109
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,461
can have toxins that
could cause a coma

110
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,172
and might not show
up on the tox screen.

111
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,706
Where do you think he is?

112
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,248
He's probably at the track.

113
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,460
If he's at the track he'd tell us
so we don't have to page him,

114
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,063
and if it was a puffer fish, he'd
be dead in six to eight hours, tops.

115
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,555
He's been in a coma at least 24.

116
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,558
And the guy didn't get to 600
pounds eating a load of sushi.

117
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,253
What if he was in a
motorcycle accident?

118
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,989
Explains the coma. But
how'd he get back in bed?

119
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,531
Oh, Cameron's
talking about House!

120
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,793
You ever see how he drives?

121
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,890
No, we haven't.

122
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,079
But I have seen how many
pills he's been popping lately,

123
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,629
I wouldn't be surprised if he's
in a coma somewhere himself.

124
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,731
If I am, this is one
lame hallucination.

125
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
What happened to you?

126
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,243
If you ever end up in a bar with the
Cambridge Women's Heavyweight Eight,

127
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:55,180
do not accept an offer of an
upside-down kamikaze shot.

128
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,978
We have a case. Fat
guy in a coma, I know.

129
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,143
Cuddy found you? Nope.

130
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,743
But the wall between
Wilson's office

131
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,397
and this one is
thinner than you'd think.

132
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,565
Which means we
need to stop talking

133
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,217
about what a
pathetic loser he is.

134
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,760
Start treating Jabba for
pickwickian syndrome.

135
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,888
His 96 double-Zs are probably putting
pressure on his chest, suffocating him.

136
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,728
CO2 and oxygen sats are normal.

137
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,359
For you and me. What's
normal for a hippopotamus?

138
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,795
And get a detailed
medical history.

139
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,147
From who? He was
brought in alone.

140
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,608
And I doubt a guy who weighs 600
pounds bothers with annual physicals.

141
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,439
Talk to the neighbors
and search the house.

142
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,708
Let's see what else Shamu's
been up to besides eating.

143
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,573
This conversation is over

144
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,278
because I've officially run out
of clever things to call the guy.

145
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,559
It's hard to believe

146
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,222
you can even attach this
much flesh to a human skeleton.

147
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,266
I wouldn't exactly
call this attached.

148
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,426
This is ridiculous.

149
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,060
A person shouldn't be able
to eat themselves into oblivion

150
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,038
and then just expect everyone to
pull out the stops to fix everything.

151
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,940
What are we supposed to do? Refuse
treatment to anyone who's obese?

152
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,774
Come on, give me a
break. This guy's not obese.

153
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,542
He's not even morbidly
obese. He's suicidal.

154
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,242
People who attempt
suicide get treated.

155
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,217
Plenty of noncompliant
diabetics don't.

156
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,083
We don't give
drug addicts dialysis

157
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,384
or alcoholics liver transplants.

158
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,947
What is your problem?

159
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,549
You get beat up
by a gang of fat kids

160
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,036
when you were in grade
school or something?

161
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,529
Yeah. I'm the one
with the problem.

162
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,993
So, I think his
bedroom's through there,

163
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,262
and the kitchen's to the left.

164
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,268
Have you seen any
changes in his personality?

165
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,568
Any trouble with
memory or balance?

166
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,541
No, but I really don't
see him that often.

167
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,271
He's not unfriendly or anything,

168
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,404
I guess he just likes
to keep to himself.

169
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,417
I think he only gave me a spare
set of keys 'cause I gave him mine.

170
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,979
What?

171
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:44,013
Nothing. Just reminds me of
someone I know. Who is unfriendly.

172
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,615
Does George have a job?

173
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,820
He has a headhunting
business he runs from home.

174
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,863
Occasionally he'll
interview people here,

175
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,091
but he does most
of it over the phone.

176
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,326
Wow!

177
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,268
Yeah, he loves to cook.

178
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,530
And eat, obviously.

179
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,972
Four-course gourmet
meals almost every night,

180
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,236
sometimes for lunch, too.

181
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,335
Do you know if he ever uses any
unpasteurized cheese or wild game?

182
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,539
I'm not sure.

183
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,447
He gets all his groceries delivered
from that market down on Alden.

184
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,178
They'd probably know.

185
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,921
He have any friends? No.

186
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,816
I mean, sometimes
women do come by.

187
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:22,056
Young, attractive, never the same
one twice, if you know what I mean.

188
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,152
I see.

189
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,757
There can't be many women
who'd wanna be with a guy like him.

190
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,242
It's usually worst
in the morning.

191
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,742
Especially if I've
slept on my arm.

192
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,712
If I sleep on my back or with
my arms out, I'm usually okay.

193
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,882
So your arm only hurts after
you lie on top of it all night.

194
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,078
Yeah.

195
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,781
Well, have you thought about,
I don't know, not doing that?

196
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,884
Yeah. But it's how I sleep,
it's how I've always slept.

197
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,071
Well, there's always surgery.

198
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,173
To do what? Like, clean out
some cartilage or something?

199
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,964
You're not sleeping on some
cartilage, you're sleeping on your arm.

200
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,094
You wanna remove my arm?

201
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,866
Well, it is your left. You
know, a guy's gotta sleep.

202
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,274
Are you insane?

203
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,753
I see spending a night in
jail hasn't humbled you a bit.

204
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,085
While following my
every move is flattering,

205
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,820
a single rose on my doorstep each
morning would be more enticing.

206
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,623
Just bringing your
boss up to speed,

207
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,324
which I guess you
didn't feel was necessary.

208
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,457
You gonna add that
to my list of charges?

209
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,799
People who are innocent tend
not to try to hide their arrest.

210
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,001
Is that based on your years of
experience arresting innocent people?

211
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,740
The way you're
going at that gum,

212
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,837
it's obviously not
having the desired effect.

213
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:50,577
You're the addict. You're gonna
be back on the butts in a month.

214
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,280
You're just taking out your frustration
on me 'cause my meds actually work.

215
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,587
Why don't you quit
while you're ahead.

216
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,488
Before you end up
as a security guard

217
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:01,050
working the night
shift at some strip mall.

218
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,054
I think working around
a bunch of nurses

219
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,692
has given you a false sense
of your ability to intimidate.

220
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,237
Who was that?

221
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,539
Apparently Cuddy's widened
her sperm donor search

222
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,139
to include Neanderthals.

223
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,651
Cuddy's looking
for a sperm donor?

224
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,047
It was a joke. Like Cuddy
would ever want a kid.

225
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,267
Or a kid would ever want Cuddy.

226
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,487
Hello, that's why it's funny!

227
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,391
Why are you guys here?

228
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,020
It's not pickwick's.

229
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,065
Intubation and steroids
have had no effect.

230
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,843
Except maybe to cause
whatever it is to get worse.

231
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,867
He's got a fever now.

232
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,198
What'd you find out?

233
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,034
That you and George have the same
taste in home furnishings and women.

234
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,835
Danish Modern and
Russian gymnasts?

235
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,000
Pianos and prostitutes.

236
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,101
We should do an LP
and look for neurosyphilis.

237
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,078
It's not syphilis.
How do you know?

238
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,239
Because you get STDs
from people you trust,

239
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,515
people you don't feel the
need to protect yourself from.

240
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,179
Whatever he has is connected
to his gut, not what's below it.

241
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,949
MRI his brain, look for clots.

242
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,957
Weight limit on the MRI
machine is 450 pounds.

243
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,424
So do a CT.

244
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,017
Limit's 350.

245
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,619
Then just start treatment.

246
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,674
If we give him blood thinners
and the coma's caused

247
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,275
by a bleed instead of
a clot, we could kill him.

248
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,633
Either start treatment or
start building a stronger MRI.

249
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,103
Whatever you do, do it fast.

250
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,381
The longer he stays in the coma,

251
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,170
the less likely it is
he'll ever wake up.

252
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,508
There's no way.

253
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,344
His head's the only part that
we have to get in the machine.

254
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,826
If we can just get
him on the table...

255
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,682
We get him on the
table, we break the table.

256
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,776
We break the table,

257
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,254
hospital's out a million dollars
and we're out of our jobs.

258
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,484
The weight limit's
obviously just an estimation.

259
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,823
It's not like if it can
hold 450 pounds fine,

260
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,089
it'll instantly
collapse under 451.

261
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,621
He's not one pound over,
he's 150 pounds over.

262
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,723
I don't care!

263
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,120
He still deserves the same
standard of care as anyone else.

264
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,537
Then you believe the
machine will stand on principle.

265
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,406
You guys gonna help or not?

266
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,748
How much does this guy weigh?

267
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,816
440.

268
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,095
Looks like a lot more than that.

269
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,451
It's 'cause he's lying down.

270
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,955
You guys ready? One, two, three.

271
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,403
Here. What's this?

272
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,836
I made some calls for you.

273
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,856
The guy's the best criminal
attorney in Princeton.

274
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,212
Thanks, but I don't need it.

275
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,011
I assume you told
Inspector Clouseau

276
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,052
that I have a valid
prescription for the Vicodin.

277
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,610
Yeah, and I assume you did
as well. Did it make a difference?

278
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,815
The guy's pissed!

279
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:46,053
And with the DEA now treating
pain doctors like Colombian...

280
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,856
I'm not a pain doctor,
I'm a pain patient.

281
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,425
Tell it to your lawyer.

282
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,874
No midline shifts, no
bleeds, clots, infarcts.

283
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,541
I don't see any edema, either.

284
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,107
So what do we do now?

285
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,380
An LP.

286
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,321
Even if it's not an STD, a fever
points toward some sort of infection.

287
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,156
I'm not sure we can do
an LP on a guy his size.

288
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,994
What?

289
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,208
You have to be able to palpate
the spine to know where to go.

290
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,860
We could use
fluoroscopy to guide us.

291
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,978
He still wouldn't be able to bring
his knees up and bend forward

292
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,595
in order to open
the space between...

293
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,486
George, it's all right,
you're in a hospital!

294
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,206
Calm down, man, calm down!

295
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,076
Get him out already! I'm trying!

296
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,376
Come on!

297
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,313
We're gonna get you out!

298
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,507
We still have no idea why he
was in the coma to begin with.

299
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,397
Or why he woke up.

300
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,706
It was probably just
some sort of head trauma

301
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:03,809
and we missed the swelling

302
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,635
because, well, his
head's already swollen.

303
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,834
Bump on the noggin
doesn't explain the fever.

304
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,969
An infection made worse by the
steroids we gave him for pickwick's does.

305
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,036
He's not worse, he's better.

306
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,878
We just replaced the
last MRI you broke.

307
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,078
Referring to the fund-raising
funbags by the royal "we" now?

308
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,883
Let me explain cause
and effect to you.

309
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,947
I specifically told them to
skip the boring testing part

310
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,602
and jump right to the
dangerous treatment.

311
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,391
You blow stuff up,
makes my life miserable,

312
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,159
makes me need to
make your life miserable.

313
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,132
He's telling the truth.

314
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,669
Kids these days, got no respect
for other people's property.

315
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,835
Repairmen cost
less than lawyers.

316
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,508
Morbid obesity is a
legally defined disability,

317
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,708
which means if we'd
denied access to the MRI,

318
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,980
he could have sued us for
discrimination as well as malpractice.

319
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,748
This was your idea?

320
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:55,982
Yeah.

321
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,625
Looks like Cameron's gonna be
having a lot more ideas in future.

322
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,570
Who knew that being bloated and
bitchy could actually come in handy?

323
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,334
Shut up. What if it is hormones?

324
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,739
It's not hormones.

325
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,003
I'm talking about George.

326
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,841
Acute adrenal insufficiency
could cause a temporary coma.

327
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,711
A glandular problem would cause
his temperature to be low, not high.

328
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,080
Maybe the fever's not related.

329
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,928
If it's not related, there's
nothing to talk about.

330
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,716
We should do an
ACTH stimulation test

331
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,756
and check his skin for
acanthosis nigricans.

332
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,020
Or the fever is related
and so are the prostitutes.

333
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,891
We should do a full STD panel
and check his genitals for chancres.

334
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,191
We should do nothing.

335
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,459
Just keep him a couple
of days for observation.

336
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,609
If he doesn't get any worse,

337
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:44,400
it was probably just a hematoma
that dissipated on its own.

338
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,898
Or we do all of the above.

339
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,370
You check his belly for patches.

340
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,172
You check underneath for sores.

341
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,544
And you just sit on your ass.

342
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:04,349
Acanthosis nigricans is a
hyperpigmentation of the skin,

343
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,188
usually indicates some
sort of hormonal imbalance.

344
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,229
There's nothing wrong
with my hormones.

345
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,231
It's the first thing every doctor
I've ever gone to has checked.

346
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,097
Then it's the blood pressure,
then it's gotta be diabetes.

347
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,569
They all figure there's gotta
be something wrong with me.

348
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,664
You having any
problems with your vision?

349
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,801
No, I have nystagmus. I've
had it since birth, I'm fine.

350
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,970
You're not fine. You were
in a coma for two days.

351
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,189
There's something
wrong with you.

352
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:31,378
Was something wrong with me,
now I'm better, now I'd like to go home.

353
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,717
A coma's not like
a stomach ache.

354
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,164
You can't just shrug it off and
hope it's not anything serious.

355
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,657
My company places a
lot of insurance executives.

356
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:43,822
There are over 300,000 deaths
caused each year by medical mistakes

357
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:48,027
and hospital-associated
infections. I'll come in for tests.

358
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,593
There are over 400,000 deaths
caused by obesity-related illnesses.

359
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:55,335
The CDC says those figures
are a gross overestimation.

360
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,640
George, you ever notice you
don't see a lot of obese old men?

361
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,976
If I'm gonna have
a heart attack,

362
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:06,543
I would rather it be caused by a
perfect pan-roasted ris de veau

363
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:11,623
than running 26 miles for no reason
other than to brag that I can do it.

364
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:15,924
Or to have an MRI machine
break in the middle of a procedure!

365
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,486
We're sorry about that.

366
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,908
It was the only way to rule out
a stroke or brain hemorrhage.

367
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,198
And now that you
have, when can I go?

368
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,737
It's probably her mom.

369
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:37,306
I bet she's huge.
She's from the Midwest.

370
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,780
Since when do you eat beets?

371
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,081
Since I was five.

372
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,432
And who are we talking about?
You know, just in case you need me

373
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,567
to chime in and tell you
you're a lunatic at some point?

374
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,153
Cameron. She's lying,
destroying hospital equipment,

375
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,526
telling Cuddy off.

376
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,963
I gotta find out where she
got the Fat Scratch Fever.

377
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,365
Yeah, you definitely better
get to the bottom of that.

378
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,145
I heard Cuddy gave
you the name of a lawyer.

379
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,038
Or it could just be pity. She feels
guilty about being born beautiful.

380
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,667
So she overcompensates
by being nice to ugly people.

381
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,703
Would explain why she
gets along so well with you.

382
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,442
From what I hear, the patient
reminds her of you, not me.

383
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,514
Call the lawyer.

384
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,813
Cameron sees a clump
of dirt and she thinks of me.

385
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,787
Or a lump of something else.
You're a lunatic. Call the lawyer.

386
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,084
Very mature. You started it.

387
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,163
Skin exam and ACTH
stimulation test were both normal.

388
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,290
He has nystagmus
but it's congenital.

389
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,697
No way it's related to the coma.

390
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,101
You say, "No way," I
say... Yeah, no way.

391
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,448
Blood and urine were negative
for chlamydia, herpes, and syphilis.

392
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,407
Looks like we got
ourselves a mystery.

393
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,841
Not for long. He
wants to be discharged.

394
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,311
Oh, sure. Places
to go, people to eat.

395
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,556
He insists his chance of dying

396
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,891
from a hospital-acquired
infection

397
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,115
is greater than him dying
from whatever caused his coma.

398
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:49,213
Did you tell him that statistics
also say that he's a big, fat idiot?

399
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,223
Yeah, I did. He's
not backing down.

400
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,235
He says if we don't
discharge him, he'll leave AMA.

401
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,718
Selectively rational,
stubborn, uncooperative,

402
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,662
maybe you ought
to check his leg.

403
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,870
Do you see what he did
there? The patient's like me.

404
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,905
The patient's three mes.

405
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,806
If I were him...

406
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,841
Maybe it's not such
a mystery after all.

407
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,017
Enjoying your Salisbury steak?

408
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,923
Putting chopped
parsley in a hamburger

409
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,291
does not a Salisbury steak make.

410
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,926
You must be Dr. House.

411
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:37,394
And you must be full
of baloney. A lot of it.

412
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,804
Right. Fat joke. Always fun.

413
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,899
The only people you
can still make fun of.

414
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,809
And Christians. Oh,
and black people.

415
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,981
No one in their right
mind comes out of a coma

416
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,449
and immediately asks to go
home with an unknown condition,

417
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,295
which means that either
you're not in your right mind

418
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,810
or it's not an
unknown condition.

419
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,049
So, what is it? You
tried to off yourself?

420
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:01,288
You figure I'm fat,
therefore I hate myself.

421
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,829
Yeah, that's a
huge leap of logic.

422
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:07,298
I don't wanna die. I
just don't wanna be here.

423
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,631
Then it's a condition you've
already had diagnosed,

424
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:11,379
or it's something you
know you've inherited.

425
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,770
Let's see, your stomach
has deep-seated feelings

426
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,205
of abandonment
written all over it,

427
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,402
which points
toward sexual abuse.

428
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:21,379
While a fear of hospitals, that points
to a more specific traumatic event.

429
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:25,976
So I'm gonna say, your mom
in the hospital with a candlestick.

430
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,180
And by candlestick, of course, I
mean inherited OTC deficiency.

431
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:32,851
My parents are both alive and
well and living in Boca Raton.

432
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,917
Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis?

433
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,394
I have no idea what that is.

434
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,897
Leukoencephalopathy.
Will you stop!

435
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,926
If I knew what was
wrong, I would tell you.

436
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:46,097
I'm not an imbecile,
and I'm not miserable.

437
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,671
I'm just overweight.

438
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,181
What?

439
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,515
When?

440
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,445
To be continued.

441
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,674
What are you doing here?

442
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,113
Executing a search
of the premises.

443
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,913
When you... When
you got bailed out

444
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,921
before we could get a
judge to approve this,

445
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:40,126
I almost didn't bother.

446
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,186
I thought for sure you'd come
straight home and throw everything out.

447
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:48,291
Rookie mistake. Never
underestimate the stupidity of an addict.

448
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:54,097
There's gotta be over
600 Vicodin in here.

449
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,870
Which most DAs would
say proves intent to traffic.

450
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:01,175
Even if all you really intended
was to simply be wasted 24/7

451
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:02,374
while practicing medicine.

452
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:05,350
In case you hadn't noticed,
those are prescription bottles.

453
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,114
I'm not an expert
on linguistics per se,

454
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,222
but I think that means
they were prescribed.

455
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,450
All these were
legally prescribed

456
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,621
to a man who's in constant pain

457
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,959
but never misses a day of work?

458
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,591
Has it ever occurred to you
that's why I don't miss a day?

459
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:25,229
Yeah. Yeah, crossed my
mind. Among other things.

460
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:29,298
Like what an unprofessional,
unethical, arrogant ass you are.

461
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,836
Because if you're
unprofessional in one area,

462
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,711
it only makes sense.

463
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:41,613
Now maybe just a few of these
are in someone else's name.

464
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,885
Forged prescription,

465
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:49,053
or just, um, swiped from the
pharmacy when nobody's looking.

466
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,965
No, but, well, you
wouldn't do that. Right?

467
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,105
Send him home.

468
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,807
Why? You think he's healthy?

469
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,406
Either I'm right,

470
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,281
he knows what's wrong, he's
just too stubborn to admit it,

471
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,378
or I was right
and it's pickwick's.

472
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,355
The treatment just
had a delayed effect.

473
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,358
You don't have delayed
effects to oxygen.

474
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,936
And Pickwick's doesn't
explain the fever.

475
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,191
Being engulfed in an
electric blanket of blubber

476
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,423
could explain the fever.

477
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,841
Yesterday you insisted we keep
him here because of the fever.

478
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,476
We have no idea what's
wrong with the guy.

479
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,526
For all we know he
could be dead in 12 hours.

480
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,628
He does not want our help.

481
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:34,863
Which means he
doesn't want your help.

482
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,842
He's obviously just
rationalizing. And so are you!

483
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,378
You would never
give up this easy

484
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,813
if you weren't so busy dealing
with your own personal problems.

485
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,379
Send him home.

486
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,386
What did you tell that cop?

487
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,453
Nothing.

488
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,749
Nothing as in nothing?

489
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,333
Or as in nothing that
could cause him to think

490
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:52,985
I have a stash in my apartment?

491
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:56,085
He called to see if I prescribed
the pills, I said yes. That's all.

492
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,153
Obviously not. What happened?

493
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,325
He searched my house,
found a buttload of pills.

494
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,965
Guy's gotta be
prepared for a rainy day.

495
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,301
Last I checked pharmacies
were still open when it rained.

496
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,950
And because I never know when
you're gonna be in one of your moods

497
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:09,974
and cut me off.

498
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,237
Oh, it's my fault.

499
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,903
I'm not the one who
talked to the cop.

500
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,971
Well, I'm not the one who put
a thermometer in his rectum.

501
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,485
So stop yelling at me and
start talking to your lawyer.

502
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,885
Is there someone
who can check on you?

503
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:25,957
Oh, don't worry.

504
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:29,189
There's gonna be a whole
crew of carpenters in my bedroom

505
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,196
for the next week at least.

506
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:35,862
You know, there's an Overeaters
Anonymous meeting here at the hospital.

507
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:39,234
If I wanted to jump out of
airplanes or climb Mount Everest,

508
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,035
would you be telling me to
go to Daredevils Anonymous?

509
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,235
I would be worried about
you just like I am now.

510
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,436
Don't be.

511
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,212
I enjoy food.

512
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,343
I like cooking it, I like
looking at it, I like smelling it,

513
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,750
and I especially like eating it.

514
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:58,316
Listen, whatever
happens is gonna happen.

515
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:02,684
Ultimately it's all out
of our control anyway.

516
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,059
Why doesn't that
philosophy apply

517
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,759
to medical mistakes and
hospital-acquired infections as well?

518
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,294
I'm a complicated
man, Dr. Cameron.

519
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,332
But don't worry, I plan on
staying that way for a long time.

520
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,186
Wait, wait, let us take
you all the way outside.

521
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,269
I'm fine.

522
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,779
It doesn't matter,
it's hospital rules.

523
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:25,045
Oh, screw the rules. I've
been on my back for four days.

524
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,483
I need the exercise, right?

525
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,430
George, come on, let us
just take you to the taxi.

526
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:32,721
Don't worry, I may not be able to
climb Everest, but I can walk, okay?

527
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,260
George... Now enough already.

528
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,437
George, are you all right?

529
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,503
George? You all right? George?

530
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,513
Disorientation
and loss of balance

531
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,819
could mean a neurofibromatosis.

532
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,323
Where's Chase? Don't know.

533
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,020
Haven't seen him since you told
him to sit on his ass yesterday.

534
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,494
Interesting.

535
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,122
NF2 is also inherited,
which means I was right.

536
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,342
You kept saying
it was pickwick's.

537
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,245
Between the first pickwick's and the
second pickwick's, I said it was inherited.

538
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,238
Whatever. NF2
doesn't explain fever.

539
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,182
I think we should focus
on the coma and the fever.

540
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,451
Why? The disorientation and
loss of balance are more recent.

541
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,943
The coma was the
most severe symptom.

542
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,242
But he's not in the coma
anymore and he is disoriented.

543
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,145
No, he's not.

544
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,583
We have a rather large piece of
tempered glass that begs to differ.

545
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,349
I just mean it's not connected.

546
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,821
You don't know that.

547
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,914
Yeah, I do.

548
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,254
How could you possibly know...

549
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,953
Because I did it!

550
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:48,295
I didn't think he
should be discharged,

551
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,996
so I gave him three
grams of phenytoin.

552
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,029
I wasn't gonna
just let him leave.

553
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,734
But you were okay with him
crashing through a glass wall?

554
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,538
I tried to keep him in the
wheelchair, but he's tough to stop.

555
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,602
Nice audible, Peyton.

556
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,512
So, what do we do now?

557
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,518
Discharge report says
he didn't eat his breakfast.

558
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:09,419
Humpty Dumpty didn't get to
be the size of all the king's horses

559
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,354
by skipping the most
important meal of the day.

560
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,222
What causes coma,
fever, and loss of appetite?

561
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,504
It can't be Chagas', he's
never been outside the country.

562
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,655
But his stomach has.

563
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,221
The food we eat no longer
comes from America's heartland.

564
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,791
It comes from South
America's deforested jungle land

565
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,599
where lettuce now grows
and lettuce pickers now poop.

566
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:26,934
Get a sample of his CSF

567
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:30,066
before the little bugs that are now
feasting on his brain move on to dessert.

568
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,510
How are we gonna do that?
He's too big to do an LP.

569
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,509
So go straight to the source.

570
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,915
You wanna drill a
hole in my head?

571
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,147
It's the only way.

572
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,282
It's gotta be something
other than a parasite.

573
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,689
I buy my produce at the best
market in town and I always wash it.

574
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,662
Leafy vegetables can
suck contaminated water

575
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,392
through their roots
right into the plant.

576
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,058
You could have
washed them in chlorine

577
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,999
and it still wouldn't
have mattered.

578
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,595
Then other people
would be sick as well.

579
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,266
The parasites could have
been on only a few items,

580
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,276
or maybe they just didn't
eat as much as you did.

581
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:07,177
It's always about
my weight, isn't it?

582
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,841
Why can't you people
come up with one theory...

583
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,281
This one fits, George.

584
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,549
It explains your coma, your
fever, your loss of appetite...

585
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,689
And the disorientation?

586
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,920
It's all explained.

587
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,276
And if we don't treat it while
it's still in the acute stage,

588
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,529
it'll be too late.

589
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,060
It could go on to infect your
heart, intestines, esophagus...

590
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,536
This is what I get
for eating salad.

591
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,847
- Suction.
- Suction.

592
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,524
Aspirator.

593
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,696
Your turn.

594
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,099
Irrigation.

595
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,399
Sponge.

596
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,771
What did you do?

597
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,036
Nothing. Why, what's wrong?

598
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,135
I can't see.

599
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,907
Vision's blurry
or you've lost...

600
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,460
I didn't lose it, you
took it from me!

601
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:18,279
George, calm down. I can't see!

602
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,545
Give me some lorazepam!

603
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,519
What did you do
to me? Hold still!

604
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,020
George! George! What's going on?

605
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:26,217
No. No. Calm down!
What did you do to me?

606
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,030
There's no inflammation in the
optic nerve and his retina's intact.

607
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,574
The blindness has to have been
caused by something in his brain.

608
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,590
And not surprisingly there
was no sign of Chagas'

609
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,636
or any other
parasites in his CSF.

610
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,865
So we've ruled out his parents,

611
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,339
prostitutes, the
arugula. Means either...

612
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:43,818
I took the sample
from the prefrontal.

613
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,708
I was never anywhere
near his visual cortex.

614
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,508
Or you missed a
tumor on the MRI.

615
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,378
Not a chance, the MRI was clean.

616
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,247
You mind? Where are you going?

617
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,979
To get a $400 butt plug.

618
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,179
What about George?

619
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,518
He's gonna have to
get his own. Come on.

620
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,233
Let's see if we can
get this thing figured out

621
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,782
by the time we
get to the elevator.

622
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,384
It could be MS.

623
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,054
Would explain the
coma, the blindness,

624
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:05,495
loss of balance, and the fever.

625
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,475
Could also explain his lack
of concern for his health.

626
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,092
MS can cause
excessive cheerfulness.

627
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,465
Yeah, he's a delight.

628
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,902
You don't get to MS with
coma as the first symptom.

629
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,408
Blindness plus coma
says diabetes. Just in time.

630
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,535
No. Blood sugar, urine dip stick
and hemoglobin A1c are normal.

631
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,170
Were normal when you tested.

632
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,423
He's been in and out of a coma,

633
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,047
whatever's going on
is waxing and waning,

634
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,074
unlike his pants size,
which only waxes.

635
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,814
Which also points to
diabetes. Test him again.

636
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,254
And this time add a glucose
tolerance test and an HEC.

637
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:32,985
We already have a CSF sample,

638
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,721
we might as well check it
for proteins to rule out MS first.

639
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:38,286
Agreed. Except for the
part about doing it first.

640
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,363
Where are you going?

641
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,900
The butt plug was my way of
saying, "Mind your own business."

642
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,663
Apparently too subtle.

643
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,935
George, all it is is
sugar water, I promise.

644
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,634
Just because I'm overweight
doesn't make me diabetic!

645
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,802
You tested me,
everybody's tested me.

646
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,621
Sometimes the blood
sugar levels can fluctuate,

647
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,908
make it difficult to diagnose.

648
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,348
You stuck a needle in my brain
and 10 seconds later I was blind!

649
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,249
How is that difficult
to diagnose?

650
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,753
Who the hell knows what
else you guys done to me?

651
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,665
I should have never come
here! You didn't come here,

652
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,591
you were brought here because
you were in a coma and barely alive.

653
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,357
We didn't do that to you, you
need to let us figure out what did.

654
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:15,343
For someone who insists he
enjoys life as much as you do,

655
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,378
you certainly don't seem
willing to do much to prolong it.

656
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,870
Yeah,

657
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:23,602
because I don't agree with the
brilliant doctors, suddenly I'm suicidal!

658
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:27,203
Refusing to cooperate with us does not
make you suicidal, it makes you an idiot.

659
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,044
You think we want to see
you blind or in a coma?

660
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,344
I've been fat all my life.

661
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:38,923
I've only been sick
for the past few days.

662
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:43,792
You look for a disease that
has nothing to do with my size,

663
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,455
and I will help you.

664
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,299
Otherwise, leave me alone.

665
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:58,838
Speeding, DUI, reckless driving,

666
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,847
resisting arrest, possession
of a class three narcotic.

667
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,158
And now it looks
like they've added

668
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,675
another possession with
intent to traffic charge as well.

669
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,950
They found some
pills at your house.

670
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,218
All of which I had
a prescription for.

671
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,315
That's a lot of pills.

672
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,190
I'm in a lot of pain.

673
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,798
This is all because some
cop came into the clinic,

674
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:22,528
I was rude to him, this is
his way of getting back at me.

675
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:23,830
You've made it pretty easy.

676
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:28,499
His insane reaction to a simple
rectal thermometer reading

677
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:32,237
probably says a lot more about
his mother than it says about me.

678
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,047
I'm inclined to think
your particular charm

679
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:40,510
may not be immediately
appreciated by a jury.

680
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,383
I'm not interested
in a plea bargain.

681
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,821
It's your best bet to
make this go away.

682
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,826
There is no this. There's a him.

683
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:50,761
The only thing I'm guilty
of is humiliating a bully.

684
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:53,355
I wasn't speeding, I wasn't
impaired, I didn't resist,

685
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,231
and I certainly was
not distributing narcotics

686
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,495
to anyone but myself,

687
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,594
because I need those narcotics.

688
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,928
Five grand retainer.

689
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:04,272
If we end up going to trial, there'll
be another 30 due before the first day.

690
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,369
My hourly is 450.
That work for you?

691
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,118
What'd your lawyer say?

692
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:17,550
I looked up butt plug in a
legal dictionary. What'd he say?

693
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,057
That a smile like
mine can't lose.

694
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,886
What did the tests say?

695
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,953
You were right about MS. No
myelin basic proteins in his CSF.

696
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,362
What about diabetes? Don't know.

697
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,675
He says we only
think it's diabetes

698
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:30,396
because of his weight,
won't let us test him.

699
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,812
So, you would rather be a
blind invalid than admit the fact

700
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,652
that maybe you might have a
little problem with overeating.

701
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:52,833
By a little problem, of course,

702
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,723
I mean you've eaten
yourself half to death.

703
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,058
And you would rather let
me die than consider the fact

704
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,360
that whatever is wrong with me
has nothing to do with my weight.

705
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,799
I go where the
symptoms tell me to go.

706
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,768
And right now they're
asking why this stuff

707
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,964
is the first thing you've
ever refused to swallow.

708
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,269
I am not diabetic.

709
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:12,869
Grocery stores giving away medical
degrees with the free turkeys now?

710
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,984
The sooner you drink this,

711
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,057
the sooner I get to go waste
my time with something else.

712
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,640
Get the hell off of me!

713
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,618
No dessert till you've
finished your dinner!

714
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,548
George, just drink it!

715
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,783
Nurse!

716
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,551
Get this jackass off of me!

717
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,117
What the hell is going on?

718
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,526
Just trying to
force a horse to...

719
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,232
Let go!

720
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,220
What's going on?

721
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:01,225
Get X-rays of his hands. Then
bronc him, do a sputum cytology

722
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,591
and check his CSF
for anti-hu antibodies.

723
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,872
How are we gonna
get him to do all that,

724
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,574
we can't even get him to
drink a bottle of sugar water?

725
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:09,090
Tell him that lung cancer is in
no way connected to obesity.

726
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,398
You don't think he'll
realize we're lying?

727
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,938
You're not. Lung cancer's
got nothing to do with obesity.

728
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,667
I meant about him
having lung cancer.

729
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,936
You didn't notice his fingers?

730
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,272
I noticed they were fat.

731
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,676
You should have pissed him off,

732
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,804
he would have grabbed you.

733
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,090
Then you would
have felt the bones,

734
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,709
they're not just
fat, they're clubbed.

735
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,782
George,

736
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:03,419
it's me.

737
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,561
Your tests were positive.

738
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,691
You have a small
cell lung carcinoma.

739
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,131
It caused a paraneoplastic
neurologic syndrome,

740
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:19,103
which in turn caused
your blindness and coma.

741
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,364
The cancer's metastasized
to your lymph nodes.

742
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,742
It's inoperable,

743
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,677
but there are radiation
treatments available.

744
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,944
They might give you
a few more months.

745
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,581
I never smoked.

746
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,928
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

747
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,334
You were right.

748
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,069
So was he.

749
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,774
He said, <i>"C'est la vie."</i>

750
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,146
He's a complicated man.

751
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:39,809
What about you?

752
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,081
What are you gonna
do about your problem?

753
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,122
Nothing. Just got a
call from my lawyer.

754
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,385
He gave the DA copies
of my prescriptions.

755
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,153
Soon as they confirm
they're bona fides,

756
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:51,094
they're gonna drop the
possession, DUI and resisting arrest.

757
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,290
Soon as I pay my
$85 speeding ticket

758
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,094
and the impound
fine, I get my bike back.

759
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,361
I guess that's good.

760
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,369
You guess? No, it's good.

761
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,233
You get to keep going
like you always have.

762
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:07,876
All right, I give
up. Who was it?

763
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,847
Who in your family
had the weight problem?

764
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,358
You think I can only
care about a patient

765
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,460
if I know someone else who's
been through the same thing?

766
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,816
You care for everybody.

767
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,151
You only lie and stand
up to Cuddy for a few.

768
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,453
You lie for everybody
and only care about a few.

769
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,186
You're avoiding the question.

770
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:23,524
I like damaged people, remember?

771
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,854
It explains everything I do.

772
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,193
Almost everything.

773
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,532
It wasn't you, was it?

774
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,427
Does it matter?

775
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,767
Nope, but it'd be interesting.

776
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,000
Sorry to disappoint you,

777
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:39,272
but sometimes the answers
just aren't that simple.

778
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,281
I know he can be a real ass,

779
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,650
and he has no problem
lying when it serves him,

780
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,313
but he's not lying
about the pain.

781
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,620
He needs the medication,
which is why I prescribed it.

782
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:54,715
All of it.

783
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:58,024
Well, I see a lot of cases

784
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,231
where people who have real
injuries end up getting addicted.

785
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:09,674
And then, well, things
kind of spiral out of control.

786
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,968
And lives get ruined,
and not just their own.

787
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,916
I don't know what
else to tell you.

788
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,155
What about these?

789
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,891
This is getting...

790
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,363
If it's got my name
on it, it's a legit scrip.

791
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,924
You sure? Yeah.

792
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,801
Because the signatures on these

793
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:43,239
look a little different than
the signatures on those.

794
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:52,908
You look surprised.

795
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,543
No, I'm just...

796
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,782
I hadn't thought about it. I do sign
my name differently sometimes.

797
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:06,961
Are you sure? Yeah.

798
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,296
I just, I guess get bored
signing it the same way.

799
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:12,303
You know what they say
about doctors' handwriting.

800
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:16,099
I'm gonna give you a moment

801
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,370
to reconsider that answer.

802
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:25,074
Because if you are, for
some reason, mistaken,

803
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:31,352
we will find out, and that
will not be good for you.

804
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,215
Or Dr. House.

805
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,320
I am sure. Absolutely.

806
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,298
All right.

807
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,939
I guess that's it, then.

808
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,516
Thank you for your help.

809
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,212
Okay, no problem.
