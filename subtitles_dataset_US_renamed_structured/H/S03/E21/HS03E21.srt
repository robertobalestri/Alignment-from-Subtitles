1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,697
Try not to be scared
when you see him, okay?

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,832
Mom, I've seen him
sick. I'm not scared.

3
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,137
This time's different.

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,488
The doctors gave him an extra
course of radiation and chemo...

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,878
I know.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,648
And you understand how
proud we are of you, right?

7
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,443
Gloves, mask.

8
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,326
Matty, you said you wanted to see
your brother before the procedure.

9
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,091
I know I look like an alien, but
I promise not to eat your brain.

10
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:14,708
When this is done, will you be
able to play out back with me?

11
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,140
I'll rip anything you
put near the strike zone.

12
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,740
Let your brother rest up, while
we take some of your marrow.

13
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,650
You don't need to be
in an isolation room,

14
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:35,025
but I pulled some strings so you
could be next door to your brother.

15
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,529
How many games will I miss?

16
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,259
Well, you only have
to be here overnight,

17
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,909
but you do have to
take it easy for a little bit.

18
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,265
I already missed two. Matty...

19
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,065
I know. It's okay.

20
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,869
It must have been a drag.

21
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,150
We just had to make sure you
weren't exposed to any bugs,

22
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:51,407
because your healthy bone marrow is
what's gonna cure your brother's leukemia.

23
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,138
Go on.

24
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,178
He sneezed. Maybe
it's just an allergy.

25
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,477
Not with an enlarged
spleen and a fever.

26
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,348
He's got one of 10,000
possible infections,

27
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,786
even if it's just the common cold, I
do the transplant, he kills his brother.

28
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,879
How long do we have?

29
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,925
Radiation obliterated
his immune system.

30
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:49,554
Even in a clean room, he's
got four, maybe five, days left.

31
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,565
No way we can solve this that
fast. You need to find another donor.

32
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,725
They're African American.

33
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,928
It makes it nearly
impossible to find a full match.

34
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,439
Tell me about it. I can't even find
the one I've got working for me.

35
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,134
Where is Foreman?

36
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,410
Nothing like a dead patient to
send you back to your choir boy roots.

37
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,023
Hey, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

38
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,252
Wilson just killed a
kid same way you did.

39
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,555
He's not dead.

40
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:25,031
Five days are gonna fly by. He
didn't look both ways before he nuked.

41
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,634
You done talking to
your imaginary friend?

42
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,746
Because I thought, maybe,
you could do your job and just...

43
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,763
Start the donor brother on
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

44
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,775
Great idea, if you're looking
to save exactly one kid.

45
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,335
Broad-spec will take at least a
week to work. We need narrow-spec.

46
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,436
How old is Hector?

47
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,415
Our patient's name is
Matty. His brother's Nick.

48
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,951
Hector's my dog. He's about 17?

49
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:50,184
Seventeen? That's, like, a 119 in
human years. Why is he still alive?

50
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,557
Five days minus 20 seconds
talking about Wilson's dog.

51
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,688
We need to start testing. Stool
samples for parasites, antibody tests...

52
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,803
Blood panel was negative
for all the usual suspects.

53
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,892
That's because the
infection is too small.

54
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,801
We start testing now, it's like
looking for a needle in a haystack.

55
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,704
We draw blood odds are we're
just gonna come up with hay.

56
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,038
We need to grow more needles.

57
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,541
Okay, that probably
needs further explanation.

58
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,311
We make the donor kid sicker.

59
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,853
We freeze him, we soak him,
break down his immune system.

60
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,254
Suddenly we're looking at some needle
that a camel can pass through the eye of.

61
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,293
Making him sicker risks spreading
the infection all throughout his body.

62
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,123
True, but who cares?

63
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,740
Once we know what the infection
is, we'll know exactly how to treat it.

64
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,460
As long as he isn't
dead yet, we're cool.

65
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,023
We should do what
we normally do.

66
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,245
Go to the kid's house, check
for sources of the infection.

67
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,794
Waste of time.

68
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,431
You think it's in the house.
I know it's in the patient.

69
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,500
Safer than intentionally
making the kid sicker.

70
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,643
Fine, go.

71
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:56,489
So exactly how sick are
you gonna make Matty?

72
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,954
He could get quite ill.

73
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,188
It certainly won't be a pleasant
experience for anyone, but it's our only...

74
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,060
Ever get caught in the
rain without an umbrella?

75
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,224
That's all we're talking
about here. Sign the form.

76
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:10,031
It's a little more complicated than
that. We'll also be doing leukopheresis.

77
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,082
We run Matty's blood through a machine
that filters out his white blood cells.

78
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,666
But without his white cells,
how could he get better in time?

79
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,712
We'll pump the white blood cells
back as soon as we have a diagnosis.

80
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,490
Then we should be able to cure the
infection in time to do the transplant.

81
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,709
But you can't guarantee?

82
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,775
We're not GM. No
recalls, no rebates.

83
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,118
Anymore questions while
your son's life slips away?

84
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,087
You really think
we should do this?

85
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,392
Yes.

86
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,363
Sorry. Your patient,
you tell them.

87
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,730
This is your family. It
needs to be your decision.

88
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,711
All you had to do
was say, "Yes, I do."

89
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,425
God knows it's a phrase that
you've used often enough in your life.

90
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,481
It was a mistake every time.
Give it a break. They said yes.

91
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,969
That's not enough for you. You need
them to feel good about saying yes.

92
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:11,055
I treat patients for months,
maybe years, not weeks, like you.

93
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,131
I'm taller.

94
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,809
If they don't trust
me, I can't do my job.

95
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,598
The only value of that trust is
that you can manipulate them.

96
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,950
You should write greeting cards.

97
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,872
Giving the parents a chance to
make a bad choice was a bad choice.

98
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,418
At least it would have
been their choice.

99
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,537
One they'd regret
at their son's funeral.

100
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:30,313
Kitchen and bathrooms were immaculate.
Whatever the kid's got, he didn't get here.

101
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:34,411
No, whatever the kid got, he didn't
get from the kitchen or the bathroom.

102
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,046
Nobody cleans swing sets.

103
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,991
Yeah, because their kid's 10
and hasn't used it since he was six.

104
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,054
You obviously think your time could
be better spent. Why'd you come along?

105
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,895
You feel bad about
what happened last week.

106
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,333
I'm handling it.

107
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,926
Think the family's gonna sue?

108
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,302
She only had her grandparents,
and they weren't close.

109
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,739
Well, that's good.
For you, I mean.

110
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,368
A lawsuit makes it even
harder to put behind you.

111
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,470
You put yours behind you?

112
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,574
Nope.

113
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,912
When I woke up this morning I...

114
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,547
I couldn't remember what she
was wearing when I admitted her.

115
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,783
Memories fade.

116
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,952
I killed her a week ago and I can't
remember what color top she was wearing.

117
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:17,930
I was grateful when I could
wake up not thinking about her.

118
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,057
I'm not like you.

119
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:22,591
Your patient died because you were
distracted over the death of your dad.

120
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,570
I made a calculated decision.

121
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:31,070
You acted like a human
being. I acted like House.

122
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,520
Could be <i>Mucor</i> or
Strongyloides in this dirt.

123
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:49,552
No pulmonary symptoms,
setting well, breathing easily.

124
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,317
Mom, I'm freezing.

125
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,790
How long do I have to wait?

126
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,486
Matty, we found an old
water pump in your backyard.

127
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
You ever drink from it?

128
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,426
Yeah it was gross.

129
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,727
We gotta test for
Mycobacteria, leptospirosis.

130
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,324
When did you drink the water?

131
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,800
Last summer?

132
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,870
You sure? You haven't
even taken a sip to cool off?

133
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,072
It was really gross.

134
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,679
My shoulder's bugging
me. Does that matter?

135
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,375
It could. Did you do
anything to hurt it?

136
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,942
Just threw the ball around the
other day, for a couple hours.

137
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,956
It's probably just a muscle
ache. Let us know if it gets worse.

138
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:56,857
So soreness and stuff,
that's not 'cause I'm sick?

139
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,331
Is something else bugging you?

140
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,397
Sort of.

141
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,771
He has acute scrotum. Adorable.

142
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,311
Please, I thought
you were dignified.

143
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,480
Come on, how am I not
supposed to make that joke?

144
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:18,450
Best thing about big, honking
gonads, well, one of the best things,

145
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,919
is that there's only a few
infections that could cause it.

146
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:25,322
Do urinalysis and cultures for <i>E.
Coli, Klebsiella,</i> TB, and <i>Brucella.</i>

147
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,122
Blood tests for enteroviruses
and adenoviruses.

148
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,358
Hopefully, the needles have grown
as fast as his sack, and we can find it.

149
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,491
Can Chase and
Cameron cover that?

150
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,336
Mind if I ask why?

151
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:41,204
I want to recheck the National
Marrow registry for an alternate donor.

152
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,803
In case we're wrong?

153
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,367
It's been known to happen.

154
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,904
Fine, go.

155
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,554
Negative for <i>E. coli</i> and TB. Why
is House taking it easy on Foreman?

156
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,625
He deserves a break.

157
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,560
Yeah, House is all about
giving breaks to people in need.

158
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,530
No on <i>Klebsiella.</i>

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,832
And it's Tuesday.

160
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,534
It's got nothing to do with
Foreman or House. It's just...

161
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:16,938
It's the day I remind you I like
you, and I want us to be together.

162
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,938
Thank you, I'd forgotten.

163
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,210
No on <i>Brucella</i> and
both viral antibodies.

164
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,130
You're really gonna
do this every Tuesday?

165
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,215
You take the day off, I'll
pick it up on Wednesday.

166
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,099
What if we're looking
for the wrong thing?

167
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,273
These are the only infections
that cause swollen testicles.

168
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,975
Why don't you just say it four times
now and leave me alone for a month?

169
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,661
Well, what if it's
not an infection?

170
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,079
His temperature's through the roof.
There's mucous pouring out of him.

171
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,540
I know he has an infection, but what if it
didn't directly cause the scrotum issue?

172
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:51,942
What if it just caused the thing
that caused the scrotum issue?

173
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,137
CK-MB is elevated.

174
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,915
Slightly. There's
nothing wrong with...

175
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,317
Indicates cardiac injury.

176
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,254
We stuck him in that
room, put his stupid,

177
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:06,187
little runny-nose
infection into hyperdrive.

178
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,490
What if it went to his heart?

179
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,091
Pulmonary valve looks clean.

180
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:19,037
Wait. Stop. Mitral
valve, there's a growth.

181
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,037
He'll need a month of
antibiotics to clear that.

182
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,046
His brother only
has four days to live.

183
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:36,282
The infection in Matty's mitral
valve rules him out as a donor.

184
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,449
This is perfect.

185
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,185
We drove the
infection into his heart.

186
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,593
Okay, perfect is too strong of
a word, but it's very, very good.

187
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,993
Now we know
where the infection is.

188
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,865
All we've got to do is remove the valve,
ID the infection, target and destroy it.

189
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,028
Remove the valve?

190
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,868
He'll be fine on antibiotics. He
doesn't need open-heart surgery.

191
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,205
He'll be heartbroken, on
account of his dead brother.

192
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,906
Either way he's got a dead brother.
The infection isn't just in the valve.

193
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,413
Even with targeted medication,

194
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,292
there's no way we can
clear his system in time.

195
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,150
We don't have to. We
have to clear his marrow.

196
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,518
After the surgery, we
harvest the marrow,

197
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:12,025
marinate it in the targeted
antibiotic, simmer and serve.

198
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,961
Could work. It's insane.

199
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,360
It is better than
a dead brother.

200
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,898
I'm running this by Cuddy.

201
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,159
Fine. Go. In fact, let's all go.

202
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,273
This surgery is
dangerous and life-altering,

203
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,242
and clearly not in the
interest of our patient.

204
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,744
It is, if he likes his brother.

205
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,177
We have a conflict of interests.

206
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,357
- The parents don't.
- Of course they do.

207
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,317
They already sacrificed Matty's
health to benefit his brother once.

208
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,909
They made his cold worse.

209
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,387
We screwed up his heart
valve by making his cold worse.

210
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,066
Do you have anything
to add to this debate?

211
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,581
Wilson's right. Foreman's wrong.

212
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,492
Your shirt is way too
revealing for the office.

213
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,759
What do you want me to do?

214
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,927
We should call child services and
have them appoint a guardian for Matty.

215
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,197
No.

216
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,071
Go explain the choices to the
parents, and don't let House bully them.

217
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,909
House.

218
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,941
Did he really think I was
gonna do that? I didn't.

219
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,134
Then, why did you let him...

220
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,616
I'm trying to cut
him some slack.

221
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,345
Nice of you.

222
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,114
I think he's got the yips.

223
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,921
Steve Blass, Scott Norwood,
David Duval all got the yips.

224
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:24,090
Great athletes, lost their confidence
and immediately started sucking.

225
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,429
And you're giving him
time to work through it?

226
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,334
Four days, and he's fired.

227
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,965
You don't get
better from the yips.

228
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,974
Open-heart surgery?

229
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,274
If you want both kids to
live, it's the only choice.

230
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,818
Due to the valve replacement.

231
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,980
Matty will have to be on blood
thinners to prevent potential clots.

232
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,489
For how long? Forever.

233
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,152
He couldn't participate in contact
sports, because of the risk of hemorrhage.

234
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,095
What about the marrow registry?
Maybe they'll find a match.

235
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,155
Maybe they'll ride
it here on a unicorn.

236
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,258
I'm afraid finding
a viable new donor

237
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,600
isn't something we can
realistically depend on.

238
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,344
Either we cripple one
son, or kill the other.

239
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:16,406
He won't be able to play baseball.
That doesn't make him a cripple.

240
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,982
What should we do?

241
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:32,794
You should protect your family as
a whole. You should do the surgery.

242
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,004
That was awesome. Shut up.

243
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,728
I gotta start
pretending to care.

244
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,570
I did exactly what
Cuddy told us not to do.

245
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,852
No you didn't. You did exactly
what she told me not to do.

246
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,868
You're completely in the clear.

247
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,071
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

248
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,343
You're actually upset. You
just said what you believed.

249
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,578
I also believe in patients
making their own choices.

250
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,951
Because it lessens your
guilt if things go wrong.

251
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,889
You're not protecting their choices.
You're soothing your conscience.

252
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,122
By that logic, a sociopath would make
the best patient advocate in the world.

253
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,229
Am I blushing?

254
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,037
You ready?

255
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,734
Yeah.

256
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,533
Thanks.

257
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,203
You'd do the same for me.

258
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,557
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

259
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:34,856
You think I'll be better in
time to pitch in the playoffs?

260
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,623
Maybe next season.

261
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,432
We should have told him.

262
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,530
He loves his brother, but if he
understood what we were asking of him...

263
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,269
He loves his brother more
than he loves baseball.

264
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,334
You did the right thing.

265
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,112
Putting any part of
this decision on him...

266
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,412
It's impossible for you
guys to deal with this.

267
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,952
How's a 10-year-old
supposed to do it?

268
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,131
Canula in place.

269
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,637
Sutures are holding.

270
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,577
We're all set to go.

271
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,945
Switch him over to bypass.

272
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,549
Yeah? I didn't do the surgery.

273
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,990
You woke me up to
tell me that you're lazy?

274
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,120
We biopsied a piece
before we started cutting.

275
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,686
I'm tired. Get to the point.

276
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,924
We didn't replace the valve

277
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,763
because the growth was
fibrous tissue. It wasn't infectious.

278
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,378
<i>We've got to be wrong about...</i>

279
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,734
Oh, God. What?

280
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,014
<i>You know what's
wrong with Matty?</i>

281
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,769
I think Hector's
committed suicide.

282
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:29,921
What are you talking about?

283
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,069
He took some pills.

284
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,634
Is he alive?

285
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,408
He ate half my stash.

286
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,407
Of course he's...

287
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,458
He's stoned. I'll be right in.

288
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,965
We cut all the way
into this kid's heart,

289
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,766
and all we got was this lousy,
non-infectious fibrous tissue.

290
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,397
How did we miss this?

291
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,409
Matty had a fever. He got sicker when
we suppressed his immune system.

292
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,842
That all points to infection.

293
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,711
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not
our fault. Fibrous tissue.

294
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,647
Something is turning his
healthy heart valve into gristle.

295
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:17,884
Fibrous tissue, enlarged spleen,
fever... Could mean autoimmune.

296
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,359
Autoimmune diseases aren't
passed along in bone marrow.

297
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,897
He can still donate. We
confirm, I do the surgery.

298
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:28,526
Lupus and Behçet's are our best
bet. Do an ANA and pathergy test.

299
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,695
Or it could be infection.

300
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,570
My memory's not
what it used to be,

301
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,005
but didn't we just rule
that out eight seconds ago?

302
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,918
Just because it's not
what screwed up his valve,

303
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,420
it doesn't mean it's
not in his system.

304
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:42,108
Uh-huh, and has the obvious
advantage of making us right all along.

305
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,343
Little disadvantage of
making big brother dead.

306
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,045
That's your argument?
A better outcome?

307
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,177
It fits.

308
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:50,553
The family has one kid with
leukemia and one with autoimmune.

309
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,167
I wouldn't stand next
to them in a rain storm.

310
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,319
That's your argument?
It sucks for them?

311
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,487
It fits, and we can
still help big brother.

312
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,940
National Marrow Registry came
up with four out of six donors.

313
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,593
Six out of six is two better
than four out of six, right?

314
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,431
I mean, I know two is so small,

315
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,062
but since it means that he's gonna
get Graft-Versus-Host Disease,

316
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:09,564
the marrow will attack his
body, and he'll die a painful death.

317
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,341
Find out what autoimmune it is.

318
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:23,181
Is this autoimmune better or
worse than the new heart valve?

319
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,885
It depends on which autoimmune it is.
With early detection, most are manageable.

320
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,359
How long will testing take?

321
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,805
That's the other
good thing about this.

322
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,829
There's literally thousands
of possible infections,

323
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,026
but only a handful of
autoimmune conditions.

324
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,693
We'll have the
answer in a few hours.

325
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,236
Hey, Doctor?

326
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,638
Is this bad?

327
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,944
Wanna catch a movie?

328
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,349
It's one in the morning.

329
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,012
I know a place.

330
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,989
Although, I wouldn't
recommend wearing those shoes.

331
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:01,619
How exactly does a dog
unscrew a bottle of pills?

332
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,785
Is that a riddle?

333
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,353
It requires an opposable thumb.

334
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,523
I must have left it off.

335
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,657
On the floor?

336
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,343
I think he hopped up
onto the bathroom counter.

337
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,733
He has arthritis.

338
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,435
Not me this time.

339
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,033
No! It's your damn dog.

340
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,244
He chews everything. I was
missing a file. Found paper in his stool.

341
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,341
An original Sun Record
78 Elvis recording, gone.

342
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,216
Who the hell chews
vinyl? He's vindictive.

343
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:32,487
He's had a good,
long life. It's his time.

344
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,026
Are you okay?

345
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,688
I just tripped over
Wilson's self-righteousness.

346
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,459
What do you got?

347
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,200
Matty's negative for
everything. It's not autoimmune.

348
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:43,600
So, we're back to infection.

349
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,969
Nick's starting to deteriorate fast.
He's got bruising all over his arms.

350
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,473
His capillaries
are leaking blood.

351
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,018
If it happens in his
brain, he's dead.

352
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,739
We've got to go with
the four-out-of-six donor.

353
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,515
Did I mention my concerns
about four being less than six?

354
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,017
Wilson's first wife
ignored a similar issue.

355
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,485
Of course, that time, it was
only fatal to their marriage.

356
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,353
It's either that, or we start
randomly testing Matty for infections.

357
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,914
I know how you hate
the word "random."

358
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,860
Do it alphabetically. We're
not doing that damn transplant.

359
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,192
Where's Foreman?

360
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,823
We've found a donor.

361
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,961
It's not an ideal match, but four
out of six still gives Nick a chance.

362
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:28,843
A partial match transplant
is extremely dangerous.

363
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,075
Doctor Foreman explained...

364
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,779
Did he also explain what sort
of pain your son will experience

365
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,412
if he gets
Graft-Versus-Host Disease?

366
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,648
Yes.

367
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,191
Apparently, he didn't
explain it vividly enough.

368
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:40,258
Let me give it a whack...

369
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:44,957
He also explained that if we did nothing,
Nick could start bleeding into his brain.

370
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,229
Matty is a perfect match. Just give
us a little more time to figure out...

371
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,360
How much time?

372
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,268
Doctor House is the
best diagnostician...

373
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,136
How much time?

374
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:56,935
I don't know.

375
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:01,447
And Nick can start bleeding
into his brain without any warning?

376
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,449
Yes, but the chances of
complications from a mismatch are...

377
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,576
My boys have suffered enough.

378
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,445
Get Matty better,

379
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,855
and give Nick the transplant
from the new donor.

380
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,190
Foreman screwed us.

381
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,633
No, you screwed us.

382
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,838
What is the point in being
able to control people

383
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,999
if you won't actually do it?

384
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,703
It's like training a dog and letting
him go on your rug, which, by the way...

385
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,722
Once Foreman got his mitts on
them, well, there was no way...

386
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,581
You don't explain chances
and probabilities, you lie to them.

387
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,570
You tell them Foreman's a moron,
which isn't even much of a lie right now.

388
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,678
You've got to talk to him.

389
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,031
I've got no problem
with what Foreman did.

390
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,251
He undercut us, and he
may have cost that kid his life.

391
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:48,988
Foreman did what he thought was
right. You, on the other hand, sucked out.

392
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:50,171
When the decision
really mattered,

393
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,187
you didn't have the guts
to tell them what to do.

394
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,665
If that kid dies, it's because
Foreman was wrong,

395
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,861
and because you're a coward.

396
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,032
Oh, goodness, I've
left my door open.

397
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:40,206
My poor dog must have run away and
been hit by a car or a truck or a train.

398
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,242
Or an anvil.

399
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,160
Thank God, you're still here.

400
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,489
He's still here!

401
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,265
Where's my stereo?

402
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,958
How are you feeling?

403
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,260
A little itchy.

404
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,030
It's weird, huh?

405
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,936
You still have no idea
what's wrong with me,

406
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,997
but those meds
will make me better.

407
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:46,774
We put you on a variety of medications
that will fight all kinds of infections.

408
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:51,609
Nick, you know exactly
what's wrong with him,

409
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,549
but maybe he's
gonna die, anyway.

410
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,247
Hopefully, the
new marrow will...

411
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,414
I can't go in there, can I?

412
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,025
Your infection would kill him.

413
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:09,396
So, I won't be able to be
with him when he dies?

414
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:14,329
You'll be able to be with
him when he gets better.

415
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:18,704
What's wrong?

416
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,075
It really itches.

417
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,451
Hello?

418
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,636
Why am I meeting you here?

419
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,867
You're paying for my
new cane. It was your dog.

420
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:51,308
So, that's it? You call
me a coward, life goes on?

421
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,709
Apparently. You showed up.

422
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,046
Hey.

423
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,719
I'm sorry.

424
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:11,906
You're pathetic. I
didn't actually mean that.

425
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,954
Yes, you did.

426
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,966
No, I didn't to infinity.

427
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,126
Yes, you did.

428
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,499
You're pathetic. Yeah?

429
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,498
When?

430
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,599
What did the labs say?

431
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,117
Why don't you buy your
cane at a medical supply store

432
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,311
like a normal cripple?

433
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,354
Fewer bitching choices.

434
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:38,420
Okay. What do
you got in bitching?

435
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,254
Right this way.

436
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,890
That was Cameron. The kid that
wasn't all that sick is now all that sick.

437
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,955
He's bleeding out of
his ears. Blood counts?

438
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,500
Down.

439
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,035
Schistocytes on the smear?

440
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:53,800
His body's not making new blood
cells. His bone marrow's crashing.

441
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,966
This is one of our top sellers.

442
00:27:56,575 --> 00:28:00,137
It's a little too Marilyn
Manson in a retirement home.

443
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,976
The meds are suppressing
his bone marrow.

444
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,141
Or the infection's doing it.

445
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,445
Pretty cool.

446
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,886
Genuine bull penis,
stretched over a metal rod.

447
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,487
Penis canes are murder.

448
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,518
Right.

449
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,223
Let me see the one on the end.

450
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,458
You got it.

451
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,863
We need to stop Matty's meds.

452
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:24,233
If the marrow rebounds, it's the
meds. If it doesn't, it's an infection.

453
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,566
And if it's the infection?

454
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,698
Maybe I was wrong about
which kid's gonna die.

455
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,172
Bitching.

456
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,536
Flames?

457
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:02,302
It makes it look like I'm going
fast. Now, how's our dying kids?

458
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,419
Nick's developed blisters
all over his feet and legs.

459
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,537
He's got grade four
Graft-Versus-Host.

460
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,376
Increase his dosage
of methylprednisolone.

461
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,313
Already did. It's not working.

462
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,146
Feeling guilty?

463
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,484
I did the right thing.

464
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,079
Always a comfort.

465
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,282
Okay, what's the
other kid's status?

466
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,383
We're done with Nick?

467
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,723
God is done with Nick.

468
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,695
We know what he has.
We know how to treat it.

469
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,097
We're doing it, it's not
working. Life is for the living.

470
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,568
Matty's been off his meds for a few
hours, but his blood count's still tanking.

471
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:33,833
Means the meds aren't
to blame. It's the infection.

472
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:38,070
If we don't get this under control,
his blood will literally turn into water.

473
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,806
Cultures still aren't
growing anything.

474
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:44,906
Why not?

475
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:49,512
Because you did the right thing.
Convinced the parents to treat the kid.

476
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,557
All you did was yank the
weed out of the ground.

477
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,253
Its roots are still killing their
beautiful lawn. We just can't see it.

478
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,125
If we can't see it, we
don't know what it is.

479
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,222
If we don't know what
it is, we can't kill it.

480
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,695
So we got to wait for
it to grow back again.

481
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,367
Now, the soil is arid.

482
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,570
So with he and his brother
we'll be dead by the time...

483
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,683
What if the dandelion
was in fertile soil?

484
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,619
What if we take the roots from
Matty, and put them in Nick?

485
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,159
Turn the kid into a
petri dish, only better.

486
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,887
A petri dish can't
tell you when it hurts.

487
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,156
You want to give him
his brother's infection?

488
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,808
The very thing we've been trying
to avoid since the brother sneezed?

489
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,266
Leukemia kid's got no defenses.

490
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,768
Which is why he'll die.

491
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,805
But before he does, the
infection will spread fast.

492
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:43,808
Fast enough to tell us what it
is, in time to save his brother.

493
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,106
Do you see any other way?

494
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:57,279
The infection is decimating
Matty's bone marrow.

495
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:04,160
But if we give that marrow to Nick, his
symptoms could let us diagnose Matty.

496
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,494
But, it'll kill Nick. Yes.

497
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,699
You're...

498
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,293
You're saying we should
kill one son to save the other?

499
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,804
Nick is gonna die either way.

500
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,183
You don't know that. I mean,
he's in pain right now, but...

501
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,006
Nick's Graft-Versus-Host is
not responding to medication.

502
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,872
That can change.

503
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,410
Maybe he... He'll rally.

504
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,316
Hey, my Nick is a fighter.

505
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,286
Graft-Versus-Host
isn't gonna go away

506
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,913
because of Nick's sunny
smile and positive outlook.

507
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,426
Nick has survived three
reoccurrences of his leukemia.

508
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,826
He's being torn apart
from the inside out.

509
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,297
His pain's gonna get worse
and worse, until he dies.

510
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,527
You're just dragging it out.

511
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,501
You have only one
decision to make.

512
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,902
You can leave here
with one dead son, or two.

513
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,048
Tell them.

514
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,146
You should let us do this.

515
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:13,325
No!

516
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:20,268
We're not giving up on Nick.

517
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:24,067
Not!

518
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,659
The patient's parents apparently
don't want to be parents anymore.

519
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:46,687
You're a sneaky bastard. Any
ideas how we get around this?

520
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,233
Court order? It's hardly sneaky.

521
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,962
We can still save Matty.

522
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,869
Run more tests, find out what
infection is destroying his marrow.

523
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:56,375
Ten-thousand possible infections
at least 20 minutes per test

524
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:58,041
it'll take you
approximately eight years.

525
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,511
Actually, four months, assuming
the last one I test is the right one,

526
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,140
and, if it's the first, it will take
me approximately 20 minutes.

527
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,878
He's right. It's worth a shot.

528
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:09,718
He's timid. Testing blindly
is not gonna save this kid.

529
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,189
But standing around here will.

530
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:44,753
Wow, he sure is hurting.

531
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:47,793
The nurses say he maxed
out on his pain meds.

532
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,123
If I had a nickel for
every time I heard that...

533
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,166
Pharmacy's on the ground floor.

534
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,304
I'm gonna go get you some
more pain medication, okay?

535
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,863
Thank you.

536
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,989
It's not gonna help.

537
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,760
You're dying.

538
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:28,330
Nothing's gonna change that. These
drugs will just make you go easier.

539
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,828
I know.

540
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:35,138
Fourteen years on the planet,
most of them spent suffering.

541
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:41,543
Dying before you
even got to drive a car,

542
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:44,515
take off a girl's
bra, drink a beer.

543
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,444
Believe me, there's
plenty you haven't done.

544
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,483
Really good stuff.

545
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,686
Must make it hard
to believe in God,

546
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:02,132
or fairness, larger purpose.

547
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,699
But your life doesn't
have to be meaningless.

548
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:11,306
You can save your brother.

549
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:15,840
How?

550
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,484
Negative for CMV.

551
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,077
Negative for amoebas.

552
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,145
House called you timid.

553
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,850
He's called me a lot worse.

554
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:29,156
To him, there is nothing
worse. He's gonna fire you.

555
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,957
Even if we run 100 tests,

556
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,555
that only gives us a one percent
chance of saving these kids.

557
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,624
Better than zero. You
don't care if you get fired?

558
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,724
I don't know.

559
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,841
There's got to be a way to better our
odds from a 99-percent chance of death.

560
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:40,895
You've got to know.

561
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,464
It's not food-borne, because
no one else in the family is sick.

562
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,219
You either care about
your job, or you don't.

563
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,788
And Matty's the only one who drank
from that water pump in the back yard,

564
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,452
and we eliminated
<i>Pseudomonas</i> and cholera.

565
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,746
If you care, you fight to
keep it. If you don't, you quit.

566
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,612
I thought they
lived in the suburbs.

567
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,156
They do. Why?

568
00:35:58,223 --> 00:35:59,521
And they've got a water pump?

569
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,464
Please, I... I want to do it.

570
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:10,263
No, Nicky, it's
not your decision.

571
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,367
I'm dying. There's nothing
that's gonna change that.

572
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:20,401
Hey, hey, hey. Don't say
that. Okay? You can't give up.

573
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,010
It's time for me to go, Dad.

574
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,414
You got to let me go.

575
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,913
No.

576
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,524
Please, son.

577
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:41,158
I can't... I can't... I can't!

578
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:48,400
Let me do it for Matty.
Let me do it for you guys.

579
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,568
So you won't be alone.

580
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,779
Are you sure?

581
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,721
No, but he is.

582
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,429
Get Nick back to the clean room.

583
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,124
The parents
agreed to infect him.

584
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:17,033
We figured out what's wrong
with Matty, histoplasmosis.

585
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:19,003
Well, what is that?
I mean, why did it...

586
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,902
Fungal infection. It
grows in chicken feces.

587
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,983
The dirt that Matty used
to build his pitcher's mound

588
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,771
must have sat
under a chicken coop.

589
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:27,677
Your whole neighborhood
was built on top of farmland.

590
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,457
We didn't test for it
earlier, because we didn't...

591
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,712
Can you fix him?

592
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:35,049
Full course of amphotericin
and he should be fine.

593
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,554
And Nick? I mean, can
you clean Matty's marrow?

594
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:44,725
Just like you were talking about doing
it, but do it fast, and get it into Nick.

595
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,891
I'm sorry, the reason
Matty is so sick is

596
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:52,062
because the infection
is attacking his marrow.

597
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:56,802
He doesn't have enough left to safely
take from him and give to his brother.

598
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,146
I'm gonna get
better now? That's it?

599
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,085
That's it.

600
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:10,554
And what about Nick?

601
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,823
Your brother was willing
to risk his life to save you.

602
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:23,391
Are you willing
to do that for him?

603
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:28,496
I can't sedate you.
You're too sick.

604
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:12,546
Please, please stop. Please.
Please. You're done, right?

605
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:15,109
Sorry, I need a lot more.

606
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:18,523
No, stop! Stop!

607
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,362
How much heat are you
taking from the parents?

608
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:32,563
They're calming down.

609
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:36,870
I think it has something to do with both
their kids being alive, awake, and eating.

610
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,069
The marrow transplant took.

611
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,537
Welcome back, Foreman.

612
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:42,740
You should talk to him.

613
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,373
Tell him how proud I am?

614
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,350
Hey, if you're ashamed
of him, tell him that.

615
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:52,118
Pride and shame only apply to people we
have a vested interest in, not employees.

616
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,310
How many hours a day do
you have to spend with someone

617
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,759
before they're basically family?

618
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:56,954
Good point.

619
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:00,328
But, first, I've got to tell Cameron and
Chase that they're violating God's will.

620
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,392
I'm just asking you to have an
adult conversation to let him know...

621
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,995
That he did a good
job? He knows it.

622
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:12,103
Adults don't need adult conversations,
just like I don't need this conversation.

623
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,171
Have you killed Hector yet?

624
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,508
Obviously not.

625
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,346
Oh. He's quiet. He's...

626
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,279
Is that my stethoscope?

627
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,014
Bad dog.

628
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,955
Listen...

629
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:34,899
Bonnie joined her homeowner's
association and staged a coup.

630
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,091
Pets are now allowed.

631
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,436
Oh.

632
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,095
If you want to keep him,

633
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,835
she wants a new puppy
anyway. She'll understand.

634
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,843
Why would I want to keep him?

635
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,606
You're sure?

636
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,250
Come on, boy.

637
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,860
Accidents happen.

638
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,361
Candy?

639
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,402
Good boy.

640
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,326
Good boy.

641
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,873
You did good.

642
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,181
I did what you would have.

643
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,124
Well, maybe I'm biased, but...

644
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,352
I tortured the kid.

645
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,691
Because you knew it was right.

646
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,958
You knew you were
saving his brother.

647
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,563
I know.

648
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,826
I don't like that I know.

649
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,906
I hate that I can listen
to a kid screaming in pain

650
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:26,934
and not even take a moment to
question whether I'm doing the right thing.

651
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,841
I hate that in order to
be like you, as a doctor,

652
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,714
I have to be like you
as a human being.

653
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,618
I don't want to turn into you.

654
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,190
You're not.

655
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:46,828
You've been like me since
you were eight-years-old.

656
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,932
You'll save more
people than I will.

657
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,542
But I'll settle
for killing less.

658
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,503
Consider this my
two weeks’ notice.
