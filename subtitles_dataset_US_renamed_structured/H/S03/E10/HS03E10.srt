1
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,465
Merry Christmas.

2
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,110
And a happy go to hell.

3
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,305
What's he doing
here? Is he with you?

4
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,450
Detective Tritter and I...

5
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,083
We worked out a deal.

6
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55,054
Already got a lawyer.
Get out of my office.

7
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,918
I told him I didn't write
those prescriptions.

8
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,692
I spoke with the DA.

9
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,992
He agreed to two months in a rehab
facility in exchange for a guilty plea.

10
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,033
Get out of my office.

11
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,298
No jail time.

12
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,772
Right. So I should get locked
up in some place I don't belong

13
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,353
in order to avoid getting locked up
in some other place I don't belong.

14
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,176
I got you on forgery,
fraud, enough drugs to...

15
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,738
No sanctions to
the medical board.

16
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,306
And you get your car back

17
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,909
and your bank accounts and
your precious tumor-ridden patients.

18
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,852
I did this to help you.

19
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,549
Next Christmas,
buy me a sweater.

20
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:31,251
You punched out an employee!

21
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,770
You nearly cut a little girl in half
because you were too strung out...

22
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,319
I was in pain!

23
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,778
You need to believe
that I've got a problem

24
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:45,000
so that your betrayal
has the illusion of nobility.

25
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,371
But you just
selfishly... Knock it off.

26
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,536
Look, I don't care why
Dr. Wilson is doing this.

27
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,074
And right now, it makes
no difference to you, either,

28
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,777
'cause you need to deal with
the reality of your current situation.

29
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,946
You want to stand on
principle, you end up in a cell.

30
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,082
And you end up never
practicing medicine again.

31
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:09,222
So you got two choices,
your principles or your life.

32
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,736
Get out of my office.

33
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,747
The DA put a clock on the deal.

34
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,211
You got three days to decide.

35
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,954
House! Just give me a
minute. You're afraid of the pain.

36
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,496
You're not?

37
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,431
You can still have
pain meds in rehab.

38
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,628
Tramadol, gabapentin.
Those don't work.

39
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,738
They will once you're
weaned off the Vicodin.

40
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,832
Look, there's Jesus.
Better go tell the Romans.

41
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,638
Fine, run to Cuddy.

42
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,008
You don't think she's
going to support me on this?

43
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,748
Well, the stitches are healing
nicely, there's no sign of infection.

44
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,148
Whoa.

45
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,586
Sorry.

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,693
Just need her for a tiny moment.

47
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,763
Small favor.

48
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,295
Pills.

49
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,561
Who's the wit?

50
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:59,003
Doctor. Don't worry,
I'll be firing him soon.

51
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,874
Wait in my office.

52
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,144
Incision looks just big
enough for a chest tube.

53
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,443
Collapsed lung? Someone
mistake you for a piÃ±ata?

54
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:11,474
Delightful. Usually we just get
the elf jokes this time of year.

55
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,753
No on trauma.

56
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,889
Negative PPD.

57
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,321
What flavor dwarfs are you guys?

58
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,828
My daughter and I both
have cartilage-hair hypoplasia.

59
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,363
Think you can make
a pun out of that?

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,457
Yes. But I don't
want to be insensitive.

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,869
She's got a bit of a
short fuse, doesn't she?

62
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,805
It's a bleb. Wait in my office.
Bleb's not a diagnosis, it's an evasion.

63
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,604
We'll schedule an
MRI to make sure,

64
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,801
but a certain number of
these cases are idiopathic.

65
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,472
Let me translate that
into Tolkien for you guys.

66
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,013
It means Dr. Cuddy's got no idea

67
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,712
why your daughter's lung
suddenly popped like a balloon.

68
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,414
You think you do?

69
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,924
Gimme her chart. And my pills.

70
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,520
Santa needs us.

71
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,027
Did you get that looked at?

72
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,799
I'm fine.

73
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,896
Great. I just admitted a
cartilage-hair hypoplasia dwarf.

74
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,569
Fifteen years old...
What are you going to do?

75
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,604
I thought I'd get your theories, mock
them, then embrace my own. The usual.

76
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,673
Wilson told us he ratted.

77
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,776
Your choice of verb, I take it?

78
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:23,313
It's appropriate. He betrayed
you. And you should take the deal.

79
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:28,360
Unexplained lung collapse and
anemia. Cuddy thinks it's idiopathic.

80
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,421
"Cuddy" and "idiop" being the
relevant parts of that sentence.

81
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,797
Well, I'd say TB, but
Cuddy's already ruled it out.

82
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,631
Then you'd be just
as big an idiop as her.

83
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,068
Don't you people
know your dwarfs?

84
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,436
There are over 200
varieties of dwarfism,

85
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,117
each with different
medical complications.

86
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,906
You can't expect us to be
intimately familiar with all of them?

87
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,809
The sick dwarfs
sure expect you to.

88
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,372
Cartilage-hair hypoplasia. They
have compromised immune systems.

89
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,315
Gold star for Cameron.

90
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,577
For extra credit,

91
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,263
explain to the special
needs section of the class

92
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,552
why our patient's negative
TB test is irrelevant.

93
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,251
A PPD involves planting a
fragment of TB under the skin

94
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,022
to see if the immune
system recognizes it.

95
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,995
Because of a compromised
immune system,

96
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,225
our patient could have
TB but not recognize it.

97
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,392
The little people love you.

98
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,398
Let's go see a dwarf
about a gallium scan.

99
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,298
Gallium is a
radioactive isotope.

100
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,686
It travels through your veins,

101
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,771
allowing us to see any bright
spots that might indicate infection.

102
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,915
I'm 4'1". That's
1.5 canes in metric.

103
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,845
You don't look a
day over four feet.

104
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,323
I saw in the file that her
dad was normal-sized.

105
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,020
It's average-sized.

106
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,495
Compared to you,
I'm sure it was huge.

107
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,054
So did he have a fetish,

108
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,862
or did he just fall in love
with your long-legged soul?

109
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,393
He grew up in the circus.
Said I reminded him of home.

110
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,699
Seems like you're
the one with the fetish.

111
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,538
I'm certainly curious
about the logistics.

112
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,941
Did you stand on a table?

113
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,172
House!

114
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,245
Pretty much, he'd
lay flat and spin me.

115
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,375
Mom.

116
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,852
So, Abigail, you want to
hop up on the table for me?

117
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,653
That's going to be tough.

118
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,751
Oh, I'm sorry. Let
me give you a boost.

119
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,125
Stop treating
her like she's five.

120
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,275
Just bring over a stool
and let her climb up herself.

121
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,824
Mom, it's okay.

122
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,267
I was just trying to be helpful.

123
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,768
She also hates Jews.

124
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:21,868
I've dealt with worse.

125
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,571
Being different, you get
used to people's idiocy.

126
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,978
Still beats the hell out
of actually being an idiot.

127
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,177
What?

128
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,385
Care to go for a spin?

129
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,085
What the hell were you thinking?

130
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,653
You didn't think ratting out
this hospital's best doctor

131
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,790
merited checking
with your boss first?

132
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,834
I didn't rat him out.
I got him a deal.

133
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,130
Which he'll never take.

134
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,797
He will if we... How long
have you known House?

135
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,671
Did you think he'd suddenly
become reasonable?

136
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,052
I made the deal. It's done. You
can either keep yelling at me,

137
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,836
or you can help me
avoid a complete disaster.

138
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,437
It already is going to
be a complete disaster!

139
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,278
He's not going to take the
deal. He's going to go to jail.

140
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,751
Because he's a child,
he's too stubborn.

141
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,050
When a child misbehaves,
what do you do?

142
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,987
You take away
something he loves.

143
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,422
We can't take away his Vicodin.

144
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,323
Not only will he be in
pain, he'll start to detox.

145
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,262
And we tell him the only way to
get the pills back is to take the deal.

146
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,525
He won't be able to function.

147
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,657
That's the point.

148
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,567
You going to explain
that to his patient?

149
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,538
What choice do we have?

150
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,704
Gallium scan shows no
bright spots of any kind.

151
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,715
Means it's not TB
or any other infection.

152
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,809
There are no bright spots
'cause the whole thing's too bright.

153
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,649
Except for the liver.

154
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,690
The tech over-exposed the
image a bit, but it's nothing.

155
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:44,918
The liver looks fine.

156
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,789
Could be lung cancer.

157
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,725
Tumor causes structural
damage. The lung caves in on itself.

158
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,162
Also explains the anemia.

159
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,961
Doesn't explain the
liver problem, though.

160
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,298
Her lung collapsed.
There is no liver problem.

161
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,979
Did you guys look at
the liver on this thing?

162
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,232
There's no liver problem.

163
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,738
Seriously, look at the liver.

164
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,741
- There's nothing there.
- Why not?

165
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,037
Because there's nothing wrong?

166
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,568
Every organ in this scan is
lit up like a hundred-watt bulb.

167
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,083
Except for her liver, which
is hovering around 60 watts.

168
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,880
And not one of them good
60-watters, but an energy saving...

169
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,631
You're saying her liver's shutting
down because the lighting is off?

170
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,385
You just don't want
a cancer diagnosis,

171
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,035
because then you'd
have to deal with Wilson.

172
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,187
Lung cancer is a lame diagnosis.

173
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,628
Avoiding Wilson
is an added bonus.

174
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,626
House, we need to talk.

175
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,224
Not taking the
deal. Glad we talked.

176
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,499
Ultrasound her liver.

177
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,035
Sit down.

178
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,601
Stand up.

179
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,134
Your turn.

180
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,938
House, you're off the case.

181
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,672
Your treatment
privileges are suspended

182
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,373
until you accept Tritter's deal.

183
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,891
Well, I'm obviously not
going to take the deal

184
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,248
just so I can have the
fun of treating a dwarf.

185
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,877
So, I assume there's
more to this threat.

186
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,684
I'm also cutting off your
Vicodin. That could work.

187
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,385
I'm taking over as attending.
Get an MRI of her lungs.

188
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:53,791
This is not lung cancer.

189
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,921
We'll find out as soon
as we MRI her lungs.

190
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,731
You're going to come
begging me to save this girl

191
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,934
long before I come
begging you for pills.

192
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,374
I hope not.

193
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,009
For everyone's sake.

194
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,517
This is wrong.

195
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:26,048
Cutting House off? It might
not work, but it's not wrong.

196
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,095
Bone windows look clean.

197
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,596
Abigail, we need
you to hold still, okay?

198
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,224
<i>Can I come out?</i>

199
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,278
Just hang in there two more
minutes, and we'll be done.

200
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,361
Okay.

201
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,235
Because it's effective
doesn't make it right.

202
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,265
Cuddy's bending the rules to
get a patient to do the right thing.

203
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,921
Who would work for a doctor like
that? And the ends justify the means?

204
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,938
If the ends involve us
keeping our jobs, sure.

205
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:53,752
Lung parenchyma's clean.
No masses, it's not lung cancer.

206
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,117
Abigail, you okay?

207
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,357
House was right.
Her liver's failing.

208
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,835
Endoscopy confirmed the vomiting
was caused by variceal bleeding.

209
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,635
Blood work also confirms
House's hypothesis.

210
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,938
I get it. House was right,
it's the liver. Let's move on.

211
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,775
What causes liver disease
and a collapsed lung?

212
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,339
Schistosomiasis, the parasite
could have... There's no eosinophilia.

213
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,580
Cirrhosis could explain...
Could be a hepatoma.

214
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,487
She's 15. It's not liver cancer.

215
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,020
It's not unheard of.

216
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,321
Cirrhosis fits better. The
question is, what caused it?

217
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,831
Could be hepatitis, Budd-Chiari...
Or drugs and alcohol.

218
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,628
If anyone has reason to dull
the pain, it's a teenage dwarf.

219
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,100
I'll do a liver
biopsy to confirm.

220
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,764
And I'll search the patient's
home for drugs and alcohol.

221
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,506
Cameron, got a moment?

222
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,111
What exactly is your
problem with me?

223
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,916
Hepatoma is a weak diagnosis.

224
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,853
So this is all about the case?

225
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,051
What else would it be about?

226
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,921
I made this deal to help him.

227
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,258
And helped yourself
at the same time.

228
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,064
This is not about my practice.
This is not about my car.

229
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,264
I gave both of them up to help House
and I would have gone on without them,

230
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,459
if he hadn't almost maimed that little
girl and if he hadn't punched out Chase.

231
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,374
Was it an easy choice?

232
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,709
Of course not. But it's right.

233
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,748
Then why wasn't it easy?

234
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,573
Because he's my friend.

235
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,314
It's obviously complicated...
It's complicated?

236
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,982
When you decided to talk to Tritter,
your life got a million times better.

237
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,219
How do you separate that out?

238
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:44,389
How do you pretend your windfall
isn't relevant to this decision?

239
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,463
It was the right thing to do.

240
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:53,671
You pretending your motives
are pure is why I have a problem.

241
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,513
Where's Cuddy?

242
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:12,457
In this drawer. It's a rescue mission.
I've got it under control, you can leave.

243
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,360
You were right
about the liver failure,

244
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,008
the patient had variceal bleeding,
which suggested cirrhosis, but...

245
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,625
Off the clock.

246
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,580
You predicted this. You
obviously saw something.

247
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,001
Obviously.

248
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,072
Liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis
but it showed sclerosing cholangitis.

249
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,271
Even weirder, there's no
increase in alkaline phosphatase.

250
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:36,214
Medical mystery. Sounds like
the kind of thing I'd be good at.

251
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,154
Breaking and entering sounds like
the kind of thing you'd be good at.

252
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,714
I take it that's where Cuddy's
been keeping your pills.

253
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,094
One theory, one drawer.

254
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:54,993
Really?

255
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,697
I thought you'd be all for
this "torture House" plan.

256
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,295
It works, therefore it's good.

257
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,250
On the other hand, I don't
want to talk you out of this deal

258
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,514
by pointing out your hypocrisy.

259
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:06,172
So, patient's life at stake,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

260
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,848
Forget about the specific nature of
the liver dysfunction, it's irrelevant.

261
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,886
The dwarf's problem is global,
that's why the gallium scan was bright.

262
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,664
And it's going to spread throughout
her entire body unless you stop it.

263
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,056
If that were true, more than her
lungs and liver would be affected.

264
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,252
It will be.

265
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,819
It'll spread through the biliary
tree and hit her pancreas next.

266
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,831
Stop retracing your
steps, get ahead of it.

267
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,494
Forget the liver and focus on
the pancreas because after that...

268
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,313
Actually, after that it doesn't
really matter what it hits

269
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,705
because, pretty much, all
roads lead to a dead dwarf.

270
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,706
I get why you don't
want to go to rehab.

271
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,747
But only an idiot goes to
prison for being stubborn.

272
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,945
Only an idiot stands between
Ahab and his whale. Move.

273
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:57,857
Sorry.

274
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,101
Santa's got gifts.

275
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,772
Olive oil wasn't in the kitchen,
it was in the medicine cabinet.

276
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,107
Home remedy for ear infections.

277
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,546
Ear infections are fairly
typical among CHH dwarfs.

278
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,345
Or, it's a symptom.

279
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,443
Certainly wouldn't indicate
a pancreatic problem.

280
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,148
Or House is wrong
and it's a symptom.

281
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,654
Laxatives. I don't think they were
used to maintain her girlish figure.

282
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,751
Again, intestinal
problems are common.

283
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,989
Again, it might be a symptom.

284
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,657
Glucosamine suggests
chronic joint pain.

285
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,702
Who ordered an alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency test?

286
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,031
I did.

287
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,829
You think the problem's
in her pancreas?

288
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,397
I think it will be. I think we
need to forget about the liver.

289
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,501
We just forgot about the lungs,
now we need to forget about the liver?

290
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:48,139
We need to stop retracing our
steps and get ahead of this thing.

291
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,778
House, you've tanned.

292
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,363
You don't think I could
have come up with this?

293
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,685
Did you?

294
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,367
You suspended House because it'd
be dangerous having him in charge,

295
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,391
but getting his opinion?

296
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,952
I'm sure he gave you that opinion simply
because he was worried about the patient?

297
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,896
Just because House wants his
pills, doesn't mean his theory is wrong.

298
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,424
No, the test results mean
that. Your test was negative.

299
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,733
And the biopsy indicated
severe duct inflammation.

300
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,706
Do an ERCP to check the
liver for bile duct cancer.

301
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,835
Just because it wasn't alpha-1
doesn't mean the pancreas isn't next.

302
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,573
You needed an
organ, he needed a fix.

303
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,344
He'd have made up any story for a pill.
You didn't give him anything, did you?

304
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,441
No.

305
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,593
There's no bruise or
nothing, but it really hurts.

306
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,759
Unfortunately, that pain and lack of
bruising is typical of a zygomatic break.

307
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,301
Sounds bad.

308
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,469
Bones are aligned properly.

309
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,150
Which ER did you go
to after the car accident?

310
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,633
Princeton Plainsboro.
Here's my discharge slip.

311
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,640
Okay.

312
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,239
I'm going to get you some
acetaminophen with codeine.

313
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,807
I tried that, it makes
me nauseous.

314
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,314
There's a drug called gabapentin

315
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,051
which is good for certain
kinds of pain. Great!

316
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,649
'Cause I haven't slept in days.

317
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,957
Gabapentin's not really
going to help with the sleep.

318
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,028
Oh.

319
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,428
Is there something
else you can give me?

320
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:18,768
Vicodin's your best bet with
sleep issues. Well, thanks so much.

321
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,139
Unfortunately, our policy forbids
prescribing opiates to new patients.

322
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:26,075
Well, how could a clinic have
a rule against relieving pain?

323
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,047
Just with opiates. We find that
it helps weed out drug-seekers.

324
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,584
You think I'm a drug-seeker?
I'm not saying that.

325
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,677
Well, then give me
the Vicodin. I can't.

326
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,244
Because you think
I'm a drug-seeker.

327
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,414
I just said I didn't.

328
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,823
No, you said that the policy
was to stop drug-seeking.

329
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,691
Then you said I'm not a
drug-seeker. Policy doesn't apply.

330
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,958
I'm sorry, that's the policy.

331
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,989
Gabapentin works
on nerve damage.

332
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,126
You're prescribing
it for a broken face.

333
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,431
Might as well hand out
Band-Aids for a severed carotid.

334
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,631
You're a doctor.

335
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,197
Not by this clinic's definition,
since I'm neither a moron,

336
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,708
nor a mindless drone!

337
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,038
Security. Forget it.

338
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,977
I'll throw myself out.

339
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:09,081
That tube is going all
the way down to my liver?

340
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,454
Don't worry, you'll be sedated.

341
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,386
Sometimes doctors
have to do things

342
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,860
that make people
uncomfortable to help them.

343
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,362
But we always want to
respect the patient's wishes

344
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,162
and not shove things
down their throats.

345
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,630
Foreman.

346
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,165
You haven't given
her the sedative.

347
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,264
No.

348
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:30,971
Abigail.

349
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,770
Abigail.

350
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,074
She's unconscious.

351
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,375
Check her airway.

352
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,275
Airway's clear.

353
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,751
Her breath smells fruity.

354
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,919
Diabetic ketoacidosis.

355
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,719
Hang an insulin drip at
.1 mgs per kg per hour!

356
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,159
Her pancreas is failing.
You ready to call House yet?

357
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,334
You were right. The
patient's pancreas is failing.

358
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,434
Told you you'd come
begging me for help.

359
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,773
Her insulin production
is almost non-existent.

360
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,008
Give me my pills or lose an arm.

361
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,777
The girl is dying!
So give me my pills.

362
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,876
Take the deal and I will.

363
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,751
You'd rather kill this girl
than give me my pills?

364
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,923
I would rather lose
one patient now

365
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,293
than the dozens we will
lose while you're in prison.

366
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:30,092
Well, have fun explaining that
to her itsy-bitsy grieving mother.

367
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,206
What if we sacrifice this girl
and House still goes to jail?

368
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,871
I'd feel bad. Can
we get on with this?

369
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,711
House correctly
predicted the spread,

370
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:47,345
means we've got a global systemic illness
affecting lungs, liver and pancreas.

371
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,819
So far. Ideas?

372
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:52,120
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
attacks multiple organ systems.

373
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,491
Histiocytosis usually starts in the
brain, then moves to the internal organs.

374
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,224
Abigail's brain is
fine. Cystic fibrosis.

375
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,697
Exocrine function's normal.

376
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:03,395
Hodgkin's lymphoma. It's a systemic cancer,
which her dwarfism predisposes her to.

377
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,665
You have any ideas that
aren't cancer? Cancer fits.

378
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:06,762
Autoimmune fits better.

379
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,283
We should treat her
with prednisone for lupus.

380
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,519
That'll spike her blood sugar
and put her back in a coma.

381
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,521
It's much safer just to run a
double-stranded DNA test.

382
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,140
Not if she dies before
we get the results.

383
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,443
One of you is probably right.

384
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,075
Why don't we hold the
sniping until we find out which?

385
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:23,589
Wilson, do an LP for lymphoma,
you guys run an antibody test for lupus.

386
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,824
Because of your daughter's dwarfism,
we've had to pick a higher entry point

387
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,094
for the lumbar puncture,
which increases the risk.

388
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,227
So, why not do
the lupus test first?

389
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:41,240
In the interest of time, we think
it's best to proceed on both fronts.

390
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,640
You have no idea what's
wrong with my daughter.

391
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,679
We have several theories.
What does Dr. House think?

392
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,215
He's... He had to go home sick.

393
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,342
My daughter may be dying and
he's gone home with the sniffles?

394
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,545
Well, he's not...

395
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,612
He was the only one who seemed to
have any idea what was wrong with her.

396
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,056
He better be really damn sick.

397
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,286
He is.

398
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,256
Unless you've got
Vicodin, go away.

399
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,136
House, it's me, I...

400
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,702
Oh, God.

401
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,802
I don't have... No pills?

402
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,910
No eggnog.

403
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,308
What happened to your arm?

404
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,651
Cut myself.

405
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,856
Wilson was wrong about lymphoma.

406
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,988
Kid's not losing any
weight, no night sweats.

407
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,964
Cuddy send you? No.

408
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,102
She doesn't trust me
not to give you pills.

409
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,234
Is she right?

410
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,103
House, these cuts
are straight, in a row.

411
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,100
You did this on purpose.

412
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,209
Cutting releases endorphins,
endorphins relieve pain.

413
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,816
You going to get me some pills?

414
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,411
No.

415
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,614
Well, then you can leave.

416
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,917
No constitutional
symptoms means...

417
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,759
As soon as the kid gets cured,
Cuddy's got no pressure to fold.

418
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,858
You really think
she's going to fold?

419
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,734
Autoimmune fits
better than cancer.

420
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,279
But lupus loves kidneys.
Usually attacks them first.

421
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,077
Kidneys are fine, right?

422
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,274
Yeah.

423
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,709
House,

424
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,877
take the deal.

425
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,614
You can survive without Vicodin.

426
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,657
After you were shot, you
stayed clean for months.

427
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,723
Yeah.

428
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,226
I wonder if it had something
to do with the absence of pain.

429
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:44,627
Leave that. I want to be able to pour
alcohol on it so I can distract myself.

430
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,132
Then you can rip
off the bandage.

431
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,206
Kid been sick lately?

432
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,799
There's a history
of ear infections.

433
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,703
See, Abigail's immune system

434
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,410
is like a shy guy in a bar.

435
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:10,050
The ear infections, they come
in and they try to coax him to...

436
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,893
To hell with the metaphor.

437
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,360
You get the point, right?

438
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,988
Nerd gets drunk,
trashes the bar.

439
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,228
One of the autoimmunes
triggered by a minor infection?

440
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,362
Factor in her age,
elevated sed rate, anemia...

441
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,337
It's Still's disease.

442
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,640
We start her on prednisone,
methotrexate, cyclosporin.

443
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,873
House.

444
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,380
Stop this.

445
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:39,613
Please.

446
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,567
What'd he say? Still's disease.

447
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,907
It's chronic, but manageable...

448
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,039
A diagnosis that's
virtually unconfirmable

449
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,643
and with a treatment that's more dangerous
than what we were considering for lupus.

450
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,512
How bad is he?

451
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,885
Are you asking because you care

452
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,926
or because you're wondering
whether to trust his opinion?

453
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,119
Both.

454
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,685
He's detoxing. In agony.

455
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,557
He's started cutting himself.

456
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,764
But he's still House.

457
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,496
I'll order the treatment.

458
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,724
Your plan isn't working.

459
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,959
Two days down, one to go.

460
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,633
Figured I'd show you
how much it isn't working.

461
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,907
Yeah. Clearly, the drugs
have no hold on you.

462
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,039
We both know that my pride

463
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:15,013
far surpasses my instinct
for self-preservation.

464
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,811
You want to redeem
yourself? Give up now.

465
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,784
And you'll go to jail.

466
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,188
I've done nothing wrong.

467
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,188
And you'll go to jail.

468
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,885
Which makes this your last
chance to do me a kindness

469
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,260
before ruining my life forever.

470
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,233
Nausea's bad this time.

471
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,701
You can write me a scrip for
metoclopramide so I can stop puking.

472
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,072
They'd give me that in rehab.

473
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,574
Then you should go to rehab.

474
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,710
I have a patient.

475
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,431
I'm so sorry, I know it's little
solace, but he went without pain...

476
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,669
House?

477
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:20,704
Well, look on the bright side.

478
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,307
At least you don't have to go
by Mrs. Zebalusky anymore.

479
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,675
That's got to be a relief.

480
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,415
You know this man?
I'm sorry, he's sick...

481
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:33,118
You hear my diagnosis
on the dwarf? Still's disease.

482
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,996
Did you even consider
those ear infections,

483
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,359
or you just wrote it
off as a dwarf thing?

484
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,659
Are you sure he's dead?

485
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,757
Because Dr. Wilson
sometimes misses things.

486
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,914
Trying to embarrass me in front of a
grieving widow crosses lines that even...

487
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,996
Right. I'm pathetic.

488
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,508
I'm strung out, I haven't
slept, puking every hour,

489
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,272
and I still out-diagnosed you.

490
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,888
But I'm supposed to let
you decide what's best...

491
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,107
Please.

492
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,216
Please leave.

493
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,446
Sorry.

494
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,084
I'm done.

495
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:07,653
House!

496
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:13,775
You didn't come in here
just to embarrass me,

497
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,768
you can do that any time.

498
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,971
Stealing Oxy from a dead man.
Yeah. You don't have a problem.

499
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,514
How's the girl?

500
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,989
Much better.

501
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,819
House was right.

502
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,260
It happens.

503
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,961
I thought we could handle this.

504
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,365
Still's disease never
crossed my mind.

505
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,598
Don't beat yourself
up, I didn't get it, either.

506
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,779
I feel like a mob informant.

507
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:12,685
You want to go inside? Got
a cafeteria in there, right?

508
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:15,185
I can't testify.

509
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:21,000
Drug addicts hurt the people
around them with their habit.

510
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,503
House has hurt plenty
of people. You included.

511
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,802
He saves lives. People
that no one else can save.

512
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,669
And, no matter how
much of an ass he is,

513
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,503
statistically, House is a
positive force in the universe.

514
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,711
Pills let him do that.

515
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,277
Vicodin does not
make House a genius.

516
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:45,916
Whatever he does on
the pills, he can do off.

517
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,756
He is just not willing to try.

518
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,960
I won't testify against him.

519
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,036
Then we'll subpoena you.

520
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,296
Your previous statement
will be read into evidence

521
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:04,173
and you'll be charged with
interfering with an investigation.

522
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,869
And you will go to jail.

523
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,214
Again, statistically,

524
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,355
better me than him.

525
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,824
Statistically, the two
of you will be in jail.

526
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,257
Dr. Cameron?

527
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,424
Come quick, there's
something wrong with Abby.

528
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,677
It can't be too severe, her
cardiac alarm didn't go off.

529
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:05,193
It's not her heart.
She's bleeding.

530
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,700
Picking up a scrip
under Zebalusky.

531
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:19,685
This is Dr. Wilson's patient.

532
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,744
Yeah. Wilson's busy right now.

533
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:28,183
What with Mr. Zebalusky dying in agony
on account of his metastatic lung cancer

534
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,286
and not having the
pills to relieve that agony

535
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:32,763
because of some
moron pharmacist.

536
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,124
Sign the book.

537
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:08,363
The bleeding wasn't a ruptured eardrum,
ear infection or bleeding disorder.

538
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,561
Her heart rate's climbing,
blood pressure's dropping,

539
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,366
she's on the verge of
a multi-system failure.

540
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,306
Head CT was clean, means
it's not a neurological problem.

541
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,434
Basically we have nothing.

542
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,171
The cancer's still on the table.

543
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,338
Spinal fluid was
negative for lymphoma.

544
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:22,506
What other... Leukemia.

545
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:23,981
We need to do a
bone marrow biopsy.

546
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,649
None of the blood
tests suggest leukemia.

547
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,686
Cancer doesn't explain
the collapsed lung.

548
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,086
Unless a small clot led
to a pulmonary infarct.

549
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,249
It's a long shot. Autoimmune
is way more likely.

550
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,268
Autoimmune diseases respond
to steroids, which we've given her.

551
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,471
And she got better for a while,
we stopped the treatment too soon.

552
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:37,519
Because she crashed.

553
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:42,034
All we're doing is bouncing back and
forth between cancer and autoimmune.

554
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,001
We're going in circles.

555
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,539
Give me half an hour.

556
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,555
Can I have a French fry?

557
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,883
Get your own.

558
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,858
You took the last ones.

559
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,487
What's wrong with you?

560
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,327
I've got spinal
muscular atrophy.

561
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,128
I guess it's not contagious.

562
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,802
Nice bear.

563
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,598
It's a dog.

564
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,199
House, it's not Still's.

565
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,779
Steroids helped until the patient
started bleeding from the ears and mouth.

566
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,048
It's a bear.

567
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,512
His name is Bill. He's a dog.

568
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,583
You win, you can have Vicodin.

569
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,754
Words have set
meanings for a reason.

570
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,124
If you see an animal like
Bill and you try to play fetch,

571
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,389
Bill's going to eat you.

572
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,794
Because Bill's a bear.

573
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,661
Are you on something?

574
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,133
You got your hands on pain meds.

575
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,236
Bill has fur, four
legs, and a collar.

576
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,205
He's a dog.

577
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,367
It's between cancer
and autoimmune.

578
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,877
See, that's what we
call a faulty syllogism.

579
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:03,347
Just because you call Bill a
dog, doesn't mean that he is

580
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,345
a dog.

581
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,558
We got to x-ray
our patient's leg.

582
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,520
Her leg looks fine.

583
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:20,964
Weird, huh?

584
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,862
Why aren't you detoxing?

585
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,300
Willpower.

586
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,897
What... What...

587
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,839
Normal's not normal
if you're not normal.

588
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,842
Did you just take a pill?

589
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:31,933
No.

590
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,747
So how does a dwarf have
completely normal growth plates?

591
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:39,008
It's impossible. We must
be missing something.

592
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,947
How many pills have you taken?

593
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,681
Not nearly as many
as I'm going to take.

594
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,383
I'd forgotten how
delicious they were.

595
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:46,686
I didn't give them to him.

596
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,284
Can we forget my vices,
get back to my virtues?

597
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,624
We were missing the fact that

598
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,029
just because we called her a
dwarf doesn't mean she is a dwarf.

599
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,068
Everyone assumed she
was, because of her mother.

600
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,898
There's no test
for CHH dwarfism,

601
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:01,133
so she lost an identity,
but we gained a symptom.

602
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,537
If she doesn't have
skeletal dwarfism,

603
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:08,842
then her short stature must be
caused by a growth hormone deficiency.

604
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,058
And something's wrong
with her pituitary gland

605
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,082
and based on her size,
it's been wrong for a while.

606
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:16,088
So what connects a
long-term pituitary issue

607
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,283
with problems in the
lungs, liver and pancreas?

608
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,089
You guys and your bickering.
Cancer versus autoimmune.

609
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,823
Obviously, you think
it's something else.

610
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,593
Nope. I think it's both.

611
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,964
Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

612
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,362
Also known as,

613
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,531
"You got your cancer in
my autoimmune" disease.

614
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:36,905
The immune component
responded to the Still's treatment,

615
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,286
led to the short-term
improvement.

616
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,642
The cancer portion didn't.

617
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,511
We dismissed this earlier, because
there were no neurological symptoms.

618
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,073
Yeah. It's not your fault.

619
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,984
The only neurological
symptom was her height.

620
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,954
Who could have noticed?

621
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,263
This is your pituitary gland.

622
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,235
This is the granuloma
that's been crushing it.

623
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:08,433
No pituitary equals no growth
hormone, equals about that much.

624
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,936
She's not a dwarf?

625
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,303
Just hormonally challenged.

626
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,279
What about my mom?

627
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:19,182
Your mom's the real deal. But
you're just a tiny little poseur.

628
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,718
Your recent ear infections
caused your body to release

629
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,221
a cascade of the same cells
that made the granuloma.

630
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,258
They attacked your lungs,
moved on to your liver,

631
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,452
then hitched a ride
over to your pancreas.

632
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,392
We can nuke them with
a mild course of chemo

633
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,693
and then remove the granuloma.

634
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:35,666
And then what? What
will happen to her then?

635
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,633
Well, let me see if I
can make this clear.

636
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,105
This pill represents

637
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,102
a pill.

638
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,304
And my mouth represents
your daughter's mouth.

639
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,014
We deposit the
pill in the mouth.

640
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:59,121
You may never be tall
enough to play in the WNBA,

641
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,456
but you should be able to
post up your mom, no problem.

642
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,427
What if I don't take the pills?

643
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,600
What if you remove the thing in my head
and give me the chemo, but not the pills?

644
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,830
Would I still get better?

645
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,600
Your body needs growth
hormone for lots of things.

646
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,868
Like

647
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,304
to grow.

648
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,440
I like who I am now.

649
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,211
Nobody your age
likes who they are now.

650
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,475
I do.

651
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,545
You like needing help when you
want something off a high shelf?

652
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,965
Not being able to press an elevator
button above the eighth floor?

653
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,925
Having to smell ass every
time you stand in line?

654
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,722
You don't need growth hormone.

655
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,730
It's just your ticket
out of the freak show.

656
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,273
Can't you deliver a diagnosis

657
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,814
without making her feel
that her life isn't worth living?

658
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,315
I'm trying to help her.

659
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,818
You're trying to
make her taller.

660
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,353
Not too tall.

661
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,317
Just tall enough to
wipe her own butt.

662
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:09,920
Are you high?

663
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,553
Higher than you.

664
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,758
If my daughter doesn't
want to choose the easy path,

665
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:15,960
I won't force her to.

666
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,094
Then you're a lousy mom.

667
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,728
You want your
daughter to be a freak.

668
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,466
We're not freaks.

669
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,068
You want her to
overcome adversity.

670
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,304
Yes. Then why stop at height?

671
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,643
Poke a stick in her eye. Imagine
how interesting she'll be then.

672
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,376
Being little is
not the same as...

673
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,647
You and I have found out
that being normal sucks.

674
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,517
Because we're freaks.

675
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:40,784
The advantage of being a
freak is it makes you stronger.

676
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,227
Now, how strong do you
really want her to have to be?

677
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,026
You told her what
you had to tell her.

678
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,193
Now you tell her you lied.

679
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,934
Even if you didn't.

680
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,505
This is who you
were supposed to be.

681
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,409
You hate normal.

682
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,584
It's not that simple.

683
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:13,354
If I grow, I'll fade
into the background.

684
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,949
I'll be boring.

685
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,656
We'll get you a funny hat.

686
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,461
You could never be boring.

687
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:30,535
You want me to be
like everybody else?

688
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,546
I want you to have what I can't.

689
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,395
Abigail agreed...

690
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,531
Abigail agreed to
take growth hormone.

691
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,263
Who's Abigail?

692
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,971
Your non-dwarf dwarf patient.

693
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,170
Good.

694
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,239
Then the growth
hormone makes sense.

695
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,043
Christmas Eve.

696
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,585
Yeah, I know.

697
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,087
Deal expires tomorrow.

698
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,250
You have plans for tonight?

699
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:22,385
You worried I'm going
to be popping more pills?

700
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,963
Thought you might
prefer people over pills.

701
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:56,456
Hey, Mom.

702
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,890
I guess you guys are
already up at Aunt Sarah's.

703
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,299
I'm sure Dad's in the eggnog

704
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:08,272
and you're probably suffering
through another dried-out turkey.

705
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,208
I just wanted to say,
"Merry Christmas."

706
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,473
House?

707
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,071
Are you okay? I
called three times.

708
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,417
I'm ready to take the deal.

709
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,692
Well, that's off the table.

710
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:16,264
The clock doesn't expire
until... Got new evidence.

711
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,565
We don't need Wilson anymore.

712
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,563
Thing about addicts is,

713
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:25,440
no matter how smart they are,

714
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,746
they are dumb when
it comes to drugs.

715
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:32,277
So, I've been keeping an
eye on the pharmacy log.

716
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,482
Seems some patient of
Wilson's named Zebalusky,

717
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:41,819
managed to pick up his
Oxy prescription after he died.

718
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,463
Jesus walks, huh?

719
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,270
Merry Christmas.
