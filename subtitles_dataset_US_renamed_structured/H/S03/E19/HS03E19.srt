1
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:13,008
Jasper, hold still. Stop
squirming, hold still.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,412
What did he do now?

3
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,576
He got in another fight and I
can't get his nose to stop bleeding.

4
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:20,951
You have to apply much
more pressure than that.

5
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,588
You had to do this today.

6
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:26,422
I got office hours, I'm supposed
to have dinner with the Dean.

7
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,519
You just can't lash out
whenever you get angry.

8
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,188
He said I smelled like a monkey.

9
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,062
Well, you do. You can't
refuse to take a bath

10
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,727
and then hit kids who tell
you that you smell. Damn.

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,360
Don't you think
we should call 911?

12
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,531
This isn't his first
nosebleed. He'll be fine.

13
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,440
Daddy! Hey! Lucy Goosey!

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,738
I'm playing doctor.

15
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,803
So am I. Can you
go back and play?

16
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:49,916
When was this fight?

17
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,646
Over ten minutes ago.

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,347
I feel dizzy.

19
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,698
Maybe you should make that call.

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,350
Okay.

21
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,858
Daddy, look, I can help.

22
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,691
No, no, that's great, honey. Can
you just please leave Daddy alone?

23
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:05,995
One of my kids is bleeding
profusely from the nose. Please hurry.

24
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,697
They're sending an ambulance.

25
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:18,103
Call them back. He'll be fine.

26
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,170
How you feeling,
bud? You light-headed?

27
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,340
Lucy.

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,209
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,352
Lucy? Are you okay? Lucy? Lucy?

30
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,155
Lucy? Lucy, are you okay?

31
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,160
Lucy! Lucy!

32
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,465
Oh, for God's sake.

33
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,668
Stop. Don't move.

34
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,267
The way the soft evening
light catches your eyes.

35
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,334
The gentle caress
of dusk on your hair

36
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,313
as you turn around and leave
my office without giving me that file.

37
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,906
Restrictive pericarditis.

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,143
Boring.

39
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,241
She's in kindergarten.

40
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,288
Less boring. Or Grandma's
been held back a few years.

41
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,380
It's calcified and
she's hypertensive.

42
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,617
Better get her into surgery.

43
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,319
She already is in surgery.

44
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,521
Tricky procedure. It's
gonna take all night.

45
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,325
Sleep tight.

46
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,299
No congenital defects,
no health problems,

47
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,335
but her heart is
strangling itself.

48
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,837
Fascinating. Since the
pathology on the pericardium

49
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,839
won't be back until
after they remove it.

50
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:57,037
Get started on her blood. You can
test for viral infections, bacterial...

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,976
Round up the usual suspects.

52
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,346
Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis,
hemochromatosis.

53
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,612
Heck, go wild.
Do all the -osises.

54
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,210
All taken care of. Sleep tight.

55
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:17,991
This thing is already
all around her heart.

56
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,034
It gets into the
muscle, she's dead.

57
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,932
Best bet's Coxsackie virus,

58
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,233
Parvovirus B19, CMV.

59
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,570
Bacterial infection's more likely
to turn constrictive. It could be TB.

60
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,840
Right, forgot about the part where
she did time in a Russian gulag.

61
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,244
Her hematocrit's elevated.

62
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,624
A few extra red blood
cells means nothing.

63
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:35,946
She's probably just dehydrated.

64
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,628
Yes, and I could assume three
or four things to fit my theory, too.

65
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,596
She's sick! She obviously
hasn't been drinking enough...

66
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,145
Enough!

67
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,982
I take it you two aren't
sleeping together anymore?

68
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,086
We do what House said,
we test for everything.

69
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,690
Good, then I can go home.

70
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,962
Since when does
we not include you?

71
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,765
Well, House is gonna
call us idiots, anyway.

72
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,830
Might as well be
a well-rested idiot.

73
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,542
You guys are idiots.

74
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:08,275
Why? Because we stayed up all night
doing exactly what you told us to do?

75
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,375
No, because you stayed up all night
doing exactly what I told you to do

76
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,528
and have nothing to show for it.

77
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,521
We eliminated dozens
of wrong answers.

78
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:18,457
I asked you what two plus two equals
and a day later you tell me, "Not 25."

79
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,460
Pathology report just got filed.

80
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,019
They found granulomas
in Lucy's pericardium.

81
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,928
Indicates a fungal infection.

82
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:26,958
Nice work.

83
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,160
He went home.

84
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,933
Work smart, not hard.

85
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,075
Find out which fungus.
Biopsy a lymph node.

86
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,374
Take employee of
the month with you.

87
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,279
I would rather
Foreman... I know.

88
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,884
I don't want any more shots.

89
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,686
I don't want any more shots.

90
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,693
Jasper.

91
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,729
Look at me, Goosey.
Squeeze my hand, okay?

92
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,823
This will tell us why you're sick,
so that we can make you all better.

93
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,796
Where would she
pick up a fungus?

94
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,099
Anywhere moist. Around a
pool, locker room, public shower...

95
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,969
She doesn't have any
gym or swim classes.

96
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,201
She doesn't even like
to play with kids outside.

97
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:11,507
You haven't taken any
trips? Gone anywhere new?

98
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,742
It's been hard to get
away since their mom...

99
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,408
Our mom is dead.

100
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,146
I'm sorry. Last
year. Brain cancer.

101
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:27,093
You're gonna stick
that thing in her arm?

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,594
Cool!

103
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,996
The cool part is your
sister won't feel a thing.

104
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,503
Nice necklace.

105
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,306
Thanks. You like video games?

106
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,970
Love them.

107
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,009
That should do it. You okay?

108
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,019
I want my bunny.

109
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,024
Are you being silly?

110
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,394
I didn't know which one to take.

111
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,265
What do you mean?

112
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,997
What's happening?

113
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,375
So. What does the
double vision tell us?

114
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,002
Slit lamp revealed the eye's
anterior chamber is swollen.

115
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,775
Uveitis. Means it's not a post-op
effect and it's not neurological.

116
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,942
It's not fungal, either.
Lymph node biopsy was clean.

117
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,246
So, we're back to square one.

118
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,651
One and a half. We've
eliminated two more conditions.

119
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,452
Yes. Two plus two doesn't
equal 12 or 16, either.

120
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,516
Vision issues plus screwy heart
equals some type of autoimmune.

121
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,028
Lupus and Kawasaki's are the
most common in a six-year-old.

122
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:39,828
Yeah, tough to find a six-year-old
who doesn't have Lupus or Kawasaki's...

123
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,233
Did you look at her knees?

124
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,902
Those knobby things in the middle
of her legs. Any scars or scabs?

125
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,017
What does that
have to do with...

126
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,772
Well, most six-year-olds
hurt themselves a lot.

127
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,609
Crash their bikes, climb
trees, bungee jump...

128
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,615
Dad says she doesn't
like to run around outside.

129
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,480
'Cause running
around outside hurts.

130
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,813
She didn't mention anything...

131
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:03,653
Most six-year-olds are not familiar
with the phrase, "My joints feel inflamed."

132
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,249
So, two plus two equals...

133
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,261
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

134
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,856
We're checking her ANA to confirm
and giving her steroids to fix her vision.

135
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,261
Some idiot gave me two
tickets for a play tonight.

136
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,835
Saved his life.
Apparently worth $186.

137
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,438
Sorry, had to take a leak.

138
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,739
Oh, I didn't know you
were seeing a patient.

139
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,006
It's an exam room. What
did you think I was doing?

140
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,048
What you usually do.
Hiding from Cuddy.

141
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,141
Well, it'd be stupid to do it in
here. There's a patient in here.

142
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,412
You been drinking more?

143
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,851
No, I haven't.

144
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,583
Guy's peeing all the
time. Play. Interested?

145
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,215
Sure. You want
me to pick you up?

146
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,487
Well, I'm not going.
You said two tickets.

147
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,524
You thought this was a date?

148
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,587
Any other symptoms?

149
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,791
My stomach hurts.

150
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,357
I have back pain
and muscle aches,

151
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:52,202
I feel dizzy and I have trouble
concentrating sometimes in class.

152
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,763
I really should...

153
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,206
You want the tickets or not?

154
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,078
Why don't you want to
go with me? It's a play.

155
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,038
Dudes only go to plays if they're dragged
by women they're hoping to see naked.

156
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,709
So, why are you
giving them to me?

157
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,253
Maybe there's someone
you wanna see naked.

158
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,749
All right.

159
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,417
Any fever? No.

160
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,292
Anything in your
pee other than pee?

161
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,592
No.

162
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,996
I'm going to need
a urine sample.

163
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,658
No!

164
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,464
Yeah, that last one
wasn't a question.

165
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,334
You might have diabetes...
I can't pee in public.

166
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,306
We have bathrooms.

167
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:33,178
I can't pee in public bathrooms.

168
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,909
Where can you pee?

169
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,816
I only live a few
miles from here.

170
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,182
I thought arthritis
was for old people.

171
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,020
JRA is an autoimmune disease.

172
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,684
Her body's attacking itself,

173
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,663
causing inflammation in the
joints, her eyes, and her heart.

174
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,959
Is it treatable?

175
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,628
It can be crippling, but it can
also go into complete remission.

176
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,864
Well, the good thing
is we caught it early.

177
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,634
Gives her the best chance
to have a positive outcome.

178
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,231
Dad.

179
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,537
Don't get up, Goosey.

180
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,706
Your stitches.

181
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,002
She's having a stroke.

182
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,281
The stroke was caused by a
clot in her middle cerebral artery.

183
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,509
Started her on tPA.

184
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,795
Should dissolve the clot and
hopefully prevent brain damage,

185
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,414
but we won't know for sure
until she regains consciousness.

186
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,514
Or she has another stroke.

187
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,527
Arthritis, heart disease.
Why can't this kid act her age?

188
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,673
JRA doesn't affect the blood. That means
the clot's a symptom of something else.

189
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,165
It's a symptom of polycythemia.

190
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,327
She's fully hydrated and her blood's
still thicker than pancake batter.

191
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,098
Well, thick blood
explains the stroke.

192
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,848
It could also have caused
an autoimmune response,

193
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,171
which would explain
the JRA kicking into gear.

194
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,573
But what explains
the thick blood?

195
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,271
Lack of oxygen forces the
body to overproduce red cells.

196
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,745
What explains
the lack of oxygen?

197
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,873
Carbon monoxide
fumes, cigarette smoke.

198
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,508
I doubt our patient's a smoker.

199
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,576
Dad could be. He's not.

200
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,450
He says he's not. Hey!

201
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,887
Don't make me turn
the hose on you two.

202
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,150
Chase is right.

203
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,128
You two go check the house,
see if Dad's a closet Marlboro Man.

204
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,527
You're intentionally
punishing us.

205
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,431
By making you do your job?
Does seem kind of cruel, doesn't it?

206
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,711
Take along a carbon monoxide
detector to check for leaks,

207
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,331
and, you, start her on hydroxyurea to
control her red blood cell production.

208
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,340
Dig out a Merck
Manual, Medieval edition.

209
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,969
Tell you how to drain a pint or
two so she doesn't clot again.

210
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,049
Dr. Cameron!

211
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,221
I got you flowers
for helping my sister.

212
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,761
That's so sweet.

213
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,319
Does your dad know
you're down here?

214
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,557
Yes.

215
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:10,602
"Congratulations on
your bundle of joy."

216
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,663
Something you forgot to tell me?

217
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,141
You should take these back
to where you found them.

218
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,677
Okay. Excuse me?

219
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,110
Can you make sure these flowers

220
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,890
and this kid both get
back to where they belong?

221
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:21,938
Sure.

222
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,746
Thanks. Let's go. Come on.

223
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,581
Wait.

224
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,333
So, you're just
draining blood from her?

225
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,121
You're not testing
it? You're not fixing it?

226
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,138
Your daughter's vascular
system is engorged with blood.

227
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,185
Draining some reduces the
chances of another stroke.

228
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,585
We're also starting her on a drug that
suppresses the production of red cells

229
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,021
so we don't have
to keep doing this.

230
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,583
Good chance she'll
make a full recovery.

231
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,219
She hasn't spoken yet.

232
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,321
Give her time.

233
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,431
This your boy?

234
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,337
Where have you
been? Exploring. See ya.

235
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,936
Thank you.

236
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,273
You know you can't just
run off without telling me.

237
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,939
Okay. Can I have $2?

238
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,410
Oven's a long shot.

239
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,420
They'd smell the gas long
before anyone got sick.

240
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,456
Yeah, right. House loves
it when we skip something

241
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,718
'cause it's a long shot.

242
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,787
Why did you take the flower?

243
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,694
Why did you kiss him?
He did something sweet.

244
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,198
He stole flowers.

245
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,632
He's eight.

246
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,063
You're trying to
make me jealous.

247
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:55,006
Yeah, I want you to profess
your love for me. Oh, wait.

248
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,909
You already did that and it
caused me to end our relationship.

249
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,875
You're enabling a
thief and a delinquent!

250
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:10,782
Letters from school. Fights,
detentions, a parent conference...

251
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:14,919
Oh, I know, I know.
Bad boys, hard to resist.

252
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,622
It's a crush. It's harmless.

253
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:19,291
It's never harmless.
So I'm learning.

254
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,566
So, this is us now?
We snipe at each other?

255
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,402
I'm not sniping, I'm
looking for a vent.

256
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:31,934
Her room's directly above the garage.
There's all sorts of CO sources down there.

257
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,707
I found a vent.

258
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,676
I think there's something in it.

259
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,355
This isn't right.

260
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,192
You dumped me. You
don't get to be mad.

261
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,996
We had a really good thing.

262
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,370
You broke the rules. I'm angry.

263
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,572
I'll get over it.

264
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,760
She's being abused.

265
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,735
A bloody t-shirt doesn't equal
abuse. Kids get hurt all the time.

266
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,937
That amount of blood?

267
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,135
Oh, crap.

268
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,268
You two are agreeing again.

269
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,783
Her father's
overwhelmed. Hectic job,

270
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,523
his wife passed away last year, he
could easily be taking it out on the kids.

271
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,675
Or she had a nosebleed
and grabbed a t-shirt.

272
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,275
She's so ashamed of a nosebleed

273
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,786
she has to hide the evidence
in a vent under her bed?

274
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:50,766
She's socially isolated, the brother's
always in trouble, it's classic signs.

275
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,088
But no physical signs.

276
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,525
No marks on her
body, no bruises at all.

277
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,887
What if it's sexual?

278
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,164
We should call Social Services.

279
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,728
Well, this sucks.

280
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,105
Either it's abuse,
or it's not abuse,

281
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,584
which means either it's a
symptom or it's completely irrelevant.

282
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:12,238
Either way, we got to waste
half a day figuring out which.

283
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,512
Full physical exam.

284
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,540
Look for bruises we may have missed,
check her mouth and do a vaginal exam.

285
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,145
We can't do a vaginal exam on a
six-year-old without the dad's consent.

286
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,019
And if he's abusing
her, he'll never say yes.

287
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,924
"Never" is just "reven"
spelled backwards.

288
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,866
Have you been
abusing your daughter?

289
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,231
What? Why would you...

290
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:43,131
We found this hidden
in a vent under her bed.

291
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,786
I don't know anything about this.
Maybe she had a bloody nose?

292
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,343
We need to examine
her for abuse.

293
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,946
You can't really think I... Maybe
you, maybe the school bully

294
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,150
maybe the creepy neighbor.

295
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,955
I'm guessing you're not paying as
much attention as you should be.

296
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,671
Do you even know where
your son is right now?

297
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,631
Yeah, he was here
just... Here a minute ago.

298
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,828
She isn't being abused.

299
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,167
Unfortunately, that
answer doesn't help me.

300
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,365
If you have abused her,

301
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,670
you're obviously gonna
lie about it. I'm not lying!

302
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,539
We need to do a
vaginal exam. No.

303
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,669
She may be dying,

304
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,873
she still can't talk and you're
gonna waste your time with this?

305
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:25,715
Either you consent and we waste a
few hours doing the exam, or you refuse

306
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:29,620
and I call Social Services and they
waste three days doing an investigation

307
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,523
which ends with them
doing the exam anyway.

308
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,403
Okay. I'm gonna look inside
your mouth. Open wide.

309
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,773
I need to look at your chest
and your back next, okay?

310
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,210
I know you can't talk, so
stop me if you get scared.

311
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:08,018
Before you came here, did
anyone hurt you? Make you bleed?

312
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,561
I need to look in your vagina
now. Do you understand?

313
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,033
I'm a doctor, so
it's okay. All right?

314
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,730
Bend your knees, keep
your ankles together

315
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,602
and just let your knees
fall to the side, okay?

316
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,910
Oh, my God.

317
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,609
She has cuts all over her
genital area, like slices.

318
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,549
Some are almost
healed, but some are new.

319
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,052
She could be
doing it to herself.

320
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,588
She's a little
young to be cutting.

321
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,624
She's a little
young for a stroke.

322
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,854
Depression accounts for the cuts,
molestation accounts for the depression.

323
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,572
But do the cuts account for all that
blood? They weren't deep enough.

324
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,225
So she's getting cut, but that's
not the source of the blood?

325
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,632
The other obvious source
is forcible penetration.

326
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,412
The obvious source of
the blood, not the cuts.

327
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,598
There was no tearing,
there's no evidence at all.

328
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,972
So we have no explanation
for the cuts or the blood.

329
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,775
Where is he?

330
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,408
What if our original
assumption was wrong?

331
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,572
Meaning what?

332
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,811
We found a t-shirt covered with
blood hidden in a heating vent.

333
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,318
How do we know it's even hers?

334
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,717
Her dad identified it.

335
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,220
Not the shirt, the blood.

336
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,366
Are those the
urine test results?

337
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,129
Yes. And...

338
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,636
I'm going to ask you
for some blood. Why?

339
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,266
To see if your answer will
be, "I can't bleed in public."

340
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,700
This wasn't your urine, was it?

341
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,416
Why would I give you
someone else's urine?

342
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,913
The usual reason is
because you're on steroids.

343
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,244
I'm not an athlete.

344
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,914
Second favorite reason is
because you're on drugs.

345
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,545
I'm not. I am.

346
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:46,082
Third favorite reason is you have insurance
but your friend Eggs Benedict doesn't.

347
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:50,027
So, Eggs describes a list of symptoms
and you repeat them to a doctor,

348
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:53,464
which is particularly stupid
because this is a free clinic.

349
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,492
Need you, now.

350
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,463
My work here is done.

351
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,803
Am I okay?

352
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,365
Is it diabetes?

353
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,206
No, you're pregnant.

354
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,250
Six-year-old abuse victim and
you haven't called Social Services?

355
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,790
She might've been
abused? That's horrifying.

356
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,656
Why are you wearing extra
concealer under your eyes?

357
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,924
The law's clear. You suspect
abuse, you call the authorities.

358
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,626
You don't proceed as usual while
the possible abuser sits by her bedside.

359
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,034
Dad consented to the exam
which means it's not the dad.

360
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,435
How late were
you out last night?

361
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,475
It's always the dad and
I don't have a curfew.

362
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,170
Panty hamster get
a spin on its wheel?

363
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,572
I went to a play.

364
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:45,379
House, you are going back to your
office. You are picking up your phone,

365
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,717
calling Social Services and you
are reporting suspected abuse.

366
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,381
Do you understand?

367
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,822
What play?

368
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,597
You're trying to
have sex with Cuddy.

369
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,598
Fries? You took her to a play.

370
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,437
You only take women
to plays because...

371
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:13,741
No, you only take women to plays
for that reason. That's your theory.

372
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,809
Okay. Then why did you take
her to a play? She's a friend.

373
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,373
A friend with a squish mitten.

374
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,148
It is possible to have a friend
of the opposite sex without...

375
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,745
Blasphemer!

376
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,758
She's not a friend of the opposite
sex, she's a different species.

377
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,054
She's an administrator.

378
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,770
She's going to eat your
head after she's done.

379
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,660
Yes, I slept with her.

380
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,888
Seriously? No.

381
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,260
Yes, you did.

382
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:39,870
Yes, I did.

383
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,036
Seriously? No.

384
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,737
You've got a problem, House.

385
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:51,379
We just tested the
blood on Lucy's t-shirt,

386
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,749
it's full of endometrial cells.

387
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,749
So it's not her blood.

388
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,687
We tested that, too. It is.

389
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,054
Your six-year-old patient?

390
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,058
It's menstrual blood.

391
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,224
She's started puberty.

392
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:16,437
How can someone start puberty
before they even start the first grade?

393
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,277
She was in diapers
two years ago.

394
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,847
For some reason her body
has too much sex hormone.

395
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,641
It caused her reproductive
system to get confused,

396
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,710
start operating prematurely.

397
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,848
We need to find out the source
of the hormones and cut it off.

398
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,448
She's so young.

399
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:35,951
I haven't even

400
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,921
talked to her about sex.

401
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,096
I doubt she even
knows what a period is.

402
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,898
Girls talk to their
moms about that.

403
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,852
You're gonna be okay, Goosey.

404
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,147
I love you.

405
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,525
I

406
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,221
Want

407
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,292
juice.

408
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,283
She got her period and
didn't know what it was.

409
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,673
She was scared and confused.

410
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,233
A friend told her to put a
t-shirt in her underwear.

411
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,836
When she started
growing pubic hair,

412
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,404
she snuck Daddy's razor
and tried to shave it off.

413
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,877
Apparently forgot to
sneak the shaving cream.

414
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,249
Tumor's most likely.

415
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,050
A pituitary adenoma would
send her hormone level sky-high.

416
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:39,000
In Puerto Rico, in the '70s, there was
an epidemic of kids growing breasts

417
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,959
because of estrogen
in the poultry.

418
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,996
If it was in the food, it would be
an epidemic. We've got one kid.

419
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:47,397
She's six, she's tiny, she lives
on chicken fingers and milk.

420
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,044
Dad doesn't look like
the type to read labels,

421
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,902
he's probably buying stuff
packed full of hormones.

422
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,372
Excellent argument.
It's a tumor.

423
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,434
There's all sorts of environmental
sources. Pesticides, soy products.

424
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,605
Some shampoos are
basically a placenta in a bottle.

425
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,946
If the tumor's not in her brain,
it's in her reproductive tract.

426
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,576
Get an MRI.

427
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,382
Can I at least...
Waste your time?

428
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:11,083
Wouldn't recognize
you if you didn't.

429
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,561
Frontal cortex is
clean, moving caudally.

430
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,667
For the record, Cameron's
the one who broke it off.

431
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,263
Not interested.

432
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,404
No masses in the hypothalamus.

433
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,344
I wanted more.

434
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,274
She didn't share my feelings.

435
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,976
I feel like I'm in
a similar position.

436
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,748
Pituitary's clean.

437
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,914
You're an idiot.

438
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,824
Either she's lying or she's
actually emotionally detached.

439
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,953
Which one sounds more
like Cameron to you?

440
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,395
Neither.

441
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,432
You have to choose one.

442
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,800
There's a bright
spot on her left ovary.

443
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,539
Looks like a solid tumor.

444
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,315
They printed my letter.

445
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,845
You were right.

446
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,153
Of course I was. What
are we talking about?

447
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,988
They printed my letter. Great.

448
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,221
Cuddy.

449
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,630
You want to see her
naked? No, no, no.

450
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:27,257
She wants to see me naked.

451
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,501
She sent me flowers.

452
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,265
Just thanking you for the play.

453
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,206
See, some people feel
an emotion called gratitude.

454
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,970
There's a card. I suspected.

455
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,307
It explains how you
knew who they were from.

456
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:43,816
"Let's do it again.
Soon. XX, Lisa."

457
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,111
Xs are the kisses, right?

458
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,675
No, I think they're the hugs.

459
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:47,879
I think Os are the kisses.

460
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,445
No, no. The Xs are
definitely the kisses.

461
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,424
"Soon" is its own sentence.

462
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,952
I gotta go!

463
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,763
I'll miss you. You
were a good friend.

464
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,966
They printed my letter.

465
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,440
How was the play, Mrs. Lincoln?

466
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,874
What's up with Wilson?

467
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,070
He's just a little freaked.

468
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,339
Why?

469
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,743
I sent him flowers.

470
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,336
Jasper, you're not
supposed to be up here.

471
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,886
Is that other doctor
your boyfriend?

472
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,554
No.

473
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,777
Your dad's probably looking for you.
He's got enough to worry about right now.

474
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,463
Do you like him?

475
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,505
He's a friend.

476
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,597
Do you like him, like him?

477
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,501
We should get you
back to your dad.

478
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,070
Let me put this down
and I'll take you there.

479
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,810
I could be your boyfriend.

480
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:58,017
I think that wouldn't be fair
to the girls your own age.

481
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,922
He seems like a tool.

482
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,291
He's not. And that's rude.

483
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,330
I'm taking you
back to your father.

484
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:19,809
The mass is small.
About a centimeter across.

485
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,870
Firing the biopsy needle.

486
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:26,946
You nick an artery?

487
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,385
No.

488
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,047
She's in V tach. No pulse.

489
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,717
Charging 50. Clear.

490
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,292
Clear.

491
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,460
Clear.

492
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,866
Arrhythmia must have been
a reaction to the hydroxyurea.

493
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,181
We have to stop
the drug therapy.

494
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,450
Her bone marrow will just go
back to overproducing blood cells,

495
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,618
she'll keep having strokes and
we'll have to keep bleeding her.

496
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,642
Forever.

497
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:56,408
We resect the tumor, hormone levels go
back to normal, her symptoms go away.

498
00:26:56,482 --> 00:27:00,010
Great plan, except for the
fact that her tumor's not a tumor.

499
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,815
It's a benign cyst.

500
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:09,592
If it's not a tumor, that just
leaves an environmental source.

501
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,461
I'm feeling another late night.

502
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,828
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

503
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:18,803
You're kidding me, right? What?

504
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,949
The answer's right there.
It's just a question of finding it.

505
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,771
You don't need me for that.

506
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,554
Don't get the mochaccino

507
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:39,080
they screwed up and put
hot chocolate in the dispenser.

508
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,823
Thank you.

509
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:45,157
You were right. The
eight-year-old kid grabbed my ass.

510
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,893
I shouldn't have encouraged him.

511
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,561
Well, I was a boy once.
I know how they think.

512
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,036
You were a pervert at eight?

513
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,700
Maybe eleven.

514
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,711
I didn't realize you
were gonna get hurt.

515
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,850
I'm sorry I misled you.

516
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,418
You didn't.

517
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,853
You have feelings for me.

518
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,952
You come back to
me again and again.

519
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,523
For sex. It's a simple
physical... Come on.

520
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,567
You have feelings for puppies
and patients that you barely know.

521
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,627
But when it comes to a guy that
you've worked with for three years,

522
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,072
had sex with, spent
the night with...

523
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,475
You telling me you feel nothing?

524
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,505
Absolutely nothing?

525
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:39,074
Get away from her! Don't touch
her! I'll kill you if you touch her!

526
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,552
Jasper! CHASE: Get him off!

527
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,419
He's biting me. Get him off!

528
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:51,963
<i>What is he gonna do?</i>

529
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,226
<i>He stopped and looked
at him from the top rope!</i>

530
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,564
<i>But now he's scaling... No way!</i>

531
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,669
Somebody better be dying.

532
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,376
Lucy's big brother's got a crush on
me, so he bit the crap out of Chase.

533
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,975
<i>And I care because...</i>

534
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,263
Just thought you might want to
know when one of your employees

535
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,949
gets attacked by a sociopath.

536
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,923
<i>Bees or monkeys, yes.</i>

537
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,926
Sociopaths, no.

538
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,325
<i>He doesn't have sense
enough to know he was pinned.</i>

539
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,458
<i>He's not a man, he is a monster!</i>

540
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,126
<i>No way!</i>

541
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,899
<i>We've got to take
another look at this...</i>

542
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,491
<i>That might be what he needed.
Unable to somehow kick out of a...</i>

543
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,578
<i>Hello?</i> He's not a sociopath.

544
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:46,914
How do you know?

545
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,749
<i>He's acting logically.</i>

546
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,619
<i>He's got a crush on you.
He's being aggressive about it.</i>

547
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,522
Not just regular aggressive,

548
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,358
he's out-of-his-mind -
on-hormones aggressive.

549
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,429
You think he's...

550
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:02,559
Better figure out what's killing the
girl, because her brother's got it, too.

551
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,769
Jasper's got a hundred
times more testosterone

552
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,308
than a healthy eight-year-old.

553
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,776
But we scanned his brain
and reproductive tract,

554
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,335
no hormone secreting tumors.

555
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,279
I'm not surprised.
What's more likely?

556
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,409
Brother and sister get the same
type of tumor at exactly the same time,

557
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,919
or they both play in
the same toxic sandbox?

558
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,799
Yes, you would think that if for some
reason you were completely unaware

559
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,468
of the fact we spent the entire night
testing everything from that home.

560
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,256
It was all negative.

561
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,319
You went home?

562
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,957
Good for you. Delegate.

563
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,427
We're not his subordinates.

564
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,765
Making it all the
more impressive.

565
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,362
What if it's genetic?

566
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,133
Well, anyone else think
it's more than a coincidence

567
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,770
these kids have symptoms that
could be caused by a brain tumor

568
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,474
which is exactly
what killed their mom?

569
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,278
You just said there
were no tumors.

570
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,511
We scanned both their brains.

571
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,813
They looked clean.

572
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,444
So did their
mom's, until it didn't.

573
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,149
It can't be genetic. Mom had
none of the same symptoms.

574
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:02,251
Yes, she did, if the symptoms
were pubic hair and menstruation.

575
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,706
That's ridiculous. If menstruation
is a symptom of brain cancer

576
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,323
then I should be
on chemo right now.

577
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:09,596
That's ridiculous. You're way
too skinny to be menstruating.

578
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,159
What if the mom
had other problems?

579
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:15,765
Symptoms her doctors ignored on
account of the fact she was already dying?

580
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,844
Pull all her medical records.

581
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,106
Find any similarities
to our patients.

582
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:26,379
And punch the little brat on the nose so
he doesn't have a stroke like his sister.

583
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,082
I'm not sick.

584
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:31,885
Just trying to
keep you that way.

585
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,222
I want Dr. Cameron to do mine.

586
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,729
Trust me, you don't want
her cutting you right now.

587
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,891
So Jasper's behavioral issues...

588
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:46,268
They could be a function of
the increased testosterone.

589
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:49,536
Hopefully, he'll be a delight
as soon as we figure this out.

590
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,702
My tummy hurts.

591
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,803
It hurts! No, it doesn't.

592
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,677
Don't be such a baby.

593
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,079
My tummy hurts!

594
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:59,948
Where in your tummy? It hurts!

595
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,816
It hurts!

596
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,853
Stomach pain is from
a cyst in her pancreas.

597
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,227
I found two more in her
kidneys and one in her lung.

598
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,095
They weren't there 48 hours ago.

599
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,294
Hormones are making
her body go haywire.

600
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,270
She gets one in her
brain or heart, she's dead.

601
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,803
No pressure, though.

602
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,375
Her mom was perfectly
healthy until she got cancer.

603
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,087
She had none of the
symptoms the kids have.

604
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,013
It's not genetic, it's
not environmental.

605
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,776
It's gotta be a
pituitary adenoma.

606
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,819
Yes! That would make
complete sense if they had one.

607
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:38,653
Just because we haven't found anything
on the scan doesn't mean it's not there.

608
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,550
We should remove
her pituitary gland.

609
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,686
Two siblings, same condition.

610
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,282
It's gotta be genetic
or environmental.

611
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,856
We add in the same time and
we're back to just environmental.

612
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:51,045
Yes, and that would make complete sense
if there was anything in her environment.

613
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,647
Just because we haven't
found anything yet...

614
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:57,439
She's been out of her environment for
four days and she's still getting worse.

615
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,145
I'm getting the
father's consent.

616
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:03,682
No!

617
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,148
We have no evidence.

618
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,880
This is your process, House.

619
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,084
You asked us
what two plus two is.

620
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,685
We've eliminated every
number except for four.

621
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,659
She needs brain surgery.

622
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,033
The ovaries produce sex hormones

623
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,628
in response to a signal
from the pituitary gland.

624
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,766
Since we know the ovaries
are fine, the most likely cause...

625
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,370
"Most likely" means she wants to
root around inside your little girl's brain

626
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,210
without any
guarantee that it'll work.

627
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,250
That's why she's holding
off on doing your son.

628
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:42,344
Dr. House knows that unfortunately
we've ruled out every other option.

629
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,865
We need to resect
Lucy's pituitary before...

630
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,357
Who else visits these kids?

631
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,734
They don't have
any family in town.

632
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,954
You got a girlfriend?

633
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,552
No one visits. School?

634
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,507
They don't go to the same
school. House, I've covered...

635
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,931
Nanny? They don't have one.

636
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:56,764
They go to after-school daycare
but none of the other kids are sick.

637
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:57,996
Yet.

638
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,715
It took your son twice as long to
develop symptoms as your daughter.

639
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,139
Maybe the other
kids are just slow.

640
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,903
We wait and your
daughter may die.

641
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,386
She does this, your
daughter will need

642
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,504
hormone replacement
therapy for the rest of her life.

643
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:11,209
The treatments are extremely effective.
She should lead a relatively normal life.

644
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,047
And isn't that every
parent's dream?

645
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:16,577
To have a kid grow up
to be relatively normal?

646
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,892
My husband died of thyroid
cancer that metastasized to his brain.

647
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,492
I've been there.

648
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,595
I know how
terrifying this can be.

649
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:37,234
And I am telling you this is your best
chance to save your daughter's life.

650
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:44,976
You did not just play
the dead husband card.

651
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,417
My wife died.

652
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:53,720
Because she signed a consent
form that I didn't want her to sign.

653
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,158
Died.

654
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,023
Thank you.

655
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,539
How did you know?

656
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,301
Know what?

657
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,435
That the other
kids weren't sick?

658
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,842
You've been here for four days.

659
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,403
I just...

660
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,779
I would have heard.

661
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:23,919
Right.

662
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,864
Do you have hair on
your special place?

663
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,664
Miss Janie!

664
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,866
Can I help you?

665
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,430
I'm a doctor.

666
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,500
Two of your kids are sick
and I need to know why.

667
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,705
You think they got sick here?

668
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,146
I think you're dating their dad.

669
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,511
He told you?

670
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:56,646
No.

671
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,713
And I don't really
care why he didn't.

672
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,469
I just need to know how often you
go to their house and what you bring.

673
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,759
I don't. Shampoos,
fancy soaps...

674
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,493
Kids get in your bag. I've
never been to their house.

675
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:14,133
They just lost their mom and
we thought it was too soon.

676
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,645
Why are you staring at me?

677
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,045
Lip wax?

678
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,016
I just had it done over lunch.

679
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,917
Mani-pedi? No.

680
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,989
Just the wax.

681
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:36,224
Women get a wax as a part of a
whole self-indulgent beauty ritual.

682
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,264
Pedicures, steam,
cucumber masks.

683
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,164
No one runs out at
lunch just to get a lip wax,

684
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,135
unless you woke up
looking like Yosemite Sam.

685
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,967
You're an ass.

686
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,071
<i>Cameron.</i> It's always the dad.

687
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:57,238
Excess facial hair in women. It's a
clear sign of hormonal imbalance.

688
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,011
Exactly what the
little kiddies have.

689
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,553
Is there something wrong
at the daycare center?

690
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,646
There's something
wrong in your pants.

691
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,196
She's a lot younger than I am. I

692
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,396
use a

693
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,413
male enhancement
cream to keep up with her.

694
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,681
What does this
have to do with...

695
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,183
Never occurred to
you to get a prescription

696
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:25,177
instead of some penis-pumper
loaded with testosterone?

697
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,643
I keep it at the gym.

698
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,306
I apply it daily in the shower
just like it says on the bottle.

699
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,214
It's never been in my home, it's
obviously never been near the kids.

700
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,283
But you have.

701
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,515
We've been through that, I'm
not a pervert or a pedophile!

702
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,218
Thirty percent of our waste
is excreted through our skin.

703
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,260
That sounds high.

704
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,421
It's why you stink
after eating garlic.

705
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:47,398
Jack waters his beanstalk
every day for a week

706
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:51,903
he's oozing bean curd
out of his pores for a month.

707
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,873
Every time you gave the little tykes a
hug you gave them a dose of testosterone.

708
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,900
Small for you, but more than
their little bodies can handle.

709
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:03,981
So...

710
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,577
I did this to them?

711
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,946
Just holding their hands?

712
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,450
Uh-huh.

713
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,463
If I stop using it?

714
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,201
You'll be floppy,
they'll be fine.

715
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:28,763
Give it back!

716
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,071
He'll still be eight.

717
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,592
You okay?

718
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,029
Yeah, I think so.

719
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,298
Talk to Cuddy? No, not yet.

720
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,462
I don't know what to say.

721
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,063
Just be straight with her.

722
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,371
I'm not sure what that is.

723
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,408
I can't stop thinking about her.

724
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,709
In what way?

725
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,684
Maybe she's right. Maybe...

726
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:17,119
Maybe this is worth exploring.

727
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,059
Are you sure that she feels...

728
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,221
She sent me flowers.

729
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:27,455
How do I do this?

730
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,864
What do I say?

731
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:33,234
Cameron would tell
you to say how you feel.

732
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,170
Me? I'd get her drunk.

733
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,644
I'm not gonna say anything.

734
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:45,048
I'm just gonna walk into her
office and I'm gonna kiss her.

735
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,353
That's a bold move.

736
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,987
Cuddy likes bold.

737
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,638
Yeah, you're right, if you spoke,
you'd just say something stupid.

738
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:01,121
Yeah, I mean I'll either
get a girlfriend or get fired.

739
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,302
Okay.

740
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:13,004
Yeah. Okay.

741
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,380
Okay.

742
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,850
You! You! You!

743
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,123
You were gonna let me do that?

744
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,228
You made a compelling argument.

745
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:34,630
You sent those flowers to me!

746
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:38,033
Yes! Because you
took her to a play.

747
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,833
And because, actually, you do
wanna march down there and kiss her.

748
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:41,929
No! I don't.

749
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,269
Yes, you do.

750
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,970
You're right.

751
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,112
Seriously?

752
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:53,146
No.

753
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,352
You're a jerk.

754
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,955
Night, Wilson. Night, House.

755
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:29,014
They're beautiful.

756
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,663
I thought about what you said.

757
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,097
And

758
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,636
I really don't want a
relationship with you.

759
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,935
I know.

760
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,702
I also know you like flowers.

761
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:17,869
I don't get the whole
May-December thing.

762
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,337
Give him a break.
May-October at worst.

763
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:24,069
Well, why can't it
be October-October?

764
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:26,702
May is when things
start to get hot.

765
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:30,980
If that guy wasn't trying so hard to
keep up with a woman half his age,

766
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,712
he wouldn't have
almost killed both his kids.

767
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,811
Guy gets a little
something-something,

768
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,085
couple of kids have
to die... Circle of life.

769
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:41,023
So many people,

770
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:42,651
so much energy and drama

771
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:46,425
just trying to find someone who's
almost never the right person anyway.

772
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:50,457
It just shouldn't be so hard.

773
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,203
I got tickets to a play.
