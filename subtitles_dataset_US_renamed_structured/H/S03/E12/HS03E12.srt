1
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,266
How can I help you
this beautiful morning?

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,899
You got any cases?

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,742
Three. Got a teenage African
American lung transplant...

4
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,907
Next two days you'll be
doing nothing but clinic work.

5
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:15,982
I just said...

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,142
You were lying.

7
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,015
Well, then why'd you ask?

8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,315
Because if you told the truth

9
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,652
I was only gonna give
you one day of clinic duty.

10
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,954
That's dishonest. I refuse
to participate in this...

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,550
You'll do it. You owe me.

12
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,495
I kept you out of jail.
I can put you back.

13
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,226
Perjurer.

14
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,463
Felon.

15
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,104
How can I help you
this beautiful morning?

16
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,542
I told the nurse I
have a runny nose.

17
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,806
But I don't.

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,008
I think I have
syphilis or gonorrhea.

19
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,718
I think I have an STD.

20
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,259
I think I have a...

21
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,799
Who is here for a runny nose?

22
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,571
It's a cold! It'll get
better. Go home.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,143
Those of you who stayed
obviously do not have colds.

24
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,378
You will be assigned to
a doctor who is not me,

25
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,444
because I am tired
of wiping crotches.

26
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,013
House. You're doing this.

27
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,456
It hurts! Sir...

28
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,929
Call security.

29
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,830
Should I get a sedative?

30
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,432
No, I'm good. Thanks.

31
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,409
It hurts! My head hurts!

32
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,825
Need a team here.

33
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,627
I have the
sedative. Little late.

34
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,699
Just in time.

35
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,326
What did you give
him? A paralytic.

36
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:16,665
Why would you do that?

37
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,014
Somebody had to
stop the screaming.

38
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,734
Then he's still in pain.

39
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,468
Yeah. But quietly.

40
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,429
Paralytic's stopped
him breathing.

41
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,208
If he goes hypoxic, he's
gonna be quiet forever.

42
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,446
So either I can continue
to swab people's privates

43
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,956
or I can figure out if
this guy's delirium, pain

44
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,960
and insanely high heart
rate are life-threatening

45
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,019
or just a personality quirk.

46
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,729
I think the latter choice is
the better for all three of us.

47
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,429
He's sedated.

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,492
It took five CCs of haloperidol

49
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,538
to get him down after
the paralytic wore off.

50
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:29,269
So, pain in his right ear, psychotic
behavior and dizziness. Go.

51
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,743
Nurses said he was
holding his head.

52
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,747
How do you know it
was specifically his ear?

53
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,043
Because he was dizzy.

54
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,859
Means the problem was
affecting his inner ear.

55
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,327
Nurses said he was
running in circles.

56
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,580
Doesn't mean he was dizzy.

57
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,019
He wasn't running in circles.

58
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,454
He was running in oblongs.

59
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,514
Looked like a
three-year-old kid drew them.

60
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,459
Acoustic neuroma that
started a hemorrhage.

61
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,893
Explains the pain,
vertigo, everything.

62
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,694
Get an MRI.

63
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,166
What else?

64
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,968
If it explains everything...

65
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,436
Might not explain everything.

66
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,439
Well, what if he
was psychotic first,

67
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,441
then self-mutilated,
damaged the ear.

68
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,737
Excellent.

69
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,971
We need a complete
psychiatric work up.

70
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,445
Your turn.

71
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,477
I was gonna say what Foreman...

72
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,279
Say something else.

73
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,251
He came to the clinic.

74
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,219
Good.

75
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,035
Decent chance he had
a chronic illness first,

76
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,119
especially given
the rapid heart rate.

77
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,594
Lingering ear infection,
pressure builds up in his inner ear,

78
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,893
bursts through the mastoid bone

79
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,209
while he's waiting
in the clinic.

80
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,496
Oh, yes!

81
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,195
Get a head CT.
Draw blood cultures.

82
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,966
Run a chem panel and
get a complete blood count.

83
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,068
Oh, while you're at it, pour
some alcohol into his ear

84
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,077
and take out the cockroach.

85
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,740
He has a cockroach in his ear?

86
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,213
He was scratching that ear

87
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,859
right before the
event, so I took a peek.

88
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,819
My guess is it started biting.

89
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,288
Nothing else wrong with him?

90
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,914
Isn't that enough?
It's pretty gross.

91
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,490
So why are we doing the tests?

92
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,738
Well, it's either that or I
have to keep doing clinic duty.

93
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,922
You can do the tests or
just stay out of Cuddy's sight.

94
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,694
I don't really care which.

95
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,606
Why are you here?

96
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,875
Because it's not a hospital.

97
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,151
It's a jogging park.

98
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,451
You're not jogging.
You can't jog.

99
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,514
I'm watching jogging.

100
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:28,551
I sit and I watch and I imagine.

101
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,993
So what do you watch for?

102
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,308
That guy's running in shorts.

103
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,672
He's not running. He's trolling.

104
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,141
You're good at this.

105
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,851
How long are you
going to stay here?

106
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,153
Beauty of this place is that it's
the last place Cuddy will look.

107
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,195
How can I help you?

108
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,659
The doctors gave me this.

109
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,432
What doctors?

110
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,303
At the other
hospital. Last month.

111
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,808
Do you know what this says?

112
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,677
Yes.

113
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,717
"Patient has a six-centimeter
mass in the right lung.

114
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,087
"Cancerous. Inoperable."

115
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,092
Do you understand
what this means?

116
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,888
Is it okay if I
sleep here tonight?

117
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,996
It's cold outside.

118
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,473
What are you doing here?

119
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,309
I thought House had a case.

120
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,281
He doesn't.

121
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,420
You ordered a CT on a
patient with a bug in his ear.

122
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,620
How did you know I was here?

123
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,322
I ran into Cameron
in the clinic.

124
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,126
"Ran into"?

125
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,961
You ordered
pointless tests just to...

126
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,060
Wouldn't have been pointless
if you hadn't "run into" Cameron.

127
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,229
She got punished.

128
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,648
She's stuck with
another dying patient.

129
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:20,231
Is that Vicodin?

130
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,401
Breath mint. Thought
you were gonna kiss me.

131
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,807
What happened to rehab?

132
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,072
I got out.

133
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,542
It was a scam?

134
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,494
Enough foreplay. Are you
going to kiss me or not?

135
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:34,215
You are going back
to the clinic. Or jail.

136
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,222
You perjured yourself
to keep me out of jail.

137
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,450
How are you going to tell...

138
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,892
I only did that because I
thought you were getting clean.

139
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,823
So it's, "Do clinic
duty or go to jail"?

140
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:44,956
Yes.

141
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,626
Then it'll be, "Finish your
paperwork or go to jail."

142
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,363
"Help with fundraising
or go to jail."

143
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,996
"Do your job or go to jail."

144
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:54,007
I think I'd rather go to jail.

145
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,408
You owe me.

146
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,418
Beautiful.

147
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,981
Thank you. It's dry.

148
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,927
Who cares? It's beautiful.

149
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,628
If my lawn were half as
well-maintained as that,

150
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,326
pigeons wouldn't have
the nerve to poop on it.

151
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,732
Good grooming is important.

152
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,794
Was that a shot?

153
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,873
People do judge you
on your appearance.

154
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,409
When you entered, I noted
your shirt hadn't been pressed.

155
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,411
You hadn't shaved
in quite some time.

156
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,470
I extrapolated you
are a person for whom

157
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,378
detail was not a major concern.

158
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,560
I was worried you might apply
that same standard in your...

159
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,780
Do you use toenail
clippers up there?

160
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,419
They're longer so they allow me

161
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,786
to better reach the upper hairs.

162
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,826
I'm wearing a rumpled shirt and
forgot to brush my hair this week.

163
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,361
You've got athlete's
foot in your nose.

164
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,029
I'm ready to be judged.

165
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:58,004
Okay. 50 dollars to any patient

166
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,098
who's willing to
leave here right now.

167
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,539
Sounds good to me.

168
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,510
House. You can't...

169
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,636
My money.

170
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,544
I don't care. People do not...

171
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,743
If they'll leave for 50 bucks,
they're not all that sick.

172
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,983
Or they're poor and desperate,

173
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,487
which is why this place is here.

174
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,994
If they're that poor, then they'd
rather have 50 bucks than...

175
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,454
Can I have the money?

176
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,356
Look. It's monogrammed!

177
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,487
He doesn't need money.
Ergo, he's not sick.

178
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,156
And the blood?

179
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,324
Could be anybody's.

180
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,129
Monogram's definitely his.

181
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,063
We need to talk.

182
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,307
Doesn't matter what you say,
do or threaten, I will find a way out.

183
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,739
How can we make this
more interesting for you?

184
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,305
How can we make the sky green?

185
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,816
How can we make the tall short?

186
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,478
You cannot make the
uninteresting interesting.

187
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,218
I'll pay you 10 dollars
for every patient

188
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,190
you diagnose without touching.

189
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,422
You pay me 10 dollars for
every one you have to touch.

190
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,663
You're making this
into a game for me.

191
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,291
From which I can only
conclude this isn't a game for you.

192
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,494
No.

193
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,229
Why? You think if I deal with
enough people I'll find some humanity?

194
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,367
Yes.

195
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,878
Why do I have to do this myself?

196
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,910
I got a bum leg. Say, "Ah."

197
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,179
Ah.

198
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,288
Feels rough.

199
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,816
Yes. It's a rash. I'm gonna
need more than "rough."

200
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:30,955
Well, it... It's just
rough. Can't you feel it?

201
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,690
Well, I could.

202
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,166
But then what
satisfaction would you get?

203
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,130
Got it!

204
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,368
Start counting.

205
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,978
How many?

206
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,410
Twenty-six.

207
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:53,748
Okay. Either you suck at math or
you're gonna die in two seconds.

208
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,318
You suck at math.

209
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:04,027
Diagnosis. Prescription.
You owe me 30.

210
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,007
I owe you 10.

211
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,677
Test results are back
for your STD patients.

212
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,345
I'm not paying you for them.

213
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,150
You already touched them.

214
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,586
How old are you?

215
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,753
30.

216
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,197
And you've never seen
an after-school special?

217
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,596
<i>Dawson's Creek?</i>

218
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,465
How do you get to 30 and
not know about condoms?

219
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,697
Oh, God. I have an STD.

220
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,399
No. But you will.

221
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,375
Every patient who comes
in here for an STD test

222
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,035
has one thing in common.

223
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,979
They had SWS,
"sex while stupid."

224
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,774
How old are you?

225
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,847
Sixty.

226
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,618
You're lying, but
that's not the point.

227
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,885
Have you never
seen <i>Dawson's Creek?</i>

228
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,695
And you've never seen
an after-school special?

229
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,797
How do you live to your age
and not know about condoms?

230
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,355
I have an STD?

231
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,799
Yeah. You're actually
the first one today.

232
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,008
Lucky day. Well, not for you, but
you gotta feel good for everyone else.

233
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,112
It's chlamydia.

234
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,047
As bad news goes,
it's about the best.

235
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,887
Oh, settle down. It's treatable.

236
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,686
It's actually curable.

237
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,588
All you gotta do
is take these pills...

238
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,156
Don't touch me!

239
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,406
Oh, God.

240
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,243
I need someone
to cover a patient.

241
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,545
House, you committed to...

242
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,880
She was raped.

243
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,921
You think I'm the
right doctor for her?

244
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,561
We've assigned another
doctor to your care.

245
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,727
I didn't mean to
upset Dr. House.

246
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,862
He knows that. That's
not why we're doing this.

247
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,929
I'd like to keep
being treated by him.

248
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,099
Why?

249
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,665
Just do.

250
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,342
Trust me. It's better if you deal
with somebody who specializes...

251
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,676
I'm fine.

252
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,047
You told Dr. House it's
been less than a week.

253
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,278
You haven't told
anyone other than him.

254
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,479
Emotionally you're still...

255
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,647
You know what I'm dealing with?

256
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,714
You know what I'm going through?

257
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,350
No.

258
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,622
You think Dr. House does?

259
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,798
I'm not suggesting either
one of us be your doctor.

260
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,530
Dr. Stone is a psychiatrist.

261
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,902
If Dr. House is too
busy, I could wait.

262
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,478
Why do you want me?

263
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,111
I don't know.

264
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,716
I don't want to treat you.

265
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,026
You're just saying that
so I'll see the psychiatrist.

266
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,361
True. Except for
the word "just."

267
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,443
I'm saying I don't
want to treat you

268
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,667
so you'll see the psychiatrist

269
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,364
and because I don't
want to treat you.

270
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,474
Why don't you want
to treat me anymore?

271
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,533
I never wanted to treat you.

272
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,738
The fact that you were raped

273
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,810
holds no interest for me.

274
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,317
It's nothing personal.

275
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,911
There's nothing to treat.

276
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,922
You're physically healthy.

277
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,485
Okay.

278
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,696
But I want you to be my doctor.

279
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,127
Why?

280
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,361
I don't know.

281
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,533
You gotta have a reason.
Everything has a reason.

282
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,112
I trust you.

283
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,081
Ah, you see?
That's a bad reason.

284
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,981
'Cause I'll lie to you.

285
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,050
I'll tell you anything just
to get you out of here.

286
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,352
I don't care. I
want to talk to you.

287
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,760
Look, you were raped.

288
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,829
All control was taken from you.

289
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,990
You're trying to find
that control again.

290
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,260
You want me because
I don't want you.

291
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,961
I'm raping you?

292
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,032
In a very non-invasive, more
annoying than traumatic...

293
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,476
Get the hell out of here!

294
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,639
I'll send in Dr. Stone.

295
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,583
I didn't consent to
all of this medicine.

296
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,465
You've been out on the
streets. No treatment...

297
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,357
I'm dying. There is
no treatment for dying.

298
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,394
We can make you comfortable.

299
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,394
Don't want to be. Why not?

300
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,490
Because I screwed up my life.

301
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,627
So you want to punish
yourself for messing up your life?

302
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:15,374
Please, stop the treatment.

303
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,011
It'll go away on its own.

304
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,448
It's not. Can't you...

305
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:25,883
Nope. It'll go away.

306
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,215
It's been all day.

307
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,530
There must be
some treatment you...

308
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,887
Nope. It'll go away.

309
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,119
Or it won't go away.

310
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,058
I read about a treatment.

311
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,062
Some doctor won a prize for it.

312
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,424
I read about it.

313
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,770
You don't have the
hiccups, do you?

314
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,442
Make a note,
"Drug-seeking behavior."

315
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,604
Morphine?

316
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,443
No. Anal digital stimulation.

317
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,351
How long has Stone
been in with her?

318
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:02,917
Are you concerned?

319
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,549
You know how many
people get raped every day?

320
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,253
So it's common,
therefore boring?

321
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,818
If we were to care about every
person suffering on the planet,

322
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:10,896
life would shut down.

323
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,659
How about just the ones we meet?

324
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,810
They deserve our sympathy
more than the other people?

325
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,963
So your solution is not to
give a damn about any of them.

326
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,835
How do you do that?
How do you take that theory

327
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,967
and put it in practice?
You met her...

328
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,410
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Whoa!

329
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:31,641
Hey! I paid these people 50
bucks to leave here an hour ago.

330
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,151
Yeah, we came back.

331
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,687
Then you owe me 50.

332
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,154
The kid needs surgery.

333
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,555
And he could walk way back then.

334
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,320
Stand up, kid.

335
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,626
He swallowed a magnet.
We got to cut it out.

336
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,289
How old are you? Eight.

337
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,599
And he swallowed
something stuck to a fridge.

338
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,261
Darwin says, "Let him die."

339
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,931
If it's already below the
stomach, it should pass on its own.

340
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,132
Strong magnet.

341
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,504
It's messing with the imaging.

342
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,238
We have no way to...

343
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,104
You got x-ray vision, House?

344
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,920
Whoa, whoa! You're gonna
cut him open? Right here?

345
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,363
It's well into the
intestines. He's fine.

346
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,665
I want my 50 back.

347
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,099
I need a crash cart! Stat!

348
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:37,740
What happened?

349
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,843
Pills. Benzos. We need to
get her stomach pumped.

350
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,759
Respiration's shallow.
What did you say to her?

351
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,965
Nothing that would
make her want to...

352
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,066
Heartbeat's irregular.

353
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,370
What did she say
to you? Nothing.

354
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,169
I gave her a couple of
sedatives, turned around,

355
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,271
and she grabbed the whole bottle.
You must have said something.

356
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,457
I said plenty. She said nothing.

357
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,055
I was with her for over an hour.

358
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,828
She didn't say one word.

359
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,488
You gonna do that again?

360
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,370
You're gonna be
okay. Physically.

361
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,539
Which is all that interests you.

362
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,439
But you're here.

363
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,316
Under orders.

364
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,487
Why would you tell me that?

365
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,613
'Cause I don't like hypocrisy.

366
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,358
But you don't have a
problem with cruelty?

367
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,763
Which brings us back
to, why do you want me?

368
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,300
I don't know.

369
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,661
You tried to kill yourself
because you couldn't talk to me.

370
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:05,830
You must have a reason.

371
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,771
Why does there always
have to be a reason?

372
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,672
Can't we just talk?

373
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,878
There's a phone.
Talk to a friend,

374
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,970
a family member.
Call the police.

375
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,116
You want to talk about
what happened to you?

376
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,316
No.

377
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,386
You want to talk
about your STD meds?

378
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,895
No.

379
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,231
You don't really
seem to want to talk.

380
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,631
No, I do.

381
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,597
About what?

382
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,465
I don't know. Anything.

383
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,440
The weather?

384
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,182
You were raped and you
want to talk about the weather?

385
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,509
Yeah.

386
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,518
I'm not gonna talk to
you about the weather.

387
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,864
You help her. She wants you.

388
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,125
God knows why.

389
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,478
She doesn't know what she wants.

390
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,493
She knows she wants you. You were
the first person she spoke to about this.

391
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,647
The fact that I was in the
wrong place at the wrong time

392
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,783
should be trumped by the
fact that I'm useless at this.

393
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,332
No, you're not.

394
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,868
You romantically
wanting to believe that

395
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,879
is never going to make it true.

396
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:23,782
I'm agreeing with you.

397
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,978
You're the last person
she should be talking to.

398
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,115
If she wants to talk about the
weather, talk about the weather.

399
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:33,057
She wants normalcy. She wants
to feel like the world didn't end.

400
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,254
Right. I'll tell her that
everything went on without her.

401
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,559
Babies were born,
people got married,

402
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,793
thousands of people will
remember the day she was raped

403
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,177
as the happiest
day of their lives.

404
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,329
You might not want to
phrase it quite that way.

405
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,047
You need to get her to
talk about what happened.

406
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,883
No, he doesn't.
Pretending it didn't happen...

407
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,466
Wrong. Pretending
this didn't happen

408
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,086
is the best thing she
could possibly do.

409
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,305
She's got to make this real.

410
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,710
No, no. You know what we should

411
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,090
be trying to make
real or process?

412
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,391
The few decent
moments in our lives.

413
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:57,576
Not the crap.

414
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,312
Maybe you're right.
Except there's no way

415
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,013
she can pretend
this didn't happen.

416
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,715
So she has no choice
but to process it.

417
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,892
You've got to tell
me what happened.

418
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,489
You don't really want to hear.

419
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:12,827
Sure I do.

420
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,595
You're lying.

421
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,798
This doesn't have
to destroy your life.

422
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,299
I know.

423
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,171
It doesn't mean
anything about you.

424
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,972
It wasn't your fault.

425
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,472
I know.

426
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,979
You did nothing wrong.

427
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,845
Some jerk hurt you. That's all.

428
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,247
I know.

429
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,919
You're worried that you
can never trust men again.

430
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,045
No.

431
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,199
Statistically, there was always
a chance this could happen.

432
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:39,658
The fact that it did happen
doesn't change anything.

433
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,524
The world doesn't suck any
more today than it did yesterday.

434
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,961
I know all that.

435
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,640
Well, then what do
you want me to tell you?

436
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,224
Nothing. I just want to talk.

437
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:53,332
About nothing. If we talk about
nothing, nothing will change.

438
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,968
It might.

439
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,508
How?

440
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,838
Time.

441
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,548
Time changes everything.

442
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,816
That's what people
say. It's not true.

443
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,218
Doing things changes things.

444
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:12,650
Not doing things leaves
things exactly as they were.

445
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,957
Why do you have to suffer?

446
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,026
I gave my word.

447
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,499
Who would make you promise that?

448
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,972
My father.

449
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,712
He said I would die
alone and miserable.

450
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,073
That's not a promise.

451
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,774
And even if it was, he's dead.

452
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,181
And even if he's not,
he's not going to care if...

453
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,685
Why did your
husband have to suffer?

454
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,952
How do you know
about my husband?

455
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,820
Well, I just know.

456
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,024
You have to die in pain

457
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,623
because of a promise
you made to your father?

458
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,071
If I say "yes," you'll use
that as proof that I'm insane.

459
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,206
Force treatment on me.

460
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,503
Did the nurse tell you
about my husband?

461
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,944
No.

462
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,377
Nurse! Yes.

463
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,183
It's under control.

464
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:26,526
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to freak you out.

465
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,858
Why?

466
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,266
Because I need
you to remember me.

467
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,769
I need somebody to remember me.

468
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,836
Where did you go to college?

469
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,211
Northwestern. You?

470
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,445
Hopkins. What was your major?

471
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,979
Comparative religion.

472
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,350
Why do you trust me?

473
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,854
I don't know. Can't we just...

474
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,151
That's not rational.

475
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,316
Nothing's rational.

476
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,450
Everything is rational!

477
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,221
I was raped.

478
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,456
Explain how that
makes sense to you.

479
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,960
We are selfish, base animals
crawling across the earth,

480
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,836
and because we've got
brains, if we try real hard,

481
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,968
we can occasionally aspire to
something that is less than pure evil.

482
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,914
Has anything terrible
ever happened to you?

483
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,325
What do you want me to say?

484
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,722
You wanted this conversation.

485
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,832
You wanted to talk about
something that matters. Talk.

486
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,933
She's waiting for your answer?

487
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,566
She's asleep.

488
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,468
I sedated her.

489
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,758
Why do you care
what you say to her?

490
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,718
Because I don't know how
to answer these questions.

491
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,482
It's a simple question.
"Has your life sucked?"

492
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,149
Tell her the truth. Tell her
you were shot. Tell her...

493
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,623
She doesn't want
to hear the truth.

494
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,989
She's looking for something.

495
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,323
Looking to extrapolate some...

496
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,885
She's looking to
connect with you.

497
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,673
And that's what's
scaring the hell out of you.

498
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,325
Tell her the truth.

499
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,061
There is no truth.

500
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,527
Are we role-playing?

501
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,038
Am I you? I don't
want to be you.

502
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,007
She's not asking
for test results.

503
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,941
She's not asking what
two plus two equals.

504
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,104
She's asking for my
personal life experience

505
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,205
so she can extrapolate
to all humanity.

506
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,773
That's not truth.
It's bad science.

507
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:30,221
It's not science at
all. Tell her the truth.

508
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,526
Tell her your life
has been good.

509
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,993
It hasn't been.

510
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,030
Tell her anyway. She wants hope.

511
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,261
She wants to know that what
happened to her wasn't the norm.

512
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,665
That things can be okay,

513
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,431
which means maybe they
can be okay for her again.

514
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,638
Tell her your life sucked.

515
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,937
It didn't.

516
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,409
Tell her anyway.

517
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:53,844
She wants to know
she's not alone.

518
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,676
She wants to know
she's gonna survive this.

519
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,409
That other people
have been through this

520
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,111
and worse and come
out the other end.

521
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,210
She wants to know
if she's going to heal.

522
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,585
Act like you've healed.

523
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:07,424
Tell her...

524
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,355
Keep her asleep.

525
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:17,297
Thanks. You all have
been a huge help.

526
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,565
There's no wrong answer.

527
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:21,901
Because there's no right answer.

528
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,906
Wrong.

529
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,502
We just don't know
what the right answer is.

530
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,047
Wake up.

531
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,458
It's not as bad as
what happened to you.

532
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,021
I don't think.

533
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,691
I don't know what
happened to you.

534
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,291
But given how lousy
you're responding,

535
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:52,896
I assume it was worse than
getting abused by your grandmother.

536
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,307
What did she do to you?

537
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,072
Parents traveled a lot.

538
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,877
They'd leave me with her.

539
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,242
She liked things the
way she liked them.

540
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,379
And she believed in discipline.

541
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:10,681
She was right, I suppose,

542
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:13,988
because I hardly ever screwed
up when she was around.

543
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:19,464
Too scared of getting forced to
sleep in the yard or take a bath in ice.

544
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,034
Your turn.

545
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:31,341
Your parents, they
never stopped her?

546
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,577
I never told them.

547
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,341
Why not?

548
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,173
Usual reasons.

549
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,774
I was afraid they
wouldn't believe me.

550
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,843
I was afraid they'd think
I'd done something wrong.

551
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,621
I opened up to you.
You open up to me.

552
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,356
What did you call her?

553
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,488
Oma.

554
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,691
And you kept calling
her that after this?

555
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,031
Dutch for "grandmother."
She was still my grandmother.

556
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,003
And she was still Dutch.

557
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,442
Is any part of that story true?

558
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,014
All of it.

559
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,107
You wouldn't keep
calling her Oma.

560
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,175
Something would have to change.

561
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,413
You don't know me.

562
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,717
You wouldn't keep
calling her Oma!

563
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:17,949
Look, you're over-reacting...

564
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,116
Do not dismiss me.

565
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,591
I'm not dismissing you.

566
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,070
I'm saying you're
not acting rationally.

567
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,995
I'm angry because
you are lying to me!

568
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,621
No, you are... What can I do?

569
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,257
What the hell can I do that
you're not gonna dismiss

570
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,734
as just being
because I was raped?

571
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:35,902
Nothing.

572
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,912
Your story, is it true?

573
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,845
True for somebody.

574
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,512
But not for you.

575
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,253
These things happen.

576
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,586
It happened to somebody.

577
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,388
What do you care if
it happened to me?

578
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,825
They're not in this room.

579
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,260
No, they're out there!

580
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,821
Doctors, lawyers,
postal workers.

581
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,163
Some of them doing great,
some of them doing lousy.

582
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,930
You gonna base your whole life

583
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,630
on who you got
stuck in a room with?

584
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:09,334
I'm gonna base this moment
on who I'm stuck in a room with.

585
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:13,404
It's what life is. It's
a series of rooms.

586
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,681
And who we get stuck
in those rooms with

587
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,047
adds up to what our lives are.

588
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,526
House?

589
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,569
You gotta get me out of this.

590
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,386
There's nothing to
diagnose. There's nothing...

591
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,641
You only tested her for STDs?

592
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:50,272
I had seven morons
who forgot their raincoats.

593
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,818
It's all they asked for so I
didn't waste the lab's time. Why?

594
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,752
I wasted their time.
She's pregnant.

595
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,597
Do you understand?

596
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,676
Are you okay?

597
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,970
I mean, I know you're not okay.

598
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,515
But are you more
or less not okay

599
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,517
than you were five minutes ago?

600
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,110
About the same.

601
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,615
Good.

602
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,954
The termination
procedure isn't pleasant...

603
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,959
I don't want to terminate.

604
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,120
You want to keep the baby?

605
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,687
Abortion is murder.

606
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,670
True. It's a life. And
you should end it.

607
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,238
Every life is sacred.

608
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,177
Talk to me. Don't quote
me bumper stickers.

609
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,839
It's true. It's meaningless.

610
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,678
It means every
life matters to God.

611
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,650
Not to me, not to you.

612
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,684
And judging by the number of
natural disasters, not to God either.

613
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,931
You're just being argumentative.

614
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,514
Yeah. I do do that.

615
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,720
What about Hitler?

616
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,489
Was his life sacred to God?

617
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:10,927
The father of your child?

618
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,294
Is his life sacred to you?

619
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,196
My child isn't Hitler.

620
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,064
Either every
life is sacred or...

621
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,625
Stop it!

622
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,182
I don't want to chat
about philosophy!

623
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:22,674
You're not killing your rape
baby because of a philosophy.

624
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,668
It's murder. I'm
against it. You for it?

625
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,608
Not as a general rule.

626
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,081
Just for unborn children?

627
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,276
Yes.

628
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,024
The problem with exceptions
to rules is the line-drawing.

629
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,327
It might make sense to kill
the ass that did this to you,

630
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,159
but then where do
we draw the line?

631
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,994
Which asses do we get to kill?

632
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,398
Which asses get to
keep on being asses?

633
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,266
The nice thing about
the abortion debate

634
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,134
is we can quibble
over trimesters

635
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:58,109
but ultimately there's
a nice clean line, birth.

636
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,643
Morally there's not
a lot of difference.

637
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,511
Practically, huge.

638
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,685
You're enjoying
this conversation.

639
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,456
It's just the type of
conversation I do well.

640
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,456
But the other type?

641
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,194
The personal stuff?

642
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,694
There are no answers.

643
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,972
And if there are no
answers, why talk about it?

644
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,706
You're healthy. You
shouldn't be here.

645
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,548
I don't want to go.

646
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,584
Fine. I won't discharge you.

647
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,931
Wanna go for a walk?

648
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,135
It's the last of my journey.

649
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,455
You don't deserve pain.
You're just an insane old man.

650
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,607
No. No. I am not going
to watch you suffer.

651
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,240
I need you to remember me.

652
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:12,841
I'll remember you!

653
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:13,977
Why?

654
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,315
Because you're a nice man.

655
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,380
You don't know that. You
don't know anything about me.

656
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,234
Either you were a nice
man or you were an ass.

657
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,988
Either way you did
something to somebody

658
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,756
that they're going to remember.

659
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,297
I have no family.
I have no friends.

660
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,094
I didn't even have a real job.

661
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,863
If I die in peace,

662
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:32,768
then I'm just another patient.

663
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,396
But if I die suffering...

664
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,806
It'll be horrible. Don't
do that to either of us.

665
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:43,042
No. I just need to die knowing
that something is different

666
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,911
because I was here.

667
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,516
Life goes on.

668
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,723
Is that the reason
why we're out here?

669
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,925
Know why I come here?

670
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:37,094
I sit. I watch. I imagine.

671
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,605
Sounds nice.

672
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,705
I imagine that one of
them will break a leg.

673
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,843
Just one false step, one
crack in the sidewalk...

674
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,476
You don't really.

675
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,744
I'm evil.

676
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,484
Evil people don't
say they're evil.

677
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,886
That sounds like
an easy loophole.

678
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,659
People can do good things,
but their instincts are not good.

679
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,262
Either God doesn't exist
or he's unimaginably cruel.

680
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,733
I don't believe that.

681
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,231
What do you believe?

682
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,308
Why do you think this happened?

683
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,303
I don't want to talk about it.

684
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,939
Me neither. Too bad.

685
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,117
You know, I don't think
there was a reason.

686
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,748
So God does exist,
lets you get raped,

687
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,794
needs you to keep your
rape baby for no reason.

688
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,859
Maybe he was challenging me.

689
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,235
He hurts you to help you.

690
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,002
Well, I guess it's better
than because he hates you.

691
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,904
You're trying to convince
me there's no God.

692
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,551
Why would you even
say something like that?

693
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,095
Because you're
throwing your life away.

694
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,611
I'm doing what I believe!

695
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,943
What you believe
doesn't make sense.

696
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,108
This is not helping me.

697
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,878
Then I can't help you.

698
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,654
If you believe in eternity,
then life is irrelevant.

699
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,861
The same way that
a bug is irrelevant

700
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,829
in comparison to the universe.

701
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,159
If you don't
believe in eternity,

702
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,171
then what you do
here is irrelevant.

703
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,833
Your actions here
are all that matters.

704
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,341
Then nothing matters.

705
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,605
There's no ultimate
consequences.

706
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,472
I couldn't live like that.

707
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,586
So, you need to
think that the guy

708
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,178
who did this to you is
going to be punished?

709
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,716
I need to know that it
all means something.

710
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,653
I need that comfort.

711
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,866
Yeah. Are you
feeling comfortable?

712
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,400
You feeling good right
now? You feel warm inside?

713
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,850
I was raped. What's your excuse?

714
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,844
Do you think the guy who
did this to me feels bad?

715
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,744
Would that help you?
Make you feel better?

716
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,612
Why do you always do that?

717
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:19,118
Ask why I'm asking questions
instead of just answering the question?

718
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,216
The answer doesn't interest me.

719
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,486
I don't care what he's feeling.

720
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,190
I'm interested in
what you're feeling.

721
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,062
You are?

722
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:36,934
I'm trapped in the
room with you, right?

723
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,078
Why did you choose me?

724
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,579
There's something about you.

725
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,983
It's like you're hurt, too.

726
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,563
It was true.

727
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,172
What was?

728
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,445
It wasn't my grandmother.
But it was true.

729
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,153
Who was it?

730
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,452
It was my dad.

731
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,344
I'd like to tell you what
happened to me now.

732
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,881
I'd like to hear it.

733
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:05,386
It was my friend's
birthday party...

734
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,016
She terminated.
She's been discharged.

735
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,750
She's going to be okay.

736
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,915
Yeah. It's that simple.

737
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:10,625
She's talking about
what happened.

738
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:13,061
That's huge. You did good.

739
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:17,498
And everyone'll tell you that's
what we gotta make her do.

740
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,732
We got to help her,
right? Except we can't.

741
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,073
We drag out her story, tell
each other that it'll help her heal

742
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,282
and feel real good
about ourselves.

743
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:36,050
Maybe all we've
done is make a girl cry.

744
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:38,650
Then why did you...

745
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,025
Because I don't know.

746
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:56,500
You gonna follow up with her?

747
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,510
One day, one room.
