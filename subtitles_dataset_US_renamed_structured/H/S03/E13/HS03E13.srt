1
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:12,004
Wait. We shouldn't...
We shouldn't be doing this.

2
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,176
What? You're not having fun?

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,346
It's not that. I just...

4
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,181
Rather be with the boys?

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,482
No.

6
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,387
Well, then come on.

7
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,699
You kids need any help?

8
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,171
No. No, we're fine.

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,400
Car trouble?

10
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:41,567
No.

11
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,338
Then why are you here?

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,673
We're just talking.

13
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:48,747
Does she do all the talking?

14
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,147
Most of it.

15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,346
I know what that's like.

16
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,355
I'm gonna come back
through here in 10 minutes,

17
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,054
and if you're still here,
I'm gonna call your parents.

18
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,496
Yes, sir. Thank you.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,339
Now, where were we?

20
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,310
We were going.

21
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,970
In nine minutes.

22
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,887
Wait...

23
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,558
Stevie? What's wrong?

24
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,706
Oh, my God!

25
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,640
Help! Someone help me!

26
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,441
Sixteen-year-old
with respiratory arrest.

27
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,416
The only thing I hate more
than a thief is a crippled thief.

28
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,509
Yeah, me, too. No sign
of trauma, no history

29
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,349
of asthma or... Who
the hell is J. Whitner?

30
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:44,652
No idea. Stevie Lipa's EKG and
echocardiogram were normal, but...

31
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,057
Normal is good. Send him home.

32
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:51,394
J. Whitner, doctor. Who is
he, and where do I find him?

33
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,457
She's the new researcher,
works with Ereshevsky.

34
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,297
Is she hot? She's
in a wheelchair.

35
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,461
Doesn't mean she's not hot.

36
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,970
Just means she can't bend over,

37
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,234
so Cuddy has to
bend over backwards.

38
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:04,745
Sixteen-year-old kid. ER workup
revealed a bloody pleural effusion.

39
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,143
That's odd.

40
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,647
Yeah, that occurred to me.

41
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,649
What took you so
long to mention it?

42
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,446
No tumors or
pneumonia on the CT.

43
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,714
He passed out while making out.

44
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,655
If he's into sex, drugs and rock
and roll can't be that far behind.

45
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,089
I'm guessing cocaine.

46
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,319
Tox screen was clean.

47
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,838
Just means he wasn't on drugs,
not that he hasn't been using drugs.

48
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,730
Looks like a plumbing
problem to me. Leaky pipes.

49
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,267
If he popped an aneurysm,
he'd be in the morgue, not the ER.

50
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,712
That's why you're gonna do a
venogram instead of an arteriogram.

51
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,096
This is not a high-pressure
burst. It's a low-pressure leak.

52
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,051
Still could've been drugs that caused
the pipes to corrode in the first place.

53
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,509
So go look under his mattress.

54
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:40,274
See if he's got any pills or
powder stashed with the hand lotion.

55
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:59,290
Sweet ride. I asked for the one with
the sissy bar and the banana seat,

56
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:03,861
but Santa gave me this instead.
Guess that's what I get for being naughty.

57
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,297
You must be Dr. House.

58
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,432
Yeah.

59
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,135
So looks like there's been some
sort of mix-up at the parking office.

60
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,009
They had to move
me closer to the door.

61
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,607
Had to? You don't look like
the type to pull a weapon.

62
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,618
Wheelchair. Cane.

63
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,148
I think you should do the honorable
thing and let me have my space back.

64
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:25,522
Oh, well, since you asked
so nicely, wheelchair.

65
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,722
Cane. Walking long
distances makes my leg hurt.

66
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,389
And it's easy for me?

67
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,797
Of course not.
Pushing that little lever?

68
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:38,066
The muscles must burn. I'm sure
the last 10 yards are pure torture.

69
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,378
Crossing the parking lot is
dangerous. Cars can't see me.

70
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,774
You ever hit a patch
of black ice with a cane?

71
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,541
No, gosh, on account of
the fact that I can't walk.

72
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,515
Maybe you should ask the
parking office for some crampons.

73
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:54,521
This is about who can most easily
cross the parking lot. You're the winner.

74
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,683
Oh, and the prize is
apparently a parking space.

75
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,064
There's still no answer at either
one of your parent's cell numbers.

76
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,435
Is there any other way we
might be able to contact them?

77
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,964
No, they're in a conference.

78
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,311
They probably had to
turn them off or something.

79
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,556
What does it matter where
they are? I mean, he's in pain.

80
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,707
You gotta do something.

81
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,044
We need them to sign this.

82
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,244
Why can't he just sign
the papers? He's 16.

83
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,684
Still not an adult.

84
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,621
Then call my parents. They know
him, and they'll take responsibility,

85
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,329
do whatever you
need. I can't. It won't...

86
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,170
You can't just let him sit here in
agony until his parents finally decide...

87
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,186
Leah, it's okay.

88
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,027
No, it's not.

89
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,667
I feel like there's an
anvil sitting on my chest.

90
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:05,292
You win. I'm doing the venogram
now. We'll deal with the fallout later.

91
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,803
My fingers feel wet.

92
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,398
That's just the dye. Your
nerves can't tell the difference

93
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,000
between the cold inside your
body and the wet outside your body.

94
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:28,572
The nerves can't tell the difference, or
the brain can't interpret the difference?

95
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:32,016
A little of both.
You like science?

96
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,785
Looks like a diffusion pattern.

97
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,521
That's because it's the
venous side. Low pressure.

98
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,620
So Graham's law applies.

99
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,458
You've taken physics already?

100
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,934
No, I just sort of
read up on my own.

101
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,996
I had to teach myself a lot of stuff,
too. Schools sucked where I grew up.

102
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,871
You go to public or private?

103
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,068
Public.

104
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:01,041
Leak has to be in the pulmonary
veins to get in my lungs, right?

105
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,309
Yep.

106
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,044
I don't see anything. Do you?

107
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,551
No.

108
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,416
It doesn't make sense.

109
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,288
How can I have a bloody
effusion without any bleeding?

110
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,277
This is putrid.

111
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,304
Put food-borne parasites and
infections on the list to check on.

112
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,984
I'll take the bedroom.

113
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,330
Oh. Sorry, I didn't
know there was anyone.

114
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,732
We were just...

115
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,827
Oh, God! I have a gun.

116
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,929
Look, you can take whatever
you want. My wallet's in my suit.

117
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,531
Freeze! Freeze!

118
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,270
I'm calling the cops.

119
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:07,178
Okay, you don't have a gun,
and you're not calling the cops.

120
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,081
Oh, no, I'm calling the cops unless
you two get out of here right now.

121
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,611
"Unless"? Who calls the cops
unless a burglar does something?

122
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,369
You don't want to have
to explain the affair.

123
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,191
We're not having an affair.

124
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,432
He's got a ring. You don't.

125
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,538
And judging from the state
of the kitchen downstairs

126
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
and the half-vacuumed bedroom,

127
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,865
I'm guessing you're a better
lover than you are a maid.

128
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,637
Maid? You son of a bitch.

129
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,910
I'm not a maid, okay?
This is my house, not his.

130
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,518
Sorry. And what's
wrong with my kitchen?

131
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,351
Nothing. We're sorry.
We're just here to help Stevie.

132
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,583
Who's Stevie?

133
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,216
Your son?

134
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,059
It was the address you gave.

135
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,656
The ER must have
written it down wrong.

136
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,011
Or you lied because you don't
want us to talk to your parents.

137
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,526
I gave you their phone numbers.

138
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,266
You gave us some numbers. We
haven't been able to reach anyone.

139
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,650
I told you, they must
be in a conference.

140
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,801
He's lying.

141
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,468
Leah.

142
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,536
He's Romany, a Gypsy.

143
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,441
So you don't have a home?

144
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,985
Of course we do.

145
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:22,022
What, next you're gonna ask me
about dancing around campfires

146
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,718
and stealing children?
This is why I don't tell people.

147
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:30,389
They share everything with each other
and nothing with the <i>gadje,</i> the outsiders.

148
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,901
Sharing information with outsiders
has not gone so well for my people.

149
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,764
Right now you're making yourself
more vulnerable by lying to us.

150
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,240
You can't go to my
house. You'll pollute it.

151
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,519
All we're gonna
do is look around.

152
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,103
Your presence is enough.

153
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:52,516
My parents take it seriously. It's
spiritual as much as it is physical.

154
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,678
You know where he lives?

155
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,221
Don't.

156
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,189
Look, I'll tell you whatever
you need to know.

157
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,691
If we can't trust
your answers...

158
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,785
I drink sometimes,
okay? I've smoked pot.

159
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,696
I'll tell you anything,
the truth. You just...

160
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,269
You can't go in my home.

161
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,873
The pot wouldn't cause a bleeding
problem. A pesticide on the pot could.

162
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,876
Where did you get it?

163
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,070
Some kid at school.

164
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,409
Stevie. He got the pot from me.

165
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,558
He doesn't even go to school.
His parents made him drop out.

166
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,642
I'm home-schooled.
He reads books.

167
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,347
What else are you lying about?
Is your father really a professor?

168
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,121
He's a salesman.

169
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,523
They buy and sell anything
they can get their hands on.

170
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,187
They? So you're with your dad
when he's making these deals?

171
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,230
He was just in
Chicago a week ago.

172
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,356
You fly?

173
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,663
No, my dad's got a truck.

174
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,965
You can't be serious.

175
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,443
Actually, I can.

176
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,011
See? It's my
space. I want it back.

177
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,710
It's not your space.
It's the hospital's space,

178
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,123
and the hospital
thinks that the person

179
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:02,813
who's worse off should
get the better space.

180
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,018
Your application for a handicap
space says you can walk 50 yards.

181
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,459
And Whitner's says
she can roll 50 miles

182
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,656
between oil changes.
I can't change my leg.

183
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,326
The space I moved you to is only
46 yards away from the front door.

184
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,028
I measured. You'll
be fine. Great.

185
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:20,062
So I can collapse four yards into
the lobby instead of outside in the cold.

186
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,051
As long as it's not in my
office. Do you know who won

187
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:26,103
the New York City Marathon six
years in a row? Guy in a wheelchair.

188
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,114
Then go get yourself
one, and leave me alone.

189
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,015
Give me my space, I'll be
happy to roll around all day.

190
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,017
You couldn't last one
week in a wheelchair.

191
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,214
Wanna bet?

192
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,386
What's wrong with you?

193
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,930
Nothing that a week
off my feet won't solve.

194
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,522
Venogram's negative. No leak.

195
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,742
You mean you
couldn't find the leak.

196
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,859
Is your leg worse?

197
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,267
No, my parking spot is.

198
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,737
Blood is only made inside
the circulatory system,

199
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,883
which means when we find
it outside... There's no leak.

200
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,619
I even checked lymphatics.
So you're gonna spend a week

201
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,188
in a wheelchair just to get a
parking space closer to the front door?

202
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,737
Easier than
chopping off my legs.

203
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,145
We've ruled out
toxins and drugs.

204
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:06,050
Kind of. He's Romany. Apparently,
they feel the need to keep secrets,

205
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,815
so it's hard to know
anything for sure.

206
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,287
Yeah, he's also a human being,

207
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,233
which means you shouldn't
be trusting him to begin with.

208
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,624
Stop relying on his answers
and find some on your own.

209
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,184
It's a deep-vein thrombosis.

210
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,060
The kid spent 16 hours in
the back seat of an old pick-up.

211
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,032
Causes a clot, makes
its way to his lungs.

212
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,478
We should do an arteriogram,
find the clot, bust it with TPA.

213
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,595
Or we can find the leak.

214
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,036
There's no leak.

215
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,506
Hey, you can't yell at
a guy in a wheelchair.

216
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,410
This is a slow leak.
You've got to speed it up.

217
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,208
Thin his blood.
Redo the venogram.

218
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,771
That could cause
a massive bleed.

219
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,408
Excellent. Massive will
be even easier to find.

220
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,818
Pardon me. I guess you guys
are gonna have to get the next one.

221
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,152
I thought you were
redoing the venogram.

222
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,458
As soon as we're done
with the arteriogram.

223
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,026
Okay, you're gonna
feel a little poke.

224
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,363
Can you maybe do that?

225
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,016
Don't worry. It's just your leg. I
don't have to go any further than this.

226
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,033
Take a look at this,
bones of your forearm.

227
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,106
Radius and ulna.

228
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,579
How about the wrist?

229
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:12,378
Lunate, hamate, the...

230
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,878
"Scared lovers try
positions they can't handle."

231
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,821
It's a mnemonic for the wrist bones.
It's the only way I can remember them.

232
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:33,871
You okay?

233
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,036
My stomach. Did
you hit something?

234
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,874
I barely started. Lie flat.

235
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,141
No, I can't. It hurts too
much. I'm getting out.

236
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,858
It's our only chance
to see what's going on.

237
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,362
If he moves, I could
shred his artery.

238
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,510
Get it out now!

239
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,316
It's gonna be okay,
Stevie. Just inject the dye.

240
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,535
Dye's going into his liver,
but it's not coming out.

241
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,892
Clot's gotta be constricting
the flow in the hepatic vein.

242
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:59,797
It's not constricting it. It's completely
blocking it. His whole liver's fried.

243
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,170
The kid's liver's failing
because of a massive clot

244
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,091
that's blocking his hepatic vein. How
can he have both a bleed and a clot?

245
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,793
It's not a clot. You must
have blocked the vein

246
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,809
with a catheter
wire. Not a chance.

247
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,864
Increased pressure downstream
could also stop the blood.

248
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,199
There's no heart failure or
cirrhosis. Means it has to be a clot.

249
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,716
Massive clots block veins.
They don't make them leak.

250
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,821
And since he clearly
has some kind of...

251
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,957
You having a little problem?

252
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,159
Would you mind?

253
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,031
Boy, that was humiliating. How
does Whitner make it through the day?

254
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,406
"Pride goeth before the fall."

255
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,843
Lucky for me, I'm sitting
in one of these babies.

256
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,041
So what other theories
can I shoot down?

257
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,447
DIC would explain both the...

258
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,849
His platelets are normal,
and his PTT isn't elevated.

259
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,548
Leukemia? Normal
CBC, and differential?

260
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,114
You guys are still thinking like doctors
when you should be thinking like plumbers.

261
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,286
Come on, I wanna
see some butt crack.

262
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,989
Something inside the liver is
punching holes in the pipes.

263
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,897
Blood bleeds through the opening,
sticks to the intruder, forms a mass.

264
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,559
A clot. A mass.

265
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,694
Cancer? A tumor could
erode a blood vessel.

266
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,501
Well, so could a granuloma
from tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.

267
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,873
Do a CT, MRI,
sputum and ACE level.

268
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:19,640
Excuse me. Sorry.
Cripple coming through.

269
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,646
He says his throat hurts.

270
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,553
That phrasing means
you think it doesn't.

271
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,024
No, I don't.

272
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,161
Good enough for me.
Where are you going?

273
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,497
Mothers know best. Get
yourself a sucker on the way out.

274
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,537
Look, I think he's just faking so
he doesn't have to go to school.

275
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,732
How did you know I
was a truant officer?

276
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,674
I told him he had a choice,
go to school or the doctor.

277
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:53,770
Right. He's wasting your precious
time, so you decided to waste mine.

278
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,371
How thoughtful.

279
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,387
I'm in a wheelchair, so I can't
examine him all the way up there.

280
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:05,448
Hop down. My life is just
one horror after another.

281
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,859
Open.

282
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,452
Does it look like it hurts?

283
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,724
No.

284
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,497
What's that?

285
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,543
Syringe. I'm with you.

286
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,579
Make him hate the doctor's
office more than he hates school.

287
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,581
That's okay. I
don't think that's...

288
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:29,775
It's just saline.

289
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,842
Hurts like hell when it's
injected directly into the muscle.

290
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,285
So what do you
think, arm or ass?

291
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,685
I think he's learned his lesson.

292
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,315
Oh, I don't know.
We better check.

293
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,556
Jack, is your mommy
a big, fat idiot?

294
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,564
Well, what do you know?
I guess you were right.

295
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,607
Just hold still, Stevie.
This shouldn't take long.

296
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,470
Sorry, I'm guessing the mike in
this thing doesn't pick up nods.

297
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,774
Smart kid.

298
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,439
Too bad it's all
gonna go to waste.

299
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,983
Nothing wrong with
being a salesman.

300
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,650
He should be able
to pursue his own life,

301
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,278
not be stuck helping his
parents sell old toasters.

302
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,594
He's still young. You never
know what he'll end up doing.

303
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,058
Unless he goes back to school, I
know exactly what he'll end up doing.

304
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,659
Wait. A lesion?

305
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,632
Magnifying times five.

306
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,066
It's a granuloma.

307
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,000
It means Wegener's
is the most likely.

308
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,730
Stevie! Mom, is that you?

309
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,006
Get him out of this now.

310
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,286
Your son is sick.
The sign on the door...

311
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,270
The sign says, "No metal."
We took everything off.

312
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,178
It says, "No admittance."

313
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,513
What's wrong with our
son? We don't know yet.

314
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,814
He's not gonna die, is he?

315
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,614
Your son is very ill. We're
still trying to figure out why,

316
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,353
which is why we need
you to leave the room.

317
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,644
What are you gonna do now?

318
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,673
Oh, now I've got to slide my butt
from one padded seat to another.

319
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,720
What if I bump my knee?

320
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,115
MRI showed a
granuloma in his liver.

321
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,623
Fantastic.

322
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,827
Wanna give me a hand here? No.

323
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,261
Clotting, bleeding and a
granuloma equals Wegener's.

324
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,266
I know. That's why I said
fantastic. I was being sincere.

325
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,302
Now, give me a
hand. Wouldn't be fair.

326
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,098
We're gonna biopsy
the liver to confirm.

327
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,502
Wouldn't be fair not to.

328
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:36,338
People are good and kind and
gentle and help people in wheelchairs.

329
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,967
You don't believe
that. But you do.

330
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,637
No, I don't.

331
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,980
Foreman, forget the biopsy.

332
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,826
His liver will be gone
before you get the results.

333
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,375
Start treatment with
cyclophosphamide

334
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,354
before the Wegener's
punches a hole in another pipe.

335
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:19,274
What's with the clothes?
You're not being discharged.

336
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,081
I know.

337
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,381
It's my parents. They
insist that I wear this stuff.

338
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:29,259
We insist on our on food, gown
and furnishings for a reason.

339
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:33,265
Hey, my chest burns. Are you
sure the treatments are working?

340
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,563
Wegener's causes
the body to attack itself.

341
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,899
That doesn't get undone
overnight. Be patient.

342
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,063
Where's your soup?

343
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,504
It's in the garbage.

344
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,132
It has willow-bark extract.

345
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,836
Willow-bark extract
is basically aspirin.

346
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,468
Yes, for the fever.

347
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,570
He's already on meds, our meds.

348
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,377
We can't risk any
adverse interactions.

349
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,694
We need all this stuff to go. We
need to control this environment.

350
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,381
So do we. People
get sick for a reason,

351
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,099
'cause something in
their life is out of balance.

352
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:00,287
Dad, he's a doctor. He
doesn't want to hear your talk.

353
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,352
Balance is just starting to be
restored now that that girl is gone.

354
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,807
That girl took pretty good care
of your son while you were away.

355
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,766
Yes, we can see that.

356
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,645
Look, all this stuff may make him feel
more comfortable, but it's not gonna...

357
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,047
How long is this
treatment gonna take?

358
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,548
We should start to
see some improvement

359
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,938
in his liver function soon.

360
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,238
Soon. Very scientific.

361
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,279
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,352
I'll be back in a little
bit to check on you.

363
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,831
Ah, yes, if it
isn't Dr. Ironside.

364
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,995
Ah, if it isn't Dr. "I Had No
Friends When I Was Growing Up,

365
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,935
"So All I Did Was
Watch TV by Myself,

366
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,440
"Which Is Why I Can Now Make
Constant Pop-Culture References

367
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,339
"Which No One
Understands but Me."

368
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,844
That's my name.
Don't wear it out.

369
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:58,981
Safe from Cuddy, but I guess
not from her trusted rat-complice.

370
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,488
Reasonable people don't debate
the relative merits of their handicaps.

371
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:05,457
Reasonable people make
rules based on evidence,

372
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,720
like difficulty
covering a distance,

373
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,594
say, 50 yards, not on some
preordained patheticness scale.

374
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,566
Last I checked, pigheadedness
was not the eighth heavenly virtue.

375
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,898
It's only pigheaded if
you're wrong. If you're right,

376
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,870
they call it, "Sticking
to your principles."

377
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,497
Give it up. You're
demeaning yourself.

378
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,269
That's what they
told Rosa Parks.

379
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,072
Don't stand up in there.
I'm watching your feet.

380
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,436
Get out of our home.

381
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,776
This is not a home.

382
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:29,848
It's certainly not...

383
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,293
It's our home as long
as our son is here.

384
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:34,412
Mom, Dad, will you
please just calm down.

385
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,684
You're not family. You
have no right to be here.

386
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,435
What are you gonna do? Throw me
out? You can't even touch the <i>gadje.</i>

387
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,428
I'll touch you.
What is going on?

388
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,340
I'm the one who brought him here. I
should be able to see how he's doing.

389
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,509
He wouldn't even need to
be here if it weren't for you.

390
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,435
Right. I'm so unclean, I
caused his liver to shut down.

391
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,494
Enough. No one is leaving.

392
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,597
He's our son, and we
want her out of here.

393
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,638
It hurts. It's your
stomach again?

394
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,340
No. What?

395
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,515
His liver's actually improving.

396
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,956
We plug one hole and
end up poking another.

397
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,539
Are we talking about the patient
or how to get a raise from Cuddy?

398
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,533
The Wegener's treatment gave him
a massive hemorrhage in his bladder.

399
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,034
Which means it's Wegener's.

400
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,297
What did I just say?

401
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,581
We were treating him for Wegener's
when everything went wrong.

402
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,664
Not everything.

403
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,232
Yeah, it was a very
lovely day outside.

404
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,744
On the other hand, the
treatment made him worse.

405
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,905
Treatment made his
bladder worse, not his liver.

406
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,380
Clot in the liver's breaking up.

407
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,818
And MRI, sputum and ACE ruled
out TB, sarcoidosis and lymphoma,

408
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,252
which leaves us with...

409
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,565
Still could be a
cancer with multiple...

410
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,718
A cancer we can't see
on MRI, CT or blood tests?

411
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,094
It's Wegener's.

412
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,824
It's not the wrong diagnosis.
It's the wrong treatment.

413
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,298
We could increase
immunosuppression. Add methotrexate.

414
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,859
We can't give methotrexate to a
kid who's already had lung problems.

415
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,669
Methotrexate is carpet
bombing. Hits everything.

416
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,803
We need a smart bomb.

417
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:08,246
We don't suppress the
immune system. We change it.

418
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:14,785
Immune modulation. FT28. His
antibodies are attacking his blood vessels.

419
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,255
The irritation causes it to bleed and
clot. We change his immune system

420
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,486
<i>so the antibodies don't
interact with his blood vessels</i>

421
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,152
but work fine everywhere else.

422
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,129
FT28 is still experimental.
It's not FDA approved.

423
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,792
It's worked for Crohn's
disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

424
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,495
He doesn't have
Crohn's or arthritis.

425
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,973
Let's say that he does
and start the treatment.

426
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,708
Absolutely not.

427
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,341
My people have been
experimented on before. Never again.

428
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,886
Mister Lipa, with
all due respect,

429
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,355
comparing this hospital
with Auschwitz, it's ridiculous.

430
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,688
FT28 has been proven
safe in hundreds...

431
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,318
People always say
you can trust them.

432
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,604
Why would they
say anything else?

433
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,187
Why do they think
we would listen?

434
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,542
You think I don't understand
what it's like to come from a people

435
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:02,694
who've been enslaved,
mistreated and experimented on?

436
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:05,704
Tuskegee went on for 28
years after World War Il.

437
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:08,316
And the laws that made it illegal
for the Romany to even set foot

438
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,539
in this state were still on the books
until 1998. It's not ancient history.

439
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:17,481
Conventional therapy hasn't
worked. Your son may be dying.

440
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:22,317
He needs a targeted approach,
and you need to trust us.

441
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:31,488
I'm sorry. A lifetime of
experiences tells me I can't trust you,

442
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,465
and the past three days have
done nothing to change that.

443
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:38,270
We want our son treated,
not experimented on.

444
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,377
If you don't know how to
do that, then just tell us,

445
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:42,931
so we can take him
someplace where they do.

446
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,902
They're absolutely
right. Stay away

447
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:49,107
from that unproven, experimental
stuff. Much better to stick

448
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,426
with the "moving the furniture
until he gets better" approach.

449
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,728
Yes, you're right. We're gonna
have to come up with something else.

450
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:58,019
Do you mean another last-ditch,
desperation move? You got anything?

451
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,083
Go back and don't take no for an
answer. What kind of salesman are you?

452
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,220
The kind who avoids the
house with the crazy couple

453
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,572
who put tin foil
over their windows.

454
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:05,791
They got money for tin foil,

455
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,409
they got money for
whatever you're selling.

456
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:08,992
What's that mean?

457
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,869
It means that if they don't trust
you, you should earn that lack of trust.

458
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,998
What does paying
for tinfoil mean?

459
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,737
Why should I have to
answer all the questions?

460
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,281
Oops.

461
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,849
Sorry. Still getting used
to the power steering.

462
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,329
I assume you've heard the news?

463
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,480
I'm not worried.

464
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,650
From what I hear, what you lack in
shame, you also lack in willpower.

465
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:36,058
My will may be weak,
but my backbone is strong

466
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,893
and pain-free now that
I've stopped using the cane.

467
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,263
Of course, it's harder to
look down Cuddy's shirt,

468
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,599
but then the vantage point
on her ass has much improved.

469
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,037
Then that's just me, always
looking on the bright side.

470
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,338
I'm the guy who said that
her C-cups are half full.

471
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,938
They are nice, aren't they?

472
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,841
Oh, no, no, no, you're not
gonna win me over that easily.

473
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,388
You may have a wheel. It
doesn't mean you get the grease.

474
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,253
You gotta squeak.

475
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,468
What's that?

476
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,008
It's cyclophosphamide.

477
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:26,603
We're continuing the standard
treatment as you requested.

478
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,393
I have to ask everyone to
leave the room for a few minutes

479
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,613
while I apply some bandages.

480
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,446
Why do we have to leave?

481
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,683
They're for his penis.

482
00:27:56,308 --> 00:28:01,110
You lied to them. The bleeding's
stopped. I don't need any bandages.

483
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,982
I need to change your treatment,

484
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,094
but your parents won't let
us. They've got it in their minds

485
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:09,145
that we want to try some sort
of inhuman experiment on you.

486
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,849
The treatment's experimental?

487
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:13,483
FT28 has been through
extensive clinical trials.

488
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,529
It's also been used
successfully for other conditions.

489
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:20,225
The fact that you're recommending
experimental treatment

490
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,700
means you have no other options.

491
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:27,569
Sorry. We stop the pleural
effusions, your liver almost fails.

492
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,540
We save your liver,
the bladder fails.

493
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:30,985
If we don't get ahead
of the curve on this...

494
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,103
What do you need me to do?

495
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,380
Take the medicine, but
don't tell your parents.

496
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,851
I don't like lying
to my parents.

497
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,217
The rest of the world, though...

498
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,846
The rest of the
world I can't trust.

499
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,550
You can trust me.

500
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,922
How do I know?

501
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:52,956
Because if you do this, then tell
your parents, I lose my license.

502
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,075
God. Get in here.

503
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,786
Wow, his spleen
basically exploded, huh?

504
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,627
Got another bleeder.
2-O silk on a stick.

505
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,661
Got it.

506
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,369
I believe you ordered
your meat rare.

507
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,775
Keep him open. If I
confirm Wegener's,

508
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:42,838
might as well stage the disease
while he's still on the table.

509
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,215
<i>What's taking so long?</i>

510
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,590
External capsule's
ruptured but still intact.

511
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,223
No signs of a clot or a bleed. Normal
follicles, normal lymphoid tissue.

512
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,530
<i>His spleen is ripped to shreds. There's
gotta be granulomas. Keep looking.</i>

513
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:06,231
Come on, can't leave Humpty
Dumpty like this forever.

514
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,604
I don't see anything but
normal spleen. No granulomas.

515
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,199
Means no Wegener's.

516
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:13,441
That's all I need to
know. Let's go people.

517
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:14,775
<i>Run his bowel.</i>

518
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,747
No need. I'm closing.

519
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,251
Suture.

520
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,177
Run his bowel.

521
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,242
Nothing suspicious
in the spleen.

522
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,810
Get him out of here.

523
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,150
You missed it.

524
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,214
He had a granuloma in his liver.

525
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,317
No, it was just scar tissue.

526
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:04,659
Looks like a granuloma
on the MRI, but it's not.

527
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,691
I don't know why I'm debating this.
Pass me the Kelly clamp. I'm closing.

528
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,703
Not unless you're gonna sew
my hand into this kid's stomach.

529
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,240
Get out of there. He's unstable.

530
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:19,005
He's got Wegener's, which
means he's got granulomas.

531
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,238
I'm calling my lawyer.

532
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,439
It's only 26 feet.

533
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:24,381
If you were an ostrich,
you'd have a 46-foot wait.

534
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:27,609
Blood pressure's dropping.

535
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,154
Hang another bag
of Ringer's lactate.

536
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,554
I'm having nothing
to do with this.

537
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,285
Foreman, hang another bag...

538
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,156
Ringer's lactate. Got it.

539
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:50,634
Come on. Come on. It's gotta
be in here. It's gotta be in here.

540
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:00,917
It's not.

541
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,783
Mind if we close?

542
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:14,432
It's a good thing we never sold
him on FT28. His parents were right.

543
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,421
There's no way his parents
are gonna let us near him again.

544
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,056
They won't be able to transfer him
until he's recovered from the surgery.

545
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,312
You can add the surgical team to the
list of people who won't let us near him.

546
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:36,845
Bleeds, clots, bleeds,
clots, spleen explodes.

547
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:39,357
We should test for
Von Willebrand's.

548
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,451
Or just play tic-tac-toe.

549
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:46,965
Okay, X's are
bleeds. O's are clots.

550
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:49,297
We started in the lungs,
right? What did we do?

551
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,734
CT, sputum, two venograms.

552
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,830
It's one bleed, one
clot, then what?

553
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:58,468
Liver shut down, MRI, labs,
treated with cyclophophamide.

554
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:02,810
Whereupon he peed out three
units of O-negative, another bleed.

555
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,907
Where is this going?
I don't know yet.

556
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,645
What's next? Bladder, kidneys.

557
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,347
High-resolution CT scan,
UA and urine sediment.

558
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:10,514
GI tract?

559
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:11,955
You ran his small
bowel in the OR.

560
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,254
The large bowel's fixed
to the abdominal wall.

561
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,037
I didn't run that. Because
there was no reason to.

562
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:18,030
He hasn't been having
any symptoms in his bowels.

563
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,564
Do a colonoscopy.

564
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,156
Because he's had no symptoms?

565
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,101
You lose your keys, the first
thing you do is look everywhere

566
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,728
you might logically
have placed them.

567
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,216
When you don't find them, then
you start looking in other places.

568
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,678
The medicine cabinet, freezer, mailbox.
We need to look in this kid's mailbox.

569
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,043
Why don't we x-ray his
feet? They're fine, too.

570
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,241
Because we need to take
the center square to block.

571
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,513
Okay, even if that did make sense,
it's kind of hard to do a colonoscopy

572
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,713
on a kid you can't get near.

573
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,419
He's in the ICU now.

574
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,360
His parent's only have
limited visiting privileges.

575
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,262
I like that kid. He's got spunk.

576
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,181
Can't talk now. On guard duty.

577
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,413
You're still in that thing?

578
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,648
What thing?

579
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,789
Oh, this? Forgot
it was even there.

580
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:22,885
You know, even if you manage not to
get struck down by a bolt of lightning,

581
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,872
and make it a week, Cuddy's
not gonna give you the space.

582
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,896
She can't.

583
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:26,988
A bet's a bet.

584
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,558
Yes, and that rule outranks the
Americans with Disabilities Act.

585
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,901
You think you've got logic on your
side, but Whitner's got the legal system,

586
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,601
and legal beats logic
every time. Just ask OJ.

587
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,234
You're right.

588
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,111
I am? Yeah.

589
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,911
So you're doing this even though you
know you've got no legal leg to stand on?

590
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:48,784
Who needs legs when you got
wheels? I'm gonna get that spot.

591
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:52,781
No way Cuddy is going to gyp me.

592
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,053
What did you say?

593
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,355
I'll see you later.

594
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,660
Gonna have them yelling at
me for the next 20 minutes.

595
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:05,260
Mucosa looks normal,
healthy. No lonely diverticula.

596
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:07,806
Blood pressure's dropping.
He's bleeding again.

597
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,534
I'm in his colon.

598
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,275
Hurry up. I am.

599
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,640
There's nothing there.

600
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,683
Wait. Wait. What's that?

601
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,445
A reflection?

602
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,386
No, it's something.

603
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,123
Looks like a...

604
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,687
Toothpick.

605
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:31,991
Are you sure?

606
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:36,831
He must have swallowed it accidentally
and just figured he'd digest it eventually.

607
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,533
When you two were making out in
the car, he must have folded awkwardly,

608
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,485
<i>pushed the toothpick through the
wall of the intestine and into the lung.</i>

609
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,670
Then it moved on to his liver and
made its way to his bladder and spleen.

610
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,270
So that's it? He's
gonna be okay?

611
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,008
Yeah, small holes.

612
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,347
It shouldn't take that long to
heal now that we've got it out.

613
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:57,014
See? See what you did? Me?

614
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,299
If you hadn't
been kissing him...

615
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,882
That's what you heard?

616
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,518
It was the toothpick. It was
that disgusting habit that you...

617
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:06,361
It would have just passed right through
him if he hadn't been writhing around.

618
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,195
Isn't that right...

619
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,764
That's it?

620
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,864
Yeah, that's it.

621
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,308
Wood absorbs water, becomes the
same density as the tissue around it.

622
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:22,575
That's why it didn't show
up on the CT or MRI.

623
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,172
That's cool.

624
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,644
I mean, not cool for me,

625
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,781
but a lot of damage
for something so small.

626
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:37,323
You know, the lab here, they
have a paid intern position.

627
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:40,624
It's usually given to one of
the kids from the universities,

628
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,397
but if you want, I could
probably get you an interview.

629
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,100
You know, some entry-level
stuff, some gopher work,

630
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:50,438
but you'd also have
access to a lot of cool things.

631
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:57,375
Thanks, really, but I can't.

632
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,343
Yes, you can.
Stevie, you're bright.

633
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:06,684
You have more curiosity than
90% of the doctors on this staff.

634
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:10,217
No, it's not that. It's just...

635
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,162
I go to work every day
with my family, you know?

636
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,269
People I've known my whole life.

637
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,333
I don't want to lose that.

638
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,340
You can have both.

639
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,440
No, I can't.

640
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,605
Because they
don't want to let you.

641
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:32,207
They shouldn't be
making you choose.

642
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,684
Maybe not, but they are.

643
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,288
I'm choosing them.

644
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:45,152
Change is hard.
Trust me, I know.

645
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,061
But it worked out for me.

646
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:51,330
You're a successful doctor.

647
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:56,906
Your name is on journal
articles. I would love that.

648
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:03,877
It's just I see you with
Doctors Chase and Cameron,

649
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,578
and you all got
empty ring fingers.

650
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,616
You're alone.

651
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:32,336
This is my last day
living a life of leisure.

652
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,489
So are you gonna tell Doctor
Whitner she's out of my space,

653
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,277
or can I? Why would I do that?

654
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:41,217
Because you said that you
would, and lying is wrong.

655
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:45,314
I said I would give you the space
if you made it a whole week...

656
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,222
Which I... Didn't.

657
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,522
The bet didn't stipulate that you
had to be in the chair for a week

658
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:54,088
unless you had to barge
into an operating room

659
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,259
and shove your
hands in a kid's bowels.

660
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,859
You know about that?

661
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,101
You lost.

662
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,901
I saved a life.

663
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,038
Two minutes out of the
chair to save a kid's life.

664
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,304
You lost, House.

665
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,141
I earned that space.

666
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,772
No, you didn't.

667
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,615
I earn that space every day I limp
into that building and do my damn job.

668
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,586
You lost.

669
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:17,788
Hey!

670
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:29,764
You were never gonna give me that space,
were you? I saw Whitner the other day.

671
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,235
She knew about the bet,
didn't seem that worried.

672
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,669
She knew I'd win.

673
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,536
She doesn't know me.

674
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,551
In fact, she doesn't know
anything, except what you tell her.

675
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:42,138
You told her that you were never
gonna give me that space, didn't you?

676
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:48,948
Just tell me, do you at
least feel a little guilty?

677
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:55,021
You wanna teach me lessons, don't
make commitments you can't keep.

678
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,768
How's it going?

679
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:05,827
How guilty does she look?

680
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,168
About an eight.

681
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,841
That space is
mine. <i>Vini, vidi, vinci.</i>
