1
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,356
You okay?

2
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,501
Yeah, just got
clipped with a beam.

3
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,069
What the hell do you
two think you were doing?

4
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,337
We thought we heard
someone in there!

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,091
You never go in
without authorization!

6
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,154
Captain, this is all me.
Amy just followed me in.

7
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,826
So torching your ass last
year wasn't enough, huh?

8
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:38,339
You need to stop trying to prove how tough
you are before you get yourself killed.

9
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,703
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,401
Let the paramedics
look you over.

11
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,850
Come on, Derek. Let's get this
ladder to the second story. Let's go.

12
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,482
Derek! Derek!

13
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,528
Derek!

14
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,196
What's happening?

15
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,161
I'm freezing.

16
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,401
I'm fine.

17
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,705
ER docs don't think so.

18
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,906
Your temperature's been going
up and down like a rollercoaster.

19
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,915
How old are these skin grafts?

20
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,542
Last one was about
six months ago.

21
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,919
We're gonna run some tests and
we'll get a consult with Dr. House.

22
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,116
I'll be fine.

23
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,126
You'll be doing what
the doctors say. Got it?

24
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,058
I'll check in later.

25
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,295
Hey.

26
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,337
The way you covered
for me last night...

27
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,068
He's my brother.

28
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,372
I know how to eat it from him.

29
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,674
I'm gonna stop by
after my shift, okay?

30
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,941
Okay.

31
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,176
So where is this Dr. House?

32
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,450
Speaking engagement.

33
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,022
Not guilty.

34
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:14,823
And on the charge of gaining control of
said medication by fraud, how do you plead?

35
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,625
Not guilty. Very well.

36
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:20,725
Preliminary hearing is set
for the 19th at 10:00 a.m.,

37
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,533
at which time I'll
determine whether

38
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,704
there's enough evidence
to proceed to trial.

39
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,264
Next case on the calendar.
People versus Williams.

40
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,105
Charge is assault
in the second degree

41
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,977
with intent to cause
injury to another person.

42
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:35,176
I see the defense has
submitted a motion to dismiss...

43
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,848
You gonna go talk to him?

44
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,411
I was just gonna ask him
where he gets his hair cut.

45
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:46,859
They have your signature in the
prescription log, a security camera video,

46
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:51,228
and a pharmacist's sworn statement
saying you stole a dead guy's pills.

47
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,926
You're already
looking at 10 years.

48
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,764
You wanna add a witness
intimidation charge?

49
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,601
Go ahead, ask
him about his hair.

50
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,003
He suffered third-degree burns
over 54% of his body, a year ago,

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,709
and arrived in the ER last
night, disoriented and shivering.

52
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,117
For 12 hours his temperature
was bouncing between 96 and 102.

53
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,426
Why don't you contest the
search of the pharmacy records?

54
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,288
Yeah. You could argue it violated
doctor-patient confidentiality.

55
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,002
Except he wasn't the
patient or the doctor.

56
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,155
He was the guy who stole
from the patient and the doctor!

57
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,775
This was the third time he'd been
disoriented in the last two weeks.

58
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:30,362
Running into smoke-filled burning
buildings can be a bit disorienting.

59
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,872
Fortunately, I have
the cure. Stop doing it.

60
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,418
He's not in a burning building
anymore, and he's still shivering.

61
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,754
A hypothalamic tumor could
cause a vacillating temperature.

62
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,940
So could ER nurses who
were too busy to notice

63
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,347
that a patient likes both
hot coffee and cold sodas.

64
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,423
He tested negative for Hep C, TB,
HIV, Lyme, and his tox screen's clean.

65
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,105
In case you hadn't noticed,
not exactly in the mood to dance.

66
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,065
I'm not asking you to dance.
I'm asking you to do your job.

67
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,003
EKG showed arrhythmia.
Probably just a mild heart attack.

68
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,671
No chest pain. And smoke inhalation
already explains the arrhythmia.

69
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:16,046
The guy was in the burn unit for six
months and had multiple surgeries.

70
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,585
Could be a hospital-acquired
infection. Maybe MRSA.

71
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,553
Works for me.

72
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,486
Draw a blood culture,
start him on antibiotics,

73
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,526
vancomycin plus broad
gram-negative coverage.

74
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:34,929
If you called to see the design for
my prison tats, they're still in R and D.

75
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,799
You need to talk to Tritter.

76
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,270
Not according to my lawyer.

77
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,338
Your lawyer isn't gonna be able to
get the DA to drop the case. Tritter can.

78
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,673
Yeah, you know what
else Tritter can do?

79
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,939
You are not impressing anyone!

80
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,344
You may call
yourself principled,

81
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,782
but what you really are is
a stubborn adolescent idiot!

82
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,649
This isn't his fault!
I'm not the one who...

83
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,086
You used the rectal
thermometer on him.

84
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,750
You insulted him
instead of apologizing.

85
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:02,489
You flaunted your drug use in his
face and you refused to accept a deal...

86
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,121
I accepted the deal!

87
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,429
Not until after you
stole a dead guy's pills!

88
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,593
Allegedly.

89
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,433
Tritter has been opening doors
for you every step of the way

90
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,769
and you keep slamming them shut.

91
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,241
There are no more
openings to give, House.

92
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:20,144
If you wanna stay out of prison,
you got to make one for yourself.

93
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:29,381
It's Vicodin. You function
better on it. Talk to him.

94
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,598
MRSA's a bacteria that
often infects hospital patients.

95
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:44,570
The burns on your chest and arm exposed
raw flesh that made you a wide-open target.

96
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,732
But the antibiotics would
take care of it, right?

97
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,900
Depends on what strain it is.

98
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,454
We'll know more once we get
the results back from these cultures.

99
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,414
So this MRSA thing,

100
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,812
would it make
everything look blue?

101
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,751
He's seeing blue.

102
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,461
Who'd you get the scrip from?

103
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,258
Cuddy. You wanna
know what I gave her?

104
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,026
MRSA wouldn't change
his ocular palette.

105
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,364
Heavy metal poisoning could cause
vision changes, particularly thallium.

106
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,336
If it was thallium,
he'd be losing his hair.

107
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,202
So maybe it's menopause.

108
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,434
He's 28 years old.

109
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,910
Yes, his age is the reason it's
weird that a man has menopause.

110
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,142
Male menopause. High
estrogen, low testosterone.

111
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,740
Explains the temperature
swings, disorientation,

112
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,581
endocrinologically similar
to female menopause,

113
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,645
but without the vaginas
and the mahjong tiles.

114
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:38,021
Male menopause doesn't
explain the blue vision.

115
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,789
Blue vision isn't a symptom.
It's a side effect of Viagra.

116
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,090
It's right there on the label,

117
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,894
which I'd had no reason to have
read, except that I'm a doctor.

118
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,299
He's not taking Viagra.

119
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,599
You mean he didn't tell
you he was taking Viagra.

120
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,970
I don't care how sick he is. Trust
me, he still thinks he's got a shot.

121
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,499
Menopause causes temperature
swings, limpness, limpness causes pills,

122
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,636
pills cause the blues.

123
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,806
He's presenting no other
signs of premature aging.

124
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,178
Aging's not the only cause.

125
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,241
You said that he's got
burns on 54% of his body.

126
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,981
Sure it's not 55%?

127
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,319
Burns to his genitals could
cause testicular trauma.

128
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,757
Which could in turn cause...

129
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,823
Run a hormone panel.

130
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,228
When it comes back positive, pump him
full of testosterone and send him home.

131
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,960
Stop following me!

132
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,605
Thank God my parents are dead.

133
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:29,165
If the old man had heard I had
menopause, I'd never live it down.

134
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,904
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

135
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,209
Once these testosterone pellets dissolve,
your system will be back to normal.

136
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,647
Yeah, but until
then I'm an old lady.

137
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:39,918
Okay to come in?

138
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,922
It's not MRSA. He's not
being isolated anymore.

139
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,357
Anyone not in a
white coat is welcome.

140
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,396
You're looking better.
How you feeling?

141
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,021
I'm good.

142
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:55,626
It turns out I got some hormone
thing. They're fixing it right now.

143
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,505
Are you okay?

144
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,473
Yeah, I think so, I just...

145
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,407
Derek, are you in pain?

146
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,821
You need to get these out!
Okay, hold on, what's wrong?

147
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,989
Get these out! What's going on?

148
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,572
Looks like an allergic reaction.

149
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,742
Hold on! We're going to
get you something to stop it.

150
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,028
It's okay. No,
just take them out!

151
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,863
But you've got to calm
down. It's okay. Get them out!

152
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,378
Derek! Get them out!

153
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:16,980
Derek, let her go!

154
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,650
Derek, let her go!

155
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,058
Two milligrams of
IV lorazepam, stat!

156
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,596
Get them out!

157
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,312
The complaint department
is across the hall.

158
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,545
I'm busy.

159
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,715
Can I just assume that you told
me how unfair I'm being and...

160
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,122
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:01,097
You could throw a dart at all the
adjectives between arrogant and unhinged,

162
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,069
and I'm sure you'd hit
one that describes me.

163
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,001
There's a reason
I operate that way.

164
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,306
I live in pain.

165
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,807
Pain that on good days
is merely intolerable.

166
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,479
And on bad ones will suck
the life force right out of you.

167
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,682
It doesn't mean that
I've handled this right.

168
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:29,791
Actually, it means I was wrong.

169
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,766
Thank you.

170
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:41,431
I know that couldn't have
been easy for you to say.

171
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,869
Even if you don't
mean a word of it.

172
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,108
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,911
Look, you can hook me
up to a damn polygraph...

174
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,956
And I'm sure you'd pass.

175
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:01,017
The thing is I've never been
interested in what you have to say.

176
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,731
All I care about is what you do.

177
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,394
I'll see you at the hearing.

178
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,240
It wasn't the medicine.

179
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,006
Contamination and allergy
tests both came back negative.

180
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,513
There was nothing to
suggest a pulmonary embolism.

181
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:25,985
And his EKG showed the expected tachycardia
from the exertion of the attack.

182
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,920
And I'm fine, by the
way, thanks for asking.

183
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,290
Aggression comes on that fast
has got to have a neurological basis.

184
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,456
We should do a CT for a frontal
lobe tumor and an LP for meningitis.

185
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,603
Great. Have at it.

186
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:54,071
That's it? No challenging our
theory, no tearing us down?

187
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,844
No need. You got
it under control.

188
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:57,940
Where are you going?

189
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,713
Upstairs this time.

190
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,287
To do what?

191
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,560
Check myself into rehab.

192
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,133
Did Tritter offer
you another deal?

193
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,831
Nope. This is all me.

194
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,942
So, no slaps on the
back? Encouraging words?

195
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,809
We're just trying to
understand what this is.

196
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,508
I hope it's me detoxing,

197
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,485
otherwise I soiled a perfectly good
pair of underwear last night for nothing.

198
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,749
So this is for real?

199
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,654
It's not just a
show for Tritter?

200
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,694
Absolutely it's a show
for Tritter. And the judge.

201
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,958
And, unfortunately, unless
it's real, there is no show.

202
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,794
Hey, if it doesn't help my case,

203
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,664
at least I can go to prison
with heightened senses.

204
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,398
All the better to enjoy
my strolls around the yard.

205
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,565
Time's up. Group's starting.

206
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,542
Gonna need to check that stuff.

207
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,410
When I lead the
big patient rebellion,

208
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,677
Voldemort here
is the first to go.

209
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,810
CT was normal, no
frontal lobe tumor,

210
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,581
LP was negative for meningitis.

211
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,646
We're back to square one.

212
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,556
What about something
vascular? Polyarteritis nodosa?

213
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,220
Brain lesions would
have shown up on the CT.

214
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,264
Legionnaire's explains
the chills and temperature.

215
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,231
Altered mental status
causes the aggression.

216
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,030
We would have seen
respiratory problems.

217
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,696
We're throwing darts.
We need to go to House.

218
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,501
We need to deal
with this ourselves.

219
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,269
He can make the time!
Derek's still his patient.

220
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,106
The man's life as he
knows it could be over.

221
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,011
I think you of all people would
want to cut him some slack.

222
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,642
We're treating a man who runs into
burning buildings for perfect strangers.

223
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,677
He didn't ask for what's happening to
him. House did everything to himself.

224
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,188
He's been cut more
than enough slack.

225
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,692
Right now, House has more
important things to deal with.

226
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,784
It was the first time
I'd seen him in months.

227
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:53,526
I guess I was hoping he'd put his arms
around me and tell me he understood.

228
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,927
But he said he wasn't
ready to forgive me.

229
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,632
Well, he may never be ready.

230
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:03,143
You're doing the only thing
you can do. You're trying.

231
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,269
How about you, Greg?

232
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,974
Have you thought about how to
fix things with people in your life?

233
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,481
No need.

234
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,745
The people in my life
have no expectations of me.

235
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,482
Makes all our lives easier.

236
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,750
Apparently not.

237
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,352
The first step in recovery...

238
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,723
Is admitting I have a problem.

239
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,024
I've obviously done
that or I wouldn't be here.

240
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,828
I've even embraced step two and
accepted that there is a higher power.

241
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,701
Maybe not a god per se, but that
André the Giant guy was powerful.

242
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,198
Where I start to butt up
against it is step three,

243
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,971
surrendering my will
to this higher power.

244
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,482
I'm sure André's ghost has
my back and all, but my free will,

245
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,107
I never leave home without it.

246
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,175
Kind of like your pills.

247
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:50,348
If you could do this on your own,
I assume you wouldn't be here.

248
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,255
True.

249
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,672
Everybody lies. His tox screen.

250
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,073
It's been clean every time.

251
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,009
Exactly. It shouldn't be.

252
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,479
He's had extensive skin
grafts, which hurt like hell.

253
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,107
Not everybody's House. People
can handle pain without medication.

254
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,584
But they do have pain.

255
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,644
This guy's worried about losing
his job, so he's hiding the pain.

256
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,782
We find out where the pain is,
maybe we find out what the problem is.

257
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,348
Or he doesn't feel pain.

258
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,292
Either way, it's something.

259
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,366
When? Two minutes ago.

260
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,372
Pulse is 157, respiration 42.

261
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,116
He was fine. He was
just telling me a joke,

262
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,802
just a minute ago...
Get her out of here!

263
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,537
No fluid in his lungs!

264
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,102
O2 stat's 85. He's hypoxic!
We're gonna have to intubate!

265
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,275
It's not his lungs! He's
got marked ST elevation.

266
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,443
He's having a heart attack.

267
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,987
Pick a color.

268
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,757
Medication time.

269
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,996
"You are a ray of
sunshine on a cloudy day."

270
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,487
He's stable.

271
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,715
Won't stay that way.

272
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,759
His blood tests showed
troponins and CK-MB up.

273
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,795
Chase was right. He
was hiding chest pain.

274
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,024
He's been having a whole
series of heart attacks.

275
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,042
Heart attacks can't cause you
to reach out and choke someone.

276
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,228
Lack of oxygen to the
brain causes disorientation.

277
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,860
Increased adrenaline
causes rage.

278
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,373
The more important question
is what caused the attacks?

279
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,073
Where are you
going? To see House.

280
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,911
We have a 28-year-old with clean
arteries, no valvular abnormalities

281
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,060
having multiple heart attacks.

282
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:01,020
I'm not gonna wait for Chase
to give us another breakthrough.

283
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,427
Maybe we should go.

284
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,896
We don't have an answer yet.

285
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,399
I'm fine, by the way.
Thanks for asking!

286
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,733
Whoever came up with buprenorphine
to wean off Vicodin should be shot.

287
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,738
Then stabbed in the eye.

288
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,104
I think someone needs
to adjust my meds!

289
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,952
The heart shows no
signs of inflammation or...

290
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,810
If the cause of the heart attacks
isn't internal, it must be external.

291
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,972
Something environmental.

292
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,516
None of the attacks
happened in the same place.

293
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,903
Still must be
something in common.

294
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,729
First one happened in
an apartment building fire.

295
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,483
Fire, water, smoke,
oxygen masks...

296
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,183
The second and third
ones happened here.

297
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,567
There was no fire,
no water, no smoke.

298
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,787
His clothes were all
different, he'd been cleaned.

299
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,625
That's the "whats".
How about the "whos"?

300
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,576
His partner Amy was
at all three attacks, but...

301
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,860
Anyone else?

302
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,868
People don't
cause heart attacks.

303
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,996
Well, then you shouldn't be
worried about proving me wrong.

304
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,772
Amy? Would you
come with me, please?

305
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,748
Anything new on my brother?

306
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,285
We're not quite sure yet.
Could you come with me?

307
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,547
Yeah.

308
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,898
What's this all about?

309
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,493
I don't know.

310
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,563
They wanted to
talk to us together.

311
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,206
Derek!

312
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,875
House was right.

313
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,982
I don't get it.

314
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,356
How can I be causing
his heart attacks?

315
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,657
You may be carrying an
agent that triggered them.

316
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:52,790
It could be anything, mold
spores, poisonous plant residue,

317
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,834
something you
picked up at a fire site.

318
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,564
Until we identify the agent,
we can't allow you near Derek.

319
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,409
I can't believe that
I'm doing this to him.

320
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,809
You can't blame
yourself for this.

321
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,940
You know how he
got those skin grafts?

322
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,949
He was trapped in a fire.

323
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,512
We were clearing rooms
in an office building fire.

324
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:18,718
And the ceiling collapsed, and it
cut me off from the rest of the group.

325
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,589
And I kept yelling
that I was fine,

326
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,154
but Derek refused to wait for
the team to clear the debris,

327
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:28,599
so he took off looking
for another access point.

328
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,400
He got caught in a backdraft.

329
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,143
He almost died
because of me once.

330
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,607
And now it's happening again.

331
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,834
You're not my mom. You don't
have to keep checking up on me.

332
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,008
How you doing?

333
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,543
Not bad,

334
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,443
considering I've just learned
I'm completely powerless.

335
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,505
See this big fancy wing?

336
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,516
It was built because
this program works.

337
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,883
Faulty logic.

338
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:25,152
This big fancy wing exists because
some people with money think that it works,

339
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,194
wanna believe that they
can buy a better world.

340
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,960
This is nothing short of idealized
despair. Let other people wallow in it.

341
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,967
I don't even know
what that means.

342
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,229
None of this means anything.

343
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,772
It's just nonsensical
slogans and platitudes.

344
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,308
Meaning takes
time, it takes work.

345
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,452
What do you think
I've been doing?

346
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:47,038
You've been here for two
days! Talk about wallowing in it!

347
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,673
We all get it. We know
how much pain you have.

348
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,116
You're here to deal with
that and get on with your life!

349
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:56,679
Right! I should have an affair with a
dying patient and move into a hotel.

350
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,491
You're a coward, House.

351
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,528
You find fault in everybody because
you're afraid to look at yourself.

352
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:12,063
Thanks. I was running short on
platitudes. You can leave now.

353
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,141
We tested Amy for about a dozen different
agents, but they all came back negative.

354
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,685
So she's not
causing the attacks.

355
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:31,182
Derek, are you in love with her?

356
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,326
What does that have
to do with anything?

357
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,828
Amy told me how you
got those skin grafts.

358
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:41,163
And the way you're always watching out
for her, and I see the way you look at her.

359
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,871
Have you told her how you feel?

360
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,075
She has a six-year-old daughter.

361
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,081
Women with daughters
can still fall in love.

362
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,679
I know.

363
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:04,014
Because she did.
With my brother.

364
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,719
They're engaged.

365
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:15,426
Broken heart syndrome.
He's in love and it's killing him.

366
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,629
I thought that only happened
to 80-year-old widows.

367
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,696
Thanks to his menopause and estrogen
level, he basically is an old woman.

368
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,140
BHS is an acute physical
response to an emotional experience.

369
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,270
Stress triggers a flood
of catecholamines...

370
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,782
That's a plain old stress
cardiomyopathy, not a heart attack.

371
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,194
But if you're too worried about
losing your job to get it treated,

372
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,585
they can devolve into
full-on heart attacks.

373
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,282
You think it's a coincidence this
started when Amy got engaged?

374
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,154
No, I don't.

375
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,818
But now that you know the "why",

376
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,453
what are you gonna
do to stop the "how"?

377
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,430
I already put him on beta-blockers
and nitroglycerin. No effect.

378
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,988
We need to put him
on antidepressants.

379
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,466
Not if you're right.

380
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,867
Antidepressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

381
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,666
which would only speed
up the heart attacks.

382
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:56,175
We could try propylthiouracil,
slow down his metabolic rate.

383
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,837
Thyroid effect would
only weaken the heart.

384
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,971
The only other option
is blood thinners.

385
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,642
This is not a fat guy with plaque-filled
arteries and a swollen heart.

386
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,811
He's a guy whose brain
is trying to kill his heart.

387
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,788
So buy him a girlfriend,
make him happy.

388
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,414
That might make you happy.

389
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,459
The only thing that'll
make him happy is Amy.

390
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,187
So keep him away from her.

391
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:17,706
He has a myocardial infarction
every time she walks in the room.

392
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,807
What do you think
will happen to his heart

393
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,075
when we tell him he
can never see her again?

394
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,658
He needs a shrink.

395
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,726
Chase's idea is as good as any.

396
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:27,671
But short of frying his brain and
wiping Amy out, he's screwed.

397
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,713
We need Cuddy.

398
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:34,838
Why?

399
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,009
So you can tell her why
you need to fry a guy's brain.

400
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:43,149
The guy's heart isn't working
and you want to shock his brain.

401
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:46,283
Electroshock therapy is the only
way to erase his memories of Amy

402
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,303
and stop the brain's
chemical attack on the heart.

403
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,886
This isn't 1940!

404
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:52,056
The problem can be
controlled with antidepressants.

405
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,131
Cameron?

406
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,518
Antidepressants would inhibit
his autonomic nervous system,

407
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,796
speed up the attacks.

408
00:23:56,869 --> 00:24:01,432
LMNO, PTU, blood thinners,
none of them will solve this problem.

409
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:04,739
The man's got a real-life
Harlequin Romance in his head.

410
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,609
We're gonna pull out
the 1940 playbook.

411
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,084
Bilateral electrodes,
high-stimulus sine-wave intensity,

412
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,382
turning that dial
all the way to 11.

413
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,533
It's basic brain chemistry.

414
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,386
We interrupt protein synthesis,
altering the neurotransmitter system.

415
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,791
End result, no memories,
no Amy, no problem.

416
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,133
Go ahead.

417
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,698
You heard the
lady, go plug him in.

418
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,640
Am I really that pathetic?

419
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,277
What are you talking about?

420
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,721
If I had pitched
electroshock therapy

421
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,385
as a cure for broken heart
syndrome any other time,

422
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,158
you'd have dug in, made me try a
hundred other useless things first.

423
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,461
So either you're actually
beginning to trust me

424
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,593
or you just feel sorry for me.

425
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,536
You presented a
reasonable argument.

426
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,474
You were clear-headed
and non-impulsive about it.

427
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,011
Never once used
the word "moron."

428
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,941
The rehab's working, House.

429
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,864
You'll still be able to
perform routine functions

430
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,517
like walking, talking,
tying your shoes.

431
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:28,789
The treatment targets the
anterior cingulated cortex.

432
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,263
It should only affect your
experiential memories.

433
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:36,359
So my parents? My childhood?

434
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,496
If this works, you
won't remember them.

435
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,700
Or your firefighting training.

436
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,676
And Amy.

437
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,614
Are you okay with that?

438
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,276
I wouldn't miss her, right?

439
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:56,686
Tell Amy how you feel.
Because if she loves you...

440
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:02,058
No. I won't do that to
her. Or to my brother.

441
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,358
You're effectively killing who
you are just to keep this secret.

442
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,734
She doesn't love me.

443
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,054
Caterpillar?

444
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:36,458
Lower intestine
with ulcerative colitis.

445
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:40,798
You crash art therapy classes
just for the adrenaline rush?

446
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:45,634
Cuddy wouldn't get off the phone until
I promised I'd come and see for myself.

447
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,002
I got to admit, this
move I did not expect.

448
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,980
Well, don't tell anyone, but the photos
of smiling people in the brochures,

449
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,778
it's just marketing.

450
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,381
Well, you're obviously
making an effort.

451
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:06,453
So I suppose the next step
is for me to talk to the DA.

452
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,087
Which you have
no intention of doing.

453
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,529
No.

454
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,929
So words mean nothing, actions
mean nothing, what the hell is left?

455
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,379
You son of a bitch!

456
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,607
What about your
words, your actions?

457
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,846
"Got to get House cleaned up. Got
to get him to show some humility."

458
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,200
But when it comes to
actually doing something,

459
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,750
you prove that all you care
about is bitch-slapping a guy

460
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,989
who refused to kiss your ass!

461
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,056
You ever trust an addict?

462
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,936
You ever give one the
benefit of the doubt?

463
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,081
How many times did
that work out for you...

464
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,164
Yeah, I get it.

465
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:58,438
And so you were screwed over by
your wife, your mother, your partner.

466
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:02,111
But you keep sending them Christmas cards
while you take it out on everyone else!

467
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,150
No more Christmas cards.

468
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:06,710
No, I learned.

469
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,718
People like you,
even your actions lie.

470
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,301
I'm scared.

471
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,599
I know.

472
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,935
I'm gonna give you a muscle
relaxant so your body doesn't convulse.

473
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,070
Count backwards from 10.

474
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:42,115
Ten, nine, eight,

475
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,585
seven...

476
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,300
Go.

477
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,183
What's your name? Derek.

478
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,452
Heart sounds good.

479
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,087
Do you know what city we're in?

480
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,927
No.

481
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:32,194
Would you be okay
with a couple of visitors?

482
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,857
Derek, it's me. Brock.

483
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,661
I'm your brother, and when you get
out of here, you'll be staying with me.

484
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,443
I'm Amy.

485
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,975
I'm your friend.

486
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,582
I'm sorry, but I don't
remember either of you.

487
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,082
We've given him four
rounds of electroshock.

488
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:45,703
The charge made his voice a little
higher, but the EKG and BP are good.

489
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:47,912
Good.

490
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,107
We're gonna give him his
last round in the morning,

491
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,151
then be in court
for your hearing.

492
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,412
Thanks.

493
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,788
I'm gonna stay
here. Monitor Derek.

494
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:03,759
Thanks for the update.

495
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:11,526
My next condolence call is
arriving. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

496
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,211
I got you something.

497
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,080
Nice.

498
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:33,555
I figured it might help make a
good impression on the judge.

499
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,389
It's not that nice.

500
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,524
I had no business
blaming you for any of this.

501
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:47,531
I know you were just trying
to help me. Protect me.

502
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,566
That's what friends do.

503
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,271
Is this an apology?

504
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,782
Part of the program.

505
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,081
If you don't like it, I
can stop. Not at all.

506
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,621
It's just so

507
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,620
unfamiliar.

508
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,251
Please, keep going.

509
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,111
He looks lost.

510
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,773
It's gonna take him a while.

511
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,550
Brock's pulling a double shift.

512
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,413
He can't stand to
see him this way.

513
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,591
Derek's gonna need him, Amy.

514
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:46,120
I know the timing isn't great
with a wedding coming up.

515
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,057
What wedding?

516
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,364
Yours. You and Brock.

517
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:54,396
We're not getting married.
We don't even date.

518
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:57,641
Why would you think
we're getting married?

519
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,645
When you first offered Dr. House
the chance to check into drug rehab,

520
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:03,943
how did he respond?

521
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,541
He told me to get
out of his office.

522
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:11,517
I warned him that he could end up
in prison and lose his medical license.

523
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,988
If he was concerned,
he didn't show it.

524
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,858
So you continued
your investigation?

525
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:17,987
Yes.

526
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:19,929
Which is what led me
to the hospital pharmacy.

527
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,411
Turn it off. What did
you tell the pharmacist

528
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,529
was the reason for your visit?

529
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:28,073
I thought I told you never
to call me when I'm on trial.

530
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,802
The memories were false.
We fried his brain for nothing.

531
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,687
Whatever was killing
him before is still there.

532
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:33,735
We did an MRI.

533
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:36,281
<i>There's slight hypo-perfusion
in the anterior cortex.</i>

534
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,647
What did you find when you
checked the pharmacy log?

535
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,549
Hold on, Mr. Vickers.

536
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,554
Thanks, Your Honor.
It's hard to hear.

537
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,966
Did you test for clotting
time and LV function?

538
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,068
I believe that this is a medical
emergency, Your Honor.

539
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,532
His blood's normal and his
heart's pumping it up to the brain.

540
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:50,994
But it's not all getting there.

541
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,473
Something's obstructing
the blood flow...

542
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,295
Dr. House, you were
given adequate notice

543
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,891
to make arrangements
for your patients.

544
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,937
There's no hyper intensity to
suggest a foreign body near the region.

545
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:01,115
<i>And no signs of infection
or vascular malformations.</i>

546
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,300
It's lower down.

547
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,603
Dr. House, hang up!

548
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,553
<i>The cytology on the LP
doesn't suggest a tumor.</i>

549
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:06,670
Now!

550
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,577
Hang on a second.

551
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,209
Does your voice always get that
high and annoying when you're angry?

552
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,915
Do you want to go to jail?

553
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,286
No, thank you.

554
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:23,117
Set him up for a selective vertebral
angiography. I'm on my way.

555
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,856
Dr. House.

556
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,297
House! Sit down!

557
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,197
Why? I'm bored.

558
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,479
There's nothing I can say or do
that's gonna make a difference here.

559
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:34,803
If you leave this room, I
will find you in contempt.

560
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,671
Get a recess.

561
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,138
Are you out of your mind?

562
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,873
They said they wanted me
there, but I don't think they like me.

563
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:44,143
His voice isn't high because
of the electrical charges.

564
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,707
It's another symptom
of menopause.

565
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,448
His system keeps getting
hit by women's issues,

566
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,319
so let's follow the pattern.

567
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,325
What might obstruct the blood flow
that's more common in women than men?

568
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,156
- Is the catheter in?
- Go back to court.

569
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,490
We'll let you know the results.

570
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,394
Shut up and wire him.

571
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,263
Center the image on the
interpeduncular cistern.

572
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,271
Keep it moving at
30 frames per second.

573
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:09,138
If you think the arteries are
narrowing, you're gonna need still shots,

574
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,506
which we can do without you.

575
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,340
The problem is not
how wide the road is.

576
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,870
There's a guy with a squeegee
on the sidewalk flagging cars.

577
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,382
That's what's
causing the slowdown.

578
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,215
We find him, we
find the problem.

579
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,118
He's wired. Go!

580
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,884
Injecting the dye.

581
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,318
Blood's in the capillaries.

582
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,092
There.

583
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,126
Mr. Squeegee.

584
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:37,325
Spinal meningioma pushing
on the nerves to the vocal cords

585
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,064
creates the voice change.

586
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,198
And that nerve just happens to
live right near the meningeal branch

587
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:46,472
of the vertebral artery, obstructs
the blood flow to the brain.

588
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,378
The brain malfunctions,
creating false memories.

589
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:53,484
Memories cause love. Love kills.

590
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,682
And we didn't
completely screw up.

591
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,624
Cleaning the slate bought us
time to find the real problem.

592
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,422
On the other hand,
if we had been better,

593
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,326
we wouldn't have
needed the time.

594
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:06,490
Schedule him for
surgery. Dig that thing out.

595
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:10,057
He can start enjoying real
misery instead of the fake stuff.

596
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,070
House.

597
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,842
I just heard that you
apologized to Wilson.

598
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,741
Detoxing. I didn't
know what I was saying.

599
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:30,722
Excuse me.

600
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,023
I have to go to jail.

601
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:43,226
What is your position
at Princeton-Plainsboro?

602
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,293
Chief Administrator
and Dean of Medicine.

603
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,450
And you're responsible for
oversight of the pharmacy?

604
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,700
Yes.

605
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,203
Sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

606
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:55,179
I hope you don't mind that
we continued on without you?

607
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:58,512
I said I was sorry. There's
no need to be sarcastic.

608
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,517
What is this?

609
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:06,024
That's our prescription
sign-out log from December 24th.

610
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,424
Does that appear to be
Dr. House's signature?

611
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:09,586
Yes.

612
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:10,993
What has he signed for?

613
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:15,363
A prescription for oxycodone in
the name of patient Larry Zebalusky.

614
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,368
And did those pills
ever reach that patient?

615
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,562
No. Why?

616
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:19,934
He was already dead.

617
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,734
And Dr. House knew this?

618
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:22,830
Yes.

619
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:28,778
So, Dr. House had no legal or medical
basis for acquiring that oxycodone?

620
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,943
Dr. Cuddy?

621
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,488
He never got the pills.

622
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:45,119
It's his signature. The
log is strictly controlled.

623
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:48,394
Dr. House did pick up a prescription,
but it wasn't for oxycodone.

624
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,300
It says oxycodone.
You testified...

625
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,998
I know, but it wasn't oxycodone.

626
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,204
Dr. Wilson informed me that
Dr. House already tried to steal

627
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,508
the pain medication of this
patient, which made clear to me

628
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,949
that Dr. House was in a particularly
vulnerable and desperate state.

629
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,013
So I went to the pharmacy
and I swapped bottles.

630
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:11,556
Dr. House only got a
bottle with placebos.

631
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,354
I understand your impulse to
protect a valued colleague...

632
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,203
I have it right here on
the inventory report...

633
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,061
Your Honor, she's lying! She's
obviously forged that report.

634
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,250
In light of this evidence...

635
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,426
If this is real, why didn't
she mention it earlier?

636
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,093
I move to dismiss this case!

637
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:25,569
There is other
evidence, Your Honor!

638
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,095
Everyone shut up and sit down.

639
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,473
Dr. Cuddy, why are you only
now coming forward with this?

640
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,448
I guess I never
expected it to go this far.

641
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,117
The witness is excused.

642
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,885
Your Honor, you can't
seriously believe...

643
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,358
Dr. House, please stand.

644
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,630
My suspicion is your boss...

645
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,702
My suspicion is you have
better friends than you deserve.

646
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:04,004
Rules and laws
apply to everyone.

647
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,909
You are not as
special as you think.

648
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,947
But Detective Tritter
chose to make you so.

649
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:14,213
Detective, I don't know
exactly what's going on here,

650
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:18,052
but I am sure that this man is not
flooding the streets with cocaine.

651
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,820
I'm also certain that,
knowing Dr. House,

652
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,691
he must have done
something to set you off.

653
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,663
But you're gonna
have to live with it.

654
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:31,669
Given Dr. Cuddy's testimony, I'm not
going to allow this to proceed to jury.

655
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:35,229
Case dismissed.
Court is adjourned.

656
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:42,912
Dr. House, you're still guilty of
contempt for that little walkout earlier.

657
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,421
You'll be spending
the night in jail,

658
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,850
and after that you're going
right back to your rehab.

659
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:50,681
Bailiff, take
Dr. House into custody.

660
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,060
Dr. House.

661
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,140
So should I be looking
for you in the shadows,

662
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,042
or flinch every time
a car backfires?

663
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:15,644
Good luck.

664
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,276
I hope I'm wrong about you.

665
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,326
They got the meningioma.

666
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:39,235
Your brain should start
generating real memories again.

667
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:41,364
What do I do when I get out?

668
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,332
You have people who love
you. They'll take care of you.

669
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,609
You start over.

670
00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:00,152
I'm surprised to see you're not
spooning your way through the walls.

671
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:07,292
So, what do you say? How
about a conjugal visit to celebrate?

672
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:11,496
There's nothing to celebrate,
House! You made me perjure myself.

673
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,167
Fabricate evidence.

674
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,870
You make everyone around
you worse for being there.

675
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,479
The only bright spot is
that now I own your ass.

676
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:28,509
When you get out of rehab, you're
gonna be pulling double clinic duty,

677
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:32,489
giving lectures to students,
helping me find donors,

678
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:36,358
pretty much anything
else I ask. You got it?

679
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,339
Your buprenorphine.

680
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:56,972
You get these from the
pharmacy or from Voldemort?

681
00:41:57,048 --> 00:42:00,177
Voldemort. Why?
What difference does it...

682
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,925
That's Vicodin. He's
been slipping you Vicodin?

683
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:12,828
No! He'd be risking his
minimum-wage job to do that.

684
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,172
The whole time?

685
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,902
My higher power
said it was okay.

686
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:25,773
Nothing's changed?

687
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,675
Nothing's changed.

688
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,216
The apology.

689
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:45,463
You didn't need to do
that to make this work.

690
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,465
Believe what you want.

691
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,663
Good night, House.

692
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:55,106
I'll see you tomorrow.

693
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,539
Good night, Wilson.
