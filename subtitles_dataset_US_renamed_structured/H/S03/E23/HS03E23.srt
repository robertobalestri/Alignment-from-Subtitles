1
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,042
So you want me to
explain how you just lost?

2
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,987
Or do you want to stare at the
board your full three minutes,

3
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,080
cling to hope?

4
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,730
Come on. It's
called speed chess.

5
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,553
<i>Hey, hey, hey, goodbye</i>

6
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,415
Good game.

7
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,345
I said good game.

8
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,061
Hey! Hey!

9
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,974
Wait! Stop it! Listen...

10
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,908
Back away. Back away.

11
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,086
Call 911. Get an ambulance!

12
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,485
Tell them to send two!

13
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,050
My head's going to explode!

14
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,257
Your head still hurt?

15
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,628
You a moron?

16
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,791
Nate!

17
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:50,104
I'm clutching my head in
pain and he asks if it hurts?

18
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,831
What are you, some
kind of med student?

19
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,000
You look like you still
have theme birthday parties.

20
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,236
Sorry.

21
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,742
Any problems concentrating
in school lately?

22
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:03,409
What, besides the dreams of running my
tongue along my French teacher's breasts?

23
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,475
No, I'm doing quite great.

24
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,288
The rage and pain could
be caused by a parasite.

25
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,051
Does he eat a lot of sushi? No.

26
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,655
He was a vegetarian
until just a few months ago.

27
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,752
Any changes in behavior
since the new diet?

28
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,887
No.

29
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,932
He's been this way since
he became a teenager.

30
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,367
It doesn't matter how much I yell
or punish, he's still gonna say what...

31
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:26,066
Yeah. Let's all shed a tear
for poor little Nate's mother.

32
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,743
Any more stupid questions? Nate!

33
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,347
I hate this kid.

34
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,375
I like this kid.

35
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,645
You haven't met him.

36
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,550
I know you hate him. What
more do I need to know?

37
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,188
Kid's not a clichÃ©. Anybody
can get into a fight after losing.

38
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,726
It takes real creativity to
beat up someone you just beat.

39
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,427
The pain's not
limited to his head.

40
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,964
The rest of his bumps and
bruises are accounted for

41
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,775
by the 17 fights he's
been in this semester.

42
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,799
Concussion?

43
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,495
MRI was clean, no
frontal lobe tumor,

44
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,038
and the tox screen showed no
trace of coke or amphetamines.

45
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,733
Nate went medieval
on the other kid.

46
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:00,899
Could be... Hold on.

47
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,633
I'm having a moment.

48
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:09,515
This could be Foreman's last time
mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.

49
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,712
Which could create excess adrenaline,
causes the head pain and rage.

50
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,482
But not the
personality disorder.

51
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,546
There is no
personality disorder.

52
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:17,957
He's a teenager.

53
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,960
Being a teenager excuses
the odd inappropriate comment.

54
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,791
This kid say
anything appropriate?

55
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,422
He's having cluster headaches.

56
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:27,434
Probably been having them for
years. Question is, what's causing them?

57
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,494
If it were just a cluster headache,
he'd have swelling around the eyes.

58
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,732
ER gave him
ibuprofen for the pain.

59
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,351
Useless for this pain, but it
could've knocked down the swelling.

60
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,310
Best bet is a vascular problem.

61
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,973
Normal treatment for cluster headaches
is steroids, which the ER also gave him.

62
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,515
He's still in pain,
which means...

63
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,778
Normal treatment is
called "normal treatment"

64
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,931
because sometimes you
have to use abnormal treatment.

65
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,574
Start him on blood thinners,

66
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,057
and give his noggin
transcranial magnetic stimulation.

67
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,792
And don't you dare
touch that acerbic wit.

68
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,162
Fifty bucks to whichever of
you steps up and treats this brat.

69
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,894
Not the kid's fault. He's sick.

70
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,128
Fine. You do it.

71
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,465
No way. He's your brat.

72
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,037
I'll do it. But I've got a
job interview after work.

73
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,641
Anything comes up
later, you guys handle it.

74
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,041
Need a peer recommendation?

75
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,238
Thanks.

76
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,682
Cameron should suffice.

77
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,270
This isn't going to turn me into
some, like, drooling vegetable

78
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:28,455
who wets his pants, is it?

79
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,928
It's safe.

80
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,933
The magnetic pulses activate nerve cells,
which will hopefully squelch the head pain.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,231
Is there anything you can
do about the other pain?

82
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,362
From the fights?

83
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,896
Yeah, I mean, my face,
my shoulder, my stomach.

84
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,175
I mean, I can barely
bend my fingers.

85
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,508
You're already on pain
meds. Nothing more I can do.

86
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,047
Sure you can, man.

87
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,275
Tell your homies to
quit stomping on me.

88
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,577
I'll get the word out
that you're a great guy.

89
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,184
So do people watch
what they say around you?

90
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,521
Because I'm black?

91
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,093
No, because you're gay.

92
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,929
Cluster headaches
can persist for years,

93
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,305
cause irritability or even
hostility towards others.

94
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,944
You mean the illness is
affecting his personality?

95
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,039
If these treatments
work, it could...

96
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,913
Change him? Yeah.

97
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,075
Oh, thank God!

98
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,227
You must think I'm awful.

99
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,853
Here my son's lying
in a hospital bed...

100
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,989
I'm pretty sure I get it.

101
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,963
I thought I was a bad mother.

102
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,100
And I hated myself

103
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,105
because I hated him.

104
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,016
What do you got for
me this fine morning?

105
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,681
Blood thinners and TMS had no
effect. It's not cluster headaches.

106
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,418
You accusing the
symptoms of lying?

107
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,857
Could be hemochromatosis.

108
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,861
Wouldn't account for
the personality disorder.

109
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,157
What about hypothyroidism?

110
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,030
He's not getting aggressive and lethargic.
He's getting aggressive and aggressiver.

111
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,796
What about ruptured
dermoid cyst?

112
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:20,204
Sorry. I just got dizzy there.
I was expecting to turn right.

113
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,105
It's Foreman's turn
to be shot down.

114
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,303
The thing that Cameron said.

115
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,647
Way to think outside the box.

116
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,205
But no fat in the ventricles.
It's cluster headaches.

117
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,446
Normal treatment didn't work.
Abnormal treatment didn't work.

118
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,680
Good point, Foreman.

119
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:37,085
But treatments don't always
work. Symptoms never lie.

120
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:40,150
The only approved treatment left
for cluster headaches is brain surgery,

121
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,127
and that's not even a guarantee.

122
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,857
Back off, Foreman!

123
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,229
If the approved treatment doesn't work,
we go with an unapproved treatment.

124
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,664
Hey!

125
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,236
Something on your mind?

126
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,109
Because you totally can't tell.

127
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:02,013
I had a job interview lined up
at New York Mercy yesterday.

128
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:06,110
Hospital for Manhattan's glitterati. Big
coup. Your homies would be kvelling.

129
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,917
Didn't happen, because
apparently I called to cancel.

130
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,514
I don't remember
making that call.

131
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,616
You think I have a
neurological issue? Yes.

132
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,892
Why are you jerking me around?

133
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,019
It wasn't me.

134
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,222
Yeah.

135
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,397
It was one of the other petty,
socially repressed asses I work for.

136
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,995
Maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.

137
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,979
If you want me to stay,
tell me you want me to stay.

138
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,139
Would it matter?

139
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,308
No, but it'd be the
adult way to handle it.

140
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,477
If the adult way doesn't
work, why bother with it?

141
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,042
I've been totally professional!

142
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,184
Gave two weeks' notice,
continued to work cases,

143
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,316
scheduled my interviews
on my own time.

144
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,693
You have no right to
screw with my future.

145
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,863
You're gonna be all whiny during
the differential diagnoses, aren't you?

146
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,504
It wasn't me.

147
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,907
I only sabotage people
I consider worth it.

148
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,080
You are one evil, cunning woman.

149
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,451
It's a massive turn-on.

150
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,360
You girls can gossip later.

151
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,191
What are you talking about?

152
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:27,257
You called New York Mercy to
have Foreman's job interview killed.

153
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,283
When I said, "You
girls can gossip later,"

154
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:32,967
I was throwing you
out, but in a polite way.

155
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,043
Well, I take it you're off
your anti-depressants.

156
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,843
You're deflecting. Only
I'm allowed to do that.

157
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,473
Does Foreman
actually think I did that?

158
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,176
No. Just me.

159
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,480
But I know something
he doesn't: I didn't do it.

160
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,677
Why would I do it?

161
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,153
Do you want him to leave? No.

162
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,849
Are you planning
on doing something?

163
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,482
I'm waiting for board approval.

164
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,598
But if he takes the job,
there's nothing to be done.

165
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,117
You had to stop him.

166
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,720
It wasn't me.

167
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,342
What are you doing?

168
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,271
Looking for a tell. Rapid
eye blink, twitch of the lips.

169
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,247
Send in Nurse Unger when
you pass her on your way out.

170
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,982
Oh, almost forgot.

171
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,046
I need to give a 16-year-old
magic mushrooms

172
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,318
to treat a cluster headache.

173
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,619
Is that cool?

174
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,160
Yeah, no problem.

175
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,964
I was being sarcastic.

176
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,565
It wouldn't look that way
in the court transcript.

177
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,899
Mushrooms have psilocybins
that work on cluster headaches.

178
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,035
It's either that or cutting into his
brain and going on a fishing expedition.

179
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,875
I assume you've considered he
could have a psychogenic experience,

180
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,745
possibly suffer a fit
of severe paranoia.

181
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,744
Well, I have now.

182
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,697
Yeah, it's definitely better that
the Dean of Medicine prescribes it

183
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,850
instead of an unhinged doctor
with a history of drug use.

184
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:01,952
Takes the stink off if the patient decides
to put on a cape and fly off the roof.

185
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:07,090
Low dose. No more than 10
milligrams, tightly controlled setting.

186
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,868
And make sure the
mother signs off on it.

187
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,404
Party on, Garth.

188
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:14,669
And don't stand in
Foreman's way. It's just wrong.

189
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,509
New research shows that a chemical
component in the mushrooms can...

190
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,745
Yeah, lots of technical medical
stuff. So when do I get them?

191
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,814
I went to college. I
know about mushrooms.

192
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,719
Friend of a friend
shot himself in the foot.

193
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,258
They're not giving
me a gun, Enid!

194
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,858
Sign the consent form.

195
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,728
We'll be monitoring him,
but cardiac arrest is possible.

196
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,026
Big "E,"

197
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,364
small "N"...

198
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,801
And if the mushrooms don't work?

199
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,632
The next step would be
a type of brain surgery.

200
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,707
Oh, God.

201
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,266
Pain's getting worse!

202
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,938
Need shrooms now!

203
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,629
Oh, yeah.

204
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,571
Nate, how's the pain?

205
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:27,742
Hey, hey! It's Skippy,
the bush kangaroo!

206
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,873
<i>Your head, Nate. We need
to know how the pain is.</i>

207
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,976
What I got here

208
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,982
is the opposite of pain.

209
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,685
That means you're suffering from cluster
headaches, which means hopefully...

210
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,852
Man, you're hot.

211
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,254
She's making me horny.

212
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,355
<i>Deal with it.</i>

213
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,335
Hey, hey, hey, you can't get me
stoned, then not close the deal.

214
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,463
<i>Shut up. Take it easy.</i>

215
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,035
You'll regret saying no!

216
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,909
Check it out.

217
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,541
Oh, for God's sake.

218
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,272
Hold it.

219
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,542
What are you doing?

220
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,579
He has undersized testes.

221
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,185
His other secondary sexual
characteristics are normal.

222
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,193
If you want to curry favor with me,
avoid discussions of other men's testicles.

223
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,125
Thanks.

224
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,633
Focus on phrases like,

225
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,112
"You were right about
the cluster headaches."

226
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,729
You're wrong about
what caused them.

227
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,138
Vascular problem in a major
artery wouldn't cause hypogonadism.

228
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:32,668
Okay, what causes rage, headaches,
personality disorder and hypogonadism?

229
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,308
Where's Foreman?

230
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,609
He's mad at me.

231
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,708
Why? No reason.

232
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,116
Yeah. That makes sense.

233
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:43,020
The male genitals are controlled by
the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.

234
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,955
We're not talking about
Foreman anymore.

235
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,322
Kid's being pummeled at school.

236
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,861
A couple blows to the head
can cause hypothalamic lesions.

237
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,307
We ever going to talk about what
happens when Foreman's gone?

238
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,995
If this were an employee-owned
airline in Scandinavia, yes.

239
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,179
It's not lesions. His temperature
would be all over the map.

240
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,001
Symptoms don't lie.

241
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,508
He's gone in less than a week,
and you haven't even read a rÃ©sumÃ©.

242
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,737
Doesn't even need to.
The two of us can handle it.

243
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,371
Craniopharyngioma
fits the symptoms.

244
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,075
Biopsy the brat's pituitary.

245
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,281
And let the record show I was
right about the cluster headaches.

246
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,421
Forget it!

247
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,766
It's a straightforward
procedure.

248
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,910
We thread an endoscopic
tube up through the nostril...

249
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,622
And cut something out
of my brain? No way.

250
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,559
If it's a tumor,
it could kill you.

251
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,225
Just give me more
shrooms, okay? I'll be fine.

252
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,580
You only need my consent, right?

253
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,364
Yeah, but it'll be
a lot easier if...

254
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,631
Do whatever you have to do.

255
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:36,375
You don't touch me, all right?
You can touch me, just not my brain.

256
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,287
Nate, you got to do this.
I can't take it anymore...

257
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:41,907
My God, Mom! Save me the
melodramatic hand-wringing, okay?

258
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,416
Loosen up! Get yourself coited.

259
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,214
I'm going to give
him a sedative.

260
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,755
You're decent-looking,
Dr. Skippy.

261
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,351
Why don't you
take her for a ride?

262
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,488
Nate?

263
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,059
<i>Are you in pain?</i>

264
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,365
Nate?

265
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,338
His heart rate's normal.
Respiration's even.

266
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,379
What's happening?
What's the matter with him?

267
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,707
He's jaundiced. His
liver's shutting down.

268
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,451
We've started him on
sodium polystyrene sulfonate.

269
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,288
His liver's operating
at about 20%

270
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,918
and deteriorating fast.

271
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:33,290
Which means he'll be dead long
before Foreman turns in his parking pass.

272
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:37,667
So what causes personality
disorder, head pain, blah, blah, blah,

273
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,204
and liver failure?

274
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,208
Liver failure can cause
hypogonadism, head pain.

275
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,074
Altered mental status leads to
the personality disorder and rage.

276
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,222
All we need to do is figure
out what caused the liver failure.

277
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:50,444
Yes. Also, we need to figure
out how symptoms yesterday

278
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,382
can be caused by
liver failure today.

279
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,563
If his liver's failing now,
it wasn't great yesterday.

280
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,907
If it wasn't operating at
capacity, it could have caused...

281
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,658
Don't sneak up on
a person like that!

282
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:01,927
I'm listening.

283
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,622
Well, listening doesn't help me.

284
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:08,323
Okay. Let's go with the liver
and a time-machine theory.

285
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,293
Foreman, what
causes liver problems?

286
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,668
Wilson's Disease.

287
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,434
No. Ceruloplasmin is normal.

288
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,999
No enlargement and no
palpable mass, so no cancer.

289
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,513
Could be a narrowing of the bile
ducts. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis.

290
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,744
Most liver damage begins with
what we put in our bodies. Foreman?

291
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,715
Angry teen... Alcohol.

292
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,549
No. Blood tests were negative.

293
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,749
No signs of drug use or acetaminophen
poisoning in his tox screen.

294
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,519
Maybe the water
was contaminated.

295
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,424
His mother would also be sick.

296
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,688
Cuddy?

297
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,025
Sounded like someone would back.

298
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,424
Go.

299
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:47,065
We'll try and muddle through
without your blank stare to guide us.

300
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,701
So if it's not the bad things he's
putting in, what about the good things?

301
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,335
He was raised a vegetarian.

302
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,640
"Was raised."

303
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,813
Means he's all grown up, or
he's not a vegetarian anymore.

304
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,785
He started eating red
meat a few months ago.

305
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,452
Unless he's been
buying cuts of mad cow,

306
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,298
his body would have no
problem metabolizing it.

307
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,655
What if he had an
OTC deficiency?

308
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,923
Body can't metabolize
nitrogen, damages the liver.

309
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,987
Run a hamburger test.

310
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,108
It's exactly what
it sounds like.

311
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,102
Stuff him full of meat, wait
for his ammonia levels to spike.

312
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,112
I'll double your salary.

313
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,883
Chase and Cameron would
mutiny if they found out.

314
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,216
Chase and Cameron wouldn't be
heading up their own diagnostic group.

315
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,186
You'd work in parallel with
House. It'll be your practice.

316
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:42,254
Separate staff, separate
cases, complete autonomy.

317
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,593
I've only been doing
this for three years.

318
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,098
Three years under House.

319
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,258
No better training.

320
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,928
And when that case comes
along that I can't figure out,

321
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,267
you know who I'd have to go to.

322
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:56,265
Or you can just let that patient
die. That's completely up to you.

323
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,008
No.

324
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,344
Why?

325
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:08,882
He's evil.

326
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,848
He didn't sabotage
your interview.

327
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,924
How do you know?

328
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,255
Because I did.

329
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,328
I didn't!

330
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,326
You believed me. Means
you're not sure House did it.

331
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,269
Well, somebody did it.

332
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,365
Somebody here did it.

333
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,639
I can't work here.

334
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,954
This isn't a medical procedure.

335
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,162
This is just about Doogie
making me eat garbage.

336
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,065
We need to see how your
liver processes the proteins.

337
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,797
Then get me a steak.
Some roast beef.

338
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,235
What if I brought him
something from home?

339
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,018
It has to be prepared here so we know
there's no chemicals or preservatives

340
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,419
that could affect
the test results.

341
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,911
I'm not eating anything prepared

342
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,073
by five-dollar-an-hour immigrant
hospital cooks in hairnets.

343
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,446
Shut up!

344
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,542
Either you start eating or I'm
going to strap you to this bed

345
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,283
and shove these down
your throat one by one.

346
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,551
Got it?

347
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,256
Can't get mad at me!

348
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,892
I'm sick!

349
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,493
Supposed to feel bad for me.

350
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,104
Nurse, full set of
body restraints.

351
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,331
<i>Yes, Doctor.</i>

352
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:36,435
Trust me. It'll be a lot less
messy if you do it yourself.

353
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,395
You killed Foreman's
job interview.

354
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,626
Why would I... Somebody did.

355
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,743
Wasn't me, and it wasn't House,

356
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,146
which means it has to be somebody
who thought he was protecting House,

357
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,148
which means it has to be
somebody who actually likes House,

358
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,606
which means it's either you

359
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,575
or the weird night janitor who
wears his pants backwards.

360
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,736
I want Foreman to leave.

361
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,345
House has to realize he needs
someone who stands up to him.

362
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,097
Cameron's in love with him, Chase
is afraid of him and I enable him.

363
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,046
House needs
limits. I give him...

364
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,284
You authorize magic mushrooms.

365
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:29,021
House is a six-year-old who
thinks he's better off without parents.

366
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,326
A few tummy aches after
dinners of ice cream and ketchup

367
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,025
might do him some good.

368
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,430
You're lying.

369
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,233
An enabler doesn't conspire
against. An enabler enables.

370
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,143
What? You're paranoid.

371
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,037
You made that call.

372
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,843
And because of that call,

373
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,474
you basically guaranteed
Foreman's out of here.

374
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:02,723
I thought it'd be fun to
work on my boat with him.

375
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:06,562
And you went shirtless,
because skin cancer looks cool.

376
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,896
Well, I realize I got burnt.
I'm not too worried about that.

377
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,131
It's these white
marks. You know.

378
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,498
Lie down.

379
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:20,612
I mean, that boat has all sorts of lead
paint, and there's chemicals everywhere.

380
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,580
When Daddy works on his boat,

381
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:27,452
does he have a cooler with lots
of brown bottles with long necks?

382
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:32,448
And does Daddy like to lie down on
his boat and go nap-nap in the sun?

383
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,698
Oh! What the hell?

384
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:47,335
I will give you this for
the $1.41 in your pocket.

385
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,700
Wait. How could you know...

386
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,472
A psychic once told
me that I'm psychic.

387
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,549
Hey! One of these
quarters is Canadian.

388
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,114
Give me back my syringe.

389
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,525
Hamburger stress test showed
no change in his ammonia levels.

390
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,966
Liver's properly converting
the ammonia into urea.

391
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,027
He doesn't have OTC deficiency.

392
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,229
Welcome back.

393
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,434
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been
taking my problems out on the patient.

394
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,737
Or on me.

395
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,375
Apology accepted.

396
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,543
Starve him.

397
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,043
And what are we looking for?

398
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,778
Diabetic steatosis
would screw up his liver.

399
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,014
Starve him overnight and
see if his blood sugar pops.

400
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,399
We mess with his blood sugar,
we could set off another rage.

401
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,915
Not a problem. You can take him.

402
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,488
I want something to eat!

403
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,622
Honey, please don't.

404
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,698
What happened?

405
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,132
I was just trying to get a urine
sample and he went crazy.

406
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,763
I need to eat! You're not
sticking anything else in me!

407
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,238
It's just a few more hours.

408
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,506
You're going to hurt yourself.

409
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm going to hurt you!

410
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,042
As soon as we get a urine
sample, we can leave you alone.

411
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,137
You want your sample?
Here's your damn sample!

412
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,237
Nate, don't!

413
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,753
Oh, my God!

414
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,528
Nate, you need to get
back into bed. Right now.

415
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,301
Chem panel and
urinalysis confirms

416
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:31,003
the bloody urine was
caused by kidney failure.

417
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,037
He's on dialysis. He's going
to need it for the rest of his life.

418
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,105
Which is shortening as we speak.

419
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,248
We are looking at
a Chinese menu.

420
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,616
We've got symptoms
from too many columns.

421
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,416
They are going to overcharge us.

422
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:45,424
Multiple organ failure could
mean primary HIV infection.

423
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,653
That'd mean someone
agreed to sleep with him.

424
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,092
Plus, his serology is negative.

425
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,754
His uric acid's
slightly elevated.

426
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,025
Ten percent of males in
this country have elevated...

427
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,000
So we're only going to pay
attention to abnormal abnormalities?

428
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,537
We've been stuffing him with
meat and his kidneys are shot.

429
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,814
Of course his
uric acid level's...

430
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,137
Could be hepatic
fibrosis, or McAb.

431
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,975
Brat's got a genetic disorder.

432
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,136
Get the sequencing primers.

433
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,679
See if it's one of the
ones we can treat.

434
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,041
I can draw some blood,
but then I got to run.

435
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,481
Job interview?

436
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,849
You going to stop me if it is?

437
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,889
You do the nurse stuff.
They'll do the doctor stuff.

438
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,798
Is this a blood test for
our marriage license?

439
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:36,399
Planning on kidnapping me
to Massachusetts? Can't...

440
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,504
What did you give him?

441
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,742
Are you treating
him for something?

442
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,147
A sedative.

443
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,249
Did he need a sedative? I did.

444
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,016
Just shutting him up so I can
draw some of his blood in peace.

445
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:52,300
You walked in with that. You
didn't even give him a chance.

446
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,324
People are what they are.

447
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:54,621
He's sick.

448
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,219
The rudeness isn't his fault.

449
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:59,788
If he had tuberculosis, it
wouldn't be his fault either.

450
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,334
But I still wouldn't
let him cough on me.

451
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,507
Hi. Hey.

452
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,408
Where are you going?

453
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:21,215
The lab. We're testing our
patient's blood for a hereditary...

454
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,188
Cuddy thinks I sabotaged
Foreman's interview.

455
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,020
She's going to fire me.

456
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,650
I don't believe it.

457
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,729
She said it was
unprofessional and...

458
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:33,527
No, I mean, I literally
don't believe it.

459
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,330
Cuddy wouldn't fire you
for something like that.

460
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:42,233
Which means either she lied
to you or you're lying to me.

461
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,947
You so would have fallen
for that three years ago.

462
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,224
You were looking for a reaction.

463
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:52,047
You were looking for me to
feel bad for you, save your skin.

464
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,416
But how am I going to save you?

465
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,980
Unless you think I'm
the one who really did it.

466
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,293
Cuddy's logic was,

467
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,921
Foreman's valuable to
House, I care about House,

468
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:07,364
ergo, I would do
anything to save him.

469
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:11,598
And your logic was, I care about
House as much as you do, ergo...

470
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:14,702
It wasn't me.

471
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,070
I don't care about House.

472
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,337
I don't believe you.

473
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,402
No one does.

474
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,915
House is nothing more than my boss.
Foreman's nothing more than a colleague.

475
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,580
You're lying.

476
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,683
Everyone does.

477
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,922
But it wasn't me.

478
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,771
No markers for hepatic fibrosis.

479
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,766
And nothing for McAb.

480
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,136
Foreman's interview in
New York got screwed up.

481
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:53,474
I heard.

482
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,946
Foreman thought it was House.
House thought it was Cuddy.

483
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:59,041
Cuddy thought it was Wilson.
Wilson thought it was me.

484
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,116
And you think it was me?

485
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:08,289
God... You think I
sabotaged Foreman?

486
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,623
I don't even want him here.

487
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,061
I know.

488
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,325
Then why would I do...

489
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,629
I think you sabotaged Foreman
just to sabotage Foreman.

490
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,472
So everyone's a suspect because
everyone wants to help House,

491
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:26,979
except for me, I'm a suspect
because I'm a petty, vindictive jerk?

492
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,545
You actually think I would
do something like that?

493
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
It was someone.

494
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:36,982
It wasn't me.

495
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,422
Negative for Von Gierke disease.

496
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,887
And it's Tuesday.

497
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,425
I know.

498
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,364
I like you.

499
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:51,528
I know.

500
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,162
See you next Tuesday.

501
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,576
Found something.

502
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:05,013
He's got a partial HPRT
enzyme deficiency.

503
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,552
Means he could have
Kelley-Seegmiller Syndrome.

504
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,920
But it's a partial deficiency, so
it may not be Kelley-Seegmiller.

505
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,793
Yes, those are the
two options. It is,

506
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:16,885
or it isn't.

507
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,124
Kelley-Seegmiller explains
the aggressive personality.

508
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,667
If he had Kelley-Seegmiller,
he wouldn't just be aggressive.

509
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,430
He'd be self-mutilating. Chewing
his lips, banging his head.

510
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,131
Lovely disease.

511
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,572
Degenerative, fatal, incurable.

512
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,200
I wonder if that's why
Cameron's on the "not" side?

513
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,768
That and the fact that
symptoms don't lie.

514
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,576
Kelley-Seegmiller carriers
self-mutilate when they're stressed.

515
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,413
He's in ICU with a failing
liver and no kidneys.

516
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,316
Yeah, his life is sweet.

517
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,819
His vegetarian diet could have
limited the purines in his system,

518
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,882
slowing the disease's progress.

519
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,527
So let's speed it up.

520
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,619
Why?

521
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,691
So you two kids
will stop fighting.

522
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,234
Also, I don't feel like
waiting for respiratory failure.

523
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,430
Chase, find some way for the
mother to get lost for a while.

524
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,997
I'm going to stress this
kid till he bites off a finger.

525
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,082
You move me to geriatrics?

526
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,717
Who are you?

527
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,049
Dr. McCaney.

528
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,180
The man who's going to kick
your ass all over this chess board.

529
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,317
Well, I'm too weak to...

530
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,883
To bite yourself. Yeah.

531
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,792
You need some liquid energy.

532
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:27,455
Now if you consent, I'm gonna
give you this shot of adrenaline.

533
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,269
I don't want to play.

534
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,204
Aside from being
indicative of pituitary issues

535
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:38,506
and certain kinds of genetic
disorders, small testicles also indicate

536
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,442
that you're a big chicken.

537
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,350
Please don't make
me do the sound effect.

538
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,811
You're not going to
goad me into playing.

539
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,616
Didn't think I'd have to.

540
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,953
Thought you'd just jump at the
chance of humiliating someone.

541
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,325
Age before cripple. I'm white.

542
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,839
It is on.

543
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:22,043
Bird's Opening. Passive
approach. Sign of a coward.

544
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,423
Sicilian Defense.
Sign of an idiot.

545
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,618
Arrogance has to be earned.

546
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,956
Tell me what you've
done to earn yours.

547
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,997
I can walk.

548
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:34,994
I don't bleed out of my penis.

549
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,182
Check.

550
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,281
You know, it's a real thin
line between tortured genius

551
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,057
and awkward kid who can't
get girls because he's creepy.

552
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,533
Why are you doing this?

553
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,499
To stress you out.

554
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,135
Check.

555
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:17,969
Yeah, but why?

556
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,670
Well, I'd tell you,

557
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,374
but I figure it's more
stressful if you don't know why.

558
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,144
Yeah, well, I'm not
feeling too stressed.

559
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,011
You know that no
one likes you, right?

560
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,579
Yeah. Well, anybody like you?

561
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,954
You're dying.

562
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,494
Check.

563
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,533
Your move.

564
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,606
Care to lay down your king?

565
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:28,212
You can't win.

566
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,539
You can pin my queen.

567
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,214
My knight to E7.

568
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,617
Your king to H8.

569
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,678
Sacrifice rook takes pawn.

570
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:37,984
Bishop blocks.

571
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,490
Queen to H5.

572
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,958
Checkmate.

573
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,987
Save what's left
of your dignity.

574
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,331
Lay down your king.

575
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,874
Crap.

576
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,707
He's having a seizure.

577
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,779
Four milligrams I.V. lorazepam.

578
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:07,876
Right away.

579
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,603
I hate this kid.

580
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,242
I like this kid.

581
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,712
Did you get the job?

582
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,476
They're going to let me know.

583
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,484
Kelley-Seegmiller
didn't cause this seizure.

584
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:43,579
So we've got one more
symptom, one less diagnosis.

585
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,090
I assume they're going
to call for references.

586
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,216
Did you give them my name?

587
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,316
No.

588
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,191
Amyloidosis can cause seizures,

589
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:52,288
and the protein buildup
could cause organ failure.

590
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,957
Wouldn't alter his personality.

591
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,728
Whose name did you give?

592
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,930
My last boss.

593
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,003
Ouch.

594
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,962
That can't look good.

595
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,403
I hate this kid.

596
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,269
What if we're not dealing
with one condition?

597
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,143
What if it's
multiple conditions?

598
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,738
It's got to be one.
It's always one.

599
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,249
But nothing explains this
constellation of symptoms.

600
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,677
We've got to be
missing something.

601
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,586
Maybe the kid lied about some
medication. Maybe he's hiding something...

602
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:17,932
Why would he be
hiding something?

603
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:20,255
Well, I don't know,
because he's evil?

604
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,718
What if he is?

605
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,357
What if the symptoms lied?

606
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,265
There.

607
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:36,433
Now all we're looking at is a
simple evil jerk with amyloidosis.

608
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:37,737
You're not being objective.

609
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,243
Amyloidosis was your idea.

610
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,922
You were right. It
doesn't fit the symptoms.

611
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,847
Yeah, it does. Look.

612
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,977
You crossed it off because
you want to hate the kid,

613
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:47,528
and you can't hate
him if he's a victim...

614
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,647
You want him to be a victim because
you want to believe that people are good.

615
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,953
And if they're not, it's got
to be a chemical problem.

616
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,050
Except they're
not, and it's not.

617
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,561
Flush him with
immunosuppressants.

618
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,532
Get a biopsy to confirm,
and find him a marrow donor.

619
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,100
What'll happen to him?

620
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,074
Substances called
amyloid proteins

621
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,944
build up in the body's
organs, shutting them down.

622
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:23,017
It's a fairly rare disease,
and I'm afraid it can be fatal.

623
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:29,888
So, do you operate or
something to take them out?

624
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,362
He needs a bone
marrow transplant.

625
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,626
Dr. Cameron is
searching the donor bank.

626
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,867
We should test you as well.

627
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:48,210
When you first told
me he was sick, I was

628
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,014
happy.

629
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,880
Relieved.

630
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:58,952
Now...

631
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:07,025
Nate, I'm going to take a small
piece of nerve from your ankle.

632
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,434
Let me know if
you feel any pain.

633
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,901
I'm burning up.

634
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,297
Why can't you just knock
me out like you did last time?

635
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,602
Wish I could.

636
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,940
But your body has to be clear so
it's ready for a marrow transplant.

637
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,535
Hey, Dr. X.

638
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,942
I know you've busted
ass trying to save me.

639
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:27,082
It's all right.

640
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,051
I wasn't going to thank you.

641
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,450
I was going to tell you

642
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,553
you really suck at this.

643
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,519
We're doing our best.

644
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,024
That's sort of my point.

645
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,399
Your best really sucks.

646
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:53,837
Nerve biopsy was clean.
No evidence of amyloidosis.

647
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,915
It was your idea. Don't
give up on it so fast.

648
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,277
He's running a fever.

649
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:01,012
If it's two conditions, one of
them's got to be an infection.

650
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:03,698
We should start him on antibiotics,
see what clears up, what doesn't.

651
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,213
Is he having trouble breathing?

652
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,158
Yeah, he has mucus in
his chest from an infection.

653
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,286
Could also be from
an amyloid buildup.

654
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,694
Keep him on immunosuppressants
and biopsy somewhere else.

655
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,027
His sinuses.

656
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,863
Look, you got two choices:

657
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,945
engage me in a futile
argument then do what I asked,

658
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,460
or just do what I asked.

659
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,869
You're not ready.

660
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,406
There was a third choice.

661
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,373
"Don't do what I asked."

662
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:33,183
You could have defied me,
stuck the kid on antibiotics,

663
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,651
but you didn't.

664
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:38,214
Because you still trust my
judgment more than your own.

665
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,583
You sabotaged Foreman's
job interview, didn't you?

666
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,479
Foreman's already
been over this.

667
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,049
It wasn't me.

668
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:16,327
Everybody's chasing
ghosts over this,

669
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,953
which means either nobody did it

670
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,555
or somebody wants
everybody chasing ghosts.

671
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,800
Now, who does that sound like?

672
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,302
And why would I do that?

673
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,370
Because as long as Foreman
thought you were guilty,

674
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,805
he was going to be
useless around here.

675
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:37,182
You know, sometimes
I forget why I hired you.

676
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,948
You cost him a good
opportunity and gained nothing.

677
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,215
I cost him a crappy opportunity.

678
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:48,656
New York Mercy is where you go to
treat boils and cysts and build a 401-K.

679
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,161
If you want him
to stay, tell him.

680
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:52,857
I don't, and
there'd be no point.

681
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,160
You do.

682
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,396
And the point would be to
make him feel like he's wanted.

683
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,800
He doesn't need that.

684
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,238
All right, then, it'd make him
feel like maybe you weren't evil.

685
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,238
He needs that.

686
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,517
Talk to Foreman.

687
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,887
We dumped one symptom,

688
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,490
but forgot to add one.

689
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,671
Revenge time, Nate.

690
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,706
Are you... Yes, I am.

691
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,440
Black or white?

692
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,302
Just limp away.

693
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,245
He doesn't want to
play. Leave him alone.

694
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,647
Pick one, or this comes out.

695
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,119
And for all you know,
this is really important.

696
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:57,961
Stop it!

697
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,292
That hurts, right?

698
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,432
Which is odd, because
I'm really enjoying this.

699
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,636
You hold the pieces that way
because you can't bend your thumb,

700
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,340
because your bones
have formed abnormally,

701
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,543
thanks to all the crap that's been
pushing its way in between them.

702
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,102
Actually, this stuff
isn't important at all.

703
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,478
Your doctors said he
needs immunosuppressants.

704
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,450
They're idiots. It's
not amyloidosis.

705
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,952
It's iron.

706
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,784
He's got hemochromatosis.

707
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,985
The body absorbs iron from food
but can't process it, can't get rid of it.

708
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,829
<i>Idle iron is the
devil's playground.</i>

709
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,924
<i>Builds up in the organs and
joints, whacking them in the process.</i>

710
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:37,559
Causes all the symptoms.

711
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,870
Including something
that wasn't a symptom.

712
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,171
Those body aches? They
were not from the fighting.

713
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,040
His personality issues?

714
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,203
Sorry.

715
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,114
The iron's innocent
on that count.

716
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,140
Your kid's a jerk.

717
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,514
Yeah, it's probably your fault.

718
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,145
Although, if you'd stayed off
the meat like your mom said,

719
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,385
you'd have half as much
iron and be twice less

720
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,525
almost dead.

721
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,127
Oh, nurse!

722
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,304
This patient is bleeding,
for some reason.

723
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,430
Is he going to be okay?

724
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,872
He'll need dialysis,

725
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,469
gonna have to get his blood drained
every few months for the rest of his life.

726
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,013
My condolences.

727
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,441
It's going to be a
long and annoying life.

728
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,652
And I wouldn't have
taken your bishop.

729
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,250
I'd have moved my queen
to D6, defusing the threat,

730
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,818
then rook to E8,
attacking the king's pawn.

731
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,421
I'd have lost the exchange
but won the game.

732
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,832
I know.

733
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,635
I was bluffing.

734
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,032
And that's why

735
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,738
you lost.

736
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,441
Jerk.

737
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:19,002
You just here to watch or
you got something to say?

738
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,978
Still running the new
biopsy for amyloidosis?

739
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,983
Yeah. Still nothing.

740
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,191
Run the test again.
Recheck your results.

741
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:45,028
Looks like you're
in for an all-nighter.
