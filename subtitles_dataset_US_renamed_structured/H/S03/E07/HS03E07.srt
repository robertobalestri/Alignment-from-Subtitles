1
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:17,008
<i>- See you Tuesday.
- How about right now?</i>

2
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,417
<i>What? What?</i>

3
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,499
<i>You wanna throw in the towel?</i>

4
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,083
<i>No, I don't wanna
throw in the... towel!</i>

5
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,990
<i>I thought that's what you said!</i>

6
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,891
<i>I'm not upset about anything!</i>

7
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,389
<i>Where the... are we going?</i>

8
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,843
What are you doing down here?

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,632
I thought you usually
had lunch with Coma Guy.

10
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,502
This is Vegetative State
Guy. Better company.

11
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,042
Hey, hey, tell him
about those Sherpas

12
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,374
you dropped acid with in
Saint Patrick's Cathedral.

13
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:48,211
You stole my prescription
pad and you forged my name.

14
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,782
What did you
tell the cop? I lied.

15
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,333
They'd have put you
away for 10 years,

16
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,653
after they took your
license to practice medicine.

17
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,986
So, everything's good, then.

18
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,084
I lied. To the cops.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,856
There is no case
unless they can prove

20
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,763
that either I got the drugs
illegally or I sold them illegally.

21
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,110
I didn't do the second, you
lied about the first. Game over.

22
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,727
Yeah, Tritter's just playing.

23
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,465
He's gonna see how clever
you are and then just walk away.

24
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,182
The important thing is
that you keep prescribing

25
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,971
the same amount of drugs
to me or it'll look suspicious.

26
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,323
Here's another
way to look at it,

27
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,312
having forced me
to lie to the police,

28
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,679
your first concern is
securing your drug connection.

29
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,280
Joining my father for lunch?

30
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,282
I should have called
ahead for a table.

31
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,486
Dr. House was just...

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,222
Enjoying a Reuben.

33
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:36,755
It's okay.

34
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,961
After 10 years, anything that'll
get doctors in the same room as...

35
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,405
What are you doing? Nothing.

36
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,235
What are you doing?

37
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,838
Chips?

38
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,711
Wanna see something really cool?

39
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,723
I saw you leaving last Tuesday.

40
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,523
You practically tripped over
two guys on your way out,

41
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,529
but you had no
problem opening doors.

42
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,292
It's called akinetopsia.

43
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,596
You can't see things
when they move.

44
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:17,104
Now, since you haven't been hit by
a bus, I assume that it's intermittent.

45
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,581
It's probably
accompanied by seizures,

46
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,064
which made me think that I
could set one off by flashing the...

47
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,215
God, I love this family.

48
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,353
I can see fine now.

49
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,127
I've had seizures before.
Most of the time they're small.

50
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,758
Doctors ran me through all
the tests. Couldn't find anything.

51
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,098
Any history of
epilepsy in your family?

52
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,161
The only things I know
that run in my family are

53
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,935
a lot of chutzpah and the
ability to sleep for 10 years.

54
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,842
Although I'm not
really an expert.

55
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,021
Dad never really liked my
mother's side of the family,

56
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:36,141
and after she died and he came
here I was raised by a guardian.

57
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,348
I wouldn't even know how
to get in touch with them.

58
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,030
How about your father's
side of the family?

59
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,454
Any relatives we
could speak with?

60
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,081
My father was an only child.

61
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,523
And my grandparents are dead.

62
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,787
Well, who did you put down

63
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,659
as the person the hospital
should contact in an emergency?

64
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,789
I left it blank.

65
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,526
There's gotta be
someone, a friend...

66
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,794
I have plenty of friends.

67
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,393
Just no one that
would care if I was here.

68
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,665
Say, do you mind
passing me my backpack?

69
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,491
Hair of the dog.

70
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,791
- Could be infection.
- Or a brain tumor.

71
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:24,991
Says he had a CT.

72
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,159
What's wrong with the
simplest explanation? Trauma?

73
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,497
He didn't report any injuries.

74
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,628
He didn't report being
an alcoholic, either.

75
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,299
Drinking equals falling
down equals trauma equals...

76
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,466
Maybe it's inherited.

77
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:38,069
How would you jump to
genetics from his EEG?

78
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,879
All you've got are some
vaguely epileptiform waves.

79
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,247
It's not his EEG.
It's his father's.

80
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,287
When it comes to cortical
seizures, like father, like son.

81
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,913
Small seizures aren't unheard of

82
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,389
in a patient in a
vegetative state.

83
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,050
Similarities are
interesting, though.

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,718
What caused the
vegetative state?

85
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,524
His house burned down.

86
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,195
Went back in to get his wife,

87
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,857
firefighters found
him unconscious

88
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,992
three feet from the
bedroom, asphyxiated.

89
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,899
Not an inherited condition.

90
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,701
Test his DNA. Start with
adrenomyeloneuropathy.

91
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,003
Check out the home.

92
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:17,016
He has a single bed.

93
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,381
They still make single beds?

94
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,352
It could mean he
just doesn't have sex,

95
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,821
though there were
condoms in the apartment.

96
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,921
House asked you to check
out the home for toxins.

97
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,393
No mold, no leaks, no pets.

98
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,623
MRI and LP are
both inconclusive.

99
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,642
Infection's still possible,
tumor's less likely, but...

100
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,692
DNA? The
adrenomyeloneuropathy test

101
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:35,768
was negative.

102
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,997
DNA test again.

103
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,266
Try Unverricht-Lundborg
and late-onset Lafora's.

104
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,739
Genetic tests take forever.

105
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,967
You can't just keep testing for every
inherited condition you think it might be.

106
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,037
Well, not me. I'll be leaving
early. But you guys can.

107
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,579
You said no one's been sick but
what about delivery people, repair guy?

108
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,214
I wouldn't know.
I work from home.

109
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,489
Haven't been to the
office in over a month.

110
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,720
Visitors?

111
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,023
Haven't had any.

112
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,961
The only person I've
seen in the last week

113
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,398
was the pizza delivery guy
and he looked pretty healthy.

114
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,565
There's gotta be
someone you're close to.

115
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,633
Actually, the person I
see most often is my father.

116
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,704
He's asleep so he can't stop me.

117
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,343
What is it?

118
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,852
I'm just feeling
a little nauseous.

119
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,816
I think his liver's failing.

120
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,760
God. Does that mean that I'm...

121
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,959
We need a central line kit,

122
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:44,198
two units of packed red
blood cells type O Negative.

123
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,697
He's unconscious and
heading for a coma.

124
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,709
He's at a four on
the RLAS scale.

125
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,146
Stop all treatment.

126
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,711
You think this is a
reaction to our meds?

127
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,978
Well, they're
obviously not helping.

128
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,662
Given the fact that
he's an alcoholic,

129
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,031
there's a good chance his liver
wasn't so hot when he came in.

130
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,415
Anti-seizure drugs could have
just pushed him over the edge.

131
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,052
We take him off those
meds, what do we put him on?

132
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,220
I was hoping you'd know.

133
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,593
It may be academic, I
just started him on dialysis.

134
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:15,500
Kidney and liver failure. Not too
many people come back from that.

135
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,764
Trauma's out of the picture.
Could still be infection.

136
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,068
Or neurological... Or genetic.

137
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,402
We need a better history.

138
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,510
Did you miss the part where
the patient lost consciousness?

139
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,950
L-dopa?

140
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,448
You're not waking Kyle.
You're waking his father.

141
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,547
I commend your
observational skills.

142
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,750
You have no reason to think

143
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,123
any amount of drugs will
wake a man from a coma.

144
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,025
Vegetative state. Much easier.

145
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,963
This guy's no Terry Schiavo, his
brain's all there, he moves around,

146
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,727
his muscles have
barely atrophied.

147
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,099
He's just waiting
for a fairy-tale kiss.

148
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,729
After I do that, I'll
stick a needle in him.

149
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,741
The amount of amphetamines
alone would be dangerous,

150
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,006
besides whatever the
hell else you've got in there.

151
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,173
There are reports
out of South Africa

152
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:05,548
about a pill that would temporarily
revive someone in a vegetative state.

153
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,213
You've all seen
<i>Awakenings,</i> made me cry.

154
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,050
I wanna cry.

155
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,215
Put the syringe down.

156
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,593
I can outdraw you,
mysterious stranger.

157
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,791
We don't experiment
on helpless patients.

158
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,164
Be reasonable. There's
no way this is gonna work.

159
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,931
Even if you woke him, it
would only be for a few hours.

160
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,836
A day, two at the most.

161
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,305
You're risking his life.

162
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,173
I'm risking getting sued,
that's the only objection here.

163
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,712
You'll be torturing
him and his family.

164
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,215
Well, good news for Legal, the
only family he's got is upstairs dying.

165
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,614
Hey!

166
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,424
I want this patient monitored
for the next 24 hours.

167
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,225
I want someone
with him at all times

168
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,730
to make sure
you didn't kill him.

169
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,029
I want your ass in my office.

170
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,571
God, I'm starving.

171
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,567
I could really go for a steak.

172
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,186
Do you know your name?
Do you know where you are?

173
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,314
Gabriel Wozniak. I don't
know the name of this hospital.

174
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,586
How much are three and five?

175
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,521
Eight.

176
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:25,722
Also known as half of 16, a
quarter of 32, two to the third power.

177
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,592
Coolest thing ever.

178
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,967
Any history of
seizure in your family?

179
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,801
No. Liver disease?

180
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:33,896
No.

181
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,204
How long have I been here?

182
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,038
I got the feeling it's
been a long time.

183
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,136
Interesting.

184
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,546
Your internal
clock kept ticking.

185
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,148
How deep does that awareness go?

186
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,618
Pick up scraps of conversations?

187
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,813
Do you have the vague sense

188
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,932
that the hospital administrator
dresses like a trollop?

189
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,449
Or that the new <i>Star Wars</i>
movies were a disappointment?

190
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,555
I know my wife is dead.

191
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,928
I don't know how long it's been.

192
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,141
Ten years.

193
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,544
What's the last
thing you remember?

194
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,186
The fire.

195
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,048
My wife was in the bedroom,
she had taken a sleeping pill.

196
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:28,027
I got Kyle out,
went back in for her.

197
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,922
I knew I didn't make it.

198
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,364
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,200
What about your wife's side of the
family? Any history of seizures there?

200
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,035
Your son Kyle is a patient here.

201
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:44,137
I'm afraid his condition is
serious. He may be dying.

202
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:51,115
No seizure issues on
my wife's side, either.

203
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,878
What about that steak?
Nobody ever answered me.

204
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:04,228
Rumor in the cafeteria was Caustic
Guy was waking up Coma Guy.

205
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,993
Technically,
Vegetative State Guy

206
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,398
was woken by, yeah, Caustic Guy.

207
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,527
So what happened?

208
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,766
I gotta get him a steak before I
can ask him any more questions.

209
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,273
He doesn't wanna
talk about his son?

210
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,242
Didn't seem to emotionally
register that his son is sick.

211
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,369
Brain issue?

212
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,107
He was asphyxiated, spent
10 years as asparagus,

213
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,343
who knows what damage
is in there. It's possible.

214
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,647
Of course there's always
the simple explanation.

215
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,880
Maybe he just
doesn't like his son.

216
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,054
Only in your world
would that be simple.

217
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,183
The delusion that
fathering a child

218
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,591
installs a permanent
geyser of unconditional love...

219
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,256
Maybe your father's feelings
were conditional, not everyone's.

220
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,440
Well, of course,
that would play into

221
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,864
your romantic vision of human...

222
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,333
In terms you would understand,

223
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,994
we have an
evolutionary incentive

224
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,537
to sacrifice for our offspring.

225
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,699
Our tribe, our friends.
Keep them safe.

226
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,238
Except for all the
people who don't.

227
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,408
Everything is conditional.

228
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,375
You just can't always
anticipate the conditions.

229
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,455
Mind if we talk
for a few minutes?

230
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,389
How many pills would you
say Dr. House takes a day?

231
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,627
I'm uncomfortable
setting a number.

232
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,195
Well, try.

233
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,602
Six.

234
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,171
A day?

235
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,582
Has he ever had you
write prescriptions for him?

236
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,411
No. What is it you
want me to say?

237
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,830
That he takes too many pills
and is a danger to the hospital,

238
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,222
or he takes too few because
he's selling them on the side?

239
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,021
Either one is ridiculous.

240
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,188
I meant the former.

241
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,730
You're wrong.

242
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,857
Can I ask what Dr. House has
done to deserve your loyalty?

243
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,994
He's not known as a great boss.

244
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,594
He's not even much of a friend.

245
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,732
Look how he left
Dr. Wilson holding the bag.

246
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,910
It's odd. You don't
know about that?

247
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:07,250
You defend him, and he won't even
tell you what's happening in his life.

248
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,666
I was paged.

249
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,792
We saw you with the cop.

250
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,029
What'd he want?

251
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,536
How many pills does House take,

252
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:25,948
did I ever write
him a prescription?

253
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,440
That sort of stuff.

254
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,573
I told him six. A
day or in a mouthful?

255
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,655
I was just hoping you guys
would stay consistent with...

256
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,307
He wants to talk to us, too?

257
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,780
You're next.

258
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,280
We've gotta tell
House what's going on.

259
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,218
Tritter says no. Then no it is.

260
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,451
Cops have a thousand ways
to make life difficult for you.

261
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,786
Quick. What's the kid's status?

262
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,099
I gotta get back to our sleeper

263
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,926
before he goes looking
for the orgasmatron.

264
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,500
See, if that were rhetorical,

265
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,613
it would mean that I can just
turn around and leave now,

266
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,415
which I'm not doing, from
which you should deduce...

267
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,772
He's off all drugs
except the antibiotics.

268
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,776
His liver's just managing
to hang in there.

269
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,039
He's still sliding into coma.

270
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,253
Your barber sucks.

271
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,594
Hey, Coma Diet,

272
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,064
I could make a fortune.

273
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,930
Vegetative State Diet.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,332
Who gave you your clothes?

275
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,734
Dr. Cuddy.

276
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,997
I guess I'll need all
new ones, anyway.

277
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,631
Everything went in the fire.

278
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,834
Don't worry about it.

279
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,310
We use recyclable clothes now.
Wear them once, then eat them.

280
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,307
Your son's measles vaccination,

281
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,126
do you remember if he
had it, what type it was?

282
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,676
Man, you're a piece
of work, you know that?

283
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,313
You weren't gonna
tell me, were you?

284
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,390
I don't need new clothes.

285
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,291
Dr. Cuddy says my body
will adjust to the drugs,

286
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,352
that I'll be a vegetable
again by tomorrow.

287
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,989
If I'm really lucky,
the day after.

288
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
Yeah.

289
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:02,974
If I've got a day to live,

290
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,301
I'm not gonna spend it in a
hospital room being grilled.

291
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,101
Come on, where you gonna go?

292
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,940
Your house burned down, your
wife's dead. Business was sold off.

293
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,141
The only thing you have left is down
the hall, heading for a liver biopsy.

294
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:22,280
Used to be this little hole in the
wall run by a guy named Giancarlo.

295
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,325
Made the best
hoagies in the world.

296
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,657
Real Italian rolls,
prosciutto, provolone...

297
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,659
How far is Atlantic
City from here?

298
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:37,226
You have one day to live,
and you want a sandwich?

299
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,295
People on death
row get a last meal.

300
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:42,570
The state provides it.
Who's providing for you?

301
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,772
You got a car? Money?

302
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,475
You're negotiating with me.

303
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,851
Take out another 100 for
me. And I need your car.

304
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,655
I'm not doing you any favors.

305
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,321
You'll get it back
tomorrow. Two days, max.

306
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,196
Road trip.

307
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,198
This is like trying to
control the weather,

308
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,401
but I'd prefer it if you
didn't eat in the car,

309
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,910
I just had it detailed.

310
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,741
I drive. Oh, the hell he does.

311
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,939
Sure.

312
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,783
Aside from the fact he just
woke up from a vegetative state,

313
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:25,994
the guy doesn't have a license.

314
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,817
How about this?
Cops stop us, we lie.

315
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,289
You know how to do that. Chips.

316
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,205
It's all the drugs pumping
through his system.

317
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,926
Right now his reflexes are
better than Dale Earnhardt Jr's.

318
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,558
What's this? It says ipod.

319
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,238
I'm coming.

320
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,876
So let's talk about
toxic exposure.

321
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,245
What was wrong with the
old colors? I trusted brown.

322
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,890
Do the purple ones
have chocolate inside?

323
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,427
Raspberry cocaine.

324
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,428
This house that burned
down, where was it?

325
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,795
Moorestown, New Jersey.

326
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,734
Listen, I really need to know about
the candy because I'm allergic to berries.

327
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:17,802
You didn't mention that.

328
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,202
Is it significant?

329
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,673
No. So where else did you live?

330
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,676
List everywhere,
including vacations,

331
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,473
start with when your
wife got pregnant.

332
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,073
We lived in Jersey. Then we
moved to Jersey, from there, Jersey.

333
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,209
What are you waiting to hear?
About the little cottage in the Amazon

334
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,566
with the mosquitoes and the
lead paint all over the walls?

335
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,679
Yes.

336
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,455
You know what?

337
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,654
I didn't let you come along so you could
suck all the fun out of my one day of life.

338
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,095
Well, you're outta luck, because
that's totally why I'm here.

339
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,059
Okay, rule change.

340
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,601
Person with the money
makes the rules. Or in this case,

341
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:56,131
the person who's friends with the
person with the money makes the rules.

342
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,837
Well, you want answers
more than I want money.

343
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,046
All right, so here's the game.

344
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,677
Ask whatever you want.

345
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,310
But for every question I answer,
you have to answer one first.

346
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,581
Why would you care about
anything I have to say?

347
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,920
The day before I died,
I was a successful man.

348
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,995
I had a factory with
over 200 employees.

349
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,997
People listened when I talked.

350
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,298
I liked power.

351
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:26,870
Now, the only power I have
left is the power to annoy you.

352
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,075
I took Wilson's
assistant for coffee.

353
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,617
Why? Something Tritter said.

354
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,982
She told me the police think

355
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,784
that House stole Wilson's
prescription pad and forged his name.

356
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,482
You believe it?

357
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,725
Do you? Well, absolutely I do.

358
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,388
I'm just checking
how naive you are.

359
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,093
He's not gonna steal his best
friend's pad, jeopardize his career.

360
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,192
Until his best friend
says no to him.

361
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,497
House is a junkie.

362
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,802
Junkies do whatever they
have to do to get what they need.

363
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,537
Kyle's down to a three
on the RLAS scale.

364
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,377
He's only showing
localized response.

365
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,980
I'll call House, tell him we're
gonna need an answer soon.

366
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,718
Get in your right lane for 295.

367
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,153
And pass me the Twizzlers.

368
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,026
I'm curious... No, you're not.

369
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,690
Why would a man's first instinct

370
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,826
be to drive away from
the only family he's got?

371
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,871
No, this is no time for
you to do your thing.

372
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,549
We don't care about his state of
mind, we don't care if he's happy.

373
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,042
This factory of yours,
what did you make?

374
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,811
So ask me a question.

375
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,341
I'm thinking.

376
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,181
Only six left, by the way.

377
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,881
So sign my name. You don't
need a doctor, you need a pen.

378
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,252
What is up with you two?

379
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,656
Wilson lied to the bulls to
keep me out of the big house.

380
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:54,955
Are you out of your mind?

381
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,655
Well, who's he gonna tell?

382
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,995
By tomorrow night he's gonna
be a mindless stalk of celery.

383
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,068
Since I answered that
one, by the way, my turn.

384
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,501
What did you make
in your factory?

385
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,004
Luxury boats.

386
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,539
Have you ever been in love?

387
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,700
Wow!

388
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,506
Going right for the closets with
the embarrassing stuff. Good move.

389
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,570
Yes. Describe the boats.

390
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:18,482
Thirty-five to 65-foot hulls, twin
engines, parquet floors in the galley,

391
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,645
staterooms with queen beds.

392
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,682
How'd you meet? She shot me.

393
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,649
These boats, I assume you used
mildew-resistant paint on the hulls?

394
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,355
Naturally. Shot you?

395
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,229
Paintball. Doctors
versus lawyers.

396
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,393
Did you ever take your
son to the factory? Sure.

397
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,836
He used to run all over the
place, but it was perfectly safe.

398
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,500
Ever love anybody else?

399
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,175
No more questions,
I got my answer.

400
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,908
While Dad's in the office, his
son's watching them spray-paint.

401
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,847
And what kid wears a mask?

402
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,647
Mercury specifically targets
the central nervous system.

403
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,930
You're saying this is my fault?

404
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,219
Mercury poisoning
explains the seizures

405
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,224
and the liver's like
a big soup strainer.

406
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,760
The soup runs through,
chicken dumplings stay.

407
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,523
For soup, read
blood, for chicken...

408
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,087
I get it, I get it. Mercury.

409
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,359
Sits more or less idle

410
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,732
until your kid pours tequila
shooters into his liver.

411
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,569
When the liver goes, takes out
the kidneys, explains everything.

412
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,663
Yeah, it's me.

413
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,676
<i>Foreman, draw blood.
Test for mercury poisoning.</i>

414
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,735
Chase, start heavy
metal chelation

415
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,610
while we're waiting for results.

416
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,114
Chase isn't here.
I'll start the...

417
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,344
Where is he?

418
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,353
The lab.

419
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,327
How many pills
does he take a day?

420
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,229
It's hard to say, pain
levels vary over time...

421
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,393
Could be six, eight, 10.

422
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,736
Ever write any
prescriptions for him?

423
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,363
Yes. Why?

424
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,134
Did he tell you to?

425
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,166
He asked me to.

426
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:02,950
Medicine attracts people
who are attracted to power.

427
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:07,787
I know how he hates when
he is defied by a patient.

428
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:12,423
I doubt he handles defiance
from his staff any better.

429
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,490
Now you correct me if I'm wrong,

430
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:18,197
but I don't think Dr. House
asks for anything.

431
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,164
I think he takes it.

432
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,201
And I think that you are
stuck lying to the police

433
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,911
to cover up something
you didn't wanna do.

434
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:42,319
We have been up and down
St. James like a Monopoly car.

435
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,592
It's not here. Giancarlo
has left the building.

436
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,847
We can still turn around
and go back to Princeton.

437
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,602
No. We've come this
far, I'm getting the hoagie.

438
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,871
If your son does have
mercury poisoning,

439
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,790
there's a good chance he'll
respond to the chelation.

440
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,226
You might be able to have a few
minutes with him before you lapse.

441
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,549
Why are you so
concerned about me?

442
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,587
Deep inside Wilson believes
that if he cares enough

443
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,352
he'll never have to die.

444
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,053
Your behavior isn't normal.

445
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,953
And you would know normal?

446
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:20,261
What could he have done that
you won't forgive after 10 years?

447
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,392
When this is your last chance?

448
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,766
My son is what he is.

449
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,637
His mother's side,
all drunken losers.

450
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,773
He's gone the same way.

451
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,113
House told you drinking
had damaged your son's liver.

452
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,376
I just said that.

453
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,849
But you didn't hear him say that

454
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,819
until after we
left the hospital.

455
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,718
So why did you leave?

456
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,092
Maybe your son
takes after your side.

457
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,453
Seizures and an allergy
to emotional connections.

458
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,327
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

459
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,402
We're in Atlantic City
and my time's not up yet.

460
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,994
We find a hotel with a casino.

461
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,569
BP's starting to drop.

462
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,875
O2-sat's down to 70.

463
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,184
Point-three
milligrams of epi in.

464
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,032
What are you trying to
do, make him bleed faster?

465
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,752
Check the pulse.

466
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:21,187
It's not his liver.

467
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,887
It's the heart.

468
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,689
I understand he's a French chef

469
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,666
but I'm sure he can handle this.

470
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,703
You need a 12-inch Italian roll,

471
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:35,002
oregano vinegar, no, not
balsamic vinegar, oregano vinegar.

472
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,174
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

473
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,009
Game's still on.

474
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,378
I thought the answer
was mercury poisoning.

475
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,440
What other questions
would you care about?

476
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,694
If you each had one day to live,

477
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:49,519
you'd look for one last meal and
House would look for one last answer.

478
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,685
No, can you just send
the ingredients up here

479
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:54,784
and I'll make it myself.

480
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:59,292
Last 10 years, how much
awareness did you have?

481
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:02,267
I don't know, I knew
it wasn't the next day.

482
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,802
I knew that...

483
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,666
I recognized your voice.

484
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,471
How often were you in my room?

485
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,772
No, you're wasting a question.

486
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,312
I have a better one.

487
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,608
Why steal my pad?

488
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,481
Oh, my God, you're
right. I'm an addict.

489
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,110
Thanks for opening my eyes.

490
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,052
No, I mean why my pad?

491
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,452
Foreman, Cameron and Chase's
pads are just as convenient.

492
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,461
But their association with you is
involuntary, they're employees.

493
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,429
I associate with
you through choice

494
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,193
and any relationship
that involves choice

495
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,928
you have to see how far
you can push before it breaks.

496
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,367
This is easy.

497
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:40,964
You ask the questions, answer
them and make tasty snacks.

498
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,599
Let's go try the casino.

499
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,576
And one day our
friendship will break

500
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:49,103
and that'll just prove your theory
that relationships are conditional

501
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,844
and you don't need human
connection or deserve it,

502
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:55,115
or whatever goes on in
that rat-maze of your brain.

503
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,348
Sorry, if I'd known he was
gonna be this annoying,

504
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,085
I would have stolen
Dr. Cameron's pad

505
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,902
and Dr. Foreman's car.

506
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:04,021
At least she appreciates
my brooding melancholy.

507
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,261
House's House of Whining,
state your complaint.

508
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,977
The patient's BP just
dropped like a stone.

509
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,025
<i>Do an echo.</i>

510
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,542
Mercury isn't likely
to damage the...

511
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,662
<i>It didn't.</i>

512
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,764
Mercury test was negative.

513
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,942
Do an echo.

514
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,286
I was wrong. Your
son's still dying.

515
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,856
I need to go over every
relative you ever had. Again.

516
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,189
And this time, forget their
diseases, just tell me how they died.

517
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,251
And we don't have
time to take turns.

518
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,559
You give me the answers,
you get a big one at the end.

519
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,098
You can go for
whatever you want.

520
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,634
Destroy my privacy, my dignity.

521
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,376
Your grandmother?

522
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,605
Heat exhaustion,
Fourth of July picnic.

523
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,170
The woman was 92.

524
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,580
Does anyone in the kitchen
know the hoagie shop

525
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,413
that used to be on
St. James Place?

526
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,750
You sister-in-law
with the diabetes.

527
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,731
As far as you know, is
she still alive? She's not.

528
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,966
She was killed in
a traffic accident

529
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,583
driving home from
a Phillies game.

530
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,251
I'm sure a lot of
beer was consumed.

531
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,193
The Phillies lost. Your father?

532
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,458
Old age. Heart finally gave out.

533
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:13,865
Your wife's father?

534
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,595
Hit-and-run, walking
the incontinent dog.

535
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,394
Hi, do you guys deliver?

536
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:21,997
Let me put it this way,

537
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:25,135
if you deliver, there'll
be a $100 tip in it for you.

538
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,374
Excellent.

539
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,007
Victory. The night is
finally going my way.

540
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,317
Wilson, toss me a soda.

541
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,093
Shall we go somewhere to talk?

542
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,302
House is an ass.

543
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,499
But he obviously
needs pain medication,

544
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:55,973
and how much pain
one person feels

545
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,510
is not a call the government
should be making.

546
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,671
So you think I'm a
bureaucrat with a badge

547
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,942
following some
arbitrary guideline.

548
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:04,845
Yeah, I do.

549
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:09,750
So you're saying I should
just trust him. Do you?

550
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,289
You're not qualified
to make that...

551
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,291
I'm not sure you are, either.

552
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,327
I've been a cop for 20 years.

553
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,453
And not a day goes by

554
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,989
that someone doesn't try to
sell me some self-serving story.

555
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,735
If you had my job, you'd know.

556
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,832
Everybody lies.

557
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,208
I think you've run
out of relatives.

558
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,611
So, it's my turn.

559
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,621
Why did you become a doctor?

560
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,091
That's the big question?

561
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,862
I give you complete
license to humiliate me

562
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,294
and that's the best you can do.

563
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:54,492
Well, okay, let's discuss the
wonder of the human body.

564
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,762
No, no, no. You're
a curious guy.

565
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,233
You like to figure things
out, why not go into research?

566
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,933
Why work with people when you

567
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,432
obviously hate people?

568
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,569
Oedipal fixation.

569
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,046
I was seeking my mother's love

570
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,259
and she thought that Ben
Casey was just the dreamiest...

571
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:14,845
Okay, fine. You don't think you'll
need any more answers from me?

572
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,782
Give me a hard time.

573
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,622
When I was 14,

574
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,334
my father was
stationed in Japan.

575
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,732
I went rock-climbing
with this kid from school.

576
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,334
He fell and got injured and I
had to bring him to the hospital.

577
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,938
And we came in through
the wrong entrance

578
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,040
and passed this guy in the hall.

579
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,018
He was a janitor.

580
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,344
My friend came
down with an infection

581
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,617
and the doctors
didn't know what to do.

582
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,024
So they brought in

583
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,095
the janitor.

584
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,426
He was a doctor.

585
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,903
And a <i>buraku.</i>

586
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,502
One of Japan's untouchables.

587
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:13,610
His ancestors had been
slaughterers, gravediggers.

588
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,142
And this guy,

589
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,612
he knew that he wasn't accepted
by the staff, didn't even try.

590
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,918
He didn't dress well, he didn't
pretend to be one of them.

591
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,255
The people around that place,

592
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,955
they didn't think he had
anything they wanted,

593
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,096
except when they needed him.

594
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,298
Because he was right.

595
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,705
Which meant that
nothing else mattered.

596
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,072
And they had to listen to him.

597
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,512
Thank you.

598
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:02,017
Need 20 milligrams of
diazepam in a syringe.

599
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,037
Heartbeat's irregular
and accelerating.

600
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,629
He's at 200. He's gonna crash.

601
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,949
Allergic reaction
to the diazepam?

602
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:15,997
Better hope so.

603
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,737
It's either that or
his heart's done.

604
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,686
What happened on
the night of the fire?

605
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,950
Yeah. I'm sure it's a
stressful, emotional question.

606
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,188
Suck it up.

607
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,128
My wife had taken a
sleeping pill and gone to bed.

608
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,225
It was Christmas Eve.

609
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,238
I let Kyle pop corn
in the fireplace.

610
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,369
He managed to knock
loose some tinder.

611
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,872
Wrapping paper caught on fire.

612
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,141
It spread so fast.

613
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,044
I got Kyle out and...

614
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,814
When I went back in for...

615
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,053
You're a disappointment.

616
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:12,086
You act as though you
don't need anybody, you...

617
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,258
You just blame your
son for what happened.

618
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,200
I don't blame him. He
was a 12-year-old boy.

619
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,204
You don't blame a
kid for an accident.

620
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,182
Then what are we doing
here? Why aren't you with him?

621
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:23,004
Because it wouldn't matter.

622
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,976
I failed to keep my family safe.

623
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,879
I couldn't stop the fire,
I couldn't save my wife,

624
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,680
now you want me to stick around
watching while I fail to save my son.

625
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:36,221
Thank you so much
for waking me up.

626
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,661
How did your son
dislodge the tinder?

627
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:47,892
God...

628
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,272
He dropped the popcorn tray.

629
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,536
He had been complaining it was
too heavy, I should have listened.

630
00:32:56,608 --> 00:33:00,067
And the hit-and-run,
walking the pissy dog.

631
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,613
That happen at night?

632
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,444
I think so, yeah, why?

633
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,950
Car accident after
the Phillies lost.

634
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,417
Night game?

635
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,619
Ragged-red fiber.

636
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,249
It's an inherited condition.

637
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,420
Dropping things, muscle
weakness, poor night vision.

638
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:20,262
Makes people seem uncoordinated,
accident-prone, careless.

639
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,892
It's transmitted in
mitochondrial DNA

640
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,869
so it only passes
through the mother.

641
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,100
Your wife's family weren't
drunks, they were sick.

642
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,274
It wouldn't have
affected his liver.

643
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,810
The kid is a drunk.

644
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:33,087
He thinks that he
killed his mother

645
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,205
and turned his father
into a vegetable.

646
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,442
I might have a few shots myself.

647
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,743
<i>Foreman.</i>

648
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:42,754
Test his DNA for
ragged-red fiber.

649
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,517
It's not gonna...
<i>Here's a thought.</i>

650
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,616
Why don't we not assume that the
test is negative until we actually do it?

651
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,129
House, the kid has
severe cardiomyopathy.

652
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,556
Alcoholic, no shot
at a transplant.

653
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:58,097
So yeah, maybe you figured
out why, good for you, but

654
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:01,537
he's gonna die anyway.

655
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,763
I want to give Kyle my heart.

656
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:38,374
This thing, whatever it is, you
said he gets it from the mother.

657
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,604
My heart's fine.

658
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:43,115
And it could go on being
fine for the rest of your life.

659
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,208
Yeah, it's not like he's
gonna do anything with it.

660
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,616
Well, you woke him up once,

661
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,417
maybe someone'll come
up with some other answer.

662
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,218
We've both seen
breakthroughs no one expected.

663
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,990
And ragged-red fiber's
treatable, but not curable.

664
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,429
Even if he gets your
heart, there's no guarantee.

665
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,200
He's my kid.

666
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,168
No!

667
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,174
Did you really expect
a different answer?

668
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:14,076
We have arranged transplants
before when a patient is near death.

669
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:18,378
Except he isn't near death, he's
saying, "Kill me and cut out my heart."

670
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,442
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

671
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,021
Fine. I'll think of
something else.

672
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,089
I'm sorry.

673
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,701
Wilson, get out.

674
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,106
No.

675
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,515
You lied to the
cops enough for me.

676
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,388
Maybe I don't wanna
push this till it breaks.

677
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,917
Pills are the simplest.

678
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:35,321
Hanging has less chance
of damaging the heart.

679
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,626
I'm okay with pain.

680
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:45,198
Strangulation is better
than breaking your neck,

681
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,706
which means this'll be slow.

682
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,647
I wouldn't get to see him even
if we got in the car right now

683
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,775
and broke the speed
limit driving back, would I?

684
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:00,947
No.

685
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,418
Tell him...

686
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,694
I don't know what to tell him.

687
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,970
I think it's my turn to
ask a question, isn't it?

688
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,410
I don't think so.

689
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,978
'Cause you just asked me
that thing about the speed limit.

690
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,614
What do you wanna know?

691
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:39,652
If you could hear one thing
from your father, what would it be?

692
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,394
It wouldn't help you.

693
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,656
Try me.

694
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,732
I'd want him to say,

695
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,766
"You were right.

696
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:00,078
"You did the right thing."

697
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,416
Yeah. It doesn't help.

698
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,262
Hi. Hi.

699
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,028
I'm Dr. Wilson.

700
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,301
I'm Mrs. Schaffer.

701
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,103
I'm from Princeton.

702
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,678
My husband and I and our
three children live in Philadelphia.

703
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:43,418
So, do you like to swing?

704
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,324
No.

705
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,826
Well, if you change
your mind, I'm in...

706
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,291
House? House?

707
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,801
Is it room 622, 642?

708
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,431
622.

709
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,171
622.

710
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:02,967
Yeah.

711
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,085
Alibi.

712
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,085
I figured.

713
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,479
They found an open
bottle of aspirin by the body.

714
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:20,514
Lucky he had a headache,
reduced trauma to the heart in transit.

715
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,553
Lucky.

716
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,063
That can't be all.

717
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,562
Well, you got a heart out of it.

718
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,699
How many organs do
you want from the guy?

719
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,301
I mean, my father must
have said something.

720
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:48,704
He couldn't just...

721
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,944
He must have given you
some kind of a message for me.

722
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,057
He said you were right.

723
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,187
You did the right thing.

724
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,229
Right about what?

725
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,933
What does that mean?

726
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,840
How would I know? He's your dad.

727
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,521
You know what I found
interesting about this case?

728
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,484
That it proved that people
can love unconditionally

729
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,256
and you can tell
yourself it's not true,

730
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,888
but you'll just end up in a
hotel room in Atlantic City

731
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,557
asking someone to
cut your heart out?

732
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,692
The hoagie.

733
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,067
You thought this guy
was emotionally confused,

734
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,833
and that the hoagie
was just a mask

735
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,636
to hide his real
feelings toward his son.

736
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:51,937
It was.

737
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,040
Did you know Tritter was talking
to your team while we were away?

738
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,113
Yeah.

739
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,047
And yet you moved
Heaven and Earth

740
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:01,109
to get him that mask with
mustard and prosciutto.

741
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,744
Which one of them told you?

742
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,844
All of them.

743
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,550
Which means that none of them
said anything I have to worry about.

744
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,002
Back to the hoagie.

745
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,086
You think that my
addiction's out of hand.

746
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:14,064
Your need to be needed is so strong
that you'll give people what they want,

747
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,862
what they need, what
they think they need.

748
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,734
I don't think my enabling is anything
you should be complaining about.

749
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:22,370
Yes, my name is
Dr. James Wilson,

750
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,639
account number 835687.

751
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:28,742
The ATM says I've got zero...

752
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,347
What does that mean, a hold?

753
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,614
Yeah, okay, thanks.

754
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:46,954
My accounts have been frozen
as part of a police investigation.

755
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,463
They can't keep
your money forever.

756
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:58,067
No, they can keep it till I agree to
help send you to prison for 10 years.

757
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,247
You're getting dinner.
