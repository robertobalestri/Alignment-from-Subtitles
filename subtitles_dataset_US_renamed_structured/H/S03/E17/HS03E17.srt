1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,502
Hey. Thanks.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,474
No, no, no... Here.

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,604
You got this whole
thing wrong, Em.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,239
It's the rock star that's supposed to
be late, not the rock-star photographer.

5
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,443
Sorry. Morning
sickness. Touch the belly.

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,646
It's the first time I've
been asked to do that.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,211
Come on. It's good luck.

8
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,779
Okay.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,625
Hit the Kinos behind the drop.

10
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,730
So what do you think?

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,564
I think people
aren't gonna get it.

12
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,867
Come on. "All-American Rejects."

13
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:42,638
Juxtaposing a classic image of
Americana with modern pop culture youth.

14
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,939
Oh, yeah.

15
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,413
Everyone loves a
good juxtaposition.

16
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,177
My fans were born in the '90s.

17
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,811
You know what? You do this
picture, you'll gain 40 years of fans.

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,515
Yeah? Yeah.

19
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,921
I love the Rockwell
thing. I thought so.

20
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,890
Okay. Kill the
house lights. Let's go!

21
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,034
Hang on. Hey, who's in
charge of the backdrop?

22
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,695
Naomi? Yeah?

23
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,762
What's wrong with it?

24
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,439
Well, the words are
completely jumbled.

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,141
What, you can read that?

26
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,737
Of course.

27
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,447
You okay? No. Oh, God.

28
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,509
I could be having a...

29
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,945
What's the mnemonic?

30
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,025
"F" is for face. Is
my smile crooked?

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,360
What are you doing?

32
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,057
"A" is for arms.

33
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,223
Arms.

34
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,596
You should really sit down.

35
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,157
Can someone get her some water?

36
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,725
"S" is speech.

37
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,635
I'm slurring? I'm slurring?

38
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,873
"F-A-S-T."

39
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,273
"T" is for time.

40
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:56,841
Hurry. Somebody, call 911.
Tell them I'm having a stroke.

41
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,390
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

42
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,396
My boss says you're important.

43
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,375
Personally I don't get
what's so hard about

44
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,368
making Scarlett
Johansson look pretty.

45
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,925
Arms out in front of you.

46
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,267
Palms up like you're
holding a pizza.

47
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,204
Close your eyes.

48
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,640
It's so easy you should
consider a career change.

49
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,236
Probably make a lot more money.

50
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,747
Dr. Mackman tell
you the clot was clear?

51
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:02,976
Yes.

52
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,070
And he said that you
and the fetus are fine?

53
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,211
Yeah.

54
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,446
He didn't mention
your pronator drift?

55
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,352
What's that mean?

56
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,519
Means Mackman is an idiot.

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,519
May I? Yeah.

58
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,325
So,

59
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,597
you take thousands
of photos of someone,

60
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,966
but only one has to look good.

61
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,380
Kind of the opposite
of my business.

62
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,804
It's not about looking good.

63
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,016
People are always hiding things.

64
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,499
I just keep shooting until I can
see what's really inside them.

65
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:32,504
My eyes okay?

66
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,808
Eyes are gorgeous.

67
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,016
The vessels don't look so hot.

68
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,778
Microaneurysms
predict further strokes.

69
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,013
This is gonna happen again?

70
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,613
Unless I can figure out
the underlying cause.

71
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,453
Puff up your cheeks.

72
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,592
You should be able to keep the air in.
Means there's weakness around the mouth.

73
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,503
So where'd you learn to
self-diagnose a stroke?

74
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:56,230
Oh, my baby's biological
father is a neurologist.

75
00:03:56,303 --> 00:04:00,035
He once told me the FAST mnemonic
could save my life one day. So...

76
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,598
Interesting pet name.

77
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,970
Most people go with
"husband" or "pookie."

78
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,638
He's gay.

79
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,511
Just a sperm donor.
So when you...

80
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,312
You turned him for a night?

81
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,147
Just straight for one date?

82
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,085
Okay.

83
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:18,085
He took a magazine and
a cup into my bathroom.

84
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,024
A man after my own heart.

85
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,994
Different magazine obviously.

86
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,927
I'm rescinding Mackman's
discharge order.

87
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,126
My lackeys will be
in to do some tests,

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,136
take some more blood and
empty your catheter bag.

89
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,740
Not a moment
you'll want to cherish.

90
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,045
This is definitely different.

91
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,279
It looks almost like...

92
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,183
He's caring.

93
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,529
Find anything else in the
patient's folder? Like a diagnosis?

94
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,999
Urinalysis revealed excessive
protein and red blood cells.

95
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,730
Chem panel showed a
creatinine level over 2.5.

96
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,366
So first she strokes, now her
kidneys are shutting down. Why?

97
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,272
Ultrasound showed
no tumors or stones.

98
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,073
No signs of fetal distress.
No urinary tract obstructions.

99
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,841
BP is fine. No pre-eclampsia.

100
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,281
Any of you guys ever
been to the Galápagos?

101
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,647
Was our patient there?

102
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,743
Dengue fever, avian
pox, even West Nile.

103
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,913
No.

104
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,649
I'm looking for a vacation spot.

105
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,917
That mean we get vacation?

106
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,585
How would that differ
from your current status?

107
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,958
You're gonna do what? Relax?

108
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,257
Visiting family.

109
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,695
My uncle's a giant turtle.

110
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,858
What if the kidney
failure came first?

111
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,425
Kidneys could've caused the
stroke not the other way around.

112
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,528
Kidneys don't often
get stuck in the brain.

113
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:38,936
I'm saying it threw a clot.

114
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,032
Early symptoms of kidney failure
are nausea, vomiting, ankle swelling.

115
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,753
She would've mistaken
it for morning sickness.

116
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,110
Heart's way more likely to
throw a clot than a kidney.

117
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,308
Echo was normal. The history
indicates no sign of cardiac problems.

118
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,544
No, but if one were to
read the history closely,

119
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,883
one would notice that
she had six cases of strep.

120
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,015
In her throat. That's the one
about 10 inches above her heart.

121
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,719
Let me rephrase, six
cases of untreated strep.

122
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,193
She was prescribed antibiotics.

123
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,456
No one takes them all.

124
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,693
They stop when they start feeling
better. All strep is untreated strep.

125
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,393
What happens when
strep goes untreated?

126
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,696
Leads to rheumatic fever.

127
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,100
Which leads to... Cameron?

128
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,331
Mitral valve stenosis.

129
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,397
Which is a thickening in
the valve of the... Kidney?

130
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,567
No.

131
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,235
The kidney doesn't
have a mitral valve.

132
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,404
We'll go look at her heart.

133
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,581
Be easy to find.

134
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,177
It's the big red pumping thing
about 10 inches below her throat.

135
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,453
That was weird.

136
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,651
He was the way he always is.

137
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,192
Which is weird.

138
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,395
Very still, Emma. Sorry.

139
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,691
No problem.

140
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,790
He caught us with your hand up my
shirt. He's gotta have a reaction to that.

141
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,346
You think that's
what the vacation is?

142
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,425
Yes.

143
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,961
The pain of losing you is
obviously forcing him away.

144
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,439
Coronal slice appears normal.

145
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,669
There's no way House
just lets this slide.

146
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,302
He's gotta be
planning something.

147
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,472
Maybe he just
doesn't give a crap.

148
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,809
Sagittal slice is clean.

149
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,525
You think he just
stumbled into that closet?

150
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,828
He knew we were there and he
wanted us to know that he knew.

151
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,582
Or you wanted him to know.

152
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,715
Now he does and you're
annoyed because he doesn't care.

153
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,216
Right there.

154
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,387
Trans-axial slice. Calcified
mitral valve. Barely.

155
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,191
That's not big
enough to throw a clot.

156
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,562
Obviously it is, because it did.

157
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:13,998
House was right.

158
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,300
A valve in your
heart is narrowed.

159
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,135
It caused the clot
which lead to your stroke,

160
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,768
and the reduced circulation caused
the problem with your kidneys.

161
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,472
And this will fix it?

162
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,879
The balloon will force the valve
back open and you'll be fine.

163
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,542
Can we do this
without a sedative?

164
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,587
It's very mild. There
really is no risk to the fetus.

165
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,282
We'll monitor your baby's
heart rate separately.

166
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,724
We won't allow it to decrease
anywhere near dangerous levels.

167
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,056
Thank you.

168
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,223
You're both gonna be fine.

169
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,693
Go ahead, Dr. Cameron.

170
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,500
Listen to that
heartbeat. It sounds so...

171
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,977
Start threading the catheter.

172
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:10,079
No, I don't want a layover in Frankfurt,
Taipei, Singapore or London, Ontario.

173
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,523
That's why I asked for a
direct flight to Phnom Penh.

174
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,960
How hard is it to not land?
Does it matter what I answer?

175
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,458
Well, then fine. I'd
be delighted to hold.

176
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,591
What's new? Can you tell
Cuddy to stop interfering?

177
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,896
It's her job. What's new?

178
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,402
Good news is
Emma's heart is fixed.

179
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,804
Bad news is it's not her underlying
problem. Her kidneys are still failing.

180
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,842
You're vacationing in Cambodia?

181
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,934
You gonna unwind in
the Killing Fields? Nope.

182
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,843
Gonna catch me a fish this big.

183
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,438
Mekong giant catfish.
Weighs over 600 pounds.

184
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,093
Aren't those catfish
critically endangered?

185
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,837
That's why it's my last
chance to catch one.

186
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,129
<i>All of our operators
are currently...</i>

187
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,317
If the mitral valve had been properly
fixed the kidney should be getting better,

188
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,030
which leads us to the conclusion
that you screwed up the procedure.

189
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,425
Or you screwed up the diagnosis.

190
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,238
The mitral valve thickening
was so insignificant

191
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,440
it probably wasn't the cause
of the kidneys or the stroke.

192
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,742
Probably never
would've been a problem.

193
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,395
She needs dialysis and
we need a new theory.

194
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,300
There are only a
few possibilities.

195
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,532
Patient's pregnant,
could be pre-eclampsia.

196
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:00,938
We eliminated it
before because...

197
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,340
Re-check for proteinuria
and low platelets. What else?

198
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,503
Hypoperfusion.

199
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,979
The fetus is basically a parasite
stealing nutrients, minerals, blood.

200
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,141
Put her on telemetry.

201
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,513
Or the pregnancy is irrelevant.

202
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,314
Could be infection,
sepsis, HUS/TTP.

203
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,378
A cholesterol embolism
is just as likely.

204
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,857
Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down,
clog up the small vessels of the kidneys.

205
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,121
Get a smear and ultrasound
her vessels for plaque.

206
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,856
That's it. Has to
be one of those five.

207
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:27,162
You know what would be even better?
If we'd narrow it all the way down to one.

208
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,932
<i>Thank you for holding.</i>

209
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,598
<i>We are experiencing
extremely high call volume.</i>

210
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,800
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

211
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,975
She's 0 for five.

212
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,387
Either the differential was
wrong or she's faking it.

213
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,650
Kidney failure has
to be precipitated by...

214
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,233
One of the five we've
already ruled out.

215
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,783
The body only has so many
ways of screwing with the kidneys.

216
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,453
The labs must be
wrong. We did the labs.

217
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,156
No one else had access.

218
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,755
That's not quite true.

219
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:09,670
You put all your patients through this
many tests or just the important ones?

220
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,278
We wanted to
explore all possibilities.

221
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,816
And?

222
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,851
We've eliminated
all the possibilities.

223
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,116
You telling me I'm dying
and you have no idea why?

224
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,215
Your body is
functioning properly.

225
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,850
So why are my kidneys failing?

226
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,592
The other body isn't.

227
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,528
There's something
wrong with the fetus.

228
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,611
Welcome to the world of
maternal mirror syndrome.

229
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,644
Mom's body is like

230
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,883
an intricate German
metro system.

231
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,785
All the trains run on time.

232
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,986
When she gets pregnant, it's like a
new station opening in Düsseldorf.

233
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,889
Bunch or rookies running
things. Bound to be mistakes.

234
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,227
Kids play on the
tracks, get electrocuted.

235
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,776
Before you know it, the trains
are backed up all the way to Berlin

236
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,945
and you've got a bunch of angry
Germans with nowhere to go.

237
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,835
And we all know that
ain't good for the Jews.

238
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,215
Who are the Jews
in this metaphor?

239
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,208
A few things can happen
to a fetus in distress.

240
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,540
It can become a
miscarriage, stillbirth,

241
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,876
a very sick baby or on
rare occasion a time bomb

242
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,147
that kills mom while it's dying.

243
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,277
Good news is, we fix
the fetus, mom gets better.

244
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,446
It's the diagnostic equivalent
of a two-for-one sale.

245
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,787
I have read the outcome of mirror
syndrome is almost always unfavorable.

246
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,726
"Unfavorable." Is that
doctor speak for "dead baby"?

247
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,561
You think she'll be less
upset if you phrase it nicely?

248
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,826
We can tell her the
truth, that she'll be fine

249
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,666
as soon as we diagnose a person
who weighs about one pound.

250
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,434
Can't touch it, can't ask
where it hurts, can't see it.

251
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:51,444
If only there existed giant machines
that could look through human skin.

252
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,037
Mirror syndrome has a limited
number of known causes.

253
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,776
Tachyarrhythmia, fetal
anemia, placental chorioangioma.

254
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,045
All of which are fixable.

255
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,882
Which would be
un-unfavorable, right?

256
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,718
Could also be trisomy 13.

257
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,587
Ebstein's anomaly, an
aneurysm of Galen's vein.

258
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:09,288
And Dr. Storm Cloud
rained all over the differential

259
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,194
and killed the
beautiful little baby.

260
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,462
Heart's easiest to see,
easiest to fix. So let's start there.

261
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,060
When you did Mom's MRI, did
you get a look at the fetus's heart?

262
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,538
It was in the range but blurry. The
fetus was moving all over the place.

263
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,405
So we need another scan. Yeah.

264
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,138
We'll just ask the fetus
to lie very, very still.

265
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,976
No need. I'm
going to paralyze it.

266
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,118
You wanna paralyze
Emma Sloan's baby?

267
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,181
Let me guess. Cameron?

268
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,315
Cameron and Chase
both had their concerns.

269
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,052
No, Cameron had concerns.

270
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,184
Chase just agreed with her

271
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,253
because he didn't want to lose
his all-access pass to her love rug.

272
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,592
They're sleeping together?

273
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,930
If by "sleeping together" you mean
having sex in the janitor's closet.

274
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,128
Here?

275
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,770
No, the janitor's closet
at the local high school.

276
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,636
Go, Tiger Cats!

277
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,719
Do you have one of those camera
phones? 'Cause I got a MySpace account.

278
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,837
I will deal with them
after I deal with you.

279
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,539
Oh, come on. Let's
gossip some more.

280
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,275
I'm sure she's into bondage.

281
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,715
Paralyzing a one-pound
baby risks damaging...

282
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,221
Not paralyzing the thing risks
not getting a clean MRI of its heart,

283
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,248
which we need to save its life, which
we need to do to save Emma's life.

284
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,683
You're gonna need
to get her consent.

285
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,457
Well, that shouldn't
be too hard.

286
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,021
"Sign here or you and
your baby both die."

287
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,657
I'm going with you.

288
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,965
Oh, good.

289
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,831
You said sedation was
risky. This sounds insane.

290
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,878
The injection goes
into the umbilical cord.

291
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,310
The baby won't feel a thing.

292
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,211
Fetus.

293
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,852
I'm lowering expectations.
It works here and on dates.

294
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,547
The benefits outweigh the risks

295
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,420
and the paralytic will
wear off in an hour, okay?

296
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,660
Must be easier to hear you
might die than your baby might die.

297
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,193
But if there's anyone I
would trust to save my baby,

298
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,759
it would be Dr. House.

299
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,573
Fetus.

300
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,435
Hold this.

301
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,663
Dr. Cameron. The
MRI results back?

302
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,300
The fetus's heart
is structurally sound.

303
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,553
The problem's with the bladder.
It's four times normal size.

304
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,577
Let me see.

305
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,656
The bladder's so engorged
it's taking up the whole torso,

306
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,148
squeezing all the other organs.

307
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,659
There's no room for
the lungs to develop.

308
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,549
The baby has a lower
urinary tract obstruction.

309
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,280
We can fix that by
inserting a shunt.

310
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,514
I'll give Emma the news.

311
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,420
Are you taking over the case?

312
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,016
House won't care.
He has his diagnosis.

313
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:55,918
Doctor Cameron.

314
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,028
Dating Chase can only
end in one of two ways.

315
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,124
House told you?

316
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,534
You get married and
live happily ever after,

317
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,403
or somebody gets hurt and
you two can't work together,

318
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,805
and I have to fire somebody.

319
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,320
I would hate to see my personal
life become such a burden to you.

320
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,454
I'm telling you this
for your own good.

321
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,391
I assume you're gonna have this same
conversation with Chase for his own good.

322
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,112
Chase isn't the one
that's gonna get hurt here.

323
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,865
There's only room for one
but I could skooch over.

324
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,996
My social life
is my social life.

325
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,369
Couldn't agree more.

326
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,774
What goes on in the privacy of a janitor's
closet is nobody's business except...

327
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,812
She told me to end it.
Is that what you want?

328
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,676
I was actually hoping
she'd fire one of you.

329
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:48,976
What are you doing?

330
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,448
Trying to avoid
altitude sickness.

331
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,212
Couldn't score a direct
flight to Cambodia,

332
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,744
so I've decided to scale Argentina's
infamous Mount Aconcagua.

333
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,633
Perfect except for the
fact that you can't walk.

334
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,855
There's a tribe of Mocoví Indians
who actually carry the elders up...

335
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,259
You're insane.

336
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,956
I'm an insane genius.

337
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,363
I set the chamber for low
pressure instead of high.

338
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,799
Thinner air builds up
the extra red blood cells,

339
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,166
creates new capillaries.

340
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,536
Few more days in here, I can
save myself six weeks at base camp.

341
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,904
Where's my MRI?

342
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,076
There's a blockage
in the urinary tract.

343
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,138
Simple terms,
your baby can't pee.

344
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,810
His bladder is swollen
and it's crushing his lungs.

345
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,216
Can you fix it?

346
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,948
We can insert a small
tube in the baby's bladder

347
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,133
that makes the urine come
out straight through his belly

348
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,887
for the duration
of the pregnancy.

349
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,157
The bladder decompresses and the
lungs will be able to develop normally.

350
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,960
When the baby gets
better, you should get better.

351
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,159
First we just have to do a test

352
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,068
to determine whether the baby's
kidneys are functioning properly.

353
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,798
And what if they're not?

354
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:49,673
If they're already too damaged,
then there's really nothing we can do.

355
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,906
If this doesn't work out
you can always try again.

356
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,974
I miscarried twice
when I was married.

357
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,278
After the divorce, I tried in
vitro like four times before this.

358
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:08,053
I'm 42. Maybe it's
just not meant to be.

359
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,370
What are you doing?

360
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,948
You're trying to be me, so
I thought I'd try to be you.

361
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,463
You don't have
the cleavage for it.

362
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,237
But I have a much tighter ass.

363
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,837
Think every day should be naked
Thursday or is that an oxymoron?

364
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,325
Let me see the results
from the bladder tap.

365
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,113
They aren't back yet.

366
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,550
They're gonna be inconclusive.

367
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,281
You think my diagnosis is wrong?

368
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,880
Fetus doesn't pee,
amniotic fluid should be low.

369
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,118
Mom's level is fine.

370
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,318
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

371
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,271
Could just mean we
caught the obstruction early.

372
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,059
Either way your test
will be inconclusive.

373
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,210
The urine you've collected has been
sitting in that fetus's bladder for weeks.

374
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,794
As my pappy always said,
"Stale pee is useless pee."

375
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,429
Fine. I'll do another tap.

376
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,598
Just as useless.

377
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,139
Old urine drops down from
the kidney right after the first tap

378
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,268
'cause it's so backed up.

379
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,870
Bladder tap number three
will give you the freshest pee.

380
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,667
That's when you'll find out if this
fetus has even a fighting chance.

381
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,979
Thank you.

382
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,083
I'll run two more taps.

383
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,089
Since when does the Dean
of Medicine run bladder taps?

384
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,522
She's an important patient.

385
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,959
Because she takes pictures
or because she's you?

386
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:19,221
Woman in her 40s, single,

387
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,432
using a turkey baster as
a last gasp at motherhood.

388
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,330
Maybe you want to make sure she
succeeds so you'll still have hope.

389
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,143
You can't be a good
doctor if you're not objective.

390
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,480
It's your file. I don't want it.

391
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,641
Then why did you
just say all that stuff?

392
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,116
To humiliate you.

393
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,483
You're taking the case
back. I don't want it.

394
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,545
Your diagnosis is right.
I want to go on vacation.

395
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,251
You can go on vacation
after you've cured her.

396
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,758
Good news.

397
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,926
The fetus's urine had appropriate
levels of protein and electrolytes,

398
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,936
so its kidneys aren't damaged.

399
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,037
Oh, wow.

400
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,030
We're gonna put the shunt in.

401
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,948
Your baby's lungs should
have more room to grow

402
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,411
and your symptoms
should go away.

403
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,373
But he'll still need
surgery, after he's born?

404
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,974
That's when we'll remove
the blockage in the ureter.

405
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:15,613
You'll be the only mother on the planet
who appreciates the value of a wet diaper.

406
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,350
Hey, could you hand me that?

407
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,857
I'm keeping a visual memory book

408
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,452
of this entire surreal process and
this is the best part of the story so far.

409
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,326
Yeah. Sure. Thanks.

410
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,800
When'd you take this?

411
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,426
She did the second bladder tap.

412
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,660
You should keep it.

413
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,468
Oh, I see her all day
at work. I don't need it.

414
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,973
Maybe you want to
see her after work.

415
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,478
I'm right, right?

416
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,273
I saw the way you look at her.

417
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,655
Thanks.

418
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,265
The shunt is in
the right position.

419
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,205
Bladder is starting
to decompress.

420
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,436
No infection.

421
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,444
Did House say
anything else? About us?

422
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:19,417
I thought you didn't care about his
reaction. Trying to make him jealous?

423
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,748
I like my job.

424
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,812
He can't fire you just
because we're together.

425
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,017
We're not "together," and
House can do whatever he wants.

426
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,856
How's my baby?
Doing just fine, Emma.

427
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:32,955
So are you.

428
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,193
My stomach's killing me.

429
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,863
That's not her stomach.

430
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,567
Can you open your eyes,
Emma? I just need to take a look.

431
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,009
What is it?

432
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,273
Emma's jaundiced.
Her liver's shutting down.

433
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,118
Figures. Just booked
my trip to Johnston Strait.

434
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,214
I thought you were climbing
Mount Whatever in Argentina.

435
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,987
Apparently I'd have to live with
the Mocoví Indians for 20 years

436
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,858
before they'd
consider me an elder.

437
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,387
Decided to go kayaking with
orca instead. No legs required.

438
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,697
Can't leave yet. Liver failure puts
her case back into the unsolved pile.

439
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,967
Increased AST, ALT and
her bilirubin's off the charts.

440
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,102
Even fetuses lie.

441
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:22,776
We diagnosed a lower urinary tract
obstruction because we saw one.

442
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,245
What if that's not
the whole story?

443
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,987
What if the little bugger
is hiding something?

444
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,990
The real reason for
the mirror syndrome.

445
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,526
Have we looked under its bed?

446
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:36,755
We checked its diary?

447
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,491
If it's not GU,
could be the heart.

448
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,841
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

449
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,576
There were no structural
problems. The lungs.

450
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,478
We won't be able to get a
good look until they develop.

451
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,494
It'll be weeks... She's
not gonna last weeks.

452
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:46,834
What do you want to do?

453
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,967
Maternal mirror syndrome
has one sure fire cure.

454
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,903
Deliver the fetus.

455
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,344
That's not viable at 21
weeks. You'll kill the baby.

456
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,644
Fetus. Semantics
make you feel better?

457
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,755
Pretend it's not a person?

458
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,877
Can it play catch? Can it eat?

459
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,921
Can it take pretty pictures?

460
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,188
Who wants to tell her?

461
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:15,124
The swollen bladder
was not the only problem.

462
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:20,071
We can't leave it inside
you. We have to terminate.

463
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,039
Well, can't you deliver him?

464
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,271
Put him on a respiratory machine
till you figure out what's wrong?

465
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,575
We can. And it won't matter.

466
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:32,583
The fetus is still at least two
weeks away from being viable.

467
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:36,550
Well, I'll suffer through this
for two more weeks then.

468
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:42,325
You're on dialysis for your
kidneys. Your kidneys can wait.

469
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,730
They don't make
dialysis for your liver.

470
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,900
You're not gonna
make it two more days.

471
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,238
I'm not gonna let
you kill my baby.

472
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,406
It's killing you.

473
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:05,076
I'm not having an abortion.

474
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,520
It's not a baby. It's a tumor.

475
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,860
I understand dying for a cause.

476
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:20,195
Sacrificing your life so your child
might live. But that's not the choice here.

477
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,866
Either it dies or you both die.

478
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,973
Or you fix him and we both live.

479
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,566
I can't fix it.

480
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,845
I'm scheduling a D&C.

481
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,179
I won't consent.

482
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,079
So I guess you have
two days to figure it out.

483
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,763
Her kidneys are
almost irreparable.

484
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:59,066
She's developed severe DIC.
You have to force her to terminate.

485
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,858
Did you give corticosteroids to
speed up the baby's lung development?

486
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,605
No. I dropped an anvil on its
chest to prevent lung development.

487
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:09,044
I'm trying to extinguish the
human race one fetus at a time.

488
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,948
Give the lungs more time to
expand so you can see inside them.

489
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,212
See if they're the problem.

490
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,186
My real patient is dying.

491
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:18,782
Very quickly. Like I wouldn't
advise her to buy any green bananas.

492
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,057
The fetus is nothing more
than a parasite at this point.

493
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,561
Removing it is an instant cure.

494
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,392
You're not gonna get
Emma to see it that way.

495
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,640
She's probably
already named the baby,

496
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,724
read him books, had
conversations with him.

497
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,463
See, you get it.
She'll listen to you. No.

498
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,768
If you let this woman refuse to terminate,
you're helping her commit suicide.

499
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,309
As her doctor my
recommendation is against suicide.

500
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,810
If the baby had a doctor,

501
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:42,871
I think she would recommend exhausting
all possibilities before taking its life.

502
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,007
Then she'd be an idiot.

503
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,779
Too bad she's your boss!

504
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,518
What if our original
assumption is wrong?

505
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,851
It isn't.

506
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,701
If we assume she doesn't
have mirror syndrome,

507
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,236
then terminating her pregnancy
isn't gonna help her liver at all.

508
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,354
We eliminated all
other possibilities.

509
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,762
The fetus is hydropic
and in distress.

510
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,927
Emma's kidneys and liver are
failing. The diagnosis is solid.

511
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,902
Wow! The ass-kisser
won't agree with you.

512
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,837
You must be even
wronger than I thought.

513
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:08,999
Fine.

514
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,975
Let's assume she
had mirror syndrome

515
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,843
but we fixed it when we
fixed the baby's bladder.

516
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:18,850
That means that her failing liver
would be completely unrelated.

517
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,410
If it is, we can fix it and
we don't have to terminate.

518
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:25,481
So her theory is that our
patient's liver problems

519
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,719
were just a giant coincidence.

520
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,125
It's not a surprising
coincidence.

521
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,356
Pregnant women can
develop liver problems.

522
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,265
If this is the case, we can
actually do something here.

523
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,963
Don't you guys think
that's worth exploring?

524
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,166
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
would have the same symptoms.

525
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,675
Thank you. Brownnoser.

526
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,805
Viral hepatitis, HELLP
syndrome. Oh, look.

527
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:52,043
Sticking up for your girlfriend.
Who says chivalry's dead?

528
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,846
He's not joking?

529
00:25:56,188 --> 00:26:00,785
Be patient. She's going through all of us.
She'll get that jungle fever eventually.

530
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,920
I'm not going through
anyone. You love him?

531
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:07,023
This can probably wait until after
you biopsy Emma's liver, right?

532
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,034
We can't. Her
platelets are too low.

533
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:12,731
Once we pierce her liver, it'll be
next to impossible to stop the bleeding.

534
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,239
Come in from above.

535
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,385
Instead of going straight
in through her abdomen,

536
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,809
go in through the
veins in her neck.

537
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,779
Transjugular hepatic biopsy.

538
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:25,716
If the liver starts to bleed, it'll
bleed right back into her own veins.

539
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,394
Why don't you start
your vacation now?

540
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,001
Threading the guide wire through
the right internal jugular vein.

541
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,668
So, the sleep lab...

542
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,368
You and Cameron not sleeping.

543
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,979
How serious is it?

544
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,209
It's nothing.

545
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,751
She's only doing it to
make House jealous.

546
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,083
Then why are you
doing it? You kidding?

547
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:05,124
You're approaching the
inferior vena cava. Slow down.

548
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,149
You better not hurt her.

549
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,421
She already has a
big brother. She does?

550
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,466
You obviously care
very deeply about her.

551
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,229
I'm not protecting her.
I'm protecting myself.

552
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,969
A heartbroken, lovesick Cameron

553
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,666
would be even more
unbearable than she is now.

554
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,000
You're through the hepatic vein.

555
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,636
I'm firing the needle.

556
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,008
Heart rate and BP
spiking. Get that out of her.

557
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,882
Fetus's heart rate
just dropped to 50.

558
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,020
We've got contractions.
Pre-term labor.

559
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,953
Start a terbutaline drip!

560
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,768
We were able to control the
pre-term labor with tocolytics.

561
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,770
The contractions
have subsided for now.

562
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,807
And the liver biopsy was negative.
This is definitely mirror syndrome.

563
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:55,917
Her baby's doing this to her.

564
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:56,965
We're out of options.

565
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,739
Did the biopsy cause the pre-term
labor or did it happen on its own?

566
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,040
It doesn't make a difference.

567
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:02,547
Pre-term labor can
be a new symptom.

568
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,277
New information gives us new
theories. Isn't that how it works?

569
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,374
Not in this case.

570
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,013
Her body's trying to do what you refuse
to, get the baby out and save itself.

571
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,353
Patient's transaminases
are 10 times normal.

572
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,335
Her liver is on the verge of
shutting down completely.

573
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,486
A torch test could...

574
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,393
We don't have
time for more tests.

575
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,624
We have to
terminate or she'll die.

576
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:22,761
Then let's work faster.

577
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:26,037
Medicine doesn't work faster
just because you hope real hard.

578
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,184
But it could help to see
what the baby's been hiding.

579
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,233
The only organ we haven't been
able to look inside is its lungs.

580
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,453
The problem must be in there.

581
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,345
We haven't been able to see inside
because they're underdeveloped.

582
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:38,326
We've already got her on corticosteroids,
but it'll take weeks for them...

583
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,343
Then let's drown them in
corticosteroids, multiple courses.

584
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,513
Speed up their development.

585
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,524
Giving the baby more than one course
will suppress adrenal gland function.

586
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:48,823
Have long-term adverse effects
on fetal organ development.

587
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,988
Worse than death?
Emma's already on tocolytics.

588
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,007
The combination could put
her into pulmonary edema.

589
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,363
You'll just kill her faster.

590
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,868
It's the only chance we have
to see inside those lungs.

591
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:01,100
We're just gonna have to make the baby
better faster than we make Emma worse.

592
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,775
Come on! This is the kind of
thing House does every day.

593
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,573
House thought we should
terminate six hours ago.

594
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,281
I'll do it myself.

595
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,615
Anybody gonna stop her?

596
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,249
Stopping the madness is her job.

597
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,794
Somebody's got to
be Cuddy's Cuddy.

598
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,030
Nurse!

599
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:41,578
Pulmonary edema? Who
tattled? It doesn't matter.

600
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,682
There's a reason we don't give
multiple courses of corticosteroids.

601
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,241
Gee, thanks.

602
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,581
It's time to terminate.

603
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:48,814
That's not what she wants.

604
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,116
Look at her.

605
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,523
She didn't want to be an incubator for a
dead baby, but that's what you've done.

606
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,357
Either get me a
laryngoscope or get out!

607
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,233
You were right.

608
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,867
You were all right.

609
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,435
Now the mom's lungs
are shutting down.

610
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,476
She's dying faster than the
baby's lungs are developing.

611
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:53,515
I had to stop the
corticosteroids.

612
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,315
Have you spoken to the family?

613
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,754
The only family
she's got is that baby.

614
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,348
Well, he's biased.

615
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,460
What do you think
House would do?

616
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,893
House wants to terminate.

617
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,187
I mean if he didn't.

618
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,063
If he shared my position,
what do you think he would do?

619
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,160
He wouldn't share your pain.

620
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,371
He'd be objective.

621
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,565
Right.

622
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,237
He would prioritize
his problems.

623
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,505
He'd terminate.

624
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,639
He wouldn't be afraid of screwing
with her lungs if there was a bigger issue.

625
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,738
There is no bigger issue.

626
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,784
She needs her
lungs. Not right now.

627
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,752
She's already on a respirator.

628
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,219
The machine is
breathing for her.

629
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,880
I can do whatever
I want to her lungs.

630
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:33,956
If you're playing catch in the living
room and you break your mother's vase,

631
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,472
you may as well keep playing
catch. The vase is already broken.

632
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:40,090
Yeah, except that room
can't breathe without that vase.

633
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,566
I'm putting her back
on corticosteroids.

634
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,375
It worked. What worked?

635
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,207
I got the baby's
lungs to expand.

636
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,156
We should be able to
figure... Cab's on its way.

637
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,172
I have to finish packing.

638
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,948
I have a whole new
appreciation for what you do.

639
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,420
How hard it is to believe
when everyone around you

640
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,532
is telling you
that you're wrong.

641
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,457
Helps to know they're idiots.

642
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,092
Do you think I'm an idiot?

643
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,390
You're not objective.

644
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,765
But you're not an idiot.

645
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:20,105
These lungs are still two
weeks away from being viable.

646
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,731
But big enough for a diagnosis.

647
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,400
These tissue buds are new.

648
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,944
Could indicate
bronchopulmonary sequestration

649
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,877
or diaphragmatic eventration.

650
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,848
I was thinking bronchogenic
cyst or bronchial atresia.

651
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:32,714
Could be lung lesions, CCAM.

652
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,877
What about...

653
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:42,786
Move.

654
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,223
Thought you
started your vacation.

655
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,326
Somebody had to save
our boss's rotundous ass.

656
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,667
Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.

657
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,002
Small buds in the lungs
could indicate... Thanks.

658
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,701
Got the multiple
choice all worked out.

659
00:32:56,775 --> 00:33:00,007
Question is, how do we pick between
A, B, C, D, and none of the above?

660
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,513
Portable MRI is in her room.
We could get a current image.

661
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,574
The fetal lungs are so tiny the
MRI won't give us the detail we need.

662
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,781
What would we do if this
patient were not just a tadpole?

663
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,323
Say it was an actual person.

664
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,721
He is a person.

665
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,453
Thanks for playing along.

666
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,290
Pretend it's a one-pound adult.

667
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,092
Forget the mom, forget
the womb, the placenta.

668
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,690
How would we get a better
look at what's in the lungs?

669
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,995
Transesophageal echo.

670
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,366
Can't access his esophagus.

671
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,147
High resolution CT
could give us a clearer...

672
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,731
Too much radiation
for a one-pound person.

673
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,110
You can't just shoot
everything down, Chase.

674
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,476
You're not me. Collaborate.

675
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,010
A ventilation perfusion
scan would be next.

676
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:41,850
How do we get a fetus to breathe
in a radioactive isotope, idiot?

677
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,232
If it were really a person
and we had no other options

678
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,918
we'd do an exploratory surgery.

679
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:48,392
Cut into its chest and
have a look around.

680
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,758
Let's do that.

681
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,363
You're the one who insists
we treat it like a person.

682
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,423
I'll put it back when I'm done.

683
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,966
Me again.

684
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,735
It's your friendly
neighborhood belly squirter.

685
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,034
We're gonna do
open fetal surgery.

686
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,080
Open the uterus, cut out the
fetus so we can look around.

687
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:12,641
I know you can't talk so I need
you to look petrified if you consent.

688
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,811
The umbilical cord won't be cut.

689
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,721
During surgery, your body will basically
serve as the baby's heart/lung machine.

690
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,225
We find what's
wrong and we fix it.

691
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:22,352
If we can.

692
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,761
Don't lower expectations if
you want them to do something.

693
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,958
She should know
what she's facing.

694
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,330
This is incredibly dangerous.

695
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,374
It risks both your lives.

696
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,635
The only reason
why we're suggesting

697
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,406
it is because there's
nothing else we can do.

698
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,497
You all here for
the fetal surgery?

699
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,696
'Cause we're way over capacity.

700
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,771
Mind each other's
personal space.

701
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,140
There are sharp
implements in the room.

702
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,542
Like this one.

703
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,385
Uterus is fully exposed.

704
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,731
And we're in.

705
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,926
Start draining
the amniotic fluid.

706
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,233
Have you never sucked beer
out of the bottom of a keg?

707
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,571
Where'd you go to
college? Give me that.

708
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,137
Affix the pulse ox to the palm.

709
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,037
House?

710
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,112
Sorry.

711
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,340
Just realized I
forgot to TiVo <i>Alien.</i>

712
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:35,485
Fetal heart rate
good. Stats are stable.

713
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,426
Position him for the incision.

714
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,271
I see three
well-defined lesions.

715
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,637
It's definitely CCAM. I
should be able to resect them.

716
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,409
It's the mom. She's in V-fib.

717
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,312
Charging.

718
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,243
Clear! I'm clear.

719
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,823
Looks like asystole. Paddling
isn't going to do anything.

720
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,291
It's fine V-fib. I'm
going again. Clear!

721
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,126
We're gonna lose
them both. Clamp!

722
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,493
The surgery's not doing
this to her. The fetus is.

723
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,127
Step away, House.
I'm going again.

724
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:21,662
The only way to save her is to cut
away the anchor holding her down.

725
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,369
You keep going, you're
gonna get electrocuted.

726
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,935
Clear!

727
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,906
Going again. Clear!

728
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,553
Heart rate's
returning to normal.

729
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,317
Continue with the lobectomy.

730
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:53,236
So my kidneys, liver and
lungs are all fine just like that?

731
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,738
Just like that. That's amazing.

732
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:01,845
What's amazing is how
blonde your baby's hair is.

733
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,513
My baby?

734
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,779
The thing in your belly
that tried to kill you.

735
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,151
You've never called
him a baby before.

736
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,926
Any pain?

737
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,624
Nothing I can't deal with.

738
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,257
You can only get out of
bed to pee, pooh or shower.

739
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,667
And absolutely no sex.
So stop flirting with me.

740
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:28,465
Sorry.

741
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,309
So this really worked?
He'll be normal?

742
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:38,779
Well, if you call being
born twice normal.

743
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,553
Hey, thank you.

744
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,356
Don't thank me. I
would've killed the kid.

745
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:04,035
Wanna grab a bite? In a minute.

746
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,202
Emma asked me to
bring up her camera.

747
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,745
I'll walk with you.

748
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:12,411
When'd she take
this picture of you?

749
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,520
You look so...

750
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,249
I'm smiling.

751
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,949
I have a nice smile.

752
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,323
No, I've never
seen you like this.

753
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,160
She got you to glow.

754
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:27,928
What were you doing?

755
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,635
What did she say to you?

756
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,538
I always glow.

757
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,843
House.

758
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,482
Need you to take
a look at something.

759
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,920
I'm off the clock. Just open it.

760
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,988
A first-class ticket
to Vancouver Island.

761
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,932
Shoot! The wrong envelope.

762
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,807
I think it's great. Yeah.

763
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,910
Who doesn't like
Canadians? It's big.

764
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,379
You're trying to have a life.
You're trying to enjoy yourself.

765
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,313
You didn't need to apologize.

766
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:19,715
I'm not. I told you why I...

767
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:20,945
Screwed up.

768
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,113
I saved a life. I
saved two lives.

769
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,314
You

770
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:28,987
let your maternal instinct get the
best of you and nearly kill two people.

771
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,723
Case like this, you terminate,
mom lives 10 times out of 10.

772
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:32,855
You do what you did

773
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,924
mom and baby both
die 9.9 times out of 10.

774
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,765
Sometimes point
one is bigger than 9.9.

775
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,805
No, it's smaller.

776
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,672
Exactly 9.8 smaller.
Always is. Always will be.

777
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:48,046
Well, not for Emma.
And not for her son.

778
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,350
Now go away and be happy.
