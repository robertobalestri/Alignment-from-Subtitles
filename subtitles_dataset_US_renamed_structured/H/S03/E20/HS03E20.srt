1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,613
Ladies and gentlemen, step around.
Step around. Come on. Gather around.

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,782
We'll show you a little way to
make a little easy money today.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,350
You understand what I'm
saying? These are the blacks.

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,352
Don't follow the blacks. You
wanna follow the queen. Know why?

5
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,242
'Cause she's red and
that means she is hot.

6
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,489
You gotta find the
queen. Find the queen.

7
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,713
The first of the day is free
to play. Who wants to play?

8
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,260
You look interested, my man. You
wanna step on up? Come on now.

9
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,028
Who wants to play? Oh,
what about you, sweetie?

10
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,096
You're cute. Come
on up. All right.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,555
Come on here and play. Cute
girls win money. You look lucky.

12
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:23,800
Now, you look lucky.
Now, follow the queen.

13
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,001
Here we go, ladies and
gentlemen. Follow the queen.

14
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,049
Follow the queen.

15
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,493
Ain't no Helen Mirren,
but this queen is for you!

16
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,054
Which one? Which one?
Which one is it? Which one is it?

17
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,259
It's right there. Right there?

18
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,080
Beginner's luck. Beginner's
luck. I'll tell you what.

19
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,314
It takes a woman
to know a woman.

20
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,738
It takes a lady to find a queen.

21
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,299
There you go... Wanna double up?

22
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,822
All right. All right,
we've got a chancer.

23
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,246
We got a chancer.
We got a chancer.

24
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,491
All right. Here we
go. Here we go.

25
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,826
All you gotta do
is find your queen.

26
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,820
You will not win again. You
will not win again. All right.

27
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,964
Here we go. Here we go. Find
your queen. Find your queen.

28
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,820
Where is she? Where
is she? Where is she?

29
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,290
Can you find her?

30
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,886
Right there. This one? Oh, my...

31
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,454
She is killing me here.
Taking all my money.

32
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,466
Anybody else wanna get
behind the good-luck girl?

33
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,592
I can do it.

34
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,045
You can do it? All
right. You're next.

35
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,613
Just give me a chance to
recover and get my money back

36
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,415
or else I'm gonna be out
here sleeping on the street.

37
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,600
Here we go. All right? Ready?

38
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,218
This is the last time. I'm not
messing with you no more.

39
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,319
You're taking all
my money, girl.

40
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,453
I'm not messing
with you no more.

41
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,122
Here we go. One more
chance. This is your last chance.

42
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:20,189
You're gonna follow
the queen, baby.

43
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,424
Follow the queen. Where's
she at? Where's she at?

44
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,459
Just one time. I'll show you
one time and there she is.

45
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,884
Boom. Boom. Boom. Pick a card.

46
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,590
I can't decide.

47
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,635
What do you mean? Just pick
a card. Just make a decision.

48
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,683
I can't decide.

49
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,956
Come on. Any card will
do. Left? Right? Center?

50
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,088
I don't know.

51
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,564
Do you want the
right? I don't know.

52
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,397
The left?

53
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,992
The center? I don't know. I...

54
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,446
Move out the way and just
let somebody else play then?

55
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,497
I can't decide. I can't.

56
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,650
You wanna flip a coin for it?

57
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,438
What's wrong with me?

58
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,411
Is she okay?

59
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,082
Scariest 30 seconds of my life.

60
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,484
I couldn't do anything.

61
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,216
It's like I couldn't
move inside my head.

62
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,484
It's called abulia.

63
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,686
The inability to make a
decision or exercise will.

64
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,127
Is it going to happen again?

65
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,755
It's part of a TIA. A
transient ischemic attack.

66
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,092
Blood was cut off to a
section of your frontal lobe.

67
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,692
Is it like a stroke
or something?

68
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,769
A little.

69
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,636
What drugs have
you taken recently?

70
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,805
No drugs.

71
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,639
Toxins are another possibility.

72
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,088
You might have been exposed
to something at work, for instance.

73
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,013
No real job right now.

74
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,982
Exposure can build up over time

75
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,484
and lie dormant for a while.

76
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,049
What was your
last job? Pet store.

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,418
Exotic pets?

78
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,786
Tropical fish.

79
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,880
And before that?

80
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:11,981
Unemployment.

81
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,088
And before that,

82
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,697
I sold subscriptions
on the phone.

83
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,825
And before that, unemployment.

84
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:25,197
Before that, I worked
at Jeans Gone Wild.

85
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,139
Before that, unemployment.
Before that, I walked dogs.

86
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,273
And before that...

87
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,518
Loss of free will. I like it.

88
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,150
Maybe we can get Thomas
Aquinas in for a consult.

89
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,256
What caused the TIA?

90
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,219
Arteries are clear.
No sign of a clot.

91
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,370
Could have dissolved. Most
likely came from her heart.

92
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,514
We should do a bubble study.

93
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,122
Clots are unlikely in a
28-year-old who's not on the pill.

94
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,133
It's probably a vasospasm
caused by drugs.

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,726
I don't think so. She
goes from job to job.

96
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,101
Maybe there's some
kind of ADD here.

97
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,515
Help us pinpoint
where the neurological...

98
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,202
She goes from job to job
because she's a scam artist.

99
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,574
She works just long enough
to qualify for unemployment,

100
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,476
then gets fired and gets high.

101
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,481
I still don't think it's drugs.

102
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,846
Did you check for infection?

103
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,384
LP showed nothing. No fever.

104
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,528
White blood count is normal.

105
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,713
Could be toxic exposure.

106
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,722
You're the one always
saying it must be drugs.

107
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,156
You figure she's a minority,
she must be stoned?

108
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,236
You know that's what I...
She seems like a nice girl.

109
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,421
You haven't met her!

110
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,473
She was pregnant at 15,
dropped out of high school.

111
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,795
She's a real overachiever.

112
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,976
Come on. Cut her some
slack. Her baby died of SIDS.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,366
This isn't some romantic story

114
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,131
about a nice girl
scarred by tragedy.

115
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,536
She's a drug-using scam
artist scarred by tragedy.

116
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,235
On the other hand, the
tox screen just came back.

117
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,503
She's clean.

118
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,636
You're wasting my
time. He's wasting...

119
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,043
Second ex-Mrs.
Wilson want money?

120
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,479
I am no longer paying alimony.

121
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,955
She wanted her independence,

122
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,491
so she got her
realtor's license.

123
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,356
Market's doing badly.
She wants money.

124
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,724
Market's doing badly.

125
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,354
She's moving into a condo.

126
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,625
She wants... She
wants me to take Hector.

127
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,326
Pool boy?

128
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:02,859
Dog.

129
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,170
No longer interested.

130
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,331
We got him on our honeymoon.

131
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,466
So I'm like the other parent.

132
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,010
But I can't take him.

133
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,137
My hotel doesn't allow dogs.
Besides, I'm always here.

134
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,114
I asked Cuddy to
a play Thursday.

135
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,749
Oh, you... Okay.

136
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,346
She said she was busy.

137
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:26,086
And you didn't believe
her, so you bribed a janitor,

138
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,492
broke into her computer,
checked her appointments...

139
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,394
I asked her as a test.

140
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,489
What would you have
learned if she'd said yes?

141
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,034
A lot about bondage.

142
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,059
She was busy for
me but not for you.

143
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,230
She's not interested
in play <i>qua</i> play.

144
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,035
She's interested in you.

145
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,702
No. I'm not getting sucked into
the vortex of your insanity again.

146
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,040
Don't pass me notes in class.

147
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,489
Don't tell me to
ask her to the prom.

148
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,072
You cannot see her socially.

149
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,172
You're leading her on.

150
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:52,117
I'll consider that. After I take
her to the Hockney exhibit.

151
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,111
On Thursday.

152
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,022
See, she is busy.
It's not a date.

153
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,993
She enjoyed the play. I
enjoyed her enjoying the play.

154
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,827
The woman works hard.
It's nice to see her relax.

155
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,258
So all this enjoying
is an act of charity.

156
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,635
I'm keeping the
receipts for tax purposes.

157
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,874
What's life without the
ability to make stupid choices?

158
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,472
She needs her free will.

159
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,644
Find out why her brain froze before
she can't decide to take her next breath.

160
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,620
You find the toxins. You
run your bubble study.

161
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,088
You won't find anything
but I'll get the office to myself.

162
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,890
There's a lot of porn
piling up on the Internet.

163
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,359
Doesn't download itself.

164
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,430
Eric? Eric!

165
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,193
Hello, Mr. Foreman.

166
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,603
Dr. Chase. How are you? Good.

167
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,148
You're lucky you
caught us, actually...

168
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,265
I'll meet you outside.

169
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:53,803
Hey, Dad. I've got to
go. Why are you here?

170
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,781
Everything okay?

171
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:56,849
Good as ever.

172
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,383
We're staying at a
hotel down the street.

173
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,349
You didn't bring Mom with you?

174
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,856
It's gonna be her 60th
birthday in a few days.

175
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,988
I know. We talked
about it on the phone.

176
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,789
You said you couldn't come home.

177
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:09,686
You didn't have to come.

178
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,165
You haven't been
home in eight years.

179
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,532
She should see you,

180
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,102
while she still
knows who you are.

181
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,103
Dad. I've talked to
her on the phone.

182
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,313
She only knows
who I am sometimes.

183
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,542
Sometimes

184
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,581
is important.

185
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,950
So what's up with your dad? Didn't
know he was gonna be in town?

186
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,050
No.

187
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,266
Building this old, could be
toxic exposure anywhere.

188
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,735
Asbestos, mold, the coloring
agents in the old wallpaper.

189
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,238
Or it could be drugs.

190
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,796
I thought we ruled out...

191
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,067
Clean tox screen means
drugs didn't cause the TIA.

192
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,045
Drugs can be laced
with toxic substances.

193
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,672
Arsenic, rat poison.

194
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,114
The drugs wash
out of her system,

195
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,378
the toxins stick around.

196
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,317
Exposure could come
about any number of ways.

197
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,582
There's no reason to assume
it was through drug use.

198
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,851
Absolutely. Except
for the crack pipe.

199
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,485
I'll test her blood for
arsenic and rat poison.

200
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,995
Yeah. Yeah. You'd
like that, wouldn't you?

201
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,099
And your dad asked
you out for dinner?

202
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,596
I'll do the tests. You're
stuck with your family.

203
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,404
You like Hockney?

204
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,705
You heard about that.

205
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,143
The pop stuff or the
Venezuelan pictures?

206
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,773
That's a trick question.

207
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,748
Yes. But you have
no idea how it's a trick.

208
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,018
I like art. I'm open to new
things. What's the problem?

209
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,356
You're going to a gallery to see
Venezuelan pictures that don't exist.

210
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,225
But you won't go to
a play with me. Why?

211
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,493
House, why is my social
life suddenly red hot?

212
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,194
One minute I'm mushing
along with the huskies as usual

213
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,396
and suddenly it's
global warming.

214
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,882
You think you saw somebody
else pick up a toy from the sandbox

215
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,772
and suddenly you want it.

216
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,670
Is that why you said no?

217
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,646
Maybe I just want a friend and I
thought Wilson was a safe choice.

218
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,278
I'm not safe? Cool.

219
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,752
James Wilson is
never the safe choice.

220
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,291
We're going to a gallery.
We're not getting married.

221
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,054
Sure, you say that now.

222
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,719
He always marries
them in the end.

223
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,934
Is that Eric? Eric!

224
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,273
Oh!

225
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,110
Oh, baby. Baby!

226
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,508
I wanted to find that picture I
took at your high school graduation.

227
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,781
I had it reframed.

228
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,585
It's in one of these
suitcases, but I don't know...

229
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,125
You can show it to me later.

230
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,361
Your father wants to
know if you've been praying.

231
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,336
You don't have to just
come out with it like that.

232
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,771
But I only want to
know if you're happy.

233
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,206
Sure. I'm okay.

234
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,765
You like it here?
You have friends?

235
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,005
Yeah. Everything is great, Mom.

236
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,047
That's why I brought
the picture for you.

237
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,707
I remember when you were little

238
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,877
you liked to look in the back of
the math book because you knew

239
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,046
even though it
made no sense then,

240
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,886
by the end of the year
you'd understand it all.

241
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,617
That's why you
brought the picture?

242
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:30,460
You wanted to look ahead,
to see how far you'd go.

243
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,864
Now you're a grown man, I
thought you might like to look back

244
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,959
to see how far you've come.

245
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,030
It all makes sense
now. Doesn't it?

246
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,739
That isn't mine.

247
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,338
It was in your closet.

248
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,382
It belongs to this guy
who used to live with me.

249
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,887
You might want to let him
know he's got arsenic poisoning.

250
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,256
We should get a
sample of his hair

251
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,655
so we can see the extent of it.

252
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,422
But I don't do...
I don't do drugs.

253
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,670
Get a crash cart in
here! Respiratory arrest!

254
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,839
Are you sure it isn't
from the arsenic?

255
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,283
Dr. Foreman said I was poisoned.

256
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,377
<i>Your hair showed
only a trace amount.</i>

257
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,093
<i>Not enough to damage
your lungs like this.</i>

258
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,715
<i>We need you to stay still now.</i>

259
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,224
Six-millimeter cuts
starting at the apices.

260
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,527
Also, I just wanted
to let you know

261
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,999
should you change your
mind, I'll be available.

262
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,233
Aren't you getting tired
of hearing me say it?

263
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,240
I have no intention
of going out with you,

264
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,799
of having sex with you,
of doing anything with you.

265
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,876
Except work.

266
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,617
We don't have to
make a big deal about it.

267
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,238
I just thought I'd let you know.

268
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,474
I decided Tuesdays would
be a good day to do that.

269
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,578
You did not suddenly
fall in love with me.

270
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,365
You were looking for something
and I happened to be standing...

271
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,085
Cameron, it's fine.

272
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,193
No need to go on about it.

273
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,825
Advancing through
the lung bases.

274
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,743
We need to put this behind us.

275
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,791
Understood.

276
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,162
But you keep bringing it up.

277
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,865
You're the one
who's still talking.

278
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,806
Look, I'm not demanding
anything from you.

279
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,276
I'm not following you home.
I've got no expectations.

280
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,679
A gentle, polite reminder
once a week is hardly stalking.

281
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,985
There's a mass. Just
outside the lingula.

282
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,271
Biopsy shows there
are white blood cells

283
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,695
in the walls of
the blood vessels.

284
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,096
They're not supposed
to get past the bouncers.

285
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,997
Got to be autoimmune,
something lymphocytic.

286
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,899
White blood cells are
attacking her own body.

287
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,938
Only question is, what
kind of autoimmune?

288
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,098
Doesn't matter what kind.

289
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,868
It always matters what kind.

290
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,102
Treatment's always steroids.

291
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,643
Treatment is always boring.

292
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,871
Diagnosis... Okay.

293
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,538
It's affecting the
larger blood vessels.

294
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,378
Gotta be giant cell arteritis.
I'll start her on steroids.

295
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,179
It's affecting the
smaller blood vessels.

296
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,446
Gotta be lupus vasculitis.

297
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,044
I'll start her on steroids.

298
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,317
It's affecting... Yeah. Got it.

299
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,890
Start her on steroids.

300
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,982
Good idea.

301
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,858
Told you. That was boring.

302
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,255
I gotta go out. Why?

303
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,166
Wilson's got a date.

304
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,261
<i>It's got 15-foot ceilings.</i>

305
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,169
It's got an open floor plan.

306
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,309
You know, I can't
believe you called me.

307
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,339
Hey. I need a condo.

308
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,615
Didn't you and Wilson have
your first date around here?

309
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,445
Wow! You remember
where our first date was?

310
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,582
I didn't think you
were paying attention.

311
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,953
Really? He's my best friend.

312
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,320
Our first date was in Boston.

313
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,451
Oh.

314
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,025
Not quite as close to
here as I remember.

315
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,587
But we're not here
to talk about him.

316
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,996
Absolutely not.

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,468
Wait till you see the kitchen.

318
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,635
All-granite countertops.

319
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,740
Since I wasn't paying
attention back then,

320
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:02,928
what was it like dating him?

321
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,108
So this is Hockney? No.

322
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,342
I don't know what happened.

323
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,440
I'm sure you don't.

324
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,586
I never knew your
tastes were so eclectic.

325
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,655
Oh, the Hockney exhibit
finished on April 20th.

326
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,217
I thought it was May 20th.

327
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,159
Okay. My bad.

328
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,797
This is not somewhere I'd
bring someone on a date.

329
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,864
Not that this is a
date. Obviously.

330
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,570
I was just thinking...

331
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,138
He's doing landscapes
on multiple canvases now.

332
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,080
And they're kind of peaceful
and you're always so busy...

333
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,377
Wow.

334
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,377
I don't think I've ever seen
you embarrassed before.

335
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,816
Oh, it was never a date.

336
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,085
I was coming off
a bad relationship

337
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,218
and he said we could
go out as friends.

338
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,354
You know, just go see
plays, go to a museum.

339
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,497
I didn't think you
liked Trenton.

340
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,624
Love it.

341
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,229
So he'd say it's not a date
but then he'd jump you.

342
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,771
Oh, no. He meant it.

343
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,307
James Wilson,
carefully calibrating

344
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:12,971
his level of protectiveness
for your individual needs.

345
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,946
Did you just compare
Wilson to a tampon?

346
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,175
No.

347
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,386
It was very endearing. He
really just wanted to be a friend.

348
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,388
So I jumped him.

349
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,816
The bedroom's through here.

350
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,322
That's such a bad idea.

351
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,422
There's no way that won't cause
damage to the large intestine.

352
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,959
Are you keeping us
here to torture me?

353
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,634
Is that a bicycle pump?

354
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,730
That's what I'm saying.

355
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,175
It's like walking
into a sticky trap.

356
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,776
And once you're the focus of
all that attention, it's addictive.

357
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,681
This unit's kitchen's
got a chef's oven.

358
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,343
I cook a lot. Go on.

359
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,582
But it's the emotional stuff
that really sucks you in.

360
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,656
He's just so
knight-in-shining-armor, you know?

361
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,658
Always there to support
you, until one day he's not.

362
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,459
But by then you're hooked.

363
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,994
Hey, do you think that you could
talk to him about taking the dog?

364
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,336
He's the only one that
Hector really gets along with.

365
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,502
Hey, we're here to talk
real estate, not Wilson.

366
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,506
So you're saying if
you'd actually had sex

367
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,575
before you connected emotionally,
you'd have gotten over him.

368
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,280
Oh, yeah. Seems weird, right?

369
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:32,691
'Cause sex with
James is fantastic.

370
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,623
Nobody works harder to
give a woman what she wants.

371
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,498
It's got six burners.

372
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,330
The chef's oven.

373
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,425
Right.

374
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,440
How you feeling?

375
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,106
That wasn't my crack pipe.

376
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,809
You told me. Are you tired?

377
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,582
I just took a hit off
it a couple of times.

378
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,588
What's wrong with
having a little fun?

379
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,647
Your personal life is
none of my business.

380
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:08,993
You don't like me
though, do you?

381
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,654
That's your imagination.

382
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,289
I've seen every
kind of drug abuse.

383
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,925
No offense, but you don't
even stand out of the pack.

384
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,567
I'm betting you got money in
the same place you got attitude.

385
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,298
You know, people who quit
drinking and people who lose weight.

386
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,120
They think they're better
than the people that couldn't

387
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,136
and because you
got out of the projects,

388
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,842
you think that
anybody who didn't

389
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,646
is weak and stupid.

390
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,381
I'm not judging you.
Now take a breath.

391
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,389
The only difference
between me and you

392
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,516
is that I made
some bad decisions

393
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:40,821
and you made some good ones.

394
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,923
You make bad decisions
every day of your life.

395
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,794
Stop doing drugs.
Stop having fun.

396
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,493
Go back to school
and get your GED.

397
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,433
Yeah, where's the
money coming from?

398
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,967
The system's not set
up for people like me.

399
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,074
What are you staring at?

400
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,165
Your eyes.

401
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,611
There's yellow in the sclera.

402
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,215
Her liver's failing.

403
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,048
Without a transplant, she'll
be dead in the next 48 hours.

404
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,918
We should increase her immunosuppressants
and target more specifically.

405
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,047
Add methotrexate.

406
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,633
Yeah, let's do more
of what's not working.

407
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,421
This isn't an
autoimmune disease.

408
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,358
Her white blood cells
are attacking her body.

409
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,428
That's autoimmune.

410
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,327
First brain, then
lungs, now liver.

411
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,366
All getting worse
and all in two days.

412
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,867
It's moving too fast.

413
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,663
It's gotta be cancer.
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

414
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,906
It's rare even by our standards
but it fits her symptoms.

415
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,570
Explains why the steroids aren't
working, poor fingernail growth.

416
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,112
A lot of people
have bad fingernails.

417
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,580
A lot of people don't have three
organ systems shutting down.

418
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,879
Her blood vessels are
taking this thing everywhere.

419
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,213
She needs total body radiation.

420
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,049
We can't do anything
until we can confirm...

421
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,080
Running those immunochemistries
could take a week.

422
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,166
She'll be dead by the time...

423
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,988
That doesn't make
radiation any safer.

424
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,117
Okay.

425
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,389
Suppose Chase and
Cameron are right.

426
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,693
Suppose it's an
autoimmune disease.

427
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,256
What's the biggest danger
of total body radiation?

428
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,831
It suppresses the immune system,

429
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,837
which is what we're trying to
do with the steroids anyway.

430
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,502
I don't usually put
out on my first date

431
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,100
but I gotta say
that is a rad move.

432
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,109
Get her consent.
Start the radiation.

433
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,650
The patient's not
too thrilled with me.

434
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,242
I'll get her consent.

435
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,015
Foreman's got
personality issues,

436
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,057
so you're gonna step in?

437
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,923
Patient doesn't like
Foreman. I'm interested.

438
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:29,929
Fatigue, hair loss, possibility of
damage to the lungs, infertility.

439
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,836
All possible side
effects of radiation.

440
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,306
Why don't you like Dr. Foreman?

441
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,243
He thinks he's
better than he is.

442
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,010
How good is he?

443
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,141
I don't know.

444
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,185
Can we get back to
what's wrong with me?

445
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,689
There's a small possibility of
leukemia at some time in the future.

446
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,787
Hardly worth mentioning.

447
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,951
You can't say he thinks
he's better than he is

448
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,995
if you don't know
how good he is.

449
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,089
No one's as good
as he thinks he is.

450
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,394
I am.

451
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,094
You might also get cataracts.

452
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,134
Sign here.

453
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,403
I don't know.

454
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,838
You're telling me
how dangerous this is.

455
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,206
We're saving your life.

456
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,673
We're that good. Sign there.

457
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,306
I can't decide.

458
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,978
Would you rather
a pencil or a pen?

459
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,083
Who's the better James Bond,
Sean Connery or Daniel Craig?

460
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,624
You see? That's
not even a decision.

461
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,066
It's happening again.

462
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,572
I can't. I can't.

463
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,495
Up her blood thinners and
get her down to Radiology.

464
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,795
The attack will be
over in 20 minutes.

465
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,267
Then she'll wanna sign this.

466
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:22,538
Bonnie called last night
to talk about the dog.

467
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,675
Your name came up.

468
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,583
Good Lord!

469
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,384
How do you still have teeth?

470
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,855
She's the worst
realtor in New Jersey.

471
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,986
What is this? Escalation?

472
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,823
I go out with Cuddy,
you hook up with my ex?

473
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,989
I don't even know what
that's designed to do.

474
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,258
You're an addict.

475
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,423
I'm saving you from yourself.

476
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,998
By condo shopping? Thank you.

477
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,262
If I can figure out where
you keep going wrong,

478
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,916
then I can nip this
Cuddy thing in the bud

479
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,637
before she becomes
the fourth ex-Mrs. Wilson.

480
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,013
Yes. I was worried there
was no way to stop that train.

481
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,775
You have to have sex with Cuddy.

482
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,483
Wait. To stop the train?

483
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,020
Bonnie said I'm bad in bed?

484
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,392
Huh?

485
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,454
Yeah. She also said

486
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,794
that if she'd slept with
you before she liked you

487
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,109
then it would've made
it easier to handle

488
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:17,103
when you turned into the
sorry bastard who left her alone.

489
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,140
I told her you were
wasting her time, by the way.

490
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,940
You think that's gonna stop her?

491
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,571
The woman's the worst
realtor in New Jersey.

492
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,808
How do you feel?

493
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:32,908
Weak.

494
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:33,985
Sleeping a lot.

495
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,573
That's normal after radiation.

496
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,150
Deep breath.

497
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,522
A little queasy, too.

498
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,494
When I feel sick to my stomach

499
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:46,089
I always want vanilla
ice cream. It's soothing.

500
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,725
It's best to stick
with liquids for now.

501
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,630
I'm getting a murmur.

502
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,039
Oh, my arm! It's hurting me!

503
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,940
Take it off! Take it off!

504
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,674
Oh, my God!

505
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,283
Pain is the issue.

506
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,591
Just the pressure of the BP cuff

507
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,289
was enough to
start her screaming.

508
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,661
That's not cancer.

509
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,598
It sounds like...

510
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,734
Sounds like she's septic.

511
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,941
A lot of things can cause pain.

512
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:31,935
How much pain?

513
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,807
Too much.

514
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,442
It's not cancer. It's
not autoimmune.

515
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,122
It's an infection and we
fried her immune system.

516
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,658
But she had no fever.
Her LP was clear.

517
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,587
Do an echo. Confirm
it's in the heart.

518
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:57,227
And then I'll tell our patient
that we just killed her.

519
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,437
I'll tell her.

520
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,910
Hi. You haven't been
returning my phone calls.

521
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
I'm busy.

522
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,754
Well, but if you
have half an hour

523
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,052
a little later this afternoon,

524
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,821
I just found this unit
ten minutes from here.

525
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,385
It hasn't been
on the market yet.

526
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,294
I'm off the market for condos.

527
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,098
James was right?

528
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,734
I never had the teeniest
chance of selling you anything?

529
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,136
Of course he was right.

530
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:36,800
Wilson doesn't stop giving good
advice just 'cause you're divorced.

531
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,069
He's compulsive about remaining
on good terms with his exes.

532
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,445
Do you wanna know why
I named that dog Hector?

533
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,682
No. Let's keep it a mystery.

534
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,884
Because even when
he was a puppy,

535
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,325
he was the worst-tempered
dog we'd ever seen.

536
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,056
He was supposed
to be house-trained.

537
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,496
He'd pee on the
carpet every morning.

538
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:02,592
When we had people over,
he had to nip at their ankles.

539
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:06,901
"Hector does go rug" is an
anagram for "Doctor Greg House".

540
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,100
That's how early in the
marriage I resented you.

541
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,871
Wow. Did I ever waste
money on that place setting.

542
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,606
James at least had the decency

543
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,045
to feel guilty when he hurt me.

544
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:16,776
Whereas I didn't hurt you.

545
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,018
I didn't even marry you, cleverly
hoping to avoid moments like this one.

546
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,214
You always needed him and
he was always there for you.

547
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,066
If you keep yelling, I'll
think you'll owe me sex.

548
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,753
You knew he had a wife
waiting at home. You didn't care.

549
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,288
Now, I'm not saying you broke
up the marriage, but you didn't help.

550
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,637
First, "Hector does go
rug" is a lame anagram.

551
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:43,198
You want a better one for
Gregory House? "Huge ego. Sorry."

552
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,868
Second, find a new career.

553
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,354
You're never gonna sell anybody

554
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,744
if you let them
control the agenda.

555
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,304
And third, I don't
owe you anything.

556
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,783
I'm not Wilson. I'm not gonna buy
a condo just to make you feel better.

557
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,226
You okay?

558
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,319
Yeah.

559
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,790
Tell me how to do this.

560
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,964
House says people
thank you after.

561
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,195
It's not typical.

562
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,502
I already killed this woman.

563
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,067
All I can do now is not
make any more mistakes.

564
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,308
First of all, stop thinking
you can minimize the hurt.

565
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,977
A lot of people are
afraid of the word "dying."

566
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,683
If you pussyfoot around it,
she's not going to read your mind.

567
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,783
Okay. No, it's not.

568
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:34,918
When you look in her face,

569
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,122
you're gonna feel the
instinct to temporize.

570
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,426
Crush it.

571
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:40,625
Yeah.

572
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,363
Then wait.

573
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,667
Give her time to
process the news.

574
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,203
Let her know you'll be
with her through all of it.

575
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,541
Wait till she's done thinking,

576
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,044
till she meets your eyes again.

577
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,378
Then if you feel it's
appropriate, you can touch her.

578
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,077
Maybe put your hand
on her arm like this.

579
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,779
Let her know she's still
connected to another human being.

580
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,421
You've got this
down to a science.

581
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,355
You're freaking out.

582
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,259
I told you... Give
her what she needs.

583
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,244
What she doesn't need is a
doctor who's not there with her

584
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,460
because he made the wrong call.

585
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:18,698
You are freaking out.
You should be freaking out.

586
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:22,000
I won't let her see it.

587
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,376
Let her see it.

588
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:33,751
Hey.

589
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,688
How come no mask?

590
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,023
We think...

591
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,191
You have an infection.

592
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,596
Didn't the radiation work?

593
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,134
It did what it was
supposed to do.

594
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,333
You're dying.

595
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,043
What do you mean? Like things
are bad and that someday I'm gonna...

596
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,138
How much time?

597
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,917
How much time?

598
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,179
We can't know exactly.

599
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,481
A year?

600
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,917
Less than a year?

601
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,652
Less than 24 hours.

602
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,318
I don't understand.

603
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,058
Why are you saying this to
me? You're trying to scare me?

604
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,497
Why would you do that?

605
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,659
I'm sorry.

606
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:22,860
It's true.

607
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:27,738
How bad is this cancer? Yesterday
you thought I had a chance.

608
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,105
You don't have cancer.

609
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,838
You came in with an infection.

610
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:34,970
We didn't catch it.

611
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,675
What kind of infection?

612
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,114
Doesn't matter.

613
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,879
Radiation was the worst
thing we could have done.

614
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,054
We destroyed the part of
your body that was fighting it off.

615
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,090
It's spread to your heart.

616
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,890
Then give me drugs.

617
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:51,396
They have drugs for infections.

618
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,023
Antibiotics work with
the immune system,

619
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,092
but your immune system is
nonexistent because of the radiation.

620
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,571
If it's my heart, you
can get me a new heart.

621
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:03,006
People have heart
transplants all the time!

622
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,270
It wouldn't help.

623
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:07,703
The infection's everywhere.

624
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,642
There's nothing anybody can do.

625
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:26,625
I'm so sorry.

626
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,436
We'll call your grandparents.

627
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,107
Get the hell away
from me! Get out!

628
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,271
Get out!

629
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,453
I think it's broken.

630
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:26,617
Nothing like a melodramatic
gesture to solve everything.

631
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,025
We were wrong, too. Steroids
wouldn't have helped her.

632
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:32,189
I didn't not help her. I
actually pulled the trigger.

633
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,495
There's nothing
left for you to do.

634
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:35,610
One of us could go home with...

635
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,296
You're trying to
make me feel better?

636
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,338
Yeah. I killed a woman.

637
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,581
Don't you think it's appropriate

638
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,370
I feel like crap for
at least a little while?

639
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,434
It won't help her.

640
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,871
Where is he?

641
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,348
He went to the ICU.

642
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,887
What are you doing?

643
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,755
Prepping for an aspiration.

644
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,003
We still don't know
what infection...

645
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,120
It's not gonna help her.

646
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,424
It's not gonna hurt her.

647
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,873
Well, it is gonna hurt
her but it's not gonna...

648
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,126
No.

649
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,710
This'll just take a few minutes.

650
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:09,811
I'll grab a piece of an abscess,

651
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,463
some pus... You
really don't care.

652
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,437
You really don't care
why she's gonna be dead.

653
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:14,705
She's gonna be dead because...

654
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,799
What?

655
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,636
What did we screw
up? What did we miss?

656
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:23,782
I need to know.

657
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,214
You'll have to wait.

658
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,219
We're moving her
back to her room.

659
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,231
Patients who've had total body
radiation have to stay in ICU.

660
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,199
ICU isn't going to help her.

661
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,826
Let's give her some privacy.

662
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,811
What do you want?

663
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,485
Want to see if I'm
dying on schedule?

664
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,883
Or do you want me
to tell you it's all right,

665
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,289
I'm okay with it?

666
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,458
I'd like your forgiveness.
I don't expect it.

667
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:13,926
Good.

668
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:18,299
'Cause this isn't like you ran your
cart into mine at the supermarket.

669
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,202
No.

670
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,075
Your grandparents
haven't arrived yet.

671
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,174
If they don't make it on time,

672
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,937
is there anything you'd
like me to tell them?

673
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,448
I never really knew them.

674
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,080
You got any friends
you want me to call?

675
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,048
It's the middle of the night.

676
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,323
They're not the kind of friends
you ask to help you move,

677
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,794
never mind watch you die.

678
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,464
I never did much.

679
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,762
No kid to leave behind.

680
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,468
When I go, the world's
not gonna be any different.

681
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,672
Kind of a relief for you, huh?

682
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:45,155
You were right about me.

683
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,124
Yeah? Which time?

684
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,556
I had a problem with you.

685
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,560
But you were wrong, too.

686
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,240
I've made some bad decisions.

687
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:07,339
Stole cars. Robbed houses.

688
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,607
Killed a woman.

689
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,044
But then I got another chance.

690
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:20,348
Left home, went to college,
entered a whole other world.

691
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,096
And there's some part of me I
can't get rid of, always thinks,

692
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:31,431
if I'm not the smartest, if I'm
not the first, everywhere I go

693
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,338
they'll figure out I'm
not supposed to be here.

694
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,766
They'll send me back.

695
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,510
You know that's
not gonna happen.

696
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,175
You're out.

697
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,648
I'll never be out of there.

698
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,652
When I came home that last
Christmas I was in college,

699
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,519
it was like the rooms

700
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,993
felt so small.

701
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,466
It was suffocating.

702
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,632
But when I was standing
on the stoop saying goodbye,

703
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,104
my mom put her arms around me.

704
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,539
That was...

705
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,644
That was the last
time I ever felt at home.

706
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,851
I only put distance

707
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,593
between you and me
because I know there isn't any.

708
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,930
You were right about me, too.

709
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:44,199
That stuff about the system
being against people like me...

710
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,642
I know it's crap.

711
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,341
I mean, it's true
but it's also crap.

712
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:55,614
I just wasn't
ready to try again.

713
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:00,017
But I always
thought I was young.

714
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,887
I had time.

715
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,712
Aren't you ever gonna leave?

716
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,673
No.

717
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:57,505
Yeah?

718
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,245
Time of death, 3:35.

719
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,284
Do whatever you want.

720
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:34,348
You wanna go and get drunk?

721
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,546
No, thanks.

722
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,621
I've got paperwork.

723
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,795
Listen, I don't...

724
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:46,832
I don't know what I believe
but sometimes I need to think

725
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,094
there's something out
there paying attention.

726
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,659
So when I can't talk to anybody,

727
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:55,730
I talk to God and pretend
somebody's listening.

728
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,968
We were all wrong. You know?

729
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,343
Even House was wrong.

730
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,978
I know.

731
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,326
I got your consent.

732
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:58,461
Her bra hook.

733
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,669
What?

734
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,207
She scratched herself
with her bra hook.

735
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,271
That's how the infection got in.

736
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,117
Staph aureus.

737
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,555
She died from a
simple staph infection?

738
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,328
That and some bad decisions.

739
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,834
I'll be outside.

740
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:53,890
Go home. Have a
few drinks. Go to sleep.

741
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,417
Get up tomorrow.
And do it all over.

742
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,521
Only better.

743
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,662
If you need absolution,
go to a priest

744
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,832
or give alms to the poor.

745
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,100
Whatever ritual comforts you.

746
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,767
I killed her.

747
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,412
Yeah. Me, too.

748
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,778
This wasn't, "Oh, I should've
thought of that idea sooner."

749
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,882
This wasn't messing up a dosage!

750
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,787
We see a disease rushing
down on someone like a train,

751
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:28,020
we can't always get
them out of the way!

752
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,828
But this wasn't that.

753
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,196
No.

754
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:35,927
And you'll do it again.

755
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,335
For a lot of doctors,

756
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:46,344
this would be a
once-in-a-lifetime mistake.

757
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,342
But we're not a lot of doctors.

758
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,251
And we'll save more patients
than the guy down the street

759
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,162
but a few of the
ones that he'd save

760
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:58,816
by doing what everyone
else does, we will lose.

761
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,159
So you're giving me numbers.

762
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,287
Because they don't lie.

763
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,294
I can't forgive you, Foreman.

764
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,665
Because there's
nothing to forgive.

765
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,812
What did you tell him?

766
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,721
That guilt is irrelevant.

767
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,855
You wanna get something to eat?

768
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,627
Can't.

769
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,254
Got a dog waiting at home.

770
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,202
What's wrong?

771
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,975
I did something bad, Mom.

772
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,078
I hurt somebody.

773
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,748
It wasn't your fault.

774
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:09,787
It was.

775
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,387
Then I forgive you.

776
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,125
I forgive you.

777
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,634
I can see from your face

778
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,210
you'd never hurt
anybody on purpose.

779
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,945
Do you know who I am, Mom?

780
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,417
It's Eric.

781
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,427
Of course.

782
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,194
My little boy's name is Eric.
