1
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,008
Mark? Mark?

2
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,781
Mark, please ask your
father if he wants a burger.

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,015
Mom. I know. You're
defending the free world.

4
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,819
Please ask your Dad
if he wants a burger.

5
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,325
Dad?

6
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:31,197
Dad? Mom wants to
know if you want a burger.

7
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,799
Mom, I don't know what
he wants. You ask him.

8
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,298
Aunt Arlene!

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,372
Want a burger?

10
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,507
Okay.

11
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,096
The guy drove his wheelchair
into a pool. House would love that.

12
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,732
He'll be bored. It's a great
visual, but it's diagnostically boring.

13
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,606
What about
post-hair-transplant aphasia guy?

14
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,557
Infection-throwing clots. House will
shoot it down and call you an idiot.

15
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,104
Oh, well, we wouldn't want that.

16
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,581
What about yoga girl?

17
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,708
It has a good hook.

18
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,184
Should we lead with it?

19
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:09,484
His first day back, he might
want to flex his sarcasm muscle.

20
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,492
Maybe we open with
one of the weaker pitches.

21
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,524
You ran here?

22
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,033
It's just eight miles.

23
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,261
Why did you...

24
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,031
Why does a dog lick its
workplace-acceptable euphemism

25
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,767
for testicles? Because he can.

26
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,950
What have you got for me, boss?

27
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,534
I thought you said you
needed eight weeks of rehab.

28
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,522
You should have been back
here... If I'd come back sooner,

29
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,983
then I'd only be able to run six
miles. I never would have made it in.

30
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,644
What have you got for me?
You're completely pain-free?

31
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,278
The ketamine
treatment can wear off.

32
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,151
It's been two months.
It's not wearing off.

33
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,233
What have you got for me?
You can take as long as...

34
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,318
Why are we having this discussion?
Want to hear me thank you again?

35
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,693
Thank you, Doctor Cuddy,
not just for removing the bullet,

36
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,808
but thank you for putting me
into a ketamine-induced coma

37
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,358
and changing my
life. Happy? I am.

38
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,332
Middle-aged man had hair
transplant about two months ago...

39
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,203
Infection-throwing
clots. You're an idiot.

40
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,069
Except you're not an idiot,

41
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,372
and she is holding a file
for a 26-year-old female.

42
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,576
What have you really got for me?

43
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,916
Girl was doing an inverted
yoga pose, neck snapped,

44
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,216
paralyzed from the neck down,

45
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,918
except the x-rays show
no evidence of spinal injury.

46
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,485
And she's cute.

47
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,757
Oh, well played, sir.

48
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,162
What about Stephen Hawking
trying to do the 500 butterfly?

49
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:35,733
Forget it. Brain cancer, brain surgery.
There's nothing left to diagnose.

50
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,539
I would take the other one.

51
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,705
I'll take them both.

52
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,950
You don't think he
had brain cancer?

53
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,683
Of course he had brain cancer.

54
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,055
Even oncologists don't
screw up for eight years.

55
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,425
So if there's no diagnostic issue,
why are you taking the case?

56
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,657
Treatment can be
interesting. Not to you.

57
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,931
I've changed. No, you haven't.

58
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,298
No, I haven't. So why
are you taking the case?

59
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,666
The guy tried to kill himself.

60
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,227
The guy had cancer. He's a lump.

61
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,206
He hasn't been able to touch
his wife, speak to his kids.

62
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,369
He's been in that chair for eight
years. His muscles have atrophied.

63
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,207
Maybe I can help
him with the pain.

64
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,823
Isn't that enough of a
reason to want to help?

65
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,782
Not for you. I've changed.

66
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:16,873
No, you haven't.

67
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,419
Then why am I taking this case?

68
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,458
Let's start with the cute
paraplegic. Welcome back.

69
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,054
Hey. You look...

70
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,360
Healthy.

71
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,800
Quad with no broken
neck. Struck me as odd.

72
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,635
You can take a whole two
minutes to ease into being back.

73
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,647
I would've taken a whole
month to ease back,

74
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,615
but eight weeks is the
maximum rehab time

75
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,346
for a gunshot wound to the
stomach and neck, so go.

76
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,820
We heard they never found
the guy. There's no new leads.

77
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,968
What? You think he might
have shot this patient, too?

78
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,219
It would explain her
symptoms. It could be MS.

79
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,319
See? It's not so
difficult. It's not MS.

80
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,126
She had no symptoms before
she climbed onto her head.

81
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,293
Unless she's been upside-down
for the last 10 years, MS ain't it.

82
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,347
Could be transverse myelitis, swelling
in the disks, choking off nerve function.

83
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,465
MRI is negative for that.

84
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,914
Your leg looks fine.
Totally pain-free?

85
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,640
When did this turn into, "What did
you do over your summer vacation?"

86
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,846
It's a little weird
to discuss the case

87
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,946
while you're staring at
your blood on the floor.

88
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,582
I asked Cuddy to
replace the carpet.

89
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:37,754
I like the carpet. What did
you do over the summer?

90
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,026
Redo the tests.

91
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,434
Let's see if the source of the problem
is in the limbs or the spine. Do an EMG.

92
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,332
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

93
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,275
We've got a whole other quad to cover.
This guy's still got fluid in his lungs.

94
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,855
You don't think that's
from the pool he drank?

95
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,940
Give him an O2 mask. His
leg muscles have atrophied.

96
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:59,646
Tendons have shortened from
disuse, causing intense pain.

97
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,746
Tendon surgery will make
him more comfortable.

98
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,523
Comfortable?

99
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:07,922
Scoot.

100
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,498
Thanks for being here.

101
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,160
Not a problem.

102
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,703
My Dad wouldn't kill himself.

103
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,806
You haven't spoken
to him in over six years.

104
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,511
I know my dad. Mark,
the doctor's just trying to...

105
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,679
- He wouldn't kill himself.
- Fine. I'm wrong.

106
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,718
You obviously have a better
understanding of this man

107
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,556
who drools in front of
your TV set 24 hours a day.

108
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,185
Doctor House?

109
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,460
Look, he must have been confused,
all right? It must have been an accident.

110
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,967
I hope it was a suicide attempt.

111
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:52,369
If he was trying to kill himself, then
he knows how miserable his life is.

112
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,500
It means there's still
something there to kill.

113
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,610
It means your dad's still there.

114
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,441
Sorry. Need you.

115
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,850
Thank you.

116
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,256
We were doing the EMG, but we never got
past the insertion of the conduction pin.

117
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,298
Did she just say, "Thank you"?

118
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,698
I loaned her some
money. What went wrong?

119
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:21,928
Nothing went wrong.

120
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,937
If nothing went wrong,
then something went right.

121
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,614
You're not gonna tell
me why she thanked you?

122
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,834
You're not gonna tell
me what went right?

123
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:32,811
You did something for which she
is grateful, and you're embarrassed?

124
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,338
For you. She saw you coming up,
thought you were a 14 year-old boy.

125
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,543
I set her straight.

126
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,485
I am not telling you
what went wrong or right

127
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,113
until you tell me why
she said, "Thank you."

128
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:48,287
Oh, you got me. You know I
need to know. I am so gonna fold.

129
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,991
Except you're forgetting
there's one thing I can do now.

130
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,630
It's either that or
a reflex response.

131
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,295
What happened?

132
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,499
Okay.

133
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,474
This is Doctor House.
House, this is Caren...

134
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,067
Pleasure's all mine.
What happened?

135
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,943
When we inserted the
conduction pin, she flinched.

136
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,039
She flinched? Did you hear?

137
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,326
Does that mean
I'm getting better?

138
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,344
How big is a flinch? Bigger than
a twitch? Smaller than a spasm?

139
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,983
Do you smoke?
Socially, not a lot.

140
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,721
You do yoga, and you smoke?

141
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,319
I know it's hypocritical, but...

142
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:27,163
No, the world sees your legs.
No one's checking out your lungs.

143
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,462
How would smoking cause...

144
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,834
It wouldn't. I just
needed a lighter.

145
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,671
House. Oh, my God!

146
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,378
The case was looking so
promising. Hey, I'm not faking.

147
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:42,177
You moved, therefore
you can move.

148
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,381
Get this lunatic out of
here before she bores again.

149
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,979
I'm not faking!

150
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:15,782
I heard you were watching
surgery with a patient's family,

151
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,482
talking to a patient's family.

152
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,918
It's because of your hallucination,
isn't it? After you were shot.

153
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,324
You chose life. You
decided you wanted meaning,

154
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:32,354
so you took a case with no mystery,
something any doctor could do,

155
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:36,460
a case with no upside
except the satisfaction

156
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,767
of helping another human being.

157
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,868
She thanked me.

158
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,740
And you felt nothing.

159
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,178
I wasn't sure what I
was supposed to feel.

160
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:55,983
It's like your leg. It's atrophied.
Keep working it. The feeling will come.

161
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,251
Sorry. Need you again.

162
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,485
I told you to get rid of her.

163
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,270
It's a good thing we didn't.
Tightness in her chest.

164
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,172
She can't breathe. It
could be pleural effusion.

165
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:07,156
Right. Either that or she's holding
her breath like a four-year-old.

166
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,106
Relax. I'm not
gonna burn you again.

167
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,142
I'm going to stab you!

168
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,418
Look, either you're faking, or
you've got a pleural effusion.

169
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,039
That's a buildup of fluid around
the lungs, which is very serious,

170
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,542
and I would have no choice but to
stab you in the back with this needle

171
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,195
and suck all of
the fluid out of you.

172
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,096
So... CAMERON: We
should give her a local.

173
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,199
That would defeat the
point of me being nasty.

174
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,037
Ready?

175
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,330
Down. She can't
breathe if she's down.

176
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,447
Down. She can't...

177
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,514
Down, down, down! Come on!

178
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,625
That's not a pleural effusion.

179
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,398
The problem's in her heart.

180
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,136
Can't fake that.

181
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,116
Had to relieve the pressure
three times in the last two hours,

182
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,625
so either we figure out what's causing
blood to build up around her heart,

183
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,903
or I follow her around with a
needle for the rest of her life.

184
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,987
Echo was clean. No
structural abnormalities.

185
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,224
It could be an
infectious process, TB.

186
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,324
Or vasculitis would
also explain the effusion.

187
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,338
But not the paralysis. Let's
assume that she wasn't faking it.

188
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,842
She moved, therefore she
could move. She wasn't paralyzed.

189
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,844
Doesn't mean she was faking.
It could have been a delusion.

190
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,436
Now, either she was faking

191
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,482
and coincidentally got
a real cardiac problem

192
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,074
at the exact same
time, or it's a delusion,

193
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,280
and the fake paralysis is a
real neurological symptom.

194
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,380
Are you thinking vascular
tumor on her spine?

195
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,549
Her platelets are normal.

196
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,684
And she's been scanned
up and down. It's all clean.

197
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,854
So open her up and find it.

198
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,707
So what do you want us
to do? Just start at her neck

199
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,792
and just keep on cutting down her
spine until we stumble on something?

200
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,496
That should work.

201
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,011
His heart rate's a little
high. Should I be worried?

202
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,140
Probably just means he's still
in discomfort from the surgery.

203
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,650
I'm gonna up his
morphine a little.

204
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,744
You've been so nice to us.

205
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,379
It's the job.

206
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:46,290
No, I mean, all the other doctors, all
they did was obsess on the cancer,

207
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:50,455
the treatment, the
damage, just trying to fix him.

208
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,497
You're the first doctor that's ever
given a damn about the quality of his life.

209
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:02,239
His heart rate's come down.
The morphine worked. I was right.

210
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,809
What a touching moment.
That's why we become doctors,

211
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,512
for these rare moments
when our hearts are warmed...

212
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,817
Would you like to get a drink?

213
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,658
Are you serious, or are you
just trying to change the subject?

214
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,557
No, I'm serious.

215
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:26,088
I drink. You drink. We could do it
at the same time, the same table.

216
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,668
If you eat, we
could do that, too.

217
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,799
I mean, if the answer's
no, that's cool, but...

218
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:42,916
No, it's just you're just coming off of
surgery, and you're not yourself yet,

219
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,714
and I work for you, and
even though last year's...

220
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:51,049
You're smiling. I'm saying
no, and you're smiling.

221
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:54,891
Well, don't take it personally.
It's just 'cause you're full of crap.

222
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:59,126
You have no interest in going out with
me. Maybe you did, when I couldn't walk,

223
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,657
when I was a sick puppy that
you could nurture back to health.

224
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,637
Now that I'm healthy,
there's nothing in it for you.

225
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,037
You are not healthy.

226
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,345
Cuddy wants to see you.

227
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,413
You've been back
at work 24 hours,

228
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,926
and you're already playing
hide-and-seek in a woman's spine.

229
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,086
Who won the pool?

230
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,595
There's no tumor.

231
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,494
Her platelets are
normal. The scans didn't...

232
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:36,059
What's the worst that can happen?
Might paralyze her. She won't even notice.

233
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,866
Her lawyers might. You're
not doing the surgery.

234
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,804
And lower the morphine
on your other patient.

235
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,934
Fine, I'll lower it if you
let me do the surgery.

236
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,707
What? You want to trade?

237
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:51,113
We're not swapping a couple of
goats for your help putting up a barn.

238
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,312
You want something. I want
something. We compromise.

239
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,030
It's the grownup way to
resolve our differences.

240
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,534
There already is a
mechanism for that,

241
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,649
it's called the
employer-employee relationship,

242
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,159
I get what I want,
and you don't.

243
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,706
You tried to swap?

244
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,840
Ran a few more tests. They came
back negative. The surgery's on.

245
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,488
You really don't
give a crap, do you?

246
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,324
Does that make me evil?

247
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,829
Yeah.

248
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,609
The girl's life is at stake. All
we're talking about with the guy is...

249
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:44,502
All we're talking about is the reason
you took the case, to help someone.

250
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,300
Too bad for them.
Too bad for you.

251
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,833
The reason we crave meaning
is because it makes us happy.

252
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,076
The first level of happiness...

253
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,307
I'm not going away.

254
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,717
The fifth level of happiness
involves creation, changing lives.

255
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,279
The sixth level is heroin. The
seventh level is you going away.

256
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:08,158
You're saving lives, which is
tantamount to creating lives,

257
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,163
but all you're taking
away from this is the game.

258
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,674
You don't have to listen
to them thanking you.

259
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,538
You don't have to change the cases
you take or even how you handle them.

260
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,935
You just have to know
that you made a difference.

261
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,444
House! You're
not... I'm not an idiot.

262
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,052
Move. SURGEON:
House, leave her alone.

263
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,678
Close her up. You
want to know why?

264
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,086
The room's no longer sterile.

265
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,455
True, but it's not the
most interesting reason.

266
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,120
That is not a sexy big toe.

267
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,560
You'd never put
that in your mouth.

268
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,773
What the hell does
that got to do...

269
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,359
I told you it was interesting,
but it gets even better.

270
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,262
Scurvy?

271
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,671
Yeah. Drink.

272
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,333
Like what sailors get
when they don't eat right?

273
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,040
Aye, aye. Your arms and leg
tissues are choked with blood.

274
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,709
It makes it hard to move. It also
damages your hair and toenails.

275
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,219
But I'm on this great diet,
lots of protein, lots of...

276
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,779
No vitamin C. Now drink.

277
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,628
Well, thank you.

278
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,222
And thank Doctor House.

279
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,028
You can send him a note.

280
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:27,038
The nurse changed his morphine.
I thought you were worried about...

281
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,968
It's just post-op discomfort.
He's ready to go home.

282
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,036
So he won't have any pain?

283
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,741
Eventually.

284
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,412
Thank you.

285
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,646
Everything else
will be the same.

286
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,452
Well, you took away his
pain, and that changes a lot.

287
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:52,295
Why don't you put him
in some sort of facility,

288
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,792
some place without a pool?

289
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,399
Yeah, I could dump him there,

290
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,569
except he's my husband.

291
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,802
He's my son's father.

292
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,713
Right. Kids need a dad,

293
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,441
someone to play catch
with, talk about girls.

294
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,963
You know, Mark's learning that
you don't have to abandon someone

295
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,319
just because... Get a dog.

296
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,726
I'm taking care of him for the
same reason you helped us.

297
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:25,856
Because some guy shot
you, and you hallucinated?

298
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,058
I have a responsibility.

299
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:31,127
So he's just an anchor, weighing
you and your family down,

300
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,765
sapping your energy, wasting your life?
That's the meaning you take from this?

301
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,433
I want to take care of him.

302
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,205
You enjoy this?

303
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,041
I can't abandon him.

304
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,107
So you don't want
to take care of him?

305
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,746
Taking care of him doesn't
fulfill you, make you happy,

306
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:53,189
but not taking care of him
would make you miserable?

307
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,629
Hmm.

308
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,136
Okay, here we go.

309
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,808
Okay, slowly.

310
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,827
I don't need your help.
I've done this a million times.

311
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,843
Here, lie him like that.

312
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,725
Do that again. Make that sound.

313
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,768
What was that?

314
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,644
That was talking.

315
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:57,585
You guys are lousy doctors.

316
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,856
You were in such a rush to
make the patient feel better,

317
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,860
you forgot to check
what was wrong.

318
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,328
Yoga girl walked out of here
two hours ago. You fixed her.

319
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,888
Not her. The other guy.
He had brain cancer.

320
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:10,494
They removed it eight years ago. His
condition's been the same ever since.

321
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,765
Until last night. He spoke.

322
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,397
What'd he say?

323
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,573
He grunted?

324
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,307
You want us to
dissect eight years

325
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,009
of medical history with
grunting in the differential?

326
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,712
Sounds good. Call
me when you're done.

327
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,159
You're fabricating a mystery
because you're bored.

328
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,888
I am not bored.

329
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,855
Damn it!

330
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,867
You didn't tell the wife
it was only a grunt?

331
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,232
Of course not.

332
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,329
'Cause then she would
never have consented to

333
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,431
I don't remember
you being this bitchy.

334
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,477
The Vicodin dulled it. In the
sober light of day, I'm a buzz-kill.

335
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,156
You're giving false hope to
a family that's been wrecked.

336
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,014
Don't torture them. Let it go.
Tell the wife it was only a grunt.

337
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,141
Tell her to go home.

338
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,981
I can't let her down like that.

339
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,283
I pumped her up with
too much false hope.

340
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:11,253
I stuck that primo!
How rad am I?

341
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,820
2002, patient had dry eyes.

342
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,687
Dry eyes plus a grunt.

343
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,254
It all makes sense. Could
be a neurological issue.

344
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:45,230
I get hay fever, I put drops in my
eyes. I don't go to a neurologist.

345
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,960
Dry eyes could indicate
an autonomic dysfunction.

346
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,033
It goes on the board.

347
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,831
What about coughing or boogers?

348
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:51,943
Should we include boogers?

349
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,597
I'm happy we're doing this.

350
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,540
I'd much rather do this than
lengthen some guy's tendon.

351
00:22:57,076 --> 00:23:00,205
Patient's headaches increased.
Doc scanned his head, found a tumor.

352
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,339
You like wasting your
time? I'm learning.

353
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,475
To do what?
Reconsider solved cases

354
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,429
because you don't wanna
deal with the real world?

355
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,853
He's pushing where
there's nothing.

356
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,049
Cameron, you are
an excellent doctor.

357
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,649
You'll get lots of tearful
thank-yous from grateful patients.

358
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,752
Yeah, aren't I such a
bitch for wanting that?

359
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,593
No, it's not a bad thing,
but it's not why I'm here.

360
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,275
I took this fellowship
to learn from House.

361
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,632
He's teaching you
to be a masochist.

362
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,965
Dry eyes goes on the board.

363
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,700
In eight years, the patient
experienced 214 symptoms,

364
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,336
many of them repeated.

365
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,505
Any patterns?

366
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,676
Fever plus frequent urination
could mean prostatitis.

367
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,515
Or a urinary-tract infection.

368
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,748
White count was
normal. No infection.

369
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,290
If you add pain
into the mix, fever,

370
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,657
frequent urination could
indicate a kidney problem.

371
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:49,994
I like it.

372
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,998
No, creatinine and
BUN were both normal.

373
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,227
Not the kidney
part. The pain part.

374
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:58,499
Abdominal pain plus all that
stuff could equal a pancreatic cyst.

375
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,768
Perfect. You managed to pick
the one symptom he never had,

376
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,933
abdominal pain.

377
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,874
It's the first symptom
on the board, "grunt."

378
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,209
Grunting isn't pathognomonic
for abdominal pain.

379
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,512
No, the traditional diagnostic marker
is compression of the diaphragm,

380
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,382
vibration of the larynx,
leading to the audible sound,

381
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,853
"I have a pain in my abdomen."

382
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,982
Richard's symptoms are culled
from eight years of medical history.

383
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:22,654
They're not patterned. These are
random, individual events over time.

384
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:26,631
Illnesses have incubation periods.
Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.

385
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,099
His throat will collapse.

386
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,636
Muscle degeneration in his
neck won't tolerate the scope.

387
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,514
It's an automatic trach.
You're talking about him

388
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:33,562
like he's an invalid.

389
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,698
We were insensitive.

390
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,801
Does he drool? Can he hold his neck
straight? Does he choke on his food?

391
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,873
His neck's fine. His
throat's not gonna collapse.

392
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,043
Cameron, get
consent from the wife.

393
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,549
Open.

394
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,762
I need you to swallow.

395
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,670
Sorry about that.

396
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,080
Here we go.

397
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,695
We're passing through the
lower esophageal sphincter

398
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,528
into the antrum of the stomach.

399
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,364
There's the tail
of the pancreas.

400
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:39,632
Looks clean.

401
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:43,106
Moving medially. The body and
the head of the pancreas look clean.

402
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,235
Get it out. Get it out.

403
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,973
It's stuck. I can't move
it. His throat's collapsed.

404
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,075
His vitals are all over the
place. We're losing him.

405
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,684
Cutting.

406
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,121
We trached him, endoscopically removed
the probe, and he's breathing again,

407
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,753
so, all in all, great idea.

408
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,855
Get a look at the pancreas
before the world ended?

409
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,024
It was clean.

410
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,590
Which means,
barring anything else,

411
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,795
meaning you, he can
go home tomorrow.

412
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,963
This man nearly died.
How can you discharge him?

413
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,200
His throat collapsed
because of what we predicted.

414
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,072
You stick something
down someone's throat,

415
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:21,739
they gag, spasm, which he did. It took
us a half an hour to get the thing out.

416
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,045
Except our patient's
throat was sedated,

417
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:27,824
which means the brain should
have sent a signal not to do anything.

418
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,183
This could be cancer or some
bizarre neuro-degeneration,

419
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:37,662
even a new type of vascular...
Stop it. You're enjoying this.

420
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,762
I find it interesting.

421
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:41,309
It's interesting
only if you're right.

422
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,996
If you're wrong, we're
torturing this guy to amuse you.

423
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,201
Half hour to remove the probe?

424
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,839
House.

425
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,571
It's not a spasm.

426
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:56,208
His throat didn't
collapse. It locked down.

427
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,227
The brain is supposed to tell every
muscle in the body to relax and contract

428
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,516
at the same time. This
muscle was only contracting,

429
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:03,731
which means the signal from
the brain was not getting through.

430
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,657
There are no lesions on his brain,
nothing to interrupt any orders.

431
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,091
All it takes is one wire down.

432
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,680
You have no evidence
of any wires down.

433
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:13,290
A few microtumors on the meninges,
and suddenly you're choking to death.

434
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,760
You want to look at
the lining of his brain?

435
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,930
The amount of contrast material
you need to pump up there just to see...

436
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,565
He'll bleed into his
brain! No, he won't.

437
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:27,477
Because that wouldn't be interesting.
You can get permission this time.

438
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,683
The brain is enclosed in a
sack called the meninges.

439
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,744
Does this mean
the cancer's back?

440
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,915
No. No, no, no. House.

441
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:48,324
If we found cancer, it wouldn't
be the original cancer. It'd be new.

442
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,035
So, what, more
surgery, more radiation.

443
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,402
Might not be the worst thing.

444
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,234
If this isn't just ancient history, then
maybe it's something we can correct.

445
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,143
Might even get some
brain function back.

446
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,406
He could get better?

447
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:05,644
No.

448
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,986
But understanding what
you're saying will be nice.

449
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,496
Maybe you could figure
out ways to communicate.

450
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,828
Thank God he spoke to you.

451
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:28,238
Mrs. McNeil, the test to do
this is very risky. He could die.

452
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,970
He's already dead.

453
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,693
<i>Chase, go slow.</i>

454
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,061
I've already injected
it into his spinal canal.

455
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,294
Next stop, his brain.

456
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,308
Contrast material entering
into the fourth ventricle.

457
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,902
No parenchymal bleeds.

458
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:09,676
Blood pressure's
high, but it's holding.

459
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,142
Meninges are
intact. No bleeding.

460
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,188
Oh, God. Foreman, get in here.

461
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,441
Surgeon repaired the CSF leak.

462
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,910
You're lucky he didn't die.

463
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,174
I'm lucky? He's the
one who didn't die.

464
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,647
We told you he'd hemorrhage.

465
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,617
You told me he'd bleed into
his brain, not out of his ear.

466
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,017
You've got to drop this.

467
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,816
We're missing something.

468
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:54,292
We did a dangerous test, and
something bad happened. That's all this is.

469
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:59,855
Give me a tour of the brain,
Foreman. Walk me through the scans.

470
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,033
1998, what happened?

471
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:06,672
Five-centimeter, grade-four
astrocytoma between the parietal...

472
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:11,039
Nothing. Next? The speck on
the superior temporal region.

473
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,771
It's a re-growth, benign.

474
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,813
The star thingy next
to the Rathke cleft?

475
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,473
Scar tissue from a biopsy.

476
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,414
House, every speck
is not a suspect.

477
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,250
It's years of surgeons digging
around in his head. Let him go.

478
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:26,856
Redo every blood test he's
ever had. Rescan his head.

479
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,325
No.

480
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,965
He's been sick and
suffering for eight

481
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:33,641
years. I'm not gonna
help you make it worse.

482
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,827
I'm not gonna help
you make it interesting.

483
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,769
That's okay. Foreman's
better at that stuff than you are.

484
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:43,341
We need five-millimeter cuts through
the occipital and hypothalamic regions.

485
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,769
No.

486
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,746
How many millimeters?

487
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,058
I can help him.

488
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,288
That's it? That's your argument?

489
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,058
It seems like a good one.

490
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,042
If I thought for a second you wanted
to help him, you'd have carte blanche.

491
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,092
You're doing this
because it's fun.

492
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,693
Does nobody in this hospital

493
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,748
have anything better to
talk about than my motives?

494
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,383
My motives have nothing
to do with the case.

495
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,672
Your motives have everything
to do with your judgment.

496
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:19,983
For the first time in years, I
got no opiates in my body.

497
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,274
Now you question my judgment?

498
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,906
Twenty-four times a year, you
come storming into my office,

499
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:27,510
spouting that you can help someone,
only you never say those words.

500
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,179
You say something like,

501
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:33,157
"His pancreas is gonna explode
because his brain is on fire."

502
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,785
You come here with
medicine, not with platitudes.

503
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,923
I didn't wanna bore
you with the details.

504
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,966
There are no details.
You have a hunch.

505
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:45,494
House, you don't use hunches.
You always have reasons.

506
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,732
This hospital doesn't exist
for your whims. I'm sorry.

507
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,974
As of 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning,
I'm sending your patient home.

508
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:03,421
The answer's no.

509
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:07,220
Cuddy called 30 seconds after you
left and said you'd try an end-around.

510
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,237
My leg hurt.

511
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:27,971
How bad?

512
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,275
Enough that I'm telling you.

513
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,412
Did it go away?

514
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,282
Ached for a while.

515
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,352
First time I've felt anything
there since the surgery.

516
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,561
But it went away?

517
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,729
It was muscular. There
was some cramping.

518
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,094
What are you smiling about?

519
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,668
You're 40-something years old.

520
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,739
You've been running God
knows how many miles a day,

521
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,267
fallen a hundred times off that skateboard,
and you're shocked to have some soreness?

522
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,813
Just give me a prescription.

523
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,246
For Vicodin?

524
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,910
House, people get
aching joints, cramps.

525
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,215
They put on an ice pack.
They take some ibuprofen.

526
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,278
I know what the pangs
of middle age feel like.

527
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,223
No, you don't because
you've been stuffing Vicodin

528
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,136
every five minutes since
you turned middle-aged.

529
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,526
The surgery didn't work.

530
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,063
Don't play me.

531
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,829
You think this is a scam?

532
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,764
I think you want me
to feel sorry for you

533
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,701
and either do the end-around
on Cuddy or give you the drugs.

534
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,272
Either way, you get the
high you think you need.

535
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,962
House, your surgery
worked. You're fine. It's

536
00:33:38,986 --> 00:33:41,785
just gonna take time
for it to feel good.

537
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,675
Circumventricular
system senses cytokines

538
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:20,150
released in the early stages
of the immune response,

539
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,084
but CVOS releases prostaglandins

540
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,520
that reset the hypothalamic
set point upward

541
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:28,788
unless it's countered by antipyretic
therapy, so, yeah, his brain is on fire.

542
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,097
The suicide attempt
was not a suicide attempt.

543
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,688
He drove that
wheelchair into the pool

544
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,166
because he couldn't
regulate his body temperature.

545
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,567
He had a hypothalamic
dysregulation.

546
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:44,734
And you discovered this when
you stepped into the university pool?

547
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,802
Fountain. I can cure him.

548
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,108
Cure him!

549
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,149
Even if the fountain
proved anything,

550
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:54,152
fixing hypothalamic dysregulation
isn't gonna regenerate brain.

551
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,654
No, but if the scar tissue
on his hypothalamus

552
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,280
is resting against
the pituitary,

553
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,190
the adrenals would shut
down. Addison's disease.

554
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,024
You didn't see any scar tissue
on his MRI, his CT scans...

555
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,496
His brain is functional.
His temperature's normal.

556
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:09,500
There is nothing wrong with
his hypothalamus or his pituitary!

557
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,799
I can make him walk. I can
make him talk. This is a wild guess

558
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,602
that came to you because
you were sweating.

559
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:19,133
Inject him with cortisol. The guy
will have sex with his wife again.

560
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,046
He'll hug his kid again. Hopefully,
that's the combination he was using.

561
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,675
It'd be a shame if I
had cured a pedophile.

562
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,179
You're smiling.
That's a bad sign.

563
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,621
You're high.

564
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,690
I told you, I haven't had
anything in three months.

565
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,717
This is as high as you get,

566
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:39,356
a theory that ties your
case up in a neat little bow,

567
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:42,424
but you don't have a lick
of substantiating proof.

568
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:49,941
Your decision doesn't make any sense.
There is no risk to a cortisol injection.

569
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,942
If I'm wrong, big deal.

570
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,422
He goes home a vegetable
like he already is, but if I'm right...

571
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,507
This is not about downsides
or risk management.

572
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,443
It is a big deal for you to
understand the word "No."

573
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,814
I'm sorry, House.

574
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,583
He's on his way out of here.

575
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,210
I figured you'd be on your
scooter, racing down the halls

576
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,017
to stab the patient in
the neck with cortisol.

577
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:42,190
She was right to say no.

578
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,997
I had no objective reason
to think that I was right.

579
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:50,130
Just needed the puzzle.

580
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,444
Hold on a sec.

581
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,986
Is everything all right?

582
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:12,320
Yeah, it's just
something I forgot.

583
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,299
What's that?

584
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:30,968
This is cortisol, and
it's to fight infection.

585
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,910
Want to hold onto that?
Let's put a bandage on it.

586
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,826
Is he okay?

587
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
Yes.

588
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,535
Can we go now?

589
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,635
You can go.

590
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,816
Excuse me.

591
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,410
Richard. Richard.

592
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,382
Dad, you okay?

593
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:06,605
Richard? Richard! Richard!

594
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,064
Richard!

595
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,702
Richard.

596
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:24,946
Richard, you're standing.

597
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,538
Thank you.

598
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,184
<i>He got up.</i>

599
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,057
I have to go tell House.

600
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,828
No. Cuddy, you can't tell him.

601
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,299
I have to tell
him. He was right.

602
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,135
Why did you do it? Why did
you think he might be right?

603
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,641
Because he's House.

604
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,940
Medically, what made
you think he was right?

605
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:24,546
Nothing. He got lucky.
That's all that happened.

606
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,119
Telling him no was a good thing

607
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:31,247
because next time, he won't
get lucky. He'll kill someone.

608
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:36,283
Just because he was right
doesn't mean he wasn't wrong.

609
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:46,504
I see him every
day. I can't just...

610
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,197
Everybody lies.
