1
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:18,842
Jennifer Williams?

2
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,251
And you are? Cyrus.

3
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:25,653
Cyrus Harry? You used to
call me Cy, if it's really you.

4
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:29,094
I'm trying to find the Jennifer
Williams I knew 23 years ago.

5
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,358
We spent a long weekend
at the Jersey Shore.

6
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,024
She was visiting a friend...

7
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,374
That lasted longer than usual.

8
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,851
That's it for
Lansdale. Pack it up.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,183
Let's move on to Philly.

10
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,022
Seriously, you're
gonna complain?

11
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,694
How many limo drivers
are making six figures?

12
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,558
Cy, you're my little
cousin, and I love you

13
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,725
and you've been
more than generous.

14
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,129
I'm upset because you
are wasting your time

15
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,034
for some faded memory

16
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,472
when there is a world
of pleasure out there.

17
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,744
The kind of cash
you got buys a lot of it.

18
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,447
Come on.

19
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,918
Don't be like that. I've just
been driving around all day.

20
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,919
I'm a little cranky.

21
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,052
Hey!

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,784
My leg won't move.

23
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,925
Are you gonna stare or
are you gonna call 911?

24
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,364
Partial paralysis.

25
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,525
Head CT and LP showed nothing.

26
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,470
Spinal MRIs and EMG were clean.

27
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,597
Brain symptom,

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,118
and yet nothing seems
to be wrong with his brain.

29
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,442
Refrigerator mechanic, no
family, in and out of work.

30
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,482
He just won 42 million
dollars in the state lottery.

31
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,493
I think I read about this
lucky bastard in the paper.

32
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,247
You sure you don't
mean the lucky bastard

33
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,015
whose grandkids
snorted his winnings

34
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,181
till he drank himself to
death with drain cleaner?

35
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,622
Or the lucky bastard who
was found naked and penniless

36
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,058
in a strip club parking lot

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,823
with his winning number
tattooed on both testicles?

38
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,627
Neuro-otological pathology
could've caused loss of balance.

39
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,792
Calorics were normal.

40
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,632
Sure, some people will screw
up anything but some won't.

41
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,194
That kind of cash,
he has a chance

42
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,705
to turn a miserable life around.

43
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,138
Miserable stays miserable,

44
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,119
happy doesn't buy lottery
tickets in the first place.

45
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,408
Our level of happiness
is set. It's in our DNA.

46
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,344
No cash payout's
gonna change that.

47
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,524
It's like there's two of me.

48
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,709
The guy repairs appliances.

49
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,512
He's probably got
toxic brain damage

50
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,264
from years of working
with toxic chemicals.

51
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,845
Or his sudden disease
came from his sudden millions.

52
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,892
He's buying something,
collecting something, ceramics,

53
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,517
precious metals, which gave him

54
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,323
atherosclerosis of
his carotid arteries.

55
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,590
My mother's lawyer called.

56
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,592
She's threatening to sue the
hospital over our mistreatment of her.

57
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,996
Says it slowed her recovery.

58
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,234
I was just thinking how much I
want a relationship with no sex,

59
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,219
but where I still have
to deal with your mother.

60
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,436
Go to the patient's
old workshop,

61
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,872
look for causative
toxic brain damage.

62
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,417
Go take a new history, and
see if there's any lifestyle change

63
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,351
that would explain
the atherosclerosis.

64
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:42,946
Go.

65
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,565
Medicinal.

66
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,602
I'm expecting a
shooting pain in my ass.

67
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,432
My mom and I got into a fight.

68
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,206
Because of our
replacement hip replacement,

69
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,833
she can barely get
around her own house.

70
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,106
I told her she has to live
with me while she recovers.

71
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,578
I'm starting to get
the connection.

72
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,707
Yeah, she has a house,
my name is House.

73
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,510
You're the doctor
that treated her,

74
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,714
that illegally switched her
meds after she fired you,

75
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,814
that went behind the
back of her actual doctor...

76
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,118
Those beads from Thailand.

77
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,093
If we're listing all the things
that you pressured me into.

78
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,722
The point is, you're the
one who's on the line here,

79
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,562
whose name is on
her hospital records.

80
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,602
Whose name is on her name? Fine.

81
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,566
We're both on the line, but she
won't discuss this with me alone.

82
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,132
She and her lawyer wanna meet
with both of us for settlement talks.

83
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,138
I need you in that meeting,
acting nice and respectful

84
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,478
while I diffuse this stunt.

85
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,860
Yeah, well, I'm not
going to that meeting,

86
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:47,252
so I'm guessing you're cool if
I'm not nice and respectful, either.

87
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,788
Picked up any new hobbies?

88
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,553
How's a hobby gonna
paralyze my left leg?

89
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,064
If you work on vintage cars, or
you've taken up painting, fumes could...

90
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,962
No cars, no paints.

91
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,562
You're a popular guy.

92
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,728
Popular wallet.

93
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,602
Three years ago, before I had
a dime, I had my appendix out.

94
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,801
Phil was there. No
one else even called.

95
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,305
What about drugs?

96
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,676
No drugs. Look, I've
seen all the documentaries,

97
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,113
I've read all the articles.

98
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,181
I'm not gonna be
a tabloid clichÃ©.

99
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,762
I'm know what I'm
gonna do with my money.

100
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,746
"Find and build a life with the
one woman I ever cared for."

101
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,189
Point is,

102
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,816
nothing's changed.

103
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,087
I live the same life, I
eat the same food...

104
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:30,755
The same crappy canned food.

105
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,094
How many of your meals
do you eat from a can?

106
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,192
Most of them.

107
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,770
I'm used to it. I order
them by the case, online.

108
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,031
Is that bad?

109
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,895
You're worried about
the trickle-down effect

110
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,218
of Cuddy versus
House versus Cuddy.

111
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,121
You're reading
subtext into my silence?

112
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,119
House gets to you
more than anyone.

113
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,819
House thinks I'm a robot,
you think I'm a wuss?

114
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,329
No. No, no, no.

115
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,830
I think you're repressed.

116
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,141
Well, it's out of your control.

117
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,899
Tough childhood, strained
relations with your family.

118
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,635
Can't be easy trying to
succeed in a white man's world.

119
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,142
First of all, white man, I've
done at least as well as you have.

120
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,247
Second, I didn't think
you'd take House's view

121
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,078
that life sucks and we're stuck.

122
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,412
I think you're stuck.

123
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,478
Last month, I turned my life
around. I'm happier than ever.

124
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,252
Sleeping with 10
women instead of four?

125
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,020
Mmm. Try none.

126
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,221
He was cutting metal,
inhaled the dust?

127
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,264
Unless he was
snorting lines of the stuff.

128
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,589
None?

129
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,899
I was having tons of sex and
I was bored, hating myself.

130
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,017
Was never gonna be ready
when something real came along.

131
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,237
So, you're becoming
some kind of super monk,

132
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,175
and I can't change at all.

133
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,744
I challenge you to
go one differential

134
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,683
without House or anyone
else getting under your skin.

135
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,584
Since I say nothing gets to me
and you won't take me at my word,

136
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,128
how am I supposed
to prove you wrong?

137
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,953
I guess you can't.

138
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,365
I hope that doesn't eat at you.

139
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,127
Off-brand solvent from China.

140
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,257
Made of God knows what.

141
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,678
<i>Patient eats cheap canned
goods by the case load.</i>

142
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,965
Could be metal poisoning.

143
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,766
He also worked with
cut-rate chemicals.

144
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,603
Could be inhalation of
the toxic volatile substrate.

145
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,540
Treatment for both is chelation.

146
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,078
Great work.

147
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,040
Alkalinize his urine,

148
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,083
and force diuresis for
heavy metal poisoning.

149
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,052
If that doesn't work, put him
on dialysis for toxic inhalation.

150
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,619
I just said treatment
for both is chelation.

151
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,915
I said force diuresis and try
dialysis. You need a transcript?

152
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,452
You wanna put him on dialysis, risk
infection and hemodynamic swings,

153
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,622
when we can just chelate?

154
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:45,722
Whoa! Whoa!

155
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,926
Settle down.

156
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,230
If we chelate, we're not gonna
know what disease he had,

157
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,515
which means we're not gonna know

158
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,201
if the problem was
in his lousy, old job

159
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,505
or his still lousy new life,

160
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,511
which, for the purposes of a
metaphorical argument, is very important.

161
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,144
Pointless to argue. He's the
boss, he needs his puzzle solved.

162
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,571
Why bang our
heads against a wall?

163
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,766
When you're done
with the patient,

164
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,783
treat Foreman by banging
his head against a wall.

165
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,660
Where's the dialysis machine?

166
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,788
Who cares, since I
ordered chelation?

167
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,743
We'll flip a coin, tell House it
was one disease or the other.

168
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,012
Worst case, he finds out, and
he's impressed we defied him.

169
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,665
I'm sorry, I asked you to
remove the dialysis equipment,

170
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,139
not the chelation equipment.

171
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,177
And Dr. Cuddy asked me
to remove all equipment.

172
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,877
She de-authorized all treatment.

173
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,594
She won't let us make a move
until you agree to a sit-down

174
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,849
with the Godmother
and her consigliere.

175
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,479
Bitch to king four.

176
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,319
Checkmate. Patient
can't use his leg.

177
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,124
You have to concede.

178
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,196
Or I could just knock all
the pieces onto the floor.

179
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,799
You're discharging me?

180
00:08:55,869 --> 00:09:00,034
We really don't
have a good lie here.

181
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,008
You got caught in some politics
between our boss and his boss,

182
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,653
but you'll be out of
here 20 minutes, tops.

183
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,122
I'm not better, but
you're kicking me out?

184
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,490
Which is why it'll
only be 20 minutes.

185
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,625
See, the Dean of Medicine
acts tough, but she's not, really.

186
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,849
She'll step in, readmit you...

187
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,661
So, you're saying that she
cares more about his treatment

188
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,363
than the doctor who's
actually treating him?

189
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,980
Phil, shut up.

190
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,024
Cyrus.

191
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,825
Jennifer?

192
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,323
It's good to see you.

193
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,702
I read about you in the paper, so I
hopped the first train from Virginia.

194
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,331
So you read that
he struck it rich?

195
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,244
He's right. It must look weird.

196
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,178
It kind of is weird.

197
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,781
But we're a long way
from the 3rd Street Jetty.

198
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,217
I just wanted to see
you again and say hi.

199
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,483
So, hi.

200
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,384
Hi.

201
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,141
I was starting to think
I'd never find my...

202
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,827
Baby Bear.

203
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,041
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

204
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,777
I'm so sorry.

205
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,283
I don't even feel nauseous.

206
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,477
I don't know why...

207
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,111
Your hand is shaking. Okay.

208
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,387
You're having a focal seizure.

209
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:23,946
What does that mean?

210
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,526
It means you're not
getting discharged.

211
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,739
We were right that
it's a brain issue

212
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,597
but wrong about toxic
inhalation and metal poisoning.

213
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,725
Everyone else is waiting.

214
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,429
That was totally
courageous of KhloÃ©

215
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,233
to tweet about her weight gain.

216
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,773
House, we've got a patient
with a seizure disorder

217
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,274
who can't walk. Another one?

218
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,937
I thought we kicked
out the last one.

219
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,123
Obviously, I'll let you
treat your patient...

220
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,843
What are you doing?

221
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,278
We've got a patient with a
walking disorder who can't seize.

222
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,645
No, wait.

223
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,755
- I'm close, though, right?
- I wasn't finished.

224
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:01,019
Of course, I'll let you treat your
patient if you meet me halfway.

225
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,263
I guess I'm not finished either.

226
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,529
No clinic hours
for the next quarter.

227
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:09,296
And three parking spots next to
each other, so I can park diagonally,

228
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,962
and three pairs
of your underwear.

229
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,438
I'm thinking of
taking up sailing.

230
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,677
Forget it.

231
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,589
Treat your patient,
don't treat your patient,

232
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,453
come to the meeting,
don't come to the meeting,

233
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,562
I'm done playing your game.

234
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,280
You realize the game is automatically
over when the loser loses, right?

235
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,687
Neurological Lyme disease
explains the seizures and the paralysis.

236
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,228
But not the fact that Chase
seems to be treating you.

237
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,026
He claims he can
swear off sex indefinitely.

238
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,899
Also claims that I'm a boiling
cauldron of repressed rage.

239
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,335
Your theory is idiotic.

240
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,013
Patient's antibody titers were
negative for Lyme disease.

241
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,519
And I shared a motel
room with your ex-girlfriend.

242
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,525
You make a good point
about the antibody titers.

243
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,493
He's a rock.

244
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,095
How's your brother?
Homeless guy.

245
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,476
Haven't heard
from him in months.

246
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,258
I don't know. Wish I did.

247
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,595
Postural hypotension,

248
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,000
which could've reduced
the blood supply to his brain.

249
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,698
Then he'd be a miserable wretch.

250
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,330
Actually, the prognosis is...

251
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,376
Oh, I'm sorry. I just meant
his life is gonna unravel.

252
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,703
In fairness, that
applies to any diagnosis.

253
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,877
Why do we do this?

254
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,349
It's not postural hypotension.
He's not orthostatic.

255
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,010
His life may unravel, may not.

256
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,950
He's not chasing
after material things.

257
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,852
Too bad. He might
actually get those.

258
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,552
He's looking for love. Just
tracked down an old girlfriend.

259
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,503
And she'll never live
up to the memory,

260
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,428
and the thrill of
finding her will wear off,

261
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,192
and he won't even be able
to dream about being happy.

262
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,901
Interesting.

263
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,146
The patient may have
found some long-ago nookie,

264
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,048
but it doesn't mean he hasn't
had some in the meantime.

265
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,836
Herpes encephalitis.

266
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,274
Explains the
neurological symptoms.

267
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,606
EEG to confirm,

268
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,846
IV acyclovir to treat.

269
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,109
How's Foreman's BP holding?

270
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,178
Same. HOUSE: That's strange,

271
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,817
since I unplugged the
lead 30 seconds ago.

272
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,461
Admirable effort. And
I'm not just saying that

273
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,806
'cause I'm scared
you might turn green

274
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,110
and rip through
your own clothes.

275
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,203
Down on the patient's romance

276
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,334
because your own life span is
shorter than dinner and a movie?

277
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,673
You're the one who said
miserable stays miserable.

278
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,306
But you keep saying
it several times a day.

279
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:37,942
I love being back,

280
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,043
having every theory
you and I share

281
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,816
used as proof of my
own personal damage.

282
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
I'm afraid we'll need you to
step out when the EEG begins.

283
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,652
The waiting area
is just down the hall.

284
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,679
I gotta catch an early train
in the morning, anyway.

285
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,194
No, don't.

286
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,502
I'll put you up in a nice hotel
or rent you a furnished place.

287
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,168
I came for the night 'cause I
wanted to see how you were,

288
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,372
and maybe get
back in your life a bit.

289
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,660
But if I take your money...

290
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,581
What's wrong with
a nice place to stay?

291
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,916
Unless, of course,

292
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,819
you don't wanna stay.

293
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,151
I guess I could keep my
motel room another night or two.

294
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,599
Need a consult.

295
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,400
Did an EEG on my patient.

296
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,369
Turns out the reason
that prior doctors

297
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,001
thought it wasn't
a neural problem

298
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,103
is because it's not
a neural problem.

299
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,740
The EEG did show signs
of metabolic distress.

300
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,418
Scan his abdomen. Yeah.

301
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,738
Let's assume we'd already
figured that out on our own,

302
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,885
and found a mass
on the pancreas.

303
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,792
Mass looks solid.
I'd say it's cancer.

304
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,622
Paraneoplastic syndrome would
explain the neurological symptoms.

305
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,133
You need to get a piece of it.
Schedule a CT-guided biopsy.

306
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,461
Yeah. Let's assume we'd
already figured that out on our own.

307
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,241
Then what's this consult?

308
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,542
Why haven't you been yelling
at me about the Cuddy twins?

309
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,755
Because you're
doing the right thing.

310
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,220
We talking about the same issue?

311
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,564
Is there something
I don't know about

312
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,580
that I'm responding
to appropriately?

313
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,491
Cuddy wants you in the
middle of this, so does Arlene,

314
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,153
because they don't wanna
face their own problem.

315
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,892
Somehow, in your
knee-jerk, juvenile way,

316
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,402
you tripped and fell into an
actual adult response to this.

317
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,229
You're right.

318
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,812
That was Cuddy's
strategy all along.

319
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,679
She wanted me to think that she
desperately needed me to be there

320
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,014
so that I wouldn't be there.

321
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,459
Where is Dr. House?

322
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,191
I didn't want him here.

323
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,957
This isn't about her treatment
at Princeton-Plainsboro,

324
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,299
it's about the fight
we had last week.

325
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,732
I'd like a moment with my mother

326
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,001
to try and work
this out on our own.

327
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,519
I'm afraid my
client doesn't want...

328
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,171
It's Mother's Day Sunday.

329
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,975
We can't have five
minutes alone to fix this?

330
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:26,347
Relax, you can still bill me for
the time standing in the hallway.

331
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,954
I know you're mad at me, but you
can barely make it up those stairs.

332
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,359
How many nights have
you spent on your couch?

333
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,953
This has nothing
to do with our fight.

334
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,194
We're talking about my
home, not a prison camp.

335
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,112
What did I just say? I think it was
something about this not being personal.

336
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,332
You can spend time with
Rachel, I can watch over you.

337
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,405
Win-win.

338
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,373
Maybe I've got a medical thing,

339
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,377
maybe I just think I'm talking

340
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,073
but no one can hear me,
not just my uncaring daughter.

341
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,641
What do you want? 20 grand.

342
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,881
I'll hire help and forget this
nightmare you put me through.

343
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,684
Make it 30. I'll
put in a stair-lift.

344
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,158
If my board even hears about
these threats, let alone a settlement,

345
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,405
they'll investigate
what happened

346
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,709
while you were
here as a patient.

347
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,734
House and I could
both lose our licenses.

348
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,600
I've been assuming
this is personal,

349
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,902
because I don't wanna assume
that that's what my mother wants.

350
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:29,974
House.

351
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,175
Ex-not-mom-in-law.

352
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,528
You said you weren't
coming. After you said,

353
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,350
"Pretty please,
with sugar on top?"

354
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,584
Problem is, we
only give store credit.

355
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,955
So I say we put your old,
cracked, poisonous hip back in,

356
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,217
here and now.

357
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,796
I saved your life,
happy to un-save it.

358
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,729
He's being an ass.

359
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,290
If I could join
you in suing him...

360
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,733
She's like this in bed, too.

361
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,067
Always scheming to get
the lawyers out of the room.

362
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,271
If House isn't going
to take this seriously,

363
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,710
I know a few judges who will.

364
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,310
Was I supposed
to be the good cop?

365
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,917
I had to rig the monitor.

366
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,819
I had a lot of salt
with breakfast.

367
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,559
You think I'm repressed, too?

368
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,602
I think you're in danger of being
dissolved by your own stomach acids.

369
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,136
But what about Chase?

370
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,356
Do you believe that nonsense
about him being celibate?

371
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,001
Don't know, but I'm rooting
for him. Read the studies.

372
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,429
The fewer partners you have,

373
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,673
the happier you are
with your ultimate partner.

374
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,373
Hmm.

375
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,610
Then you're gonna be miserable.

376
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:42,112
Those studies, it's important
that they have a control group.

377
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,786
There's the tumor
on his pancreas.

378
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,091
There's one in his kidney,
and one in his colon.

379
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,466
One looks avascular,
one looks vascular,

380
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:57,093
the third looks calcified.

381
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,105
He has three completely
different cancers at once.

382
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,404
On average, not
so lucky after all.

383
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,844
You had to go all
Wile E. Coyote on her.

384
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,348
You told me that Arlene
wanted me in the middle of it.

385
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,783
I had to show her that no
good would come of that.

386
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,684
Seriously, that's
your rationalization?

387
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,221
How about, you didn't
like that Cuddy tricked you

388
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,590
even though you wanted
the same thing as her?

389
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,391
You didn't like that
she got the best of you.

390
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,208
You've got more anger
toward her than you realize.

391
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,292
I'm happier without her.

392
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:34,265
So I'm not stupidly expecting
her to make me happy.

393
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,808
I'm happier with my unhappiness.

394
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,209
Do you listen to what you're
saying? Because I have to.

395
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,545
I'm holding a summit meeting to force
you and Cuddy on to the same page

396
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,881
before a lawsuit gets filed.

397
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,121
Three completely
unrelated cancers at once.

398
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,253
A multicancer syndrome,
von Hippel-Lindau?

399
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,729
Wouldn't have touched his colon.

400
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,792
I hereby certify that
Dr. Foreman has not tampered

401
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,304
with this blood pressure
mechanism in any way.

402
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,432
And after I prove
I'm 100% stress-free,

403
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,977
do I get to strap you
into a chastity belt?

404
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,674
What if the patient's missing
a tumor suppressor gene?

405
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,082
How would we even find it? We
need to blast him with chemo now.

406
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,431
We can't give the patient chemo.

407
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:21,763
His platelet count's
through the floor.

408
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,949
Even worse, it'll
contain his cancers.

409
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,567
If we wanna know
what they've in common,

410
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,102
we've gotta see
where they spread next.

411
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,004
You wanna wait six months
while the cancer spreads

412
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,690
and his seizures and
paralysis get worse?

413
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,765
Now, that's crazy talk.

414
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:37,493
But if we pump the patient full of
vascular endothelial growth factor...

415
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,834
Foreman doesn't like that idea.

416
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,278
You want to grow more
and bigger cancers.

417
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,648
We can't figure out what three
small ones have in common,

418
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,950
maybe we can figure out what
eight big ones have in common.

419
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,252
Is this idea real,

420
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,262
or are you just threatening to
kill the patient to screw with me?

421
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,002
This whole thing is idiotic!

422
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,582
What does it matter what's inside
of me if I know how to control it?

423
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,474
Makes no difference to us, but
you may want to make out a will.

424
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,302
Go get lotto boy's consent,
and turn his cancers up to 11.

425
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,151
You, what, found my old yearbook

426
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,319
and got a picture of my
high school boyfriend?

427
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,074
Actually, that would've
been a lot simpler.

428
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:39,525
I took this 10 minutes ago.

429
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,229
Your high school
boyfriend who dumped you,

430
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,169
leaving you unable
to believe that

431
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,003
anyone can
rekindle an old flame.

432
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,538
He dumped me after I
hooked up with his sister.

433
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,819
Would you mind
letting him down gently?

434
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,980
I might have made
promises that you can't keep.

435
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,556
We're giving you more cancer.

436
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,755
The risks of that
are kind of obvious.

437
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,232
We'll scan you, run your
blood at frequent intervals.

438
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,098
We believe this
is our best chance

439
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,865
at finding the
underlying genetic flaw.

440
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,072
Will you marry me?

441
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,914
Don't be stupid.

442
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,718
If this cancer overwhelms me,

443
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,393
at least I'll die
happy here and now,

444
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,859
instead of hoping for a
future I may never have.

445
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,531
I love you.

446
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,397
No, you don't.

447
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,961
You don't know. You can't know.

448
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,541
We both need more time.

449
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,709
And I believe
we're gonna have it.

450
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,066
Did you notice she's wearing
different clothes every day?

451
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,821
As opposed to the same
Starfleet-issued tunic?

452
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,225
She said she came for one
night. Why'd she pack for more?

453
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,094
So she stuffed an extra sweatshirt
in her bag or she bought some.

454
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,497
Used? She's here because
an old beau struck gold.

455
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,112
She turned down a proposal. How
long a game do you think she's playing?

456
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,129
I think if she said yes after 14
hours, even he'd be suspicious.

457
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,970
You're lucky you're
hot and smart because...

458
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,341
Well, you're just lucky
you're hot and smart.

459
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,125
I need a hooker.

460
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,530
Not if you can make that work.

461
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,762
How the hell is that
supposed to relax you?

462
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,116
It's not for me, it's for Chase.

463
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,666
I'm saving myself, too.
Maybe you should get a couple.

464
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,310
You're riding me,
why not ride him?

465
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,710
Because I can get
a rise out of your BP,

466
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,372
his pee-pee, on
the other hand...

467
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,178
Forget yoga. Embrace Zen.

468
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,276
You're a repressed
idiot, he's a horny idiot.

469
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,982
Neither one of you
can do anything about it.

470
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,547
Pretty sure that's Zen.

471
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,190
Thought we were
meeting in Cuddy's office.

472
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,241
And I put one of the radio frequency
tagged sponges from the OR

473
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,343
in your portable television.

474
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,564
However much it hurt, I did
have a right to break up with you.

475
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,866
You just want everything to
have a hidden personal agenda.

476
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,190
You need to get over it instead
of torpedoing our jobs out of spite.

477
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,238
It couldn't just be that
you're a pain professionally...

478
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,423
Stop!

479
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,364
You're both at fault here.

480
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:03,197
You, for trying to manipulate
House when you used to know better,

481
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:06,295
and you, for being you,

482
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,572
which is an especially bad
idea under the circumstances.

483
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:09,869
I had good reasons.

484
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,410
You had lame rationalizations.

485
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,622
If I hadn't played him, he'd
have found out about the meeting

486
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,739
and crashed it anyway.

487
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,158
Yeah, it would've
been a lot more efficient.

488
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,980
Enough! Okay, here's
what's gonna happen.

489
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,347
Tomorrow, I drive
both of you to Arlene's.

490
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,460
You're gonna write her a
personal check for $30,000,

491
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,633
and tell her she can stay in
her own home with your blessing.

492
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,855
You're gonna do this because you
actually give a crap about your job

493
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:33,365
and this hospital, and your
mother, and possibly even House.

494
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,361
And you're gonna
say, "I'm sorry,"

495
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,197
and not utter one syllable more.

496
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,170
'Cause I'm an idiot?
No, because if you don't,

497
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,002
I'm gonna tell the
pharmacy to stop issuing

498
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,769
Vicodin prescriptions
in my name.

499
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,679
I'm not paying for gas.

500
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,586
Anything look different?

501
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,950
Not yet.

502
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:58,380
Where's Jennifer?

503
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:00,790
She's embezzling money
from my Swiss bank account.

504
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,240
That's what you think, isn't it?

505
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,254
I'm being taken for a ride?

506
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:10,901
I think she wouldn't be here if
you were still fixing refrigerators.

507
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,900
One random set of numbers
doesn't change human nature.

508
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,367
Those sets of numbers
are what kept me going.

509
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,113
Clutching those tickets,

510
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,307
thinking about the
life I could have,

511
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,713
finding Jennifer again.

512
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,911
So you figure if one
long-shot dream came true,

513
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,214
the other one will as well?

514
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,955
You think you're protecting me.

515
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,116
I think you're sad.

516
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,553
Can't stand to see
somebody happy.

517
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,237
Mom, here's a check.

518
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,609
It's a settlement for
all you've been through.

519
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,116
Of course, you can
stay in your home.

520
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,010
It was wrong of me
to suggest otherwise.

521
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,316
I'm sorry

522
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:01,977
that we saved your life

523
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,349
in the way that we did.

524
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,322
B plus.

525
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,327
I hope this resolves everything.

526
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,195
I can tell you that both your
daughter and Dr. House are deeply...

527
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,495
This is 30 grand.

528
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:17,763
Which is what you asked for.

529
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,202
This covers pain and suffering.

530
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:20,705
What about the probate lawyer?

531
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,366
Did you two...

532
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,138
I have to change my will.

533
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,703
Leave everything to Julia so this
one doesn't try more funny business

534
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,612
to get control of my home.

535
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,947
I'm sure we can toss
in another $2,500.

536
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,886
Well, I guess I'll have
to kill you tonight, then.

537
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,148
Mom, I'm not interested in...

538
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:40,216
You already think you own
my body, why not my home, too?

539
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,850
Everybody, stay calm and...

540
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,452
You have to lash out at
everyone who tries to help you?

541
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,330
Live in your own
kitchen sink, for all I care.

542
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,367
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! HOUSE: Harsh.

543
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,333
I didn't think you
had a case before,

544
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,598
but that is no way
to talk to a patient.

545
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,139
You are right.

546
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,344
Chase has had his eyes
on this one for months.

547
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,983
Meaning, he has eyes?

548
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,390
I paid her $100. Now,
when he hits on her,

549
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,394
might be tonight,
might be next week,

550
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,961
she's gonna slap
him and storm off.

551
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:23,230
So, your plan is to prove you're
both full of crap all in one move?

552
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,935
First he'll compliment her hair.

553
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,199
That's how he breaks the ice.

554
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:30,834
Next comes some
kind of joke or story.

555
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,377
He's sharpening his harpoon...

556
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,503
Are my moves this predictable?

557
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,876
She's grabbing his arm,
he's going in for the kill...

558
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,542
Don't let it get to you.

559
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,246
We poured a lot
of gas on the fire.

560
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,790
Ultrasound will give us a
good look at the damage.

561
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:19,916
A little more gel.

562
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,561
I never made a will.

563
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,068
I wanna provide
for you if I don't...

564
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,428
Stop it, will you?

565
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,465
I'd like you to hold
your breath for a sec.

566
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,966
Your money,

567
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,899
there's charities, causes,

568
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,928
your family.

569
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,097
You gotta ask yourself,

570
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:37,205
"What's mattered to you
most year in and year out?"

571
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,074
That can't be right.

572
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,280
Is it bad news?

573
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,716
No.

574
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,747
We've been pumping
you with growth factor,

575
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,650
but you don't have
any new cancers.

576
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,983
The tumors you had

577
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,218
all shrank.

578
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,229
Three tumors disappearing means
we were probably wrong about

579
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,703
him missing a tumor
suppressor gene.

580
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,400
How many mulligans
are you gonna ask for?

581
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:11,568
This test is what raised
my blood pressure.

582
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:13,441
I'm used to it now.

583
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,440
Go.

584
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:17,909
If it's autoimmune,

585
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:21,214
and he created antibodies that
ended up fighting his own tumors...

586
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,279
Growth factor would've made the
underlying autoimmune condition better.

587
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,187
Maybe it was never
cancer in the first place.

588
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,193
Of course, it was
cancer. We biopsied.

589
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,792
It could've been
a false positive.

590
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:36,300
Amyloidosis? His EKG voltage
has been on the low end of normal.

591
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,860
What if the tumors were
actually protein deposits?

592
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,904
GI biopsy to confirm,
chemo to treat.

593
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,376
She's making that diagnosis
based off a low-normal EKG.

594
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:47,572
Low-normal's still normal.

595
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:51,743
That thing cannot be right.

596
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,547
Low-normal is still low.

597
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,897
And that thing does not have
money riding on you being wrong,

598
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:56,945
like the rest of us do.

599
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,114
Chase fixed this.

600
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,734
Oh, I think you're confusing
Chase and Foreman.

601
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,158
I used to do that all the time.

602
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,520
I know it's rigged!

603
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,654
Because you're Mr. Cool,

604
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,254
nothing could possibly phase...

605
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,799
'Cause I took a beta blocker.

606
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,340
Both times, right?

607
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:23,981
His platelet count's still low.

608
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,415
Chemo's still a death sentence,

609
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,146
treating for amyloid
with normal EKG

610
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,847
is like doing heart
surgery on a guy

611
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:30,631
because he's 10 pounds
overweight. It's insane.

612
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,454
We'll do it your way. Go shout
at the patient till he gets better.

613
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,359
GI biopsy to confirm,
chemo to treat.

614
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,138
Here's the dirty little secret.

615
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,833
I just think we are who we are.

616
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,102
And I think
lotteries are stupid.

617
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:55,443
Janet Hemorrhoid!

618
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,378
That's not my name.
It's why I'm here.

619
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:05,954
Oh, I see, it goes across.

620
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,190
We better make this
fast 'cause I'm about to

621
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,024
lose my medical
license for malpractice.

622
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:13,462
It's nothing unusual. Head of the
hospital's about to lose hers, too.

623
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,136
I heard Cuddy quadrupled
your clinic hours.

624
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,611
Yeah, but you know what?
I'm flying through patients.

625
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,840
Arlene wants another meeting.

626
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,143
I know. I told my
seconds to tell her seconds

627
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,378
that she gets no second chance.

628
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,852
Technically, it's a third
chance, but I don't have thirds.

629
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,980
Cuddy told her the
same thing, more or less.

630
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,048
So you got us on the
same page, after all.

631
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,836
I've been thinking
about your irrationality,

632
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,900
and I've come up with a
rational explanation for it.

633
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,520
That's quite a challenge.

634
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,962
You don't wanna let go of Cuddy.

635
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:49,297
So you're clinging to
the negative interaction

636
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,302
because some small
part of you thinks

637
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,634
the bad stuff
beats nothing at all.

638
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,674
Almost making this work.

639
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,676
All you gotta do
now is change reality.

640
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,302
Perhaps if I was
the one suing me.

641
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:02,745
You didn't start it, but you
had the chance to end it.

642
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:05,044
And you didn't.
You love her, House.

643
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:08,710
And it's human to hang on, but
you're blowing up not just your job

644
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,689
but any chance of any kind
of relationship with her again.

645
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:23,696
Hi.

646
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,231
Hey.

647
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:31,876
What's that?

648
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,945
It's a check for $10 million.

649
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,685
Uh.

650
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,886
I don't know what to say.

651
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,925
You've already been so generous.

652
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,298
By hiring you? For a whopping
six figures? My own blood?

653
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,772
Best friend I ever had?

654
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,740
Year in, year out?

655
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:38,443
You're wearing contacts
under your glasses?

656
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,341
I must've forgotten to
take them off when I...

657
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,472
They're tinted. Do you
change your eye color?

658
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,650
Sometimes I like to mix it up.

659
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,349
I don't understand what you...

660
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,549
Wait.

661
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,052
You don't have brown eyes?

662
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,226
Where'd the name
"Baby Bear" come from?

663
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,730
It's so long ago, I don't...

664
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,298
It's a birthmark
on your left breast

665
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,002
in the shape of a bear.

666
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,773
You forgot that?

667
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,496
It's the one thing
I never told you.

668
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,285
That's why she doesn't know.

669
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:28,794
It's not like that.

670
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,258
I swear.

671
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,031
Get out. Get out, both of you.

672
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:38,261
Come on, man.

673
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,839
Get out. I'm sorry.

674
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,271
Get out!

675
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,366
Both of you!

676
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,477
You were right. I'm
just another lottery fool.

677
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,680
My life sucks.

678
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,251
It'll always suck.

679
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,464
He's crashing.
Everything's shutting down.

680
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,868
Patient had a cardiac arrest,

681
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,238
and his lungs and liver failed
before we even started the chemo.

682
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,642
Brain symptoms that aren't brain
symptoms, tumors that come and go.

683
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,270
It's not amyloidosis.

684
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,211
You're forgetting alopecia.

685
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,628
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were just listing

686
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,211
the things it's
not, alphabetically.

687
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,085
His long-lost love is a fraud.

688
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,215
Thirteen figured that out.

689
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,314
Good for her.

690
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:34,825
Decades of menial work.

691
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:38,560
If three cancers couldn't make
him die miserable, she just did.

692
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,064
The truth made him miserable.

693
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,131
It's like there's two of me.

694
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:47,929
Keep the clinic shut down,

695
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:50,601
but whatever it is, it's isolated
to the administrative floor.

696
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,338
I'm not gonna
evacuate the whole...

697
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,378
Only way to get the two of you

698
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,821
in the same place
at the same time.

699
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,354
Reopen everything,
readmit everyone, now.

700
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,925
I want you both to know
I'm filing the suit today,

701
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,698
delivering the paperwork
to your counsel's office.

702
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:20,083
You have to be destructive.
You have to tear things apart.

703
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:23,302
God forbid you should say what's
really on that twisted mind of yours.

704
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,275
And you're the great peacemaker?

705
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,609
Single mom, can't keep a man
long enough to cook a meal...

706
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,310
You'd be dead if it weren't
for our mistreatment.

707
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,543
And somehow, you'd still
find something to whine about.

708
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,179
We'll let the court decide who's
whining since you're so sure...

709
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,018
We're not getting back together.

710
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:43,286
What are you talking about?

711
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,193
It's the only explanation.

712
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,954
Why she keeps making threats

713
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:51,025
without ever filing her stupid,
yet completely valid lawsuit.

714
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:52,416
Why she ripped up her will,

715
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,235
why she kicked half of the
hospital out on the street.

716
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,866
She wants us united against her.

717
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:01,108
This is her drawing blood

718
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:04,809
over the latest of a long
line of imaginary slights.

719
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:08,648
She doesn't care if anyone
else is happy for a single...

720
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,322
Look at you idiots.

721
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,861
Who else is gonna put
up with either of you?

722
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,159
I asked you to move in.

723
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:29,569
That meant we
weren't gonna reconcile.

724
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,337
I'm sorry, Mom.

725
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:40,145
Some things take more
than a common enemy.

726
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,851
And you're an idiot with
impossible standards.

727
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,265
Common enemy.

728
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,334
One way to trigger
brain symptoms

729
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:08,539
when there's nothing
wrong with your brain.

730
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:12,050
Have something else turn
your brain into a common enemy.

731
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,448
You have a teratoma,

732
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:16,282
a usually harmless
congenital growth

733
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:19,118
which can be filled with
almost any kind of tissue.

734
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,188
And unusually,
not at all harmless.

735
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,594
If I'm right, yours is
filled with primitive cells,

736
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,064
some of which
developed into brain cells.

737
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,364
These foreign cells leaked
into your blood stream.

738
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:35,567
Now, the body is a little
xenophobic, and it creates antibodies.

739
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,151
The problem is, there's
not much difference

740
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:38,575
between brain cells
in your abdomen

741
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:39,941
and brain cells in your brain.

742
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:44,982
To make matters worse, primitive
cells can become almost anything.

743
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,642
Grow like weeds,

744
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,152
which means they
can turn into tumors,

745
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,655
and destroy whole organ systems.

746
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,619
But the cancer?

747
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:56,786
It was cancer.

748
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,059
It was just growing so fast, it
collapsed under its own weight.

749
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,662
Am I gonna live?

750
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,499
Cut out the teratoma and
what's left of your cancer,

751
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,266
you should be fine.

752
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,965
Think of it as your
second luckiest day.

753
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,669
It's hard to feel lucky.

754
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,473
The woman I loved was a fraud.

755
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,175
No, actually, a
fraud was a fraud.

756
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,285
You fell for her just the same.

757
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,116
You may stay miserable,

758
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,851
but your long-lost love is
not gonna be the reason why.

759
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,414
It's the real Jennifer.

760
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:01,845
Or at least the
only one to show up

761
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,752
who actually has the birthmark.

762
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,188
He's renting her an apartment.

763
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,250
It'll end horribly.

764
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,692
Not for him.

765
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,198
She may take all his money,

766
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,896
and he may be a naÃ¯ve idiot,

767
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:18,522
but he'll always be hopeful.

768
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,196
So he'll always be happy.

769
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,907
You lost your mother, you
euthanized your brother,

770
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,347
you got the life expectancy
of a pretty good sitcom.

771
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,395
If you can convince
yourself that

772
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:35,662
you'll be miserable
no matter what,

773
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,917
even without all that stuff,

774
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,783
then maybe you don't
have to hate the universe

775
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,884
for dumping a giant turd on you.

776
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:47,459
Fatalism is your
survival mechanism.

777
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,700
And you?

778
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,935
Dumped by everyone
you've ever loved,

779
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,735
rehab was a bust,

780
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:59,869
your leg feels like somebody
took a giant bite out of it.

781
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,644
We are who we are.

782
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,715
Lotteries are stupid.
