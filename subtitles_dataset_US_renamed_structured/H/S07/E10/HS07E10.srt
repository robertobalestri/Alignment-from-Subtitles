1
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,298
Move it. Faster.
Parks, quit slacking.

2
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,448
I'm not slacking. I can't.

3
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,887
How dare you talk
to your drill instructor?

4
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:44,911
Sir, I'm not slacking.

5
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,640
You stand up and
you look me in the eye.

6
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,976
I feel lousy. I can't...

7
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,574
"Can't" doesn't exist here.

8
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,229
Now you finish this course or
you're in isolation the rest of the day.

9
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,585
You hear me?

10
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,575
MacDonald, you ready to
make Parks eat your dust?

11
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,623
Sir, yes, sir.

12
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,125
Ready? Go!

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,096
Are your ears
malfunctioning? I said go.

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,331
Go! Go!

15
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,559
Get down! Get down!

16
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,331
Belly down. Belly down.

17
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,461
Move it!

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,170
Get up over there.
Grab those bars.

19
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:19,341
Move ahead. You grab
them bars. Faster. Move it!

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,007
Move it. Knees up.
Knees up! Move it!

21
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,280
Grab the wall! Hit
that wall! Hit that wall!

22
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,822
Move it. Get up over there.

23
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:33,087
Keep it going. Don't you
fall on me. Faster! Move it.

24
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,100
What's the matter,
Parks? You got a boo-boo?

25
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,297
Sir, I'm bleeding, sir.

26
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,363
Is your life in
immediate danger? No.

27
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,465
Then you get your
ass up over that wall.

28
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,781
I said get your ass over that...

29
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,149
What's going on?

30
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,948
My back hurts. I can't move.

31
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,680
Help. Help! I can't get up.

32
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,853
"Can't" doesn't exist here.

33
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,184
We should not
be looking at this.

34
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,609
He sent out an alert.
It'd be rude not to look.

35
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,680
Though I am straining my eyes.

36
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,044
What are we checking out?

37
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,946
Your profile page.

38
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,848
Why? I haven't...

39
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,186
That is not me.

40
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,148
That is you.

41
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,989
That's me, but that is not.

42
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:17,520
Whoever did this made it
smaller. Much, much smaller.

43
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,930
Whoever did this has
a bone to pick with you.

44
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,126
Ironic, since your bone...

45
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,033
Is not in that picture.

46
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,847
My proof is right here.
You really want to see?

47
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,737
Whoa, convinced.

48
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,703
You have any idea who did this?

49
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,889
I don't even know where
the original picture is from.

50
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,246
Bathroom at the Carleton Hotel.

51
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,348
Towel, hotel logo's reversed.

52
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,477
Shot must've been
taken in the mirror.

53
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,487
We were there for
Sanford Wells' wedding.

54
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:42,954
That must narrow it down.

55
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,251
He slept with three women there.

56
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,123
Ah, you're a whore.

57
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,629
38-year-old former Marine.
Came to the ER with back pain,

58
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,674
now his bladder aches as much
as his back 'cause he can't empty it.

59
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,785
What are we looking
at this morning?

60
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,745
Upskirt celebrity,
endearingly funny cat?

61
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,010
Another study about
gays being better parents.

62
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,636
We were lured in
by the word "lesbian."

63
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,418
Has he taken any
antihistamines or anticholinergics?

64
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,116
Nope, and the ER ruled
out enlarged prostate,

65
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,181
stuffed colon and spinal injury.

66
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,693
Military history. In suspiciously
good shape for his age,

67
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,264
makes a living bullying kids.

68
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,933
I'm thinking steroids.

69
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,294
Fascinating.

70
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,701
Thanks. We can wean him off...

71
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,932
Steroids isn't
fascinating, it's moronic.

72
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,870
There's no other sign
of hormonal imbalance.

73
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:38,002
What's fascinating is that you
equate discipline with bullying.

74
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,589
Which means that
your parents either

75
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,133
disciplined you too
much or too little.

76
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,274
I'm guessing too little.

77
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,247
It's hardly surprising you agree
with our patient's philosophy.

78
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,981
You run your department
like a boot camp,

79
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,252
as if cruelty ensures
performance.

80
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,208
Is this where I'm supposed
to disagree with you?

81
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,659
Diagnosis of urinary
retention depends on

82
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,010
the particular mechanical cause.

83
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,012
We need to know if there's
a blockage in the urethra

84
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,164
versus a nerve or a muscle
problem with the bladder.

85
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,807
Fascinating without misdirect.

86
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,044
Cath him, and see what's
stopping him from emptying his bilge.

87
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,771
Oh, not you, Chase.

88
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,781
Sending Captain
Micropenis to deal

89
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,646
with what's probably
normal-sized equipment?

90
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,451
That's too cruel even for me.

91
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,890
Good morning.

92
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,838
And what brings the
lesser Cuddy to these parts?

93
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:41,033
Pediatrician appointment
for an S-H-O-T.

94
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:45,044
Waldenwood insists vaccination
reports go in with the application.

95
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,571
Honey, finish your oatmeal.

96
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,411
Waldenwood. Is that by any
chance a boarding school?

97
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,075
Or a work camp?

98
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,884
It's our first choice preschool.

99
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,833
Blocks made of gold? Kids
don't have to pick their own noses?

100
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,258
Great facilities and teachers,

101
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,488
and they're known
for their gifted program.

102
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,693
You sure that's the
right place for her?

103
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,529
Sounds a little snobby.

104
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:12,334
I've done my research,
we've visited. It's a perfect fit.

105
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,578
You feel pressure,

106
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,775
we need you to tell us when the
urge to void becomes unbearable.

107
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,718
Sorry, can't make you feel
better till we make you feel worse.

108
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,915
I get it. Goes
for what I do, too.

109
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,792
We cause pain when
it's the only option.

110
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:36,292
The kids I work with at the camp
are there because a judge sent them.

111
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,358
I can't teach them
good behaviors

112
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,109
without first getting
rid of all their bad ones.

113
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,568
That's not gonna happen
unless I push them.

114
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:46,437
I don't see why metaphorical
pushing has to involve actual pushing.

115
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,242
I may work these kids
hard, but I never hit them.

116
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,854
You march them into the ground
instead of knocking them there.

117
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,642
Yeah, well, it beats
the alternatives

118
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,478
which is ending up in
jail or a gang, or a coffin.

119
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,282
How often do you pull that off?

120
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,891
Two-thirds never re-offend.

121
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,479
It's better numbers than juvie.

122
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,150
She's brilliant, but
new to the real world.

123
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,818
Yeah.

124
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,898
Doc, I gotta go.

125
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,159
Let's empty you out.

126
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:15,225
Take the urine to Taub.
Have him screen it for bacteria.

127
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,429
I'll analyze this data.

128
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,141
A half-hour on the phone, no go.

129
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,621
Website won't take
down the picture.

130
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,274
I thought their policy
doesn't allow nude photos.

131
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,944
Now tap the tube gently against
the table to re-suspend the cells.

132
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:37,150
They don't, but technically,
I'm no longer nude.

133
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,360
Maybe you should
shut down your account.

134
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,362
I tried but whoever did
this changed my password

135
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,807
so I can't even
prove it's my page.

136
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,858
There's a clue, she's
got serious tech skills.

137
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,259
My password was "password."

138
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,500
You're a dumb whore.

139
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,980
Do any of the three seem
like a more likely suspect?

140
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,806
Maybe one was clingier.

141
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,470
I can't even
remember their names.

142
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,938
Listen, this is a
tough time for me,

143
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,507
breaking up with Rachel,
moving into a hotel.

144
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,145
I want you to know how much your
humiliation has eased my burden.

145
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,996
Urine is clean for bacteria.

146
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,998
Not surprising, since
his bladder test showed

147
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,242
that his peeing
problem is really

148
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,734
a nerve problem,
neurogenic bladder.

149
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,997
Could mean spinal cord
tumor, cerebral palsy.

150
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,314
House is gonna
go right for syphilis.

151
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,465
How can you be so sure?

152
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,565
Rare complication of
an embarrassing illness,

153
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,041
practically a House special.

154
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,624
I want to get ahead. Let's
go test his blood for syphilis.

155
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,257
Okay, I'm gonna take some blood.

156
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,341
This will only hurt
for a second. Ready?

157
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,022
Stop it. Stop trying to kill me.

158
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,517
Hey, let her go.

159
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,687
You're trying to
kill me. Let her go.

160
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,523
Security. Need
some help in here.

161
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,857
Let me go! Let me go!

162
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,207
She's fine. How about we
get back to someone who isn't?

163
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,266
The patient's in
restraints and on Haldol,

164
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,387
which seems to
have made him lucid.

165
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:08,109
Differential diagnosis, back pain,
neurogenic bladder, psychosis.

166
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,214
A symptom which we learned
about when he choked me.

167
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,377
Hate to slow us down
by acknowledging it.

168
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,681
And yet you have.

169
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,250
Tertiary syphilis fits.

170
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,415
Test came back negative.

171
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,553
Several meds could
cause those symptoms.

172
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,925
Tricyclic
antidepressants, ritalin.

173
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,862
Also other native plants,
wormwood, jimsonweed...

174
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,176
With the amount of jimsonweed
or ritalin you'd have to ingest,

175
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,344
seems like he
would've mentioned it.

176
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,893
Unless he didn't know about it.

177
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,933
Maybe one of those
kids at the camp

178
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,100
got tired of Driscoll's
lessons and poisoned him.

179
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,638
Go to the camp, check
for potential poisons.

180
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,581
I all but ignored your assault,

181
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,746
showed you no
compassion whatsoever,

182
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,488
and you came up
with a good idea.

183
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,881
Score one for tough love.

184
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,965
Glad to hear you met someone
you liked. Weddings are good for that.

185
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,500
I was hoping to get in touch.

186
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,764
Thing is, I'm a bit
fuzzy on names.

187
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,601
Sorry, open bar.

188
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,236
She was sitting at
Dr. Simpson's table,

189
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,800
brunette, purple dress, low-cut.

190
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,775
That's my niece, Winn Phillips.

191
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,012
Your niece?

192
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,649
Fantastic.

193
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,243
Her info is in your e-mail.

194
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,459
Also, there was a
blonde, green dress.

195
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,963
You want me to hook
you up with two women?

196
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,297
Actually, three.

197
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,103
How do you cheat on a
test when there's no test?

198
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,833
Sorry, not playing.

199
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,536
Go away, House.

200
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm not giving you
advice just so you can

201
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,011
distort it to suit your
own warped world view.

202
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,315
But it's been working so well.

203
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,721
Cuddy wants to get Rachel
into Waldenwood Preschool.

204
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,487
Problem is Rachel's dumber
than a paste sandwich.

205
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,792
And her not getting in bothers
you. You care about Rachel.

206
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,388
That was not advice.

207
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,023
Cuddy cares about her,

208
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,160
which means when Rachel
gets rejected, Cuddy will be upset.

209
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,780
Then, as the boyfriend,
I will be expected

210
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,069
to be supportive and consoling.

211
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,405
Not your strengths, I grant you.

212
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,479
Leave it alone. It's just
a play date. It'll be fine.

213
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,276
"Play date" being their code for

214
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,316
"way to weed out the
paste sandwiches."

215
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,249
They'll hand her puzzles
and counting games

216
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,549
and Rachel will just sit
there and eat the pieces.

217
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,689
Crap! Crap. I'm such a sucker.

218
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,821
Thanks for the advice.

219
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,421
That's the isolation area.

220
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,559
Kids that behave badly go
there, sometimes 23 hours a day.

221
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,570
Sounds like a pretty
good incentive to behave.

222
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,399
They're treating the symptom
instead of the disease.

223
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,869
Basic systems theory,

224
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,607
troubled kids are produced
by troubled families.

225
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,824
This place doesn't even attempt
to change the environment

226
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,181
that damaged them
in the first place.

227
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,948
So there are no bad
kids, only bad parents?

228
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,682
Then why is my
brother an ex-con?

229
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,783
Treating kids decently
doesn't mean identically.

230
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,864
Some kids need more
structure or discipline.

231
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,125
Nobody needs this place.

232
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,129
Maybe we're
coming at this wrong.

233
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,070
We find the poisoner, let
them point us toward the poison.

234
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,735
Driscoll's got 24
kids in his troop.

235
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,245
You want to
interview all of them?

236
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,372
Maybe we don't need to.

237
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,377
Driscoll sent me to isolation all the
time. Doesn't mean I poisoned him.

238
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,478
He's the psycho, not me.

239
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,815
Tell him.

240
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,222
DI Driscoll's way harder
on him than the rest of us.

241
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,625
Maybe because he's
a bigger pain in the ass.

242
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,129
What are you in
here for? Shoplifting.

243
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,131
You ready to upgrade to
second-degree murder?

244
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,832
Spend 10 years in jail?

245
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,665
If he dies because of whatever
you gave him, that's what'll happen.

246
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,932
That supposed to scare me?

247
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,066
My mom's dead, my
dad's never been around,

248
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,086
and after this I'll get
bounced to another foster hole.

249
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,079
My future's not exactly bright.

250
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,590
Prison, now or later, doesn't make
that much of a difference to me.

251
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,584
Dude, I'm not mopping
the whole floor by myself.

252
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,844
Your eyes are red.

253
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,453
Might be an allergic reaction
to the cleaning solution.

254
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,924
It's just my allergies.

255
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,192
Do you take anything for them?

256
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,162
Not right now.

257
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,689
Why not?

258
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,607
These IV fluids will help flush
the drugs out of your system.

259
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,310
You know which of
the kids dosed me?

260
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,013
It's not medically relevant.

261
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,816
Look, I'm not gonna hurt him,
but I get why you're scared of me.

262
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,931
I'm real sorry
about this morning.

263
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,049
No apology necessary.

264
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,958
You're ill, you didn't
know what you were doing.

265
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,365
I used to be a real screw-up.

266
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,458
The military taught me that
actions always have consequences,

267
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,563
part of being a man
is accepting them.

268
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,669
After all the times I've said that
to the kids, apology is necessary.

269
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,844
Are you okay?

270
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,580
No, my heart's kind of racing.

271
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,086
I got it.

272
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,260
Heart rate is 170, PAT
until proven otherwise.

273
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,801
We got to slow it down. Six
milligrams of adenosine, IV bolus.

274
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,855
Tell the nurse to get in
here with the crash cart.

275
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,938
Pushing fluid sent his
heart into overdrive.

276
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,372
It took three doses of
adenosine to get it under control.

277
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,921
<i>Treating him for antihistamine
toxicity revealed a new symptom.</i>

278
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,988
<i>Which revealed
that he didn't have</i>

279
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,004
<i>antihistamine toxicity
in the first place.</i>

280
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,013
House, where are
you? Playground.

281
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,419
Great place to meet
chicks. Their moms, too.

282
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,516
Tachycardia could be a
humoral effect, mastocytosis.

283
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,253
We'd see either GI or
cutaneous symptoms.

284
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,486
Pancreatic insulinoma...

285
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,028
Wouldn't cause bladder problems.

286
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,961
Unlike pheochromocytoma.

287
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,534
Well done, Chase.
Now turn off your phone.

288
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,899
You heard that? It's on vibrate.

289
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,131
<i>I'm assuming it's been
ringing almost non-stop</i>

290
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,036
<i>since you changed
your status update to,</i>

291
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,803
"Nothing lights my
fire like a lady-of-size.

292
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,970
"Less than three bills,
don't bother calling."

293
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,543
<i>Followed by your cell number.</i>

294
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,578
No, no, no, you're right. This is
in no way clever and hysterical.

295
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,623
<i>Before you start
rolling anyone in flour,</i>

296
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,055
<i>work the patient up for a pheo.</i>

297
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,486
Adrenal and pituitary scans,
24-hour urine collection.

298
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,800
How soon after the admissions
session did the child get sick?

299
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,064
Kid barely got home
before she collapsed.

300
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,766
Her parents are a wreck,
desperate for answers.

301
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,741
Have you experienced
any symptoms?

302
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,869
Or does someone else
oversee these sessions?

303
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,641
The teachers supervise. No
one's mentioned feeling sick.

304
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,579
I'd love to call the
family, offer my support.

305
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,244
Sorry, I can't reveal names.

306
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,651
Doctor/patient confidentiality.

307
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,889
So this is where all the
admissions play dates happen?

308
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,368
She wouldn't have
been in another room?

309
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,792
This is where we have them all.

310
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,571
Maybe to be safe we
get rid of these toys and...

311
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,654
No, no, no. Don't do that.

312
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,823
I'll tell you if
anything's toxic.

313
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,060
For now, you should
minimize your exposure.

314
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,583
I'm supposed to be supervised.

315
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,150
The scan is pre-programmed.
There's no risk to the patient.

316
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,782
You're literally gonna sit
here, watch the monitor

317
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,294
and chat with him
if he gets lonely.

318
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,360
Still... Report me.

319
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,212
How are you doing in there?

320
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,016
<i>You shouldn't bother
trying to protect Landon.</i>

321
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,578
<i>I know he's the one
who drugged me.</i>

322
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,154
The antihistamines
aren't what got you sick.

323
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,556
<i>Doesn't change
the fact that he did it.</i>

324
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:13,731
<i>I tried everything with that
kid, I just can't break through.</i>

325
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,462
It's clear you care about him.

326
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,471
Have you tried telling him that?

327
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,581
<i>You gotta understand something.</i>

328
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,904
<i>These kids, they're
all manipulators.</i>

329
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,176
<i>As much as I care
about all of them, I can't...</i>

330
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,078
<i>I can't show them that unless there's
some mutual respect, otherwise...</i>

331
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,344
Forget those other
kids. Think about this kid.

332
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,184
He watched his
mother get sick and die,

333
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,856
he's never known his dad.

334
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,393
Who knows how long it's been
since anyone's taken care of him,

335
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,961
or if there's ever
been a man around

336
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,259
with any degree of consistency.

337
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,237
I believe that
you're on his side.

338
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,400
I'm betting it
would help if he did.

339
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,717
You are a beautiful
man. Can I leave now?

340
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,753
I know where all
three women are,

341
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,821
but I'd like to avoid the
additional humiliation

342
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,686
of falsely accusing any of them.

343
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:15,387
You ID'd the hotel off this. Hoping
there's another clue in it somewhere.

344
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,591
We could enhance the image,

345
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:24,203
maybe her face is reflected in
that gleam off your butt cheek.

346
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,271
Or maybe it's time
to chalk this up

347
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,104
to the hazards
of being a player.

348
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,267
Your zipper problem just
blew up your marriage.

349
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,639
Don't move.

350
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:40,116
Unlike me, you've had the
decency not to cheat on anyone,

351
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,814
but you haven't been giving much
thought to who these women are,

352
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,254
how they might feel.

353
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,218
Obviously you hurt one of
them. Emotionally hurt her,

354
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,059
because physically, how
would you even know.

355
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,896
Looks like your
shorty is a shorty.

356
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,736
You're early,
dinner's not ready.

357
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,646
Oh.

358
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,342
Okay. Rachel and I
will go play in her room.

359
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,816
Really?

360
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,286
I'm hungry, go cook.

361
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,297
All right, you
little lump of clay.

362
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,607
Rachel? Rachel!

363
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,712
It's a new toy. What kid
doesn't like new toys?

364
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,786
A moron, that's who.

365
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:57,119
Okay, look at the pretty
colors. Now, what color is this?

366
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,795
Orange.

367
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,030
Yes, that is orange.
What color is this?

368
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,711
Okay, blocks going
away. Bye-bye, blocks.

369
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,113
Next time, reinforce the levees.

370
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,482
Bad corps of army
engineers, bad.

371
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,118
But what's this?

372
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:25,352
Rings. Look at the rings.

373
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:30,089
Now the goal of this game is...

374
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,092
To not kill you.

375
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,035
Why are you here? Wait,
did you give me an STD?

376
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,772
No, I did not. Don't deflect.

377
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,245
That picture was taken
by someone your height.

378
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,347
Just take it down.

379
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,883
What picture?

380
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,384
Fine.

381
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,253
Play it that way.

382
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,889
So...

383
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,931
You really like kittens, huh?

384
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,493
Yeah, you said you did, too.

385
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,334
No wonder you're pissed,
because that is not you.

386
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,940
And I didn't take it.

387
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,874
Did you mean my height
with heels or without?

388
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,340
You weren't wearing heels
when we were in that room, so...

389
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,440
Oh, yes, you were.

390
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,284
I started to take them off, and
then you asked me very nicely not to.

391
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,024
Why would I do this?

392
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,117
I'm not mad about
what happened with us,

393
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,253
or apparently with you and any
other women at that wedding.

394
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,128
Sorry, I guess my
forensic analysis

395
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,031
wasn't as advanced as I thought.

396
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,898
Wait. You know, you don't have
to rush off. I still have those heels.

397
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:53,607
Everywhere you looked,
gingham and stuffed animals.

398
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,237
How did you get out of there?

399
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,483
I didn't, right away.

400
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,583
Wasn't anything wrong
with her physically.

401
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,850
One down, two members
of a threesome to go.

402
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,357
You should flip a
condom to choose.

403
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,916
We checked his adrenal,
pituitary and thyroid glands,

404
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:11,191
monitored his
catecholamines. It's not a pheo.

405
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,858
We had to put him on a
diltiazem drip to regulate his heart.

406
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,300
Means he's running out of time.

407
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,263
Means you are, too.

408
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:22,633
Your campaign to soften him
up so he'll go easier on the kids,

409
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,301
all in a pointless attempt to
validate your own upbringing.

410
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,543
Another cardiac arrhythmia?

411
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:31,413
It's not our
patient. It's the ER.

412
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:36,646
That patient House admitted with
back pain and urinary retention?

413
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,384
How do you feel
about a matched set?

414
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,804
We need to track your common
exposures. What shampoo do you use?

415
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,499
Whatever crap the camp gives us.

416
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,131
Same here.

417
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,352
We need things exclusive to
you but not the rest of the camp.

418
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,869
Otherwise, a lot more people
would be sick. Toothpaste, deodorant?

419
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,943
Can't be deodorant
making him sick.

420
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,812
He doesn't wear
any. Smells like a...

421
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:05,917
Parks, shut your mouth.

422
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,128
You're not my drill
instructor here, okay?

423
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,752
Doesn't mean you
get to be disrespectful.

424
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,950
I can do whatever the hell I
want. You're not in charge.

425
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:13,702
There's gotta be a link.

426
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,195
Diet, sexual
history, drug abuse.

427
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,695
No, and believe me, I asked.

428
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,595
Those were some
fun conversations.

429
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:20,826
Did you believe the answers?

430
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,053
I know the answer to that
is always supposed to be no,

431
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,126
but I did.

432
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,195
Not like the kid has had
much unsupervised time lately.

433
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,142
Delivery for a Dr. Robert Chase.

434
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,209
That's me.

435
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,437
Camp is in the woods.

436
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,122
There are tons of
opportunities for infection

437
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,614
that not every
person will pick up.

438
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,981
Legionellosis from water,
toxoplasmosis from dirt,

439
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,280
brucellosis from animals.

440
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,514
Too bad none of those
explain his symptoms.

441
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,190
Casey and Sanford Wells thank me

442
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:49,023
for my extraordinarily generous
donation to their wedding charity.

443
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,118
Aw!

444
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,461
Oh, God. She must have
gotten access to my credit card.

445
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,532
Nocardia fits.

446
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,899
The bacteria lives in the
dirt. They both spent plenty...

447
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,233
Nocardia starts in the
lungs, not the bladder.

448
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,398
How generous is
extraordinarily generous?

449
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,237
Call the charity, explain
the donation's a fraud.

450
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,005
And take back
Wells' wedding gift?

451
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,479
You are extraordinarily screwed.

452
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,517
Bushes can make a happy hunting
ground for ticks. Lyme disease.

453
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,382
Neither of our patients
have a rash or a tick bite.

454
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,547
40% of Lyme patients don't
develop a rash. Bite is easy to miss.

455
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,256
Start them on
doxycycline for Lyme.

456
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,191
$2,500!

457
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,655
Cancel your credit card,
find that girl and marry her.

458
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,308
Go back, that was <i>Jersey Shore.</i>

459
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,716
I'm not watching that crap.

460
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,420
No, let him be your guinea pig.

461
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,363
You can dose me after
you're sure you're right.

462
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,957
The side effects
are fairly limited,

463
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,689
and it would be
better to treat you

464
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,732
before you develop
any more symptoms.

465
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:00,857
I want to wait.

466
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,794
I'm not your drill instructor,

467
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,306
I'm not trying to break you.

468
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,036
My only job is to
make you better.

469
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:15,881
I truly believe this
medicine is our best shot.

470
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:19,146
But whether or not
you take it is up to you.

471
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,918
Is there anything
else I can do for you?

472
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:33,291
Another pillow would
be cool, if you don't mind.

473
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,338
Hey.

474
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,244
Your turn to pick.

475
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:00,121
Ready, set, feed the monkey.

476
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,086
This isn't weird at all.

477
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:07,123
She's got the fine motor
skills of the Hulk in oven mitts.

478
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:11,432
Do you want a doodle?
Do you? Feed the monkey.

479
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:17,667
Cuddy puts her to bed at 7:30,
which cuts way into our training time.

480
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,972
Her play date's on Friday.

481
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,949
What is that?

482
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,349
Dog training clicker.

483
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,481
Gives immediate
positive reinforcement,

484
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:29,994
bridging the precious
seconds between

485
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,456
the desired behavior
and treat delivery.

486
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,221
House, she's not a dog.

487
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,357
That really seems to be working.

488
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,898
Does Cuddy know
that Rachel's here,

489
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,609
and that you're turning
her into a schnauzer?

490
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,602
I told Maria that Rachel
and I are working on

491
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,138
a secret art project for Mommy.

492
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,764
Which means that
some paede's patient

493
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,638
is about to be
short one art project.

494
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,109
The sacrifices we make
for our children's education.

495
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:56,540
Who's a good girl?
Who's a good girl?

496
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,245
It had to be you. I gave you
my credit card to pay for drinks.

497
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,552
And I gave it back. I didn't
take the picture, now go away.

498
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,922
Forgive me if I'm not convinced.

499
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,204
You're obviously pissed at me.

500
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,527
Because I thought we
totally had a connection.

501
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:13,408
And then when you didn't
ask me for my number...

502
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,094
A connection?

503
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:16,595
It was a threesome.

504
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,331
Yeah, but you were obviously
more into me than you were into Nika.

505
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,464
Kenzie, honey. You
have a phone call.

506
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,701
Just a minute, Dad.

507
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,511
I didn't want to say anything in
front of her, but you could have.

508
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,805
You live with your parents?

509
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,440
Just until graduation.

510
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,242
College?

511
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,609
How old are you?

512
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,686
Eighteen.

513
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:37,715
Next month.

514
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,783
Relax, it's not
illegal or anything.

515
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,451
Look, I just need this to stop.

516
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:45,690
Would you give it up,
already? I told you it's not me.

517
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,591
My parents won't even let
me on social networking sites.

518
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,225
Too many sexual predators.

519
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,643
Stop him!

520
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,045
Hey. Hey. Where are you going?

521
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,651
Hey. You're sick, you
need to be in a hospital.

522
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:09,264
There's a million hospitals. Ones
that won't send me back to that camp.

523
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,415
Landon, what's going on?

524
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:12,617
Please help me,
don't send me back.

525
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,657
Those are my car keys. You
stole them out of my pocket?

526
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,389
"No bad kids," huh?

527
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,159
Did you stop Landon?

528
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,233
Yeah. Yeah. What's wrong?

529
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,828
My legs, they hurt.
Muscles are in a vise.

530
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:26,938
What does it mean?

531
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,064
Not sure yet.

532
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,665
10 diazepam, 40 potassium.

533
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,346
The leg pain was caused by a
muscle cramp from low sodium,

534
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,114
which was caused
by kidney dysfunction.

535
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:46,283
Landon didn't respond to doxycycline
either. I think we can rule out Lyme.

536
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,002
I thought I was
getting through to him,

537
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,586
but he just wanted
to steal my car keys.

538
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,859
If only his previous behavior had
given you a reason to expect that.

539
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,767
Why are you putting
hot sauce on a toy?

540
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,036
Maybe you don't care if
children chew on your caterpillar.

541
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,264
I think it's wrong.

542
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,674
What causes kidney dysfunction
on top of everything else?

543
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,300
Arsenic poisoning.

544
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,879
And people do change.

545
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,148
Driscoll took it to
heart when I asked him

546
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,117
to think about Landon's history.

547
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,551
He was much nicer and then...

548
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,556
Wow, two ideas that
don't make any sense.

549
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,682
If it was arsenic, they'd
be puking and pooping.

550
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,726
And conversations
with moralizing strangers

551
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,956
do not make people
change their behavior.

552
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,468
Rachel is not gonna
do that more than once.

553
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,670
Whipple's could affect
the brain, kidneys, heart.

554
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,337
Not without GI involvement.

555
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,675
Why is it impossible to believe

556
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,148
I made a compelling
argument and he...

557
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,412
If he changed, it's
because something

558
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,750
besides you made that
argument compelling.

559
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:53,056
Compromised kidneys secondary to
bladder issues points to botulism toxin,

560
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,182
which lives in soil.

561
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,960
Got into the kid's bloodstream

562
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,394
through the cut on his forehead,

563
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:58,640
got into the drill instructor's

564
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,223
through some
abrasions on his feet.

565
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,866
Good idea. Give
them both the antitoxin.

566
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,907
I saw my chance to get
out of here. I had to take it.

567
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,711
Don't make excuses.
You tried to steal from me.

568
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,061
All these kids are manipulators.

569
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,678
You can't let your guard down.

570
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,415
What do you mean
"all these kids"?

571
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,199
Don't lump me in with
the losers at that camp.

572
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,091
Seems like you belong there.
It may be your only chance.

573
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,220
Look, I've screwed up but I've
never been in trouble with the law.

574
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,232
You said you were
in for shoplifting.

575
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,744
The store owner caught me
trying to boost some chips and stuff,

576
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,532
called my DCS caseworker.

577
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,878
I thought all the kids were
there under court order.

578
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,499
That's usually how it works.

579
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,237
So why is he different?

580
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,183
Why would I take a
naked picture of you?

581
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,086
You're cute, but you're not
that cute. Now please, go.

582
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,351
You're the only one
left. You're pissed off.

583
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,935
I'm pissed off because
you're in my apartment,

584
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,621
and my boyfriend might
be here any minute.

585
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,089
Boyfriend.

586
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,742
The last thing I want to do is
publicize that I cheated on him,

587
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:08,893
so why would I prank you?

588
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,596
And where was this
boyfriend at the wedding?

589
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,331
Out of town.

590
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,464
Conveniently.

591
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,540
It's from my sister's
birthday last month.

592
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:23,207
And before you suggest he's my
brother, note how I'm kissing him.

593
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,876
You used me, I used
you. It was a mistake.

594
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,715
Now I just want
to forget about it.

595
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,288
I just got off the phone with
Landon's DCS caseworker.

596
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:41,265
You were right. I'm not what
made my argument compelling.

597
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,641
Where are we going?

598
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,181
To give your bladder an antibiotic
wash to protect against infection.

599
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,586
Who are you?

600
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,252
I'm Dr. House.

601
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:13,495
And that boy is the
spitting image of his mother.

602
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,565
Of course I've never seen her.

603
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,332
But his care worker
told my lackey

604
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,764
that you paid his
enrolment fee at the camp.

605
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,710
Now that could mean
that you're a family friend,

606
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,837
but then why hide it?

607
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,547
The only person
who'd want to hide it

608
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:37,045
is his deadbeat dad who's decided
not to be a deadbeat anymore.

609
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,361
Please don't tell him.

610
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,339
We spend days looking
for a link between them.

611
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,739
He doesn't tell us
the kid is his son.

612
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,867
We were looking for exposures.

613
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,584
He didn't think it was
medically relevant.

614
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,723
Soon he won't have to
worry about his kid finding out.

615
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,581
Being dead makes
keeping secrets much easier.

616
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,744
Neither one is responding
to botulism treatment.

617
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,253
And the boy started
having seizures.

618
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,998
And Driscoll might
have been right that

619
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,700
their biological
relationship doesn't matter.

620
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,802
Genetic illness emerges
when people are the same age,

621
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,089
not during the same week.

622
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,321
Unless there's a trigger.

623
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,007
Genetic conditions can be set
off by things in the surroundings,

624
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,227
and these two obviously
have shared surroundings.

625
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,360
That's a relatively
rare phenomenon,

626
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,699
which is our specialty, I know.

627
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,104
Our patients are related.
That can't be a coincidence.

628
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,004
I just had an idea.

629
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,349
Relevant to our case?

630
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:40,442
No. Sit.

631
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,749
Wegener's can be brought on
by exposure to heavy metals.

632
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,933
You see anything at the camp?

633
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,394
Near the isolation hut, there
were some old generator batteries.

634
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,895
Could've leaked into the soil.

635
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,955
Seems like someone else at the
camp would've had lead poisoning.

636
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,192
You got anything better?

637
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,198
Treat with cyclophospamide.

638
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,133
Go find your bliss.

639
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,941
Now if you'll excuse
me, I have a play date.

640
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:19,717
Why didn't you step
forward when his mom died?

641
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,894
I found out she'd
passed months later.

642
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:29,457
By then, Landon was
already in the foster system.

643
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,337
I was figuring out a way to
approach him when he got into trouble,

644
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:38,067
so I brought him to the camp.

645
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:40,843
You need to tell him.

646
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,973
I can't. Not now.

647
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,415
If I die, the only
thing I'll ever be to him

648
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,920
is the hard-ass who made
him run obstacle courses.

649
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:55,293
You apologized to me for
something done in a psychotic state,

650
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,295
but you won't own
up to being his father.

651
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:01,792
What happened to actions have
consequences, a man accepts them?

652
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,233
I'm in his life,
and I am working

653
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,271
to get him on the right path.

654
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,264
He doesn't need
a drill instructor.

655
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,803
He needs a dad.

656
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,346
It's so sweet of
you, coming to this.

657
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,481
Just trying to be supportive.

658
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,958
I heard that's
what boyfriends do.

659
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:33,188
Hi, honey. Hi. Did you have fun?

660
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:34,961
Yeah?

661
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:41,173
Rachel had a great time,
played with everything.

662
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,140
She's a very clever girl.

663
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,374
I'm sorry to ask this,

664
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,746
but we've had some problems
with parents coaching kids.

665
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,414
Rachel caught on to our
toys unusually quickly,

666
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,717
and she even knew the game
was called Feed the Monkey.

667
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,354
Well, as eager as I
am to have her go here,

668
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,328
I promise you, I
would never do that.

669
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,163
Hey, Rachel, have you ever
played Feed the Monkey before?

670
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,704
No, Mama.

671
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,409
She seems so dumb.

672
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:28,480
But when the pressure was on, she
knew what had to be done and she did it.

673
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:31,081
You're pumped
because your kid lied?

674
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,318
She's not my kid.
She's a pain in the ass.

675
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:38,693
And she's a better
liar than you are.

676
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:42,159
You didn't cut your leg
getting into your truck.

677
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:44,099
The abrasion has
dirt and gravel in it,

678
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,869
a bit of fertilizer, too.

679
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,401
I tripped in my greenhouse.

680
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,170
Growing my own organic veggies.

681
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,404
Didn't ask, not gonna tell.

682
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,209
She didn't hesitate.
She didn't oversell.

683
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:02,419
Took me years to learn how to lie
like that. Rachel has it on instinct.

684
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,546
Sounds like you're
real fond of that kid.

685
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,049
You're really not good
with nuance, are you?

686
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,958
I admire her talent.

687
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,693
I'm just gonna numb you up.

688
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,371
I gotta go.

689
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,739
Latest kidney function
test shows no improvement.

690
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,883
Nice stitches. Did they hurt?

691
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:33,983
No, they gave me
a shot of something.

692
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,977
That was lidocaine.

693
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,922
It triggered an underlying genetic
condition called variegate porphyria.

694
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,754
That would explain
their symptoms.

695
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,596
But I didn't have any lidocaine.

696
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,358
But you had a handful
of antihistamines,

697
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,423
courtesy of the
deviant in the next bed.

698
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,592
It's also a porphyria trigger.

699
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:55,137
Wait. So we have the
same genetic thing?

700
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,401
Yeah. Small world.

701
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,306
This is good news. We can
manage the condition with haematin.

702
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,576
Liver transplant could cure it.

703
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,916
Sometimes two patients
share one donated liver.

704
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,659
Would that work for us?

705
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:18,389
Possibly.

706
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,228
We'd have to test your blood,
tissue type, if they match.

707
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,494
Why would they?

708
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,411
Just because we have the
same thing making us sick...

709
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,733
Also...

710
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,407
I'm your father.

711
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,023
I don't believe you.

712
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,026
What, you don't think a
white guy can be a bad father?

713
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,756
Happy to check your DNA,

714
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,265
but do you really think he'd
say he's your dad if he isn't?

715
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,358
It's not like you're a catch.

716
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:07,977
You're evil.

717
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:14,218
Barely recognize you
with your clothes on.

718
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,989
You were at the
wedding with your sister.

719
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,491
Shared a room with her, too.

720
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:25,729
I came by to change my shoes
and found you in my bathroom.

721
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,198
Took you long enough to find me.

722
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,791
Because when someone starts
pranking you, the logical suspect

723
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,428
is the overly protective sister

724
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,835
of a woman you slept with once.

725
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,572
This has nothing
to do with my sister.

726
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,199
Then what does
it have to do with?

727
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:44,882
If you really have no clue,
then you so deserved this.

728
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,715
All that creativity and energy
you put into pranking me,

729
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:50,965
seems like you were
trying to make a point.

730
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:53,754
You really don't want
to tell me what it was?

731
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,026
You're a really big fan
of John Hughes movies.

732
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:01,362
You inexplicably prefer <i>Some
Kind of Wonderful</i> to <i>Sixteen Candles</i>

733
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,094
though that's
probably because...

734
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:06,228
Mary Stuart Masterson looked
hot in those leather gloves.

735
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:10,234
We talked at the reception.
That's why you hate me?

736
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,508
It was fun. It was great.

737
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,173
Until I mentioned that I don't
sleep with guys on the first date,

738
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:20,412
and then you said you had to go to
the bathroom and you never came back.

739
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,711
Actions have consequences.

740
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,520
Do you take vengeance on
every guy who acts like an ass?

741
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:28,958
Could be a full-time job.

742
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,522
When we were talking,
you seemed like a nice guy.

743
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,960
So either you're a great actor or
you're a nice guy who lost his way.

744
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,196
Whatever the reasons,

745
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,900
a little negative reinforcement
seemed to be warranted.

746
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,974
Oh, currently your
password is "great big ho."

747
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,939
Change it back to
anything but "password."

748
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,383
I'm sorry.

749
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,123
Let me prove it to you by
taking you out for dinner,

750
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,154
followed by not
sleeping with you.

751
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:07,892
I'm serious.

752
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,996
Not on your life.

753
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,818
We need to talk.

754
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:39,693
Nothing to say.

755
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,164
Okay.

756
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,801
I'll wait till you're ready.

757
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:56,971
You're my son.

758
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,044
I'm not going anywhere.

759
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:23,232
Wait a minute. What is that?

760
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,673
A doggie. What does it say?

761
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,369
That's right.

762
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,516
Waldenwood called.

763
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,681
They love Rachel
but they have no room.

764
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:40,215
Something about more siblings
than usual. We should apply next year.

765
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,623
She's a smart
kid. She'll be fine.

766
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,066
You mean that?

767
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,472
Yeah, I do.
