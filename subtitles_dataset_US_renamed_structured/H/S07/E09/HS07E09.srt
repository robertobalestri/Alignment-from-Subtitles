1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:04,468
What's the difference
between a sea lion and a seal?

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,595
What's that, baby?

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,972
What's the difference
between a sea lion and a seal?

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,143
Seals tell the truth, but a
sea lion is always lying?

5
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,980
A sea lion has ears.

6
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,676
Yeah, that's right. I forgot.

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,445
I'll show you when
we get to the zoo.

8
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:22,885
Can we have pizza tonight?

9
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,982
I'm not gonna be here, Daisy.

10
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,085
I'm going back on
the road, remember?

11
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,289
You've only been
here for two days.

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,941
I'll be back in three
weeks this time.

13
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,831
Somebody help her!

14
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,193
She's having a seizure!

15
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,976
There's a lady down there.

16
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,511
Daddy, come back! Daddy!

17
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:56,023
Hey, lady. Hey, lady, are
you okay? Come on. Come on.

18
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,354
Hey, wake up! Come
on, get up! Hey...

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,587
Come on.

20
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,389
Help me!

21
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,632
Somebody help me! Come on!

22
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,228
Hurry! Hurry up!

23
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,580
Daddy!

24
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,063
Move the train! Move the train!

25
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,714
Hey, man, are you okay?

26
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,120
Yeah, I think so.

27
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,924
She's epileptic.

28
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,327
Come on, let's get you up.

29
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,328
You all right? Here we go.

30
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,300
Hey, sweetie, I'm okay.

31
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,967
Daddy?

32
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,476
I found this case in the ER.

33
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:07,112
White male, mid-30s, loss of
consciousness, abnormal EKG,

34
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:11,386
and he's the subway hero.

35
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,526
Your enthusiasm is impressive.

36
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,155
Wish I could say the same
about your presentation.

37
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,962
Everybody knows you lead with
your most interesting symptom.

38
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,870
You're right, EKG is more
interesting than loss of consciousness.

39
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,012
So I think we should do...

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,838
God! She's still
talking, make it stop.

41
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,670
House's world view doesn't
include random acts of self-sacrifice.

42
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,315
He's gonna count heroism as a
symptom until proven otherwise.

43
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,214
The guy did a wonderful thing.

44
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,877
Can't we just take
that at face value?

45
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,048
You are adorable.

46
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,819
Heroism does exist.

47
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,868
What about the guy who
landed the plane in the Hudson?

48
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,361
News flash, that guy
was already on the plane.

49
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,406
For all we know he would have
killed everyone else on board

50
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,830
if it increased his chances.

51
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,491
Faced with almost certain death,

52
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,229
a normal person rides the pine.

53
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,359
What about firefighters?

54
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,234
The guys who undergo
months of training

55
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,398
to deny their own instincts
for self-preservation?

56
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,118
And the patient
isn't a firefighter.

57
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,043
He plays a bass in a band.

58
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,375
So humanity is apathetic
and self-serving?

59
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,507
Yeah.

60
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,747
I was mugged once. When I
saw the gun, my legs went out.

61
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,297
I always thought it
was "fight or flight,"

62
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,065
didn't know it was
"fight or flight or faint."

63
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,287
Laugh all you want, the other
100 people stayed on that platform.

64
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,224
That's a normal
response to danger.

65
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,894
The coward has spoken. Our
patient's problem is neurological.

66
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,126
Sympathetic stimulation.

67
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,634
Stress to the brain triggers
a response in the heart.

68
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,699
Go forth and look for masses

69
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,433
in Clark Kent's limbic system.

70
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,688
Seems like you're
getting a bit of attention.

71
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:42,410
Everyone keeps going out of their
way, asking me if I need anything.

72
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,107
It's kind of nice.

73
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,978
So what happened out there?

74
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,885
I don't really remember.

75
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,891
It's just images, like flashes.
I kind of went on autopilot.

76
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,793
My memory doesn't go back into
real time until I was in the ambulance.

77
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,832
I read that's pretty common for
people in life-or-death situations.

78
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,767
Jack. JACK: Honey.

79
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,564
This is my wife Eva.

80
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,662
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.

81
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,933
They're just doing some tests.

82
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,940
How's Daisy?

83
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,339
She's not so good, actually.

84
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,676
She watched her father
jump in front of a train.

85
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,282
She's still shaking,
she can't stop crying.

86
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,683
Why would you do that to her?

87
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,220
He saved a woman's life.

88
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,288
He could have died.

89
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,855
Did you even think
about your family?

90
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,457
<i>I need your advice.</i>

91
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,499
Dinner with your
mom on Thursday...

92
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,026
It's my birthday.

93
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,171
I know. I'm definitely coming.

94
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,805
Wilson's got tickets to the
Hong Kong Film Festival.

95
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,845
Ever since his break-up
he's been a mess.

96
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,622
I haven't been able to
tell him that I'm not going.

97
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,444
So maybe if you
happen to see him,

98
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,677
you can mention
how important this is.

99
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,850
You should go.

100
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,651
What? I can't.
It's your birthday.

101
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:05,129
It's fine. It's sweet that
you care about your friend.

102
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,661
And frankly, as you will
find out sooner or later,

103
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,828
my mother is a handful.

104
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:13,999
Go.

105
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:18,703
I need your advice.
This film festival...

106
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,577
I have had these
tickets for two months.

107
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,877
Yeah, I know. I'm
definitely coming.

108
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,044
Okay.

109
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,756
But Thursday is Cuddy's birthday
and her mom's coming down.

110
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,896
It's a whole dinner thing.

111
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,591
And I thought,
maybe if you see her,

112
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,561
you could mention
how upset you've been...

113
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,729
You have to go.

114
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,059
Your girlfriend's birthday?
It's not even a question.

115
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,431
She has one every year.

116
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,835
How often do you break
up with the love of your life?

117
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,026
Okay, for you, it's more
often than most, but still...

118
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,100
I'm a big boy, I
think I'll survive.

119
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,911
I will definitely
make this up to you.

120
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,535
Hey.

121
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,439
Am I imagining things,

122
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,311
or did I see a billboard with your
face on it on my way home tonight?

123
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,942
Was my whole face there?
'Cause I just saw the nose.

124
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,230
I thought you said they
were taking a picture

125
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,722
of a bunch of doctors together.

126
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,157
They did. I have no idea
how it ended up just me.

127
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,819
Well, you are pretty cute.

128
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,664
You're flirting with me?

129
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,635
Don't see anyone
else in the room.

130
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,642
What?

131
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,178
I don't know.

132
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,906
Things have been a
little tense around here

133
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,849
since that whole
online-boyfriend thing.

134
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,987
Phil's not my boyfriend. I'm
not the one with the problem.

135
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,489
No, you're the one with
feelings for someone else.

136
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,692
You're still my husband,

137
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,764
I still love you,

138
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,599
and I want things to
be okay between us.

139
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,439
Also, you're a famous
model now. That's pretty cool.

140
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,607
Sexy, even.

141
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,816
So I advance through
the carotid bifurcation?

142
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,020
Are you asking?

143
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,562
Yes, I'm asking.

144
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,728
I've only read how to do it, but
practice is different than theory.

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,361
Just tell me how to do it.

146
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,700
You're gonna inject dye just
past the takeoff of the optic artery.

147
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,632
Now?

148
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,868
His BP's going up, the
procedure's stressing his body.

149
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,438
What do I do?

150
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,514
Hold on a minute.

151
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,141
Just give him a chance
to regain equilibrium.

152
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,312
BP's up, heart rate's 180.

153
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,386
What should I do?

154
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,319
Give me the catheter,
get the crash cart.

155
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,053
He's in cardiac arrest.

156
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,023
Maybe your second
time will go better.

157
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,400
So we finally know what Taub
would look like if he were life-size.

158
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,431
Can we go back
to the office now?

159
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,507
You kidding?

160
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,670
We got a differential to
run. Cardiac arrhythmia...

161
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,546
That poster got me laid when I got
home last night, so do your worst.

162
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,550
Arrhythmia proves I was right.

163
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,143
Jack's problem is his
heart, not his brain.

164
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,587
So when you're not on a
billboard you sleep with nurses,

165
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,920
but when you are you
sleep with your wife.

166
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,254
I think you got that backwards.

167
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,850
That's my elbow in the corner.

168
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,226
What's your wife doing later?

169
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,096
Huh. They chose you
and cut out Chase?

170
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:02,897
Apparently, Marketing thinks
my face is the most trustworthy.

171
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,002
For real?

172
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,815
Both of our patient's
cardiac incidents

173
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,808
happened after physical stress.

174
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,366
I'm guessing vasovagal syncope.

175
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,536
Buzzkill.

176
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,856
Vasovagal syncope would
manifest at a much younger age.

177
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Could be drugs.

178
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,007
Tox screen was clean.

179
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,278
What about autonomic
nervous system dysfunction?

180
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,410
Could cause
arrhythmia and fainting.

181
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:30,725
Inappropriate? I mean
because of the Jew thing?

182
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,799
Autonomic nervous
system dysfunction. I like it.

183
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,597
Let's biopsy his
pituitary gland.

184
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,672
Adrenal venous sampling
makes more sense,

185
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,707
and it is a less
invasive procedure.

186
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,376
Which you don't care about because
you just want to check the pituitary

187
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,744
because you still think there's
something wrong with the guy's brain?

188
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,272
Can't fool you.

189
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,647
He has no other symptoms
for pituitary disease.

190
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,379
We can't stick a
needle in his brain

191
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,730
because you don't
believe in heroism.

192
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,086
Fine, do it your way.

193
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,126
You'll waste half a day, but I'm
sure he's in no hurry to get better.

194
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,820
The autonomic nervous system
controls involuntary actions,

195
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,954
like your heartbeat.

196
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,727
If we're right, it's
manageable, but will progress.

197
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,235
Do you think we
could consult with him?

198
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,636
I didn't know you knew Dr. Taub.

199
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,768
I don't.

200
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,406
You saw the ads.

201
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,415
Look, no offense, but
you were wrong yesterday.

202
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,293
And they wouldn't have made
him the face of the hospital

203
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,751
if he weren't
really good, right?

204
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,093
Dr. Taub.

205
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,933
The patient would
like to see you.

206
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,599
How can I help?

207
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,830
I forgot, you guys talk.

208
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,867
Look, no offense
to either of you,

209
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,997
but dinner with your
mom? Come on.

210
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,474
I'd have to act like a
decent human being.

211
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,204
You know what a
strain that puts on me.

212
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,805
And, you,

213
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,156
ever since you
broke up with Sam,

214
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,739
you've done nothing
but mope and whine.

215
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,214
It's an unbelievable bummer.

216
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,751
And just what is so exciting

217
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,050
you have to blow
off both of us to do it?

218
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,893
I just want to sit on my couch
in my underwear, drink scotch,

219
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,896
and watch <i>The Real
Housewives of New Jersey.</i>

220
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,262
By myself. I just
want one night off.

221
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,595
Is that so much to ask?

222
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,896
Yes. Yes.

223
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,504
You have to choose one of us.

224
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:55,933
I choose Wilson.

225
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:01,408
Good, because he's
coming to my birthday dinner.

226
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,243
I do not whine.

227
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,052
Jack's not exactly
the hero-type.

228
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,758
He started this band in college.

229
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,930
They gig around the country,
looking for their big break.

230
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,802
It's been 16 years.

231
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,363
That must be hard
on you and Daisy.

232
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,705
It's like I'm a single parent.

233
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,708
I love him so much,

234
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,644
but I'm at the end of my rope.

235
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,755
What Jack did yesterday
was so incredible,

236
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:51,059
our boss assumed his illness had
something to do with his behavior.

237
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,429
But if that's not the case,

238
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,994
there's more to
him than you think.

239
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,471
You think Taub
really comes across

240
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,604
as the most
trustworthy doctor here?

241
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,644
I knew it was bugging you.

242
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,143
They cut me out.

243
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,311
You're a pretty boy.

244
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,463
Works well with the ladies,

245
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,597
not so much with the patients.

246
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,284
No one wants an underwear
model performing their splenectomy.

247
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,469
I notice they weren't exactly
knocking down your door

248
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,603
looking for Dr. Trustworthy.

249
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,627
That's 'cause I'm black.

250
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,593
Cortisol levels look
normal. We were wrong.

251
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,635
Which House will
interpret as him being right.

252
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,731
He's gonna make us
biopsy the pituitary gland.

253
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:39,572
You seem pretty calm for a
guy who's surrounded by racists.

254
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,347
80% of the Princeton
population is white.

255
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,781
Some are racist, some aren't.

256
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,342
White works with
both demographics.

257
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,852
So race is your excuse,

258
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,479
not the fact that
you usually look like

259
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,956
you're about to punch
someone in the face?

260
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,523
We're good.

261
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,188
O2 sats are dropping.

262
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,694
He's not breathing. Suction.

263
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,338
Sats are coming back.

264
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,036
Mucus plug. That's weird.

265
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,640
Fluid in the lungs.

266
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:18,717
Pneumonitis?

267
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,111
That doesn't fit
with anyone's theory.

268
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,158
Our tests finally
rule out the brain.

269
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,390
That leaves the
heart and the lungs.

270
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,330
Pneumonitis can be
caused by bacteria,

271
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,425
parasite, some
kind of obstruction...

272
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,163
Who was the girl on the tracks?

273
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:41,139
News story said her name's Chloe
Jefferies. Why does that matter?

274
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,051
'Cause there's another
reason besides being sick

275
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,135
that he'd risk his
life for a stranger.

276
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,406
She's not a stranger.

277
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,046
The damsel in
distress is an epileptic,

278
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,519
so we assumed she was
having an epileptic seizure.

279
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,520
But what if she wasn't.
What if she's sick, too?

280
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,715
Jack is away a lot, on tour.

281
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,503
What happens on the
road stays on the road.

282
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,925
The most likely cause of
pneumonitis is infection.

283
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,858
Shouldn't we be
getting a sputum culture?

284
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,249
There's no significant elevation
in white blood cell count.

285
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,611
This is more like
toxic exposure.

286
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,706
He's got a point.

287
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,429
Why is your
assumption of his guilt

288
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,527
more valid than my
assumption of his selflessness?

289
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:16,770
Because my assumption is backed
up by millions of men, and Taub,

290
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,737
who've cheated on their wives.

291
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,212
Find the girl and the love nest.

292
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,273
Every hero has his Kryptonite.

293
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,179
Hello?

294
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,698
So we're breaking
into this girl's apartment

295
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,122
because House
thinks that two people

296
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:34,786
standing 30 feet apart on a
subway platform have to be lovers.

297
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,590
God, you're a drag today.

298
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,892
Let me guess. You're back
to fighting with the wife?

299
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,058
No.

300
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:44,228
We had sex again last night,
twice. And again this morning.

301
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:45,928
Oh.

302
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:52,375
Rachel hasn't wanted this
much intimacy in a long time.

303
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:56,109
I don't think it's me she's
hot for, it's this Internet guy.

304
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:00,418
She's just happy and
that's turning her on.

305
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,318
So she's not cheating on you

306
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,890
and you're getting all
the action you can handle.

307
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,457
I don't see the downside.

308
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,055
What was Jack's band called?

309
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,599
Suicide something.

310
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,363
Suicide Season.
She does know him.

311
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,495
Question is, how'd
they get sick?

312
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,838
Kryptonite.

313
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:30,080
EKG's unremarkable. Thyroid,
liver and kidney function seems fine.

314
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,683
You're perfectly healthy.

315
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,810
I wish that you would
take a second look.

316
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,152
I'm tired all the time
and when it's cold,

317
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,283
I get this weird
pain in my shoulder.

318
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,553
I have a pain in my leg,

319
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,254
you don't hear me complaining.

320
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,461
Except for just now.

321
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:50,128
How do doctors get this idea
you're better than everyone else?

322
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,767
Probably all that pulling people
back from the brink of death.

323
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,764
It's just a guess.

324
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,004
My own daughter's a doctor.

325
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,603
She makes a hobby of
dismissing my concerns.

326
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,944
She sounds smart.

327
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,508
Did she tell you to say that?

328
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,781
I've never met your daughter.

329
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,347
That's hard to believe, since
you're currently shtupping her.

330
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,175
We have a situation.

331
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,040
Roach bombs, where?

332
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,346
In Chloe's apartment.

333
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,852
Who's Chloe?

334
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,718
Look, we don't care
about your personal life,

335
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,867
we're not gonna
tell your wife...

336
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,520
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

337
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,788
Guess who showed
up looking for Jack.

338
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,923
Hey.

339
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,059
Hi. JACK: Are you okay?

340
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,329
The EMT said you'd
gone to another hospital.

341
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,429
They held me
overnight for observation,

342
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,838
I'm fine. I had to
come here to...

343
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,438
I don't know why you
did it, but thank you.

344
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,244
You're welcome.

345
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,821
I should have brought
flowers, or something.

346
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,085
You're like my guardian angel.

347
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,888
No, I'm just a guy in a band.

348
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,226
Maybe you've heard of
them? Suicide Season.

349
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,959
One of my nurses gave me the CD.

350
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,065
I haven't had a
chance to listen to it yet,

351
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:32,469
but I have a feeling I'm
going to be your biggest fan.

352
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,638
I'm gonna need you to cough.

353
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,575
What are you doing?

354
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,111
Getting a sputum culture.

355
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,147
They obviously don't know each
other, so it's not toxic exposure.

356
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,911
Just leaves my
theory, infection.

357
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,950
If you could just cough up a
sample, we can test for pathogens.

358
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,759
Sorry. Sorry. There's nothing...
There's nothing coming up.

359
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,922
Well, maybe I can help you.

360
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,132
It hurts! CHLOE:
What's the matter?

361
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,840
Round, equal, reactive
to light, it's not a stroke.

362
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:12,942
No, it's not my
head, it's my ears.

363
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,686
"When I saw her
lying there I thought,

364
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,882
"" I can't just stand
here and let her die.

365
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,450
""She has her
whole life to live.""

366
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,089
He didn't jump because he was
sick or because he knew that girl.

367
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,655
Even you have to admit that now.

368
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,463
Yes, but that doesn't make him
a hero, it just makes him an idiot.

369
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,046
The only reason that
headline doesn't say

370
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,005
"Moron crushed
by train" is luck.

371
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,008
Next headline is gonna be
"Moron goes undiagnosed

372
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,442
"because doctors won't
talk about his ear pain."

373
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,139
Ear pain fits with my theory.

374
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,011
Jack has an infection
that spread to his mastoid.

375
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,660
Great, we'll confirm
that in a week

376
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,516
when your secret
cultures have sprouted.

377
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,619
Am I in trouble?

378
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,451
I only get mad when
you waste my time,

379
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,320
I couldn't care
less about yours.

380
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,435
But let me know when they come
back negative and I'll mock you.

381
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,927
You have a better idea? - No.

382
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,123
So I'm gonna pick one at
random. Acoustic neuroma?

383
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,029
A tumor in the ear. Makes sense.

384
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,678
And if it's putting pressure on
the breathing centers in his brain,

385
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:10,726
it explains the lungs.

386
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,523
The lungs explain the heart.

387
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,603
Evoked auditory potential test.

388
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,174
This counts as my time.

389
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:20,806
You guys got this?

390
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,042
I have been going out of my way

391
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:30,146
to be nice to old Jewish
ladies for months now,

392
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,521
on the off chance one of
them could be your mom.

393
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,321
You couldn't have
mentioned she's a shiksa?

394
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,626
She converted when
she married my dad.

395
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,959
You see, now is too late.

396
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,522
I'm not blaming you for this.

397
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,878
She's the one who ambushed
you to find out what you were like

398
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,302
because "I never
tell her anything."

399
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,091
I'd have to agree
with her on that one.

400
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,308
Anyway, I obviously
can't come to dinner now.

401
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,400
Obviously?

402
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,808
She's crazy and she hates me.

403
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:54,903
House,

404
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,480
I need you to come to
that dinner for two hours,

405
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,986
keep your mouth shut
and behave like an adult.

406
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,713
Yes, you will be in hell,

407
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,150
but I will feel better
having you there.

408
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,557
That is what a relationship is.

409
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,229
We average our misery.

410
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,662
That was

411
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,038
unexpected.

412
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:21,939
I'm having a good day.

413
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,019
I finally resolved that
thing with my sister.

414
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,043
What thing?

415
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,740
We had the worst fight over whether
it's time to put Dad in that facility.

416
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,573
I've been sick
over it for weeks.

417
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,050
You never mentioned
anything about your sister.

418
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,766
I actually talked a
lot about it with Phil.

419
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,155
I should be getting back.

420
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:47,365
It's fine now. It's no big deal.

421
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,061
Are you in love with him?

422
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,333
I've never met him.

423
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,056
Waves one and three
normal at 70 decibels.

424
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,926
It's been 37 minutes
and everything is normal.

425
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,064
House was wrong again,
he doesn't have a tumor.

426
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,226
House doesn't usually accept
"we gave up halfway" as an answer.

427
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:28,638
If I could get fluid closer
to the sources of infection,

428
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,109
I could get better
cultures, prove my theory.

429
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:35,375
I'm gonna set up for an ear
drainage and a thoracentesis.

430
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,380
I'll only be wasting my time.

431
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:46,419
She's a student.
Somebody's got to go with her.

432
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,624
I saved that girl. I did that.

433
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,302
I'm really proud of you.

434
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,901
This whole thing
has made me wonder

435
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,308
if things could be different.

436
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,179
I have spent so much
time away from you.

437
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,547
Yeah, well. You love your music.

438
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,085
But it's not just that.

439
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,146
I think that I have been

440
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,514
afraid.

441
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:24,319
That I would screw things up,

442
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,933
that I couldn't be the man you
and Daisy needed me to be.

443
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,869
But maybe I'm better than that.

444
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:34,998
Hmm?

445
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,675
I am going to quit the band.

446
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,717
I think we'd like that.

447
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:52,481
Uh-oh.

448
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,536
- Hey, how's the ear pain?
- It's better with the drugs,

449
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,324
but it still really hurts.

450
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:59,763
We are going to take some fluid
samples from your ear and your lung.

451
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:03,428
Can you get up? Lean
forward. Lean on this.

452
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,132
Okay, this is Lidocaine.
It'll numb you up.

453
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,572
Okay.

454
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,614
This is weird.

455
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,152
What's the matter?

456
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,646
The pain in my ear is gone.

457
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,789
Gone? Completely?

458
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,624
Yeah. When you
stuck me in the back.

459
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,531
What does that mean?

460
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,840
Okay. I'm just
cutting that for you.

461
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,384
Is she going to
eat anything else,

462
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,684
or just the cheese and crackers?

463
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,322
She's going through a
picky phase, it won't kill her.

464
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,319
You're her mother.

465
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,597
All I know is, when you and
your sister were growing up

466
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,498
you ate what we ate, no excuses.

467
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,666
Would you pass the salt?

468
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,943
She had eggs this
morning and lots of fruit.

469
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,145
Ah! That explains it.

470
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,219
Explains what?

471
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,290
She was a little <i>vilder chaiah</i>
at the park this afternoon.

472
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,484
She wouldn't listen
to anything I said.

473
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,891
Must have been all the sugar.

474
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,293
Actually, the whole

475
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:39,454
sugar-makes-kids-hyperactive
thing is a myth.

476
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,824
It's a study.

477
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,900
I'm sure it's very interesting.

478
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:49,566
I didn't read any studies,
I just raised children.

479
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,812
It's not your fault.

480
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,925
How are you supposed to keep
up with what she eats all day?

481
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,042
You're never home.

482
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,814
I'm sorry, I have to get this.

483
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,457
Tell me you need me.

484
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:11,827
Jack doesn't have cancer.

485
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,627
God, that's awful.
I'll be right in.

486
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,678
<i>Masters stuck him in the back with
Lidocaine and his ear pain went away.</i>

487
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:17,812
<i>We don't need you here,</i>

488
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,876
we just need to figure out why this
guy's body thinks his ear is on his back.

489
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,242
'Cause his ear used
to be something else.

490
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,642
<i>When you're a fetus, your
cells are close together,</i>

491
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,840
<i>when you grow, they
spread out and specialize.</i>

492
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:32,180
<i>Sometimes the body screws up
and they keep the old area codes,</i>

493
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,742
<i>still report to the
same pain centers.</i>

494
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,912
Referred pain.

495
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,852
<i>Looks and brains.</i>

496
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,229
When you stuck him in the back,

497
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,054
you cut off communication with
the pain centers in his spinal cord.

498
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,972
So we just need to figure out where
the message is actually coming from.

499
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,191
What about his thyroid?

500
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:47,842
Hyperthyroidism would
explain all his symptoms.

501
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:48,993
<i>Or it could be his liver.</i>

502
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,211
<i>Good. We'll take a look at both.</i>

503
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,101
<i>For the record,
referred pain does not</i>

504
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,731
<i>rule out infection.
If it's spreading...</i>

505
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,984
Were you like this when you
were working for your math degree?

506
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,499
<i>If Euclid had been
a guest lecturer,</i>

507
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,387
would you have been the kid
sitting in the front row going,

508
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,556
"Actually, you haven't proven
the Pythagorean theorem."

509
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,173
Hello?

510
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,852
All right.

511
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:10,588
Mom?

512
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:11,885
Thank you, sweetie.

513
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:21,431
So say you two got married,
would you convert to Judaism?

514
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,600
We haven't gotten that far, Mom.

515
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,064
That's actually a really
interesting question.

516
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,267
I'm an atheist.

517
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:33,278
Honey, half the Jews
I know are atheists.

518
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,903
It's about community.

519
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,415
House isn't that
big on community.

520
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,883
And why do you call him House?

521
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:43,912
The man's name is Greg. It
makes it seem like you're not serious.

522
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,320
I'm just trying to help
you think about the future.

523
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,826
You're a certain age now.

524
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:52,023
The parade of boyfriends
can't be as amusing as it was.

525
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,657
You need to settle
down, like your sister.

526
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,928
Settling down isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

527
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:00,495
Next week is Sam's birthday and I
was gonna take her to the Poconos.

528
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,977
That's very sad.

529
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,471
Perhaps not the best choice
of topic for a festive occasion.

530
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,578
I just don't want Rachel
growing up thinking you're a slut.

531
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:17,280
Okay. I got this.
First of all, Mom...

532
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,786
Oh, my God.

533
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:35,236
Did you sedate my mother?

534
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,603
It kicked in just in time.

535
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,612
She'll wake up in a couple
of hours, be good as new.

536
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,115
Think of it as my
birthday gift to you.

537
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,810
You told me to
keep my mouth shut.

538
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,326
This was the only
way I had a chance.

539
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,919
Leaving aside the fact
that House is a sociopath,

540
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,758
I have to admit that
I'm honestly relieved.

541
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,822
Your mom is quite a handful.

542
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,357
What? I feel...

543
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,762
You've got to be
kidding me. You drug...

544
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,033
Sorry. I honestly
thought you'd be worse.

545
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,146
That was my gift to myself.

546
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,654
I take it Jack's thyroid
levels are normal.

547
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,124
Foreman is doing
a liver biopsy now.

548
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,193
Good.

549
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,757
What's up with you?

550
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,128
Nothing. I'm peachy.

551
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,361
It's hard when you feel
like you've been replaced.

552
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,134
We got a new puppy once,

553
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:46,506
and our old cocker spaniel
just moped for weeks.

554
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,338
Have you even had sex?

555
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,459
We're not talking about
me, we're talking about you.

556
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,612
No, you're talking about
puppies, and I'm not listening.

557
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,384
She wants to do it all the time,

558
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,624
but it has nothing
to do with me.

559
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,993
I'm just a piece of meat.

560
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:08,130
Well, she likes someone else,

561
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,499
and you've slept
with other people.

562
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:11,769
Uh...

563
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,002
Why are you still together?

564
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,207
I love her.

565
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,643
We've been
together for 22 years.

566
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,239
I've never loved anybody else.

567
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:27,581
I don't know how
to not be with her.

568
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,023
So you're never
gonna cheat again.

569
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,353
I don't know.

570
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,217
That seems kind
of selfish, doesn't it?

571
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,903
Foreman found diffuse
inflammation in Jack's liver.

572
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,409
Looks like autoimmune hepatitis.

573
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,377
He's starting him on steroids.

574
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,396
Isn't this nice?

575
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,832
What's this note? Does
that sound like an A?

576
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,570
Remember if I put
my finger like this

577
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:27,203
without this do-hickey
on it, it's an F.

578
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,279
Hmm?

579
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:29,747
Hmm.

580
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,482
Can we read a book instead?

581
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,449
Yes, we...

582
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,356
Jack? Jack!

583
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,423
Help him!

584
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,084
Come on. Come on.

585
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,026
Okay. Okay.

586
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,127
He seized three
times last night.

587
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,536
We got him
stabilized, but barely.

588
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,472
If there was nothing wrong with
his brain before, there sure is now.

589
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,306
Any particular reason we
need to be looking at the patient?

590
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,709
Yes.

591
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,442
Cuddy's mom is in my
office. And she looks mad.

592
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,348
What did you do?

593
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,717
Our patient also developed
a raging fever overnight.

594
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,381
That means Masters was right
all along. This is an infection.

595
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,768
Should we give you
a minute to gloat?

596
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,488
We still don't know
what kind of infection.

597
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,189
It could be bacterial, viral,
fungal. Until the cultures...

598
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,889
You are the worst gloater ever.

599
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,694
Her starting those
cultures when she did

600
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,632
means we're 24 hours
closer to the answer.

601
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,146
"We're sorry your
husband croaked,

602
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,004
"but at least we were 24
hours closer to the answer."

603
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:30,065
Let's narrow it down, shall we?

604
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,937
Four days ago the guy was
face-down in the subway.

605
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,072
God only knows
what's in that sludge.

606
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,879
Toxic fumes make him pass
out. Rat pee does the rest.

607
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,921
If it's leptospirosis, it's the
fastest-moving case in history.

608
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,513
Leptospirosis can
turn into meningitis.

609
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,422
I can't confirm any of this yet.

610
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,586
We don't have time
to choose wrong.

611
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,329
It fits,

612
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:56,233
and since it's the only idea
on the table, I say it's a winner.

613
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,361
Start him on
doxycycline. No, wait.

614
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,070
I'll do it.

615
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,840
You guys have to go back to the
office, tell me when <i>bubbie's</i> gone.

616
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,020
You a doctor?

617
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,121
Sure.

618
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,594
You're on new meds.
Go back to sleep.

619
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,202
Am I gonna die?

620
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,272
I hope not.

621
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,869
'Cause then I'd have
to go back to my office.

622
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,544
Of course, if you do kick it,

623
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:45,073
then you get to be famous for
another two, maybe three weeks.

624
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,448
They're saying I'm a hero.

625
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,385
Yeah, but, you
know, in a few days

626
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,447
a panda bear will give birth
to triplets and we'll all move on.

627
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,594
Oh, I'm sorry. You actually
believe that you are a hero.

628
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:59,160
You should get yourself
some tights and a cape

629
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,428
and you can run around Gotham
pulling babies out of burning buildings.

630
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,332
Maybe you'll keep getting lucky.

631
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,766
You're still the same
guy you were last week.

632
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,344
Hey, how long are
you gonna sit there?

633
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,814
Could be hours.

634
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,915
Hiding behind a
sick guy, that's heroic.

635
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,008
Look, I can explain.

636
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,451
Sometimes I mix
up my medication...

637
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,487
I don't need you
to explain anything.

638
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,545
I think we both know

639
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,851
that I owe you an apology.

640
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,120
Say what?

641
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,858
I don't even remember
going to bed last night.

642
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:09,491
I must have had
too much to drink.

643
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,033
I do know I can be difficult.

644
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,163
You were a little bitchy.

645
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,071
In the clinic, you were
a complete <i>schmendrick.</i>

646
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,803
But once you knew I was Lisa's
mother, you held your tongue.

647
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,578
That's because you love her.

648
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:30,355
I still think you're a pain in
the ass with a God complex,

649
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,914
and I'll kill you
if you hurt her.

650
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,383
But I'm glad she has you.

651
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,042
We don't have to hug now, do we?

652
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,196
What do you think?

653
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,830
I've got a train to catch.

654
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,047
I thought you were
staying till Sunday.

655
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,063
I'm coming down with a cold.

656
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:50,506
Every time I stay
with Lisa or her sister,

657
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,044
one of those
rugrats gets me sick.

658
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,778
Children are awful.

659
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,356
Did she have a rash recently?

660
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,763
No. What's going on?

661
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,165
Feverish, itchy?

662
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,235
No.

663
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,535
What's she doing here, anyway?

664
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,454
It's the middle of the morning.
Shouldn't she be in school?

665
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,788
I'm keeping her
out for a few days.

666
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:28,889
There's been a
little outbreak of...

667
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,913
Chicken pox.

668
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,927
Sorry, but if I'd let you
finish that sentence,

669
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,591
that would have been
much less impressive.

670
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,144
Chicken pox is
no big deal for kids,

671
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:42,091
but it's a terrible, horrible, no
good, very bad deal for grownups.

672
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,752
You think Jack has chicken pox?

673
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,594
But he doesn't have blisters, he's
not itchy. And Daisy never got it.

674
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,829
I know. Again, that's why it's
so impressive that I figured it out.

675
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,598
5% of cases present
without blisters.

676
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,001
The kid was just a carrier.

677
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,133
I'm gonna start you on
anti-varicella gamma globulin,

678
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,337
which will save your life.

679
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,245
But it won't make me a hero.

680
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,999
Hey. How are you feeling?

681
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,194
Like I'm not gonna die.

682
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,139
I can't wait to take you home.

683
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,707
The guys called.

684
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:38,211
All this press has got
us a couple new gigs.

685
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,219
Just a few more dates.
Three weeks tops.

686
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,618
But you said...

687
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,688
I know. I know.

688
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,864
Three weeks isn't so bad.

689
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,642
It's not three weeks.

690
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,811
This is what he's always
done. Just one more tour.

691
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,715
I'm sorry.

692
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:15,419
The pathetic thing is, I let myself
believe that he could change,

693
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,716
he could be this other guy.

694
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,323
There's nothing worse
than loving someone

695
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,918
who's never gonna
stop disappointing you.

696
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,910
Culture confirmed Jack
does have chicken pox.

697
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,338
It just took six hours longer.

698
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,438
Autopsy works, too.

699
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,575
FYI, it turns out
your hero is a loser.

700
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:47,845
He's going back on the road.

701
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:49,887
He still risked his
life for that woman.

702
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,616
That was impulse. It was easy.

703
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,749
Dealing with family is hard.

704
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,860
Wait, that's another
thing I got right.

705
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:58,386
How many does that make?

706
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,930
And how many for you?

707
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,135
I'm also kicking
your ass at gloating.

708
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,435
Hey. Hi.

709
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:18,615
I think we should get a divorce.

710
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:26,616
You have feelings for
him, and I can't handle that.

711
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:34,258
But it's my fault you
needed someone else.

712
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:35,732
I keep hurting you.

713
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,166
We love each other.

714
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,259
I know.

715
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,972
But are you happy?

716
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,300
No.

717
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,638
Then what are we doing?

718
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:03,420
You know, you turned out
remarkably close to normal,

719
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,622
considering the genes in play.

720
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:06,756
Thanks.

721
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,333
Here. In case your
mom comes back.

722
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:12,793
Happy birthday.

723
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,634
You are a sweet, sweet man.

724
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:20,709
You coming over?

725
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:21,837
Yes.

726
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,509
Oh, no, I can't.

727
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,051
Wilson?

728
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,452
It's bowling night.

729
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,649
He'd never
forgive me if I don't.

730
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:35,887
No, screw it, I'm coming.

731
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,189
No, no, no.

732
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:39,730
I am not gonna be
responsible for that.

733
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,562
You drugged the man,
you go bowling with him.

734
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,468
But my chances for sex are
considerably lower with Wilson.

735
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:50,231
Fine.

736
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,513
Hey. You ready?

737
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,377
Here's the thing...

738
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:00,454
<i>Well, it's about me, too,</i>

739
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:01,969
<i>and I have my boundaries, Dina.</i>

740
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,948
<i>And they're clearly being crossed
by you and your entire family,</i>

741
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,027
<i>making hate pages...</i> WOMAN 2:
<i>That's not true. That has nothing to do...</i>

742
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,747
<i>We all need improvements, Dina,</i>

743
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,564
<i>and I've formed
my opinion on you.</i>

744
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,533
<i>- No, don't shush me, Dina.
- No, I will shush you</i>

745
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:14,423
<i>because you're
not letting me finish.</i>
