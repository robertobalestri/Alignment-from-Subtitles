1
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,081
If you're going to dress
like an Italian hooker,

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,214
at least let it be this
year's Italian hooker.

3
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,981
She's not telling
us we look fat.

4
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,093
It's a major breakthrough.

5
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,521
If you didn't want
to be insulted,

6
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,989
you wouldn't have invited me.

7
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,715
Would anyone like
some champagne?

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,454
No. Yes. Three glasses, please.

9
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,120
Mom. It's not even lunch.

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,461
If you'd prefer, I'll
make it a mimosa.

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,799
What do you think?

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,426
Perfect for a night on the town.

13
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:38,462
Perfect for breastfeeding.

14
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,612
My heart's doing
that weird thing again.

15
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,807
Beating? That's
normal for humans.

16
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,614
Come on, Lisa. Take
her seriously for once.

17
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,495
What? What is it?

18
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,292
I think we need to
get you to the hospital.

19
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:28,513
Is no one gonna tell me

20
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,436
why we're in the morgue?

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,826
House is on the
lam from someone.

22
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,135
Taub's got his money on Wilson,

23
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,340
but I'm pretty sure it's Cuddy.

24
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,198
Fool's bet. There's a whole
world of angry patients, creditors...

25
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:46,896
She needs a doctor.

26
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,739
Yes, just not me.

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,303
Your mom is a 65-year-old
woman with high blood pressure.

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,660
What about the
macrocytic anemia?

29
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,344
Borderline, which is the
lab equivalent of imaginary,

30
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,148
which, by the way, matches
the rest of her medical history.

31
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,418
You really think she's psyching
herself into atrial fibrillation?

32
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,185
So get her a cardiologist.

33
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,894
You don't want me involved.
You don't want you involved.

34
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,540
You know all that ethics stuff
that I don't give a crap about?

35
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:11,657
It suddenly makes sense.

36
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,109
If you're emotionally invested,

37
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,931
you cannot make
rational decisions.

38
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,271
You know this
would be a disaster.

39
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,273
This is my mother.

40
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,004
Treadmill test went well.

41
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,877
No chest discomfort or ischemia.

42
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,442
The abnormal rhythm
will probably resolve itself,

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,883
and if not, a daily pill
will keep it under control.

44
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,387
I will follow up later today.

45
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,446
Is it connected to
my other symptoms?

46
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,386
Which other symptoms, Mom?

47
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,024
Not her fault.

48
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,896
This Dean of Medicine stuff,
very impressive at parties,

49
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,561
but she's forgotten
how to be a real doctor.

50
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,534
It's all in my file.

51
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,799
There are 15 years of
clinic visits in this file.

52
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,002
I don't want to be a bother,

53
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,943
but isn't this what
you do for a living?

54
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,079
So, we're looking for a disease

55
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,883
that can last a
decade and a half,

56
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,116
causes constipation,
diarrhea, flu, colds,

57
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,626
dizziness, rashes,
back and joint pain,

58
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,162
heart feeling "weird",

59
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,691
kishkes feeling "wobbly".

60
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,364
One actual hip replacement.

61
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,464
And which has eluded
detection by years

62
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,061
of blood work, X-rays and MRIs.

63
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,129
Well, one thing
does pop to mind.

64
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,971
We'll monitor you. And
we'll give you a thyroid test.

65
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,807
And House's team will do a home
search for environmental toxins.

66
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:37,307
He seems to know his stuff. How
come he can't afford a coat that fits?

67
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,164
No radon, no mold,
no lead in the pipes.

68
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,188
Yeah, yeah, great.

69
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,933
Have you seen Cuddy's
high school yearbook?

70
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,868
Okay, that is clearly not
related to the case, so...

71
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,019
There is no case.

72
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,220
Cuddy won't let House
see the yearbook,

73
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,958
so he figures there's
something to hide.

74
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,223
Any guesses?

75
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,791
It's clearly related to
being a giant teenage dork.

76
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,729
So you thought I'd
have some insights?

77
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,207
Oh, no, no, I didn't
mean that. Relax.

78
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,239
I was crowned Homecoming Geek.

79
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,312
I'm sure you can relate.

80
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,216
Because you knew some dorks?

81
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,842
I was the class president
and head boy at...

82
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,186
Ah!

83
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,085
Is that Cuddy's mom?

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,594
Certain parts of her.

85
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,724
And certain parts of some
muscular Hispanic gentleman.

86
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,199
Should we consider STDs?

87
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,237
I think I just caught one
looking at these photos.

88
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,764
What does "azarcon" mean?

89
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,538
It means we might
have an actual case.

90
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,046
Mexican herbal medication
for stomach problems,

91
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,912
but only in the sense
that lead chromate

92
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,713
is an herb and
poison is a medication.

93
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,581
I'll start a chelation
IV. Thank you so much.

94
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,048
Wasn't too much
of a disaster, was it?

95
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:55,225
You know, it's not the only
thing they found in her home.

96
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,588
Not my yearbook.

97
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,157
Nope.

98
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,360
Just some stuff that
could cause severe

99
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,596
nausea and permanent
erectile dysfunction.

100
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,963
And which proves that
your mom is doing the help.

101
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,241
According to her diary, it's
some contractor named Jesus.

102
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,848
Which, granted, was
originally a Jewish name, but...

103
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,780
Go, Mom.

104
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,128
So, why were you taking
a Mexican folk remedy?

105
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,266
A friend uses it. A friend.

106
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,935
Mom, just for medical reasons,
you should have told me.

107
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,735
If you're sexually
active... At my age,

108
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,299
he's more the active one.

109
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,668
Mom's having a fling.

110
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,380
I know. You do?

111
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,278
She's been giving me lousy
advice about it for five years.

112
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,352
I have physical needs.

113
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,479
He's a married man, Mom.

114
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,547
She doesn't want sex with him,
I do want to have sex with him.

115
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,716
Tell me who's being hurt.

116
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,885
Hold on. Five years?

117
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,274
Why didn't you tell me about it?

118
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,797
I don't know.

119
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,356
We don't have that
kind of relationship.

120
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,131
Does that really surprise you?

121
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,137
You're not ready?

122
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,477
You said you had two
guys helping you move.

123
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:22,846
They couldn't get out of work.

124
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,476
I'm trying to economize.

125
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,654
And this hotel is cheaper.

126
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,012
Hi.

127
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,580
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,215
I just wanted to
drop off some mail

129
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,590
and talk to you about something.

130
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,760
Of course.

131
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,196
Rache.

132
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,775
Chris, that's not why...

133
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,741
We got to move on.

134
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,709
And what does that
mean? Have you moved on?

135
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,688
With who? Is it Phil?

136
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,035
I don't want to talk about this.

137
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,360
I know that you're
worried about money, so...

138
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,691
You're trying to change
the subject. Yeah.

139
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,161
Which you could
have gleaned from,

140
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,028
"I don't want to
talk about this."

141
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,497
I got you a tryout
to be a part-time

142
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,560
medical consultant on law suits.

143
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,129
Wait. With your brother?

144
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,410
Have you completely
forgotten the last time I saw him?

145
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,604
Yeah, that was five years ago.

146
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,189
Jamie had just found
out that you'd been

147
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,079
cheating on me with
your partner's daughter.

148
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,617
It's a little over-reaction...

149
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,743
He broke my nose
and then called me

150
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,311
the most horrible
person that he's ever met.

151
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,093
He shouldn't have
broken your nose.

152
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,076
You know, texts,
calls and e-mails

153
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,643
all go to the same magic device
these days, only got to send one.

154
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,349
Then it's even weirder it took
you so long to get down here.

155
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,421
Yeah, it's a crazy mystery. It's
not like I got a department to run.

156
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,923
This other magic
device tells me that

157
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,800
lead poisoning wouldn't
cause all my symptoms.

158
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,274
True. But it could cause
the 5% that are real.

159
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,869
You think I'm a hypochondriac?

160
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,122
Well, let me answer this way.

161
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,605
Maybe you're imagining that I
think you're a hypochondriac.

162
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,143
Look, my hand just
started to shake.

163
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:44,447
It's a side effect of these
arthritis pills. Read the label.

164
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,889
I did. When I was typing it up.

165
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,157
Right before I slapped it
on a bottle of sugar pills.

166
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:56,193
You printed a fake label just
to prove I'm a hypochondriac?

167
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,797
Did it work?

168
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,305
It got you fired, you schmuck.

169
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,206
An hour to convince her
to go with Dr. Kaufman,

170
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,806
and only then because
he runs internal medicine.

171
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,557
She wanted to leave
the hospital entirely.

172
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,849
My God, a woman getting
better wants to leave the hospital.

173
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,762
If she's getting better, it's not
because you made her feel like a fool.

174
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:19,986
It couldn't be more because.

175
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,738
If I hadn't, she'd have diagnosed
herself with six new forms of cancers.

176
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,821
She'd never leave.

177
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,028
It's hard enough dealing with
my mom being sick. This juvenile...

178
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,230
Yeah. DR. KAUFMAN: <i>Lisa.</i>

179
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,533
It's gonna be okay,
but she's in A-fib at 170.

180
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,665
<i>Oh, God.</i>

181
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,752
<i>I think we should cardiovert
while she's unsedated.</i>

182
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,768
I'll be right there.

183
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,411
A-fib's at 170.

184
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,412
Wait. I'm sorry she's sick.

185
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,725
I'm not sorry I'm off the case.

186
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,016
You're not off the case.

187
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,733
You don't think you
can convince her...

188
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,453
No, no. You are staying on.

189
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,585
She just can't know about it.

190
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,800
Top of the morning, Dr. Kaufman.

191
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,464
Here's the deal. You
copy me on all the imaging.

192
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:08,684
I'll have my guys
run the lab tests.

193
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,199
No.

194
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,687
I thought you spoke to Cuddy?

195
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,703
Yeah. Then I spoke
to the elder Cuddy.

196
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,046
Who specifically requested
you not be involved.

197
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:22,085
Listen, Kaufie. You are perfectly
competent, bordering on good, even.

198
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,885
But you know I'm better.

199
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,797
If you want, we can pretend it's
'cause I got a team and more resources.

200
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,988
Either way, it'd be crazy
to ignore my advice.

201
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,996
It's not gonna stop at advice.

202
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,241
You're gonna
start cutting me out,

203
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,597
go behind me to your girlfriend.

204
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,100
And if something goes wrong?

205
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,967
It's still me standing up
there alone at the M&M.

206
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,563
Please, stay away
from my patient.

207
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,277
You bugged the room?

208
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,614
I absolutely without
apology will admit

209
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,750
that someone may
have allegedly done so.

210
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,426
Guess we can pass unethical
and skip straight to illegal.

211
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,160
Not according to the recent
Supreme Court case of Bite vs Me.

212
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,696
<i>Dr. Kaufman's single.</i>

213
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,664
<i>Did you know he went
to Harvard Medical...</i>

214
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,103
<i>Mom, stop yenta-ing</i>

215
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,265
<i>for one minute.</i>

216
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,450
<i>Of course, if you want gloomy</i>

217
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,501
<i>and unable to commit, then
stick with the</i> goyishe <i>one.</i>

218
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,655
This is completely unethical.
Why are we listening to this?

219
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,773
I know I'm a pain,
but it's impossible

220
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,025
for me to work
with you if you...

221
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,108
Fine. Fine.

222
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,552
Instead of a live stream, I'll get a
recap from Cuddy 20 minutes later.

223
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,815
Thank you for saving America.

224
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,717
Could be leukemia. Anemia
from taking over the marrow.

225
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,657
A-fib from infiltrating
cardiac muscle.

226
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,188
Sounds good.

227
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,965
Yeah.

228
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,062
I was really hoping
for a different diagnosis.

229
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,139
One that Kaufman hadn't
already come up with.

230
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,672
He just started a
bone marrow biopsy.

231
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,255
So we don't need to do anything?

232
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,210
I don't. You do. Go to
admitting and find us a new case.

233
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,692
DDX.

234
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:14,995
We just did it.

235
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,161
No, we just did the fake one.

236
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,518
Why do you think I let the
truth fairy know about the bug?

237
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,868
I was testing her. She
failed. She's still a narc.

238
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,102
Thiamine deficiency
fits better than leukemia.

239
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,272
You think she's an alcoholic.

240
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:31,351
When I had dinner with Arlene,
I mixed her a gin and tonic

241
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,579
and I'd run out of the tonic

242
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,588
so I substituted sleeping pills.

243
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:39,186
Next morning, she assumed
the blackout was from the drinking.

244
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,787
How many old ladies are used
to passing out from boozing?

245
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,194
The answer is the boozers.

246
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,296
We're gonna have to
slip her the thiamine pills.

247
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,536
We've got to run this by Cuddy.

248
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,706
Why do you think I'm
in such a bad mood?

249
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,249
Alcoholic?

250
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,884
Treatment's very easy, safe,

251
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,587
just literally a
few vitamin pills.

252
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,002
It'll fix her heart
and it won't interfere

253
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,896
with the biopsy
Kaufman's running.

254
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,566
I've put them in
an antacid bottle.

255
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,730
Just tell her it's for
stomach problems.

256
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,408
I have to ask her about this.

257
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,941
Of course. Absolutely.

258
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,243
You'll ask, she'll deny, you'll
push it, she'll get offended,

259
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,664
you'll be exactly
where you are now,

260
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,968
except it'll be harder to treat.

261
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,422
You've absolutely
got to do that.

262
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,730
I don't think she'll lie to me.

263
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,591
She just spent
the last five years

264
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,324
going south of the
border down Mexico way.

265
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,764
We have our issues,
but since Dad died,

266
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,099
we tell each other the
truth when asked directly.

267
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,937
It's important to us.

268
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,135
Addicts lie.

269
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,659
Can I speak to Mom alone?

270
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,256
Why?

271
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,528
You're scaring me, Lisa.

272
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,966
Mom, I think your drinking

273
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,281
is causing your heart problems.

274
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,704
Is this about the
champagne? She ordered...

275
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,007
Patsy and Anne told me last week

276
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,848
you lost control at
the museum luncheon.

277
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,320
You're talking to my
friends behind my back.

278
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,721
We are all concerned.

279
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,823
Just tell me honestly.

280
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,827
How much have you been drinking?

281
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,357
I may be your patient,
but I am still your mother

282
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,562
and I'm telling you
I am not a drunk.

283
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:14,570
Okay.

284
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,553
For your stomach pains.

285
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,381
If something like
that comes up again,

286
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,575
just do what you need to do.

287
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,388
And keep you out of it?

288
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,892
Yeah. I am being a coward.

289
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,496
Which is exactly why doctors
shouldn't treat their own families.

290
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,258
Congratulations.

291
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,764
You were right, as usual.

292
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,776
The hitting you was not optimal.

293
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,605
I was going through my
own divorce at the time.

294
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,874
I've had years of therapy.

295
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:25,715
Now when I get mad, I do some
deep breathing, squeeze my stress ball.

296
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,846
Hey, I kind of deserved it.

297
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,080
That's for sure.

298
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,292
Here's the deal.

299
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,623
I do a lot of med-mal insurance.

300
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,219
I need a new
non-testifying expert.

301
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,764
I'll give you one
case as a tryout.

302
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:42,563
You kick ass, I put you on
retainer, average 15 hours a week.

303
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,728
It's 50 a year.

304
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,030
Fifty what?

305
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,570
You kidding? Fifty thousand.

306
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:50,900
I'll take it.

307
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,707
You drive a soft bargain.

308
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,246
You got to sign an NDA.

309
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,313
Sure.

310
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,450
Is this...

311
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,047
That's a case
I'm about to settle.

312
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,748
I rep a giant pizza
delivery company.

313
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,121
Driver hit that kid,
messed up his legs.

314
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,251
And gave him a
micro-bleed in his brain, right?

315
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,262
What? No.

316
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,090
This little white mark.

317
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,069
Your predecessor checked,
so did the kid's doctors.

318
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,900
I don't know what
that is, but he's fine.

319
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,970
Probably. But if
there's any doubt...

320
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,476
It's a multimillion-dollar case
we're settling in two days.

321
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,773
Lay off it, okay?

322
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,844
Okay, you're right. I'm off.

323
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,962
She spiked a fever. It's 102.

324
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,298
Means I was wrong about
the thiamine deficiency.

325
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,428
You were wrong
about the alcoholism.

326
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,037
True dat.

327
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,604
It's actually looking more
and more like leukemia.

328
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,702
Kaufman rushed the
biopsies. It's not cancer.

329
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,706
So there's a bright side.

330
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,748
Kaufman was wrong, too.

331
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,584
DDX.

332
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,192
Okay. What disease
can turn Cuddy's mother

333
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,894
into a coma patient
named Stewart?

334
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,594
Lupus?

335
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,098
We got fired from that
case. We're moving on.

336
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,441
We were already fired.

337
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,508
By the patient.

338
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,406
This time by
Cuddy, so it's real.

339
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,476
She somehow realized that her
completely unworkable system

340
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,414
was completely unworkable.

341
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,515
Okay, pop quiz, hotshots.

342
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,020
I chose Vegetable
Stew for a reason.

343
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,250
You got 60 seconds, no hintsies.

344
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,720
You're not gonna talk to us?

345
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,870
Exactly, you're gonna have to...

346
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,022
Hey, you're good.

347
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,225
So this is just a test?

348
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,095
Pupils fixed and dilated.

349
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,832
An addict found with an empty
bottle of phenobarb next to him.

350
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,104
How's this a mystery?
It's an overdose.

351
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,675
Glutethimide!
Script filled last year.

352
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,544
Could mimic fixed and
dilated without the brain death.

353
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,375
Except he'll just get
better on his own,

354
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,748
so why would you take this case?

355
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,130
Because House doesn't
care about the treatment

356
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,679
as long as the
case is interesting.

357
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,458
I'll do a blood draw and put
glutethimide on the tox screen.

358
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:30,467
Really? You thought
that case was interesting?

359
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,804
Guess we're still on Arlene.

360
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,883
Aren't there other ways of
keeping Masters occupied?

361
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,809
Not according to my
sexual harassment seminar.

362
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,775
Maybe it's not hypochondria.

363
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,214
She says she
gets a lot of rashes.

364
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:48,050
Add the fever, sounds
like autoimmune, SLE.

365
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,987
Congratulations. You can think
exactly like a semi-competent internist.

366
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,953
Kaufman's starting
her on prednisone.

367
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,962
But the heart
problems were first.

368
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,458
Endocarditis?

369
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,823
With no murmurs?

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,298
It's usually a late sign.

371
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,733
The echo showed pristine valves.

372
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,431
Below the resolving threshold.

373
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,797
Kaufman's prednisone will
suppress her immune system.

374
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,898
It could kill her.

375
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,739
You've got to tell
him it's endocarditis.

376
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:16,908
Check the wiretap.

377
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,281
His ID guy's has been putting
the same argument to him.

378
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,946
He can't convince him.
You think I got a better shot?

379
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,312
So what do we do?

380
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,186
We switch her meds.

381
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,531
We get a solution of
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

382
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,862
Stick it in an IV bag
marked for prednisone.

383
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,493
Kaufman can only be
there a few times a day.

384
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,723
Tell Arlene you're from the
pharmacy. Switch them out.

385
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,967
This is nuts.

386
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,185
This is way too complicated...
It's hanging an IV bag.

387
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,353
If the attending doesn't know
what she's on, the risk of...

388
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,006
What risk? We know how he's
treating her, we bugged the room.

389
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,639
This is not about information.

390
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,116
We're talking ethical and
legal violations on a scale

391
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,948
that should make even
you puke. She's dying!

392
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,716
Doesn't mean we should
all go to jail to save her!

393
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,463
You're losing control because
this is your girlfriend's mom.

394
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,533
You gonna run this by Cuddy?

395
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,435
No. She said to keep her out
of it, do what we need to do.

396
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,708
Look, I know what I'm suggesting
is completely screwed up.

397
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:24,011
That's because this situation
is completely screwed up.

398
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,175
Do it or you're fired.

399
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,225
We stick together, he
can't fire all three of us.

400
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,895
Give me your prescription pad.

401
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,154
Why are you doing this?

402
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,308
Because I think
it's endocarditis

403
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,460
and I think the
prednisone will kill her.

404
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,729
And I forgot my
prescription pad.

405
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,075
Am I a horrible person?

406
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,451
I used to win awards
for volunteer work.

407
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,854
I went to Guatemala
and fixed cleft palates.

408
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,392
Now we're sitting back
letting Chase do our dirty work.

409
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,054
We're doing the right
thing. Stay out of it.

410
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,656
I don't know. I don't know
about anything anymore.

411
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:19,237
Then this thing with the
kid Rachel's brother is...

412
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,670
Stay out of that, too.

413
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,834
A, radiologists, experts,
unlike you said no bleed.

414
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,537
B, you yourself
said it's probably not.

415
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,944
C, you've got no
doctor-patient relationship.

416
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,675
D, you'll lose your
consulting job.

417
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,046
E, your ex will kill you.

418
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,709
F, I'm running out
of alphabet here.

419
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,348
You do it?

420
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,255
Had the bag. Walking
towards the room

421
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,692
and Cuddy's sister
says, "Hey, Dr. Chase."

422
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,759
I met her at that
charity event last year.

423
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,229
One of you two's got to do this.

424
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,529
I met Arlene at
the same benefit.

425
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,863
Conveniently.

426
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,065
Come on, don't ask me. I
don't even know if I believe it's...

427
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,107
Damn it. It's Rachel's brother.

428
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,172
He wants me to check
out some new case.

429
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,735
Conveniently.

430
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,816
It's a tryout. I need this job.

431
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,245
I got to do this.

432
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,482
So you're just gonna ditch us, run
off and work on some other case?

433
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:22,834
Are you Timothy's mom?

434
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,097
Yeah.

435
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,398
My name is Christopher Taub.

436
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:28,305
I'm a doctor at
Princeton-Plainsboro.

437
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,705
I saw your son's file.

438
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,643
I think he might have a
very small bleed in his brain.

439
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,944
Wait, you saw his file? How
do you even know who we are?

440
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,716
Your son could die
of a brain hemorrhage.

441
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,515
He needs a cerebral
angiogram today.

442
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,317
Get in your car and
meet me at the hospital.

443
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,624
Timothy? We're gonna
go see the doctor.

444
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,169
<i>Another pop quiz.</i>

445
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,365
How many idiot doctors
does it take to switch an IV?

446
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:04,503
The longer we wait,
the more the prednisone

447
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,807
is gonna kill her immune system.

448
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,849
Forget playing the pharmacist.
Mom naps every afternoon.

449
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,629
Wait by the room, when she falls
asleep, get the sister out somehow.

450
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,816
Hi, Dr. Cuddy. Is now
a good time to talk?

451
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:22,156
Not really.

452
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,822
So, um, you know how
you had us consulting,

453
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,866
and then stopped
having us consult?

454
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,329
Why are you still here?

455
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:33,404
Well, I think the stopping
might have stopped.

456
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,171
House put me on this weird
case where there's no treatment.

457
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,808
I think maybe to distract me.

458
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:40,998
And they've been acting odd.

459
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:42,906
I'll look into it.

460
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,715
Thank you for coming to me.

461
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:49,255
Because I'm worried that he's
switching your mother's medications.

462
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,514
I checked with the pharmacy.

463
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:56,117
Dr. Chase got prednisone and
antibiotics for my coma patient.

464
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,323
Which wouldn't treat him,

465
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:02,732
but could treat conditions
that cause heart failure.

466
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,199
You told me to keep you out
of it, do what I needed to do.

467
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:11,820
What the hell did
you think that meant?

468
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:12,988
I meant like if
you had to slip her

469
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,742
a few more vitamin
pills or something.

470
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,817
This is life-threatening.
It's illegal.

471
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,148
I wasn't expecting
something like this.

472
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,163
Only because you intentionally
weren't thinking about it

473
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,816
'cause you don't wanna
make any tough decisions.

474
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,924
Are you completely
sure it's endocarditis?

475
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,030
That's not a real question.

476
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,064
Endocarditis fits better
than the alternatives.

477
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:47,544
We're having a little
trouble hanging the right IV.

478
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,646
Fastest way is with your help.

479
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,023
Where did Julia go?

480
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,190
She's got a family.

481
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,197
I've got a family.

482
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,397
Three kids and a
husband, that's a family.

483
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,740
You are always tougher on
me than Julia. Why is that?

484
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,103
I'm not.

485
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:21,071
I was thinking about when you
made me run for yearbook editor.

486
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,911
I didn't want to, I didn't have a
social life my whole senior year.

487
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,260
You let Julia do
whatever she wanted.

488
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:27,844
We're debating 12th grade now?

489
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,979
Like anything's changed.

490
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,054
What do you want, Lisa?

491
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:33,422
Do you want to hear I
love you both the same?

492
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,118
Of course I do.

493
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,057
Okay.

494
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,557
But times like this,

495
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,503
when we argue, it reminds me

496
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,369
I have more in common with her.

497
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,471
She's nicer to me.

498
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,075
I love you both,

499
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,439
but I like her more than you.

500
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,259
I called you three times.

501
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,236
My phone wasn't exactly on.

502
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,234
I figure I'll be getting
some angry calls

503
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,001
once radiology sends
back the angiogram.

504
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,170
They already did.

505
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,744
Here.

506
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,008
This is what you saw.

507
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,274
It's an anatomical
variant of the skull,

508
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,320
bone in proximity
to a blood vessel.

509
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,944
There was nothing
wrong with him.

510
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,420
That was reason G.

511
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,455
That's good news for him.

512
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,661
Lungs clear?

513
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,502
Diffuse wheezing,
tightness, pruritus.

514
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,771
It's an allergic reaction.

515
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,317
Looks like. But it
doesn't make any sense.

516
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,808
She's on prednisone. How
could she get an allergic reaction?

517
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,620
I switched out the antibiotics,
put her back on prednisone.

518
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,661
Her breathing's normal. But the
A-fib's back and her fever's up.

519
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,923
Allergy's got to be
due to our antibiotics.

520
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,589
Does Kaufman know what we did?

521
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,790
That's good. No,
that is terrible.

522
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,327
He doesn't know that she
got worse on antibiotics,

523
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,962
so now he's
thinking endocarditis.

524
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,667
He'll put her back on the
antibiotics that almost suffocated her.

525
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,933
What do we do?

526
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,005
We push through this.

527
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,046
Started in the heart, endocarditis
still fits, it's just got to be fungal.

528
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,881
We have to switch Kaufman's
antibiotics for Amphotericin B.

529
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,630
I don't know if you're
right, I don't care.

530
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,350
But we are gonna end
up killing this woman

531
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,891
if we keep confusing her
attending with these secret meds.

532
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,655
I don't care about confusing
the attending. I want this woman...

533
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,061
We're not talking about
simple antibiotics anymore.

534
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,998
Amphotericin B is dangerous
in itself. It's a poison.

535
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,866
That's why it kills fungi.
It'll give her fever, chills...

536
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,132
Which she already has,
which will help us hide it.

537
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,482
I don't think I can
take a risk like that.

538
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,346
Well, then, you shouldn't
have let her fire me!

539
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:12,049
Look, all you have to
do is switch the IVs again.

540
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,329
This has blown up
on you once already.

541
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,353
He's right.

542
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,479
Yep.

543
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,259
I'm so sorry I got you guys
into this. You should go.

544
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:33,371
I'm right.

545
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,669
I know. And I'll do it, but...

546
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:53,359
I agree. Fungal
endocarditis fits.

547
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,756
But we still have
to tell your mother.

548
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,736
I don't want to
tell her, not at all,

549
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,067
but the patient is
the highest priority.

550
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,932
I'm kicking you
out of your office.

551
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,644
Yes, you. This is
not her office yet.

552
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:37,199
If you tell anyone,

553
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,604
I will get you thrown
out of med school

554
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,198
and I will destroy your career.

555
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,574
I've thought about that.

556
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,278
Lying about me won't work.

557
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,718
Everybody knows your reputation.

558
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,125
True. But I won't have to lie.

559
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:09,598
Buried in your coma
patient's big, big file is a form

560
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,364
that doesn't allow
treatment without

561
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,133
the express consent
of the relatives.

562
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,438
Wait... You drew blood.

563
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,077
That's not just a screw-up.
It's a criminal assault.

564
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,252
But you told me...

565
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,152
No. As you may recall...

566
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:38,691
You set me up?

567
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:45,696
Why?

568
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:50,768
Because this patient
is the highest priority.

569
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,855
You made her think I was
hiding her son being sick!

570
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,886
She scuttled the settlement.
She reported me to the bar.

571
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,517
I got to deal with
that crap now!

572
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:47,025
I will sue you for slander,
for tortuous interference

573
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:50,091
and anything else I
can use to destroy you.

574
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:57,605
And my sister says, stay
out of her life, you failure.

575
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,712
Five years of therapy.

576
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:12,751
Dr. Kaufman, I need to speak
with you and the patient alone.

577
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,090
I'm skipping the
credentials committee.

578
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,565
I'm going straight to the state
board and reporting you for...

579
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,697
What you've done
is so off the spectrum,

580
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,296
I don't know there's
a specific name for it.

581
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,052
- I think he's talking to you.
- Marty, calm down.

582
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:32,796
And you. What you did is worse.

583
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,541
He's an insane lunatic.
You're the Dean of Medicine.

584
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,046
I want you off my case.

585
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,139
That's exactly right.

586
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,048
Don't get excited.
You're fired, too.

587
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,211
What?

588
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,811
I'll never get away from House

589
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,550
or my daughter if I stay here.

590
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,489
Transfer me to
Princeton General.

591
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:47,752
Mom.

592
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,793
You're very ill and
you're very angry.

593
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,799
You really think now is the right
time to make a decision like this?

594
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,665
You lied to me and betrayed me.

595
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,136
Do you think I really care what
you consider a good idea anymore?

596
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,481
I'll get the ambulance.

597
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:24,690
Happy?

598
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,166
I can't believe it.

599
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:43,505
What just happened?

600
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,012
You just killed her.

601
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,184
Are you blaming me?

602
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,057
This is all because
you're so arrogant,

603
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,528
you goaded her into firing you.

604
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,862
Actually, my mistakes
started a little after that,

605
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,696
when I agreed to
your brilliant scheme

606
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,645
to keep me on the case
after she'd fired me off it.

607
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:05,913
She would have
left the hospital.

608
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,372
Only 'cause you would have
let her. Like you did just now.

609
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,738
You think I can control her?

610
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,152
I don't know. I've
never seen you try.

611
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,112
I have been rebelling against
this woman my entire life.

612
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,113
Here's what I've seen.

613
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,115
She insults you,
you complain to me.

614
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,345
I drug her at dinner,
you never let her know.

615
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,445
We slip her medicine,
happens behind her back.

616
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,547
You never confront her.

617
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,683
And it pisses me off.

618
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,696
Are you taking this personally?

619
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,266
If she leaves, she dies.

620
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:41,568
One day, maybe a week from
now, maybe a year from now,

621
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:46,971
you're gonna decide that the man
sleeping next to you killed your mother.

622
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,475
Get me my patient back.

623
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:59,019
This is really bad, Lise.

624
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,821
I swear to God, Jules,
I will call security.

625
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,831
I asked you before why
you were tough on me.

626
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:17,941
I wasn't.

627
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,807
You were. And I know why.

628
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,111
You see something in
me that you didn't see

629
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,946
in Julia and you
didn't see in you.

630
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,748
A type of ambition,
a type of brains.

631
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,846
That's why you rode me.

632
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:35,916
You made me yearbook editor,
summa undergrad, AOA in med school.

633
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,259
The only time I ever
see light in your eyes

634
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,164
is when you hear me
talking about my job.

635
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,572
The reason you keep
coming to see me

636
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,007
in the clinic is
because you trust me.

637
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,179
You trust my medical judgment.

638
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:56,641
So here it is.

639
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,409
If you transfer to
Princeton General,

640
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,613
you'll be treated
well and you'll die.

641
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:07,618
If you stay here with House,
you'll be treated badly, but you'll live.

642
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,594
I don't care if I have
to slash the tires

643
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:16,294
of every ambulance
in this bay, Mom.

644
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,303
I am not letting you
leave my hospital.

645
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,644
One, two, three.

646
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:29,041
I got it. How are
you feeling, Mom?

647
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,244
I feel a little dizzy.

648
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,717
Heart's still weak from the
infection. We'll hang an antifungal IV.

649
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,515
If you're so great,
how come you're not

650
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,716
running your department anymore?

651
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,314
What are you talking about, Mom?

652
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,654
That's what he told me.

653
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:42,726
Two days ago?

654
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,406
I said that I didn't have a department
to run? I was being sarcastic.

655
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,489
No, you weren't.

656
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,394
Right, because
people who are talking

657
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,946
can't tell if they're
being sarcastic.

658
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,378
That doesn't make any sense.

659
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,338
Of course they
can. But you weren't.

660
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,877
I love A-Rod.

661
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,346
He's so modest

662
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,944
and I highly respect the paintings
he has of himself as a centaur.

663
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,582
Question. Do I like A-Rod?

664
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,225
Yes. Whoever he is.

665
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,927
She can't recognize sarcasm?

666
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,124
Deficit in the right
parahippocampal gyrus,

667
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,228
which means CNS
involvement before the fever.

668
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,463
I was wrong about
the endocarditis.

669
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,700
I don't feel...

670
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:32,237
Mom. Mom.

671
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,973
Heart rate 170. Nurse!

672
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,140
Do something.

673
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:39,216
I am.

674
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,317
House! The fever
was hypothalamic.

675
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,753
That means brain,
heart, anemia, allergy.

676
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,233
You hear that, what do
you think? I don't know.

677
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,520
You think heavy metal toxicity.

678
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,036
It can't be. You treated
chelation for lead.

679
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,995
And she got better,
then she got worse

680
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,758
because she never
stopped being poisoned.

681
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:55,899
What are you doing?

682
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,487
You really want me
to stop and explain?

683
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,744
There it is. Look at that.

684
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,419
The muscle's black.

685
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:17,680
Necrosis?

686
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:22,955
Metallosis. Her artificial hip
weared and teared way too much.

687
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,256
It's cobalt poisoning.

688
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,788
We're gonna need
Chase to get an OR.

689
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,595
We should start chelation again.

690
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,627
I thought you didn't
want to see me.

691
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,396
I didn't.

692
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,526
But Foreman called me.

693
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,874
I didn't know that you thought

694
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:16,039
that little boy had
a bleed in his head.

695
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,218
I will kill my brother if he
messes with you anymore.

696
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,986
What do you care?

697
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,191
Chris. You were
a crappy husband.

698
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,762
But you are a good person.

699
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,130
Once again. You are unfired.

700
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:11,395
Why?

701
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,569
You sold me out
even though you knew

702
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,804
that you're gonna get
thrown out of med school.

703
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,805
That's just kind of impressive.

704
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:30,281
I keep my job if I stand
up to you, I keep it if I don't.

705
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,653
I don't buy it.

706
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:39,063
When Cuddy was protecting me
before, she was protecting a doctor.

707
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,793
She's now
protecting a boyfriend.

708
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:44,562
The hospital's not gonna
put up with that for long.

709
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,795
So I need you to protect me

710
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,137
from doing something
Cuddy will regret.

711
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,273
See you bright
and late tomorrow.

712
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:19,200
Mom, why would
you want to keep this?

713
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,641
So I can mount it on the
wall like a moose head.

714
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:36,887
It says here, "Cobalt
can cause rashes,

715
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,348
"dizziness and
stomach problems."

716
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:45,161
You still think I've been
imagining the whole thing?

717
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,789
Okay, you might have a point.

718
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:49,826
How do you feel?

719
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:53,838
You know, a little
dizziness, some pain.
