1
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,159
Shouldn't they be up by now?

2
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,703
I'm sure they're fine.

3
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,929
They're gonna run out of air.

4
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,268
I'm happy to kill my daughter,

5
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,434
but I'd feel a little awkward
about killing your son.

6
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,569
They're spending
time together, it's good.

7
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,313
We're a family now.
They need to bond.

8
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:32,614
Yeah. Well, they can
bond with full air intake.

9
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,092
Julie, surface now!

10
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,088
Help! Shark!

11
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,032
Please don't scare me like that.

12
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,262
What? You said we should bond.

13
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,863
Look what I found!

14
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,808
You're not supposed to
take anything off the wreck.

15
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,612
How cool is this?

16
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,791
They kind of look like feathers.

17
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,951
Can I see?

18
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,385
Ow!

19
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,725
Julie!

20
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,224
Get her a towel.

21
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,333
What was in that jar?

22
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,931
Why aren't you
guys in my office?

23
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,510
Why are you in the building?

24
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,909
It's 8:00 in the morning.

25
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,070
Where's Chase?

26
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,512
He's not here because
it's 8:00 in the morning.

27
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:13,577
Sixteen-year-old girl, high
fever, vomiting, bloodshot eyes.

28
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,555
Wow, the case of
the really bad flu.

29
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,785
Hmm. Let me see. Did
I leave anything out?

30
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,123
Oh, yeah. The smallpox.

31
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,366
Smallpox was eradicated
over 30 years ago.

32
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,095
So were Hush Puppies.
Did you check out

33
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,761
your local hipster
coffee shop lately?

34
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,204
Smallpox doesn't exist outside
of P4 labs and bio weapon plants.

35
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,434
She was in Bermuda...

36
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,100
Where she was scuba-diving

37
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,906
on the wreck of
a Dutch slave ship

38
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,776
that had been intentionally sunk

39
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,111
because an epidemic of
smallpox had broken out onboard.

40
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,081
Was the ship sunk in water?

41
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,062
Because viruses can't
survive contact with water.

42
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,749
And if the virus had been kept
on the outside of an airtight jar,

43
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:49,915
that might be an issue.

44
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,486
The jar held
old-school inoculations.

45
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,637
They kept the scabs
of the infected people.

46
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,721
The virus can't survive
over 200 years...

47
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,957
You have.

48
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,393
Thanks for calling back.
Listen, I'm a screenwriter.

49
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,338
And is it theoretically
possible for smallpox

50
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,805
to survive for more
than 200 years

51
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,935
underwater in a
sealed glass jar?

52
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,446
<i>Well, theoretically, yes, but...</i>

53
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,640
Thank you.

54
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:18,179
So who do we believe,
the CDC or Dr. 90210?

55
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:22,286
Isolate, get the baseline blood
draws for smallpox antibodies,

56
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,256
then vaccinate
the entire family.

57
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,759
We should test for the
21st century suspects.

58
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,455
Varicella, measles...

59
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,672
You're free to perform whatever

60
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,289
unnecessary tests
you want, Foreman.

61
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,162
Slavery was abolished years ago.

62
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,276
Why the hell do you guys
have us quarantined in here?

63
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,215
We're just taking
every precaution.

64
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,547
Against what?

65
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,311
What do you think I have?

66
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,289
One possibility is tetanus

67
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,986
from the glass jar
that sliced your hand.

68
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,224
I remember tetanus shots. That
does not look like tetanus shots.

69
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,855
It's really not
worth going into,

70
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,524
because the odds
are astronomical.

71
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,361
Tell me.

72
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,408
Again, it's... Smallpox.

73
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,439
Smallpox?

74
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,146
Vaccine will protect
you if you don't have it,

75
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,342
and lessen the severity
if you already do.

76
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,712
But it's a billion-to-one, so we
don't want you to panic or anything.

77
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,958
How do I not panic
with that information?

78
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,735
Idiot in exam room one needs
anti-diarrheals and a dictionary.

79
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,738
You're not scheduled
for clinic duty now.

80
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,775
I had some free time.
I owed four hours...

81
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,773
Don't you have a case? Yeah.

82
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,209
Then don't worry about it.

83
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,047
Are you a Stepford doctor?

84
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,311
If you're busy, you don't
need to be down here.

85
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,212
You're serious.

86
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,482
Yep. Get out of here.

87
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,752
I can't.

88
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,054
I forgot her stuffed
animal at home.

89
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,099
It's been with her through
all the chemo sessions so far.

90
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,929
I need Lamby.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
She doesn't want
me to do it alone.

92
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,038
Honey, there's no other way.

93
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,800
You're just gonna
have to be brave, okay?

94
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,008
What if I get
someone to sit with her

95
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,067
while you run home
and get Lamby?

96
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:31,111
I'll get a nurse. Then I have
to deal with a very sick man.

97
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,024
I think she knows.

98
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,661
Who is she, and
what does she know?

99
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,030
Cuddy and that
I faked a lab test

100
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,661
and lied to her to
save my last patient.

101
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,762
What did she do?

102
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,239
She let me out of clinic
duty because I had a case.

103
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,004
She's never done that.

104
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,874
She's also probably
never ordered

105
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,879
the pasta special
in the cafeteria.

106
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,677
Would that also have some special
paranoid message to send you?

107
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,547
I am not imagining this.

108
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,746
It's an aberration in the
way that she treats me.

109
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,031
How do I find out what it means?

110
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,580
You don't. If she doesn't know,

111
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,702
all you're gonna do by sniffing
around is make her suspicious.

112
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,991
If she does know, you'll
find out soon enough.

113
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,927
What if I die of curiosity
in the meantime?

114
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,192
You were an idiot for
lying to her in the first place.

115
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,063
Don't be more of an idiot now.

116
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,433
Say nothing. To no
one. About anything.

117
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,835
That includes me.

118
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,946
It's not smallpox.

119
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,347
Blood work suggests some other
infection. White count is way down.

120
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,552
Masters, you got a boyfriend?

121
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,356
That's none of your business.

122
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,048
Probably just a dry spell.

123
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:50,095
House, you do realize
we just ruled out smallpox?

124
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,723
Would you ever be extra
nice to a theoretical boyfriend

125
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,367
if you were really mad at him?

126
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,768
I guess the only reason I would
be extra nice is because I'm angry,

127
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,102
and I just want him to go away

128
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,774
so I don't have to
deal with him anymore.

129
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,802
You passive-aggressive bitch.

130
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,106
You just asked me...

131
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,978
What about Foreman's
unnecessary tests?

132
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,607
Negative for
varicella and measles.

133
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,379
So all of our ideas
are off the table.

134
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,447
I'm putting mine back on.

135
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,122
Patient's a diver.

136
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,176
Under increased pressure,
everything in the blood

137
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,159
gets scared, panics,
runs and hides.

138
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,888
Antibodies could
be in the joints.

139
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,725
Tap her knee, ankle, shoulder,

140
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,094
and any other joint in
her smallpox-ridden body.

141
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,328
Good talk.

142
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,978
You know.

143
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,812
Of course I know.

144
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,851
Oh, thank God.

145
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,824
I thought I was
just being paranoid.

146
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,692
Why didn't you say something?

147
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,456
'Cause I wanted you to
come to me and apologize.

148
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,623
I can't apologize if I
haven't done anything wrong.

149
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,092
You lied to my face.

150
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,294
To do my job. To
save the patient's life.

151
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,665
Look, I don't wanna go all <i>Godfather</i>
on you, but this was business.

152
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,641
I wouldn't lie to you
about something personal.

153
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,874
You don't get to lie
to me about anything.

154
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,146
I can't compartmentalize
my life like that.

155
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,981
Well, maybe you should
practice, 'cause it comes in handy.

156
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,789
I think you should go.

157
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,832
Ow.

158
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,398
Sorry.

159
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,342
I have to get the
needle behind the bone.

160
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,642
I'm running out of bones.

161
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,234
If this is a waste
of time... Last one.

162
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,850
We just have to be...

163
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,213
What?

164
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,358
What is it?

165
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,526
I'm sorry. I have
to call the CDC.

166
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,899
I think you do have smallpox.

167
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,200
Am I gonna die?

168
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,041
I mean, this is what terrorists

169
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,842
want to use to kill
everyone, right?

170
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:21,938
Like, there's no cure.

171
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,779
There are treatments.
We can give you cidofovir...

172
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,684
I don't think you care
about the drugs' names.

173
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,052
Bottom line, it's 30% fatal.

174
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,167
Which means your chances of
being okay are about the same

175
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,525
as a basketball player's
chance of hitting a free throw.

176
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,461
Unless she finds dark,
purplish skin blotches.

177
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,031
What would purple blotches mean?

178
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,932
Hemorrhagic-type smallpox.

179
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,368
In which case, her chances are
more like Shaq hitting a free throw.

180
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,437
Well, no purple skin,
but take a look at this.

181
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,602
What is it?

182
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,145
There's a rash under
your daughter's arm.

183
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,045
What, like, more of
those gross bumps?

184
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,252
No. It's just a regular rash.

185
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,186
What does that mean?

186
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,556
It means it's not smallpox.

187
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,731
Are you saying you
see House's side?

188
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,468
It's not even a side, it's
a fictional construction.

189
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,372
She's expecting
House not to lie?

190
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,843
If she's using the relationship

191
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,641
as a rationale to try
to change things...

192
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,580
Wait, wait. Are you saying it's
okay for us to lie to each other?

193
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,118
No. We have a different
relationship. I think a better one.

194
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,818
Lying was never part
of it. Theirs is built on it.

195
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,252
I'm sorry. I have to go.

196
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,622
Oh, come on. I have to
leave in, like, five minutes.

197
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,285
Can't it wait?
There's a little girl.

198
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,771
The nurse watching
her got called away.

199
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,095
It's a long story,
but I've gotta babysit.

200
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,593
I'll see you tonight.

201
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,529
<i>Attention. Effective
immediately,</i>

202
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,970
<i>all hospital entrances
and exits will be restricted</i>

203
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,335
<i>until further notice.</i>

204
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,920
<i>Center for Disease
Control has ordered</i>

205
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,615
<i>Princeton-Plainsboro
Hospital locked down.</i>

206
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,936
Well, I guess I can stay.

207
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,019
Please, step out of the room.

208
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,357
I'm Dr. Broda, Head of
Infection Control, CDC.

209
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,764
And your protective
suits are not adequate.

210
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,629
Turns out they don't have to be.

211
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,430
Rash under the arm
means it's not smallpox.

212
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,103
False alarm.

213
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,965
Sorry, hope the
traffic wasn't too bad.

214
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,633
Rash is consistent
with smallpox.

215
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,438
Not if it presents
after pustules.

216
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,787
She's probably just allergic

217
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,336
to the bed sheets
or the hospital gown.

218
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,686
Or you simply didn't notice it.

219
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,707
We're gonna airlift blood
and tissue samples to Atlanta.

220
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,718
We'll have the DNA
results in 18 hours.

221
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,521
In the meantime, please,
step out of the room.

222
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,054
You brought the plane? Cool.

223
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,989
When we left, Julie's
fever had climbed over 103.

224
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,377
It's not smallpox, she's not
dying, and it's not our case.

225
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,165
Need any other
reasons to forget it?

226
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,569
You know how you can tell
there's nothing to be done?

227
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,696
Chase showed up.

228
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:01,866
I was here at 9:00.

229
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,219
So you guys just want to do
nothing for the next 18 hours

230
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,041
until they tell us
it's not smallpox?

231
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,975
Can't we spend
the time discussing

232
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,347
what looks like smallpox
but isn't smallpox?

233
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,646
Molluscum contagiosum.

234
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,479
You have to compare
lesions to differentiate.

235
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,388
But we don't have access to
the patient or any new information.

236
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,357
We do have access
to the other patients.

237
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,021
The ones who died of
the same thing in 1793.

238
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,255
The captain's log from
the <i>Sotos Ooslerzoon.</i>

239
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,866
Maritime Museum in Bermuda
graciously sent over a PDF.

240
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,165
Problem solved.

241
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,064
I assume at least one of
you speaks fluent Dutch.

242
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,953
It's the middle of the
night in the Netherlands.

243
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,036
Nobody's working.

244
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,545
Oh, you can always find someone.

245
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,349
<i>Oh, yes. My name is Geerte.</i>

246
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,577
<i>Are you handsome
sexiest American man?</i>

247
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,950
Well, you know, some people...

248
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,591
I would say that I am, yeah.

249
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,355
I want you to translate
something for me.

250
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,896
<i>Why you want I translate?</i>

251
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:01,061
<i>I do topless, toys, and...</i>

252
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,363
Just do the translation.

253
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,548
She can translate however
she feels most comfortable.

254
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,299
<i>Whatever.</i>

255
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,701
<i>You put in credit card.</i>

256
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,036
House, the hospital
has translators on call...

257
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,236
Shut up.

258
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,613
Honey, could you e-mail our
new friend the captain's log?

259
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,209
Sure thing,

260
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,380
sexiest American man.

261
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,317
"On morning of 14 July,

262
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,430
<i>"I boarded</i> Sotos Ooslerzoon
<i>with two trunks and my cat."</i>

263
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,498
<i>Aw. The Captain had a cat.</i>

264
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,261
Isn't she adorable?

265
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,843
Go ahead and skip to the
part where people get sick.

266
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:39,998
<i>Mmm.</i>

267
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,165
<i>Ah, here.</i>

268
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:45,174
<i>"The passenger has a
fever, shaking and red eyes."</i>

269
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,842
<i>Ew, also, African man
make go in his pants.</i>

270
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,675
What about the
captain, the crew?

271
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,650
<i>No. It say only
African men sick.</i>

272
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,256
It can't be smallpox.

273
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,284
Airborne transmission means
it's an equal opportunity killer.

274
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,201
We're looking for a
disease that discriminates.

275
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,754
Sickle cell.

276
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:08,301
The disease doesn't have to
be racist, it could be classist.

277
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,667
Vitamin D deficiency from lack of
sunlight weakens the immune system,

278
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,366
makes the slaves more vulnerable
to malaria or dengue fever...

279
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,418
I don't know how you get
pustules from any of those.

280
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,843
The captain and crew
got clean drinking water.

281
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,937
The slaves drank
whatever they could.

282
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:22,942
Scrofula.

283
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,447
That's what they called cervical
TB lymphadenitis in the 1700s.

284
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,221
Scrofulicious. That's what they
called annoying in the 1700s.

285
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,520
Is she wrong?

286
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,125
They died for nothing.

287
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,132
Those slaves could
have lived long

288
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,828
fulfilling lives mowing
my ancestors' lawns.

289
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,701
Foreman, can I speak to
you outside for a second?

290
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,237
We need to test for TB.

291
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,708
TB might fit, but it's too
slow-moving to kill her anytime soon.

292
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,844
There's no way that CDC's
gonna give us access.

293
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,821
That's why we
don't think it's TB.

294
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,824
We think it's
meningococcal disease,

295
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,258
which could kill her before
the results come back.

296
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,728
And once I gain
access, I run the TB test.

297
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,207
You could've said
all that in there.

298
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,927
In front of the narc? As if.

299
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,378
Are you so afraid
of this new girl,

300
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,546
we have to take
elaborate measures

301
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,648
every time you want to skirt
around ethical boundaries?

302
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,039
Elaborate measures?
We took a walk.

303
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,100
A walk you would
have taken anyway.

304
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,736
Actually, I saved
you from the horrible

305
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,781
post-differential traffic jam.

306
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,246
Meningococcus?

307
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,881
We believe the rash under Julie's
armpit is actually petechial spots.

308
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,085
When added to the high
fever, the vomiting and...

309
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,837
There haven't been any
seizures, no stiff neck...

310
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,727
If I could just gain
access to the patient,

311
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,264
I could investigate
the rash further.

312
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,525
All right, I'll take a look.

313
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,968
I can wear your gear. I'll take
every necessary precaution.

314
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,437
You come to me
with a weak diagnosis.

315
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,939
I even offer to investigate.

316
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,942
But that's not good
enough for you.

317
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,474
What's really going on here?

318
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,587
<i>Sir, are you feeling
all right in there?</i>

319
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,881
It's just a headache.

320
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,226
Baby.

321
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,289
Baby.

322
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,660
Dad, you're bleeding.

323
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,134
Somebody, please,
get in here now!

324
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,506
This is not meningococcus.
You're not getting in here.

325
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,877
Cool.

326
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,398
Not really. Not for
them and not for you.

327
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,834
The dad's new symptoms are
consistent with them having smallpox.

328
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,918
Would be, if he had a headache.

329
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,325
He does have a headache.

330
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:51,023
No, he just said, "Ow"
and held his head.

331
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,532
Actually, he said, "Ow" then
he said, "It's a headache."

332
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,397
Which could be
indicative of head pain.

333
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,866
Headache is caused by muscle
tension or vascular stretching.

334
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,998
Head pain is caused by trauma.

335
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,651
Which would include such events

336
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,166
as a bleed in the brain from TB.

337
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,235
- We're back to TB?
- We never left.

338
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,819
We'll need to do a CT.

339
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,109
And I sort of have a hunch

340
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,776
that the CDC is not gonna
approve of us moving the patient.

341
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,713
Chase, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

342
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:24,057
We just tried this. I'm not
a better liar than Foreman.

343
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,100
Sure you are. You're
descended from convicts.

344
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,862
Plus, there's no lie this
time, just a bait and switch.

345
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,801
You propose that we
don't have to move him

346
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,396
if we do a
pneumo-encephalograph.

347
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,270
That's 60-year-old
technology that killed patients.

348
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,173
Exactly. He'll
compromise on the CT...

349
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:42,204
This isn't Cuddy. Your Jedi
mind tricks won't work here.

350
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:45,680
These aren't the
droids you're looking for.

351
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,385
You don't trust me.

352
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,581
Going behind your back works
better when you're not facing us.

353
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,217
Instead of whatever lie
you're gonna tell Broda,

354
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,057
why don't you just
tell him the truth?

355
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,372
If we're honest
and reasonable...

356
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,989
Then people of all
races and creeds

357
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,342
will live together in
peace and harmony...

358
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,267
How did your
first plan work out?

359
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,366
Permission granted.

360
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,600
Thank you.

361
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,436
After she gets denied,
do the bait and switch.

362
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,074
They won't let your
mommy back in the hospital

363
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,550
because of an
emergency downstairs.

364
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,782
But we have to get started.

365
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,754
I can't do it without my Lamby.

366
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:27,551
Who is she?

367
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,796
I'm nobody, I'm leaving soon.

368
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,565
Her name is Sam, and
she's a friend of mine.

369
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,826
What does Lamby usually do
while you get your treatment?

370
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,097
She holds my hand.

371
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,670
Well, you could hold my hand.

372
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,007
That won't work.

373
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,939
Well, sometimes we have to do
things that we don't want to do.

374
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,514
You have to go to school,

375
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,862
you have to eat your vegetables,

376
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,310
and you have to
take your medicine.

377
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,780
You have to.

378
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,148
I want my mommy.

379
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,591
Yeah.

380
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,692
I'll be right back.

381
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:11,501
You know, I'm pretty sure Lamby
has a cousin down in the gift shop.

382
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,613
Hold off a minute.
I'm in overtime.

383
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,120
Broda agreed to
CT the dad's brain.

384
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,486
Well, that sucks.

385
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,623
But I thought that's
what you wanted.

386
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,358
I shouldn't have gotten it
with the truth. He's a hypocrite.

387
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,209
His position ever since
he's been here has been...

388
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,293
I pointed out that
either we're right,

389
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,167
and he's the hero
for ending the crisis,

390
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,296
or he's right,

391
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,616
and he gets to
be the first person

392
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,007
to look at a brain
infected with smallpox.

393
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,236
CT scans weren't
around 30 years ago.

394
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,214
Good work.

395
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,392
So I guess honesty
is the best policy.

396
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,061
Why'd you say that?

397
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,461
Seriously, to establish
your viewpoint,

398
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,748
as if I didn't already know it,

399
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,741
or to demonstrate some weird

400
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,436
cross-generational female
solidarity with Cuddy?

401
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:27,376
Actually, I was just trying
to fill the awkward silence.

402
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,751
Why have they stopped?

403
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,688
You can't go out there!

404
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:37,848
Why did you stop?

405
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:38,947
Get out of the hallway.

406
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,955
He does not have smallpox.

407
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,187
Yes, he does.

408
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,727
It itches.

409
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,457
He's just developed pustules.

410
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,695
He's now too
dangerous to transport.

411
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,365
Get out of the hallway.

412
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,113
<i>Dad's vitals are in the toilet.</i>

413
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,911
<i>He's got full-blown smallpox.</i>

414
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,093
<i>What about the daughter?</i>

415
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,382
<i>Pustule count is way up,
her vitals are way down.</i>

416
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:08,614
<i>Means I was wrong.</i>

417
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,958
Well, to be precise, I was
right before I was wrong, so...

418
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,424
So we just give up and go home?

419
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:19,056
Actually, somebody locked the
front door. But yeah, we give up.

420
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,190
We might as well keep...

421
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,309
We have our diagnosis.

422
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,268
If you're eager, you can
go find us a new case.

423
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,174
I guess she's eager or
has a blind spot for sarcasm.

424
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,717
I just wanna look at
the rash under her arm

425
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,160
to see if it's matured
to match the...

426
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,424
You can look through the glass.

427
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,613
I need to be closer.

428
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,098
If the pustules are
at a different stage...

429
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,420
She's comfortable.

430
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,652
We're gonna have our
results back in eight hours.

431
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,422
If it's not smallpox, you
can be the first one in there.

432
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,742
<i>Why are you just
standing out there?</i>

433
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,114
<i>I'm just trying to help.</i>

434
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,363
<i>If you're feeling up to it,</i>

435
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:14,418
<i>can you sit up and show
me the rash under your arm?</i>

436
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,815
<i>Wait.</i>

437
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,525
<i>The soles of your feet...
There aren't any lesions.</i>

438
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:26,690
<i>Who cares? They're
everywhere else. This is torture.</i>

439
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:31,834
Eve.

440
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:36,942
Guess who came by
the hospital for a visit.

441
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,103
Hello, Eve.

442
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,546
Oh, no.

443
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:48,680
All right, I'm gonna get a couple
of nice nurses to come in here

444
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,222
and get you two ready
for the treatment, all right?

445
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,955
Okay.

446
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,625
How come Lamby can
be here, but Mommy can't?

447
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,643
Lamby was dirty.
We gave her a bath.

448
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,511
This isn't Lamby!

449
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,650
Julie doesn't have smallpox.

450
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,520
Did I just dream the part where
I finally agreed it was smallpox?

451
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,657
Well, if what I
thought was reality

452
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,892
was actually a dream,
then the reverse...

453
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:36,093
Oh, my God. I had a threesome
with Beyoncé and Lady Gaga.

454
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:42,164
She doesn't have pustules on
her palms or the soles of her feet.

455
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,040
But Dad does
have pustules there.

456
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:49,343
So how does he get
smallpox, but it skips her?

457
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,284
If I leave like that,
you should follow.

458
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:06,727
We gave it to him.

459
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,527
Where's Chase?

460
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,900
You do realize we don't
all live together, right?

461
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,940
Well, then just...
We gave it to him.

462
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,532
No pustules on the
daughter's palms, so...

463
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,339
So, therefore, your theory is

464
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,851
you asked me to
take the dad's blood,

465
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,815
but I accidentally
injected him with smallpox.

466
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,215
Exactly. Although, technically,
it was the vaccinia virus.

467
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,948
Which is what the smallpox
vaccine is made from.

468
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,784
Same symptoms as smallpox,

469
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,518
but only half the calories and
almost none of the lethality.

470
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,336
You sound like one of
those anti-vaccine cranks.

471
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,906
You can't develop full-blown
symptoms from the vaccine this quickly.

472
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,592
You can if you're
immuno-compromised.

473
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:44,087
Am I the only one who reads
these things? Dad had kidney cancer.

474
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,105
Six years ago. He's
been in remission.

475
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,264
Well, it's obviously back.

476
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,702
It shot his immune system,

477
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,299
made him vulnerable
to the vaccinia.

478
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,310
Which will get
better on interferon.

479
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:55,142
So if he responds
to the treatment,

480
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,910
that proves he
doesn't have smallpox.

481
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,396
Then what does
the daughter have?

482
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,979
Damn. I was hoping you
weren't gonna ask me that.

483
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,145
Can we please just
focus on the disease

484
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:06,420
we've just diagnosed
and we can treat?

485
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,356
What's more likely?
He got smallpox

486
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:10,987
the day after we
immunized him for it,

487
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,724
or he's sick from
the vaccine itself?

488
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,960
You got any proof the
kidney cancer's back?

489
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,160
Well, let me give him this.

490
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,828
When he gets better, that
will be the proof you need.

491
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,633
I'll put on one of your
fancy space suits,

492
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,732
and I promise I won't
kiss him on an open sore.

493
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,174
You know who Janet Parker is?

494
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:30,105
In 1978, she was working
at a university in England.

495
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,981
Someone in a research lab
on the floor below screwed up.

496
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,850
Some smallpox virus
managed to float up

497
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:39,618
through the vents into the
room where she was working.

498
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:44,686
She died four days later, the last
known person to die from smallpox.

499
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,790
And the person in charge
of the lab was so destroyed,

500
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:50,860
he killed himself.

501
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:56,536
Now that he's shedding, I
can't open that door for anyone.

502
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,277
Hey! Look.

503
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,507
There's the proof you need.

504
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,821
There's blood in the urine bag.

505
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,610
His kidneys are shutting down.

506
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,778
He's in the final
stages of the disease.

507
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,879
If smallpox was causing
the kidney failure,

508
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,947
the blood would
be brown. It's red.

509
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:16,085
Because the kidney cancer is
back and this is not smallpox.

510
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,525
I'm not opening that door.

511
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,735
Well, that makes one of us.

512
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,262
Hey!

513
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,303
Hey! You're insane!

514
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,537
But I'm right.

515
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:44,081
<i>I hope you are. Because
I can't let you out now.</i>

516
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,562
This is what happens when
you have no respect for authority,

517
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,202
no respect for anything.

518
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,901
You don't think it's a little
much to use the threat of death

519
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,604
to win a totally separate
argument with your boyfriend?

520
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,442
You think this is
about the other thing?

521
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,772
It does seem to track
suspiciously closely.

522
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:16,116
I don't care right now that you
lied to me. I want you to stay alive.

523
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:19,214
And if I do, does that
mean I win both arguments?

524
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,783
Put the suit on.

525
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,885
It's unnecessary, Mom.

526
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,859
This is why I didn't
want them telling you.

527
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,593
It's why I'm glad
they didn't tell Wilson.

528
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,964
Dr. House.

529
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,912
I'm getting worse, aren't I?

530
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,249
Interferon takes a
little time to work.

531
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,821
Don't worry.

532
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:06,869
Tell Broda that I'm increasing his
oxygen. And get my team down here.

533
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:24,781
Hi.

534
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,658
You're mad at us, aren't you?

535
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:29,990
Yeah.

536
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,793
Well, you have a right
to be. We weren't honest.

537
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,457
You might not know this yet,

538
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,526
but sometimes adults mess up.

539
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:44,301
Can I tell you something and
you'll keep it just between us?

540
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,806
I'm not great with kids.

541
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,072
I love them, but I get scared

542
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,913
that I'm gonna do the
wrong thing, and then,

543
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,584
I usually do.

544
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,352
That's what I
did with the lying.

545
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,053
And I'm very sorry about that.

546
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:06,493
But the reason why
I did the wrong thing

547
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:10,866
was because I was trying to
get you to do the right thing.

548
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:16,366
Your mommy and your Lamby
both really need you to get better.

549
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,880
So, do you think that
you could be really brave

550
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,686
and do the right thing?

551
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,784
I'll try.

552
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,452
Great.

553
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:38,892
Great.

554
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,101
Fever's way up, sats are way
down, pustules still spreading.

555
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,729
Interferon's not working.

556
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,707
Means this is smallpox.

557
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:54,103
Right, because there are only two
diseases in the whole wide world.

558
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,441
What else could it be?

559
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,105
There's got to be something.

560
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,911
No, there doesn't.

561
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,576
There are still no
pustules on her feet.

562
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,088
All the reasons you thought
it wasn't smallpox still exist.

563
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,421
Forget her feet. Forget
all those other reasons.

564
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,754
Look at him now.

565
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,954
The pox are dome-shaped,
they're on 80% of his body,

566
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,462
and they're not scabbing over.

567
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,391
This is textbook smallpox.

568
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,066
DDx-ing at this point isn't
gonna make a difference.

569
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,263
Don't say that.

570
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,396
I'm sorry.

571
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,675
House, you screwed
up going in there.

572
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,025
You have any fever?

573
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,928
Not yet.

574
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,264
But when it does come,

575
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,165
I assume you'll
see the pettiness

576
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,636
of being mad at me for lying.

577
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,502
Shut up, House.

578
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,538
I'll be right back.

579
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,188
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

580
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,567
You should say
goodbye to your family.

581
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,101
I love you.

582
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,608
Just hold on. Fight this.

583
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:08,541
You gotta take care of my boy.

584
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,852
No. Promise me.

585
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,514
I promise.

586
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,123
I love you.

587
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,228
I love you, too.

588
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,431
Get Roger closer.

589
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,231
Come closer.

590
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,635
Come on.

591
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,443
Dad?

592
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,050
You're my baby boy.

593
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,883
Dad, please.

594
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,090
It's gonna be okay.

595
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,457
Lulu's gonna take care of you.

596
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,324
I don't want to, Dad.

597
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,254
She's not you.

598
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,501
I will always love you, Rog.

599
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:12,470
Dad?

600
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,142
Dad!

601
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,480
You're killing me.

602
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:31,556
The suit will protect you if you
haven't already been exposed.

603
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,649
My air supply's almost out.

604
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,157
<i>We'll give you another canister.</i>

605
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,422
<i>Yeah, and when I
change it, I will be exposed.</i>

606
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:38,758
Just move him.

607
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,162
I wish I could.

608
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,494
<i>Well, that's great, because
you know what you can do?</i>

609
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,593
<i>You can move me.</i>

610
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,328
<i>You don't know that
I have smallpox yet.</i>

611
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,805
We have to assume.

612
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,399
There's another isolation
room on the fifth floor.

613
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,445
The problem is getting
him from here to there.

614
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,740
So it's inconvenient?

615
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:58,146
My having a fighting
chance at life is inconvenient?

616
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:01,676
I'm sorry.

617
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,951
We don't know
that he'll catch it.

618
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:11,019
We don't know that
it's definitely smallpox,

619
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,530
not until we get the DNA
results back from the CDC.

620
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,461
What do you think
the dad just died of?

621
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,192
Would it kill us
to talk it through?

622
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,794
Kill us, no. Save
House, also no.

623
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:22,701
Even if by some
miracle it's not smallpox,

624
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,333
there's nothing
more for us to go on.

625
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,638
There's no new data and
there isn't going to be any...

626
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:27,735
Where are you going?

627
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,610
To get more data.

628
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:35,820
<i>"Gerritt seems
distant, preoccupied."</i>

629
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,684
Who's Gerritt? Is he a slave?

630
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,555
<i>Gerritt is the captain's kitty.</i>

631
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,937
The captain's cat
is preoccupied?

632
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,187
Skip the cat.

633
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:45,354
<i>"One goat
slaughtered for dinner.</i>

634
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,524
<i>"Broke out the next
barrel of wine..."</i>

635
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:48,963
Skip the food.

636
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:53,061
Can we go back to the
cat? Did the cat get sick?

637
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,330
Smallpox is exclusive to humans.

638
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,466
Ship captains didn't have pets.

639
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:59,887
Nothing and nobody went on
those ships if it didn't have a purpose.

640
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,402
Hunting mice and rats?

641
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,674
For the crew.

642
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,615
The hold was probably
infested with mice.

643
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:06,883
What if that's the difference?

644
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,350
What happened to Gerritt?

645
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,813
Ah.

646
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,553
Is that a sad "ah"
or a cute "ah"?

647
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,254
Gerritt, he died.
It's a sad "ah."

648
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,758
Before he died,
did he lose his fur?

649
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,901
How did you know?

650
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,140
Mice don't carry smallpox,

651
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,904
but they do carry
rickettsialpox.

652
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,772
Which is treatable.

653
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,383
Just start them on doxycycline.

654
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,941
Based on a bald cat? You
never heard of shedding?

655
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,111
What's the downside?

656
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,689
If we shove her full of
antibiotics plus the antivirals,

657
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,418
it'll suppress her bone marrow.

658
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:47,719
That girl's about to die.

659
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,919
She probably is.

660
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,422
And I don't want to risk
pushing her over the edge.

661
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,088
At least look at the dad's body.

662
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:57,192
Small patches of black
dead tissue will prove I'm right.

663
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:01,066
Eschars appear with
rickettsialpox but not with smallpox.

664
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,438
If he had developed
eschars, I would've noticed.

665
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,772
You haven't been within
20 feet of the guy in hours.

666
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,711
Have them check.

667
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,510
Their job is to bleach
the body, kill the virus,

668
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,342
and get it out of there
for Dr. House's sake.

669
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:16,118
Bleaching the body will destroy
all evidence of rickettsialpox.

670
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,884
There is no evidence.

671
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,955
I'm not trying to
hurt anyone here.

672
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:25,120
I'm not lying to you.
This is smallpox.

673
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,065
House, you have
to examine the body.

674
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:39,983
I'm not going anywhere near it.

675
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,071
<i>Look for eschars. Hurry.</i>

676
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:44,575
You think it's R-pox?

677
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,676
<i>The Captain had a cat.
He lost his fur and then died.</i>

678
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,094
<i>Step back, Dr. House.</i>

679
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,338
It's kind of hard to do
an autopsy in oven mitts.

680
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:12,635
<i>Take them off.</i>

681
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,975
Says the woman standing
behind two panes of glass.

682
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,139
<i>Do you believe me?</i>

683
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,708
Forget me. Do you believe you?

684
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,376
You think it's
rickettsialpox, don't you?

685
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:24,718
<i>If it is, it's curable, and she's
gonna die unless we can prove it.</i>

686
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,591
You really are annoying.

687
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,211
Come on, House. Come on.

688
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,853
Eschar.

689
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,127
Eschars.

690
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:17,767
<i>Start the girl on
doxycycline right now.</i>

691
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:37,622
Mommy!

692
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,057
You were good with her. - Yeah.

693
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,568
Only after being bad.

694
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,001
It takes practice.

695
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,399
Maybe I should get a puppy.

696
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,269
Yeah. Or pregnant.

697
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,085
Hey.

698
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,152
You're gonna be okay.

699
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,757
Hey.

700
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,123
Hey.

701
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,282
Buy you breakfast?

702
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,682
No, thanks.

703
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:37,782
You can pay if it's starting
to feel like I'm carrying you.

704
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,881
House, stop.

705
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,889
When I was dying,

706
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,465
you realized that
a little white lie

707
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,866
between co-workers
wasn't such a big deal.

708
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:55,838
Yeah, and that was true,
when you were dying.
