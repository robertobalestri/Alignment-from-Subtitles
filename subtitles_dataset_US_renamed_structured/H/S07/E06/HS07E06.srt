1
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,875
<i>This election day,</i>

2
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,412
<i>the fate of our borders
is in your hands.</i>

3
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:19,813
<i>John Moreno wants to invite
illegal immigrants into our country.</i>

4
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,880
<i>He wants to give them our jobs.</i>

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,550
<i>He wants to give
them our healthcare.</i>

6
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,761
<i>John Moreno wants to give
them the American dream</i>

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,389
<i>and he wants you to pay for it.</i>

8
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,852
"Whose side is he really on?"

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,071
It's a valid question.

10
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,221
He favors easing restrictions.

11
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,269
So do I.

12
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,841
Come on, Hal, your position
on work visas is irrelevant.

13
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,887
He's talking about
a path to citizenship.

14
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:56,185
I'm telling you. This ad
wins you the election.

15
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,191
By insulting one of my
core constituencies?

16
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,952
Come on, in '04, I had
45% of the Latino vote.

17
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,691
And this year, you're running
against a guy named Moreno.

18
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,792
This isn't one of your races in
South Carolina or Oklahoma, Joe.

19
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,598
This is New Jersey. People vote
for me because I'm a moderate.

20
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,728
Well, that's great.

21
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,297
You can be the most moderate
ex-senator in the country.

22
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,742
Hal, the election
is seven days away

23
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,270
and even our own internals
show you down six points.

24
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,849
We've always been the underdog

25
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,316
and we've always
found a way to win.

26
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,548
I know, because you have always
let me do what's needed to be done.

27
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:31,114
Now, I can have this
on the air tomorrow.

28
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,485
No, no.

29
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,757
Come on, Hal, let me do this.

30
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,459
No, absolutely not. This
could totally galvanize the left.

31
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,459
You all right, Joe?

32
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,504
Yeah, I think I got
some kind of a rash.

33
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,834
What the hell?

34
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,066
That's not a rash.

35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,768
Maybe I should call a doctor.

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,073
Better call an ambulance.

37
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,977
Look at it like this,

38
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,515
of all the ways to rupture it,

39
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,985
nothing honors the
real Achilles more

40
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,282
than blowing the
dismount on a keg stand.

41
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,717
What's that smell?

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,652
Onions? Peppers?

43
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:42,352
Oh, I know. It's a sausage-fest.

44
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,159
Sausage-fest implies multiples.

45
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,394
Now if you're talking
yardage, I'd have to agree.

46
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,026
I'm talking about
your department.

47
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,695
You still haven't
replaced Thirteen.

48
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,499
It's coming along.

49
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,473
You've had plenty of
time to find someone.

50
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,661
I've found plenty of someones,
just haven't kept them.

51
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,235
It's time to end the cycle.

52
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,677
Meet your new team member.

53
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,476
Her name is Martha M. Masters.

54
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,318
This doctor is not a doctor.

55
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,876
She's a third-year med student.

56
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,819
She graduated high
school when she was 15.

57
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,366
She filled out the
time before med school

58
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,087
getting PhDs in both
applied math and art history.

59
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,755
Should be incredibly useful if my
next patient is an Escher drawing.

60
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,354
Those things are
seriously screwed up.

61
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,025
This isn't a suggestion.

62
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,368
Just because my sausage
has been filling your bun

63
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,700
doesn't mean you get to decide

64
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,741
what flavor chips I
nosh on during the day.

65
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,834
No. I get to do that
because I'm your boss.

66
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:39,084
Patient is Joe Dugan,
42, political consultant.

67
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,916
Presents with palpable purpura

68
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,183
and ALT and AST
are through the roof.

69
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,124
Otherwise known as rash
and liver damage. Fascinating.

70
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,161
Senator Anderson
sent this case to us

71
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,890
and personally
requested we take a look.

72
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,625
That's reason enough for me.

73
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,894
Black guy campaigning
for the opposition?

74
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,196
Does Obama know about this?

75
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,102
I tried calling him on the
Brother Hotline. He didn't pick up.

76
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,945
Martha M. Masters?

77
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,483
I'm Dr. House. This
is the rest of the team,

78
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,145
Boring, Bimbo and Bite-Size.

79
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,156
Martha enjoys quadratic
equations, Italian frescos,

80
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,385
and her turn-ons include
"learning to be a doctor."

81
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,289
Take a seat.

82
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,954
She's a med student?

83
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,090
Cuddy thinks she's
some kind of genius.

84
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,666
Say something brilliant.

85
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,430
Oh, I don't...

86
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,440
Capital of Azerbaijan. Baku.

87
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,533
Year Beethoven died. 1827.

88
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,668
Twentieth decimal
of Euler's number.

89
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,302
Six.

90
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,677
It's my favorite constant.

91
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,479
She's like the
Internet with breasts.

92
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,119
No, wait, the
Internet has breasts.

93
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,156
Our patient's liver
damage explains the rash

94
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,850
and cryoglobulins
we found in his blood,

95
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,550
but we can't explain
the liver damage.

96
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,370
He shows no other signs
of drug or alcohol abuse...

97
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,872
Now all you've got
to do is figure out

98
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,161
which one is Bimbo and
which one is Bite-Size.

99
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:02,566
Also which monster truck won
the 2004 Thunder Nationals?

100
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,336
Hep C makes sense.

101
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,499
Test came back negative,
same for Hep A and B.

102
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,237
The answer we were
looking for is Virginia Giant.

103
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,539
Feel free to chime in
on either conversation.

104
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,712
Hate to steal the spotlight
from Small Wonder over here,

105
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,377
but what about toxic exposure?

106
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,715
Tetrachloroethylene.

107
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,086
Could even be pennyroyal
or sassafrass oil.

108
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,591
Go to his house, get
me some chemicals.

109
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,059
If you wanna stay on this team,

110
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,225
have an opinion.

111
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,832
Oh, cool.

112
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,705
Tudor revival architecture.

113
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,439
Steeply pitched asymmetrical
roof over the entrance.

114
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,214
But it doesn't have the
half-timbering over the facade.

115
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,716
Doesn't say anything
about medicine.

116
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,685
Can't shut up about
architecture. Great.

117
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,550
I know. I don't know
what happened.

118
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,558
Being around House... He's
such a legend, he's so intimidating.

119
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,357
I'm not like that
around ordinary people.

120
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,092
Oh, not that you
guys are ordinary.

121
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,743
It's just that he's so brilliant

122
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,807
and you work under him,
so you're not as imposing...

123
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,273
I'm gonna be quiet. Good idea.

124
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,404
Dugan didn't give you a key?

125
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,968
If patients know we're coming,

126
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,890
they can hide something
relevant to their illness,

127
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,712
intentionally or
unintentionally.

128
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,444
Their knowledge changes things.

129
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,230
Are you a vampire?

130
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,961
It's okay. We're
inviting you in.

131
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,400
But our patient didn't.

132
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,996
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

133
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,145
Well, she's gonna be a big help.

134
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,677
Yeah, what a rube,
being uncomfortable

135
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,082
breaking into a
stranger's house.

136
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,362
It's part of our
job description.

137
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,150
Not the most morally
ambiguous part.

138
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,418
Give her a chance.
She's fresh, enthusiastic,

139
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,153
has no bad habits
we need to re-teach.

140
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,754
She's a med student with
no practical experience.

141
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,195
That means every
procedure, every blood draw,

142
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,130
she needs one of
us there to supervise.

143
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,964
Is this attitude about her not
having an M.D. after her name?

144
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,447
Because I wonder if it has more
to do with her being a brainiac.

145
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,598
That's not it at all.

146
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:20,917
I'm not thrilled
someone else might be

147
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,432
the smartest person
on the team now.

148
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,034
I can only imagine how you feel.

149
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,342
You're not smarter
than me. Oh, yeah?

150
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,013
You find this?

151
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,816
A jug of unpasteurized cider.

152
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,251
Could be tainted with E coli.

153
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,289
That's what's causing
the liver to shut down.

154
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,948
E coli is found in animals.

155
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,889
So unless he's
drinking pork cider...

156
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,150
Pork cider.

157
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,538
I need the number
of the patent office.

158
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,690
There are indirect ways
of contracting E coli.

159
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,029
Masters refused to go
on the search with us.

160
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,192
Interesting.

161
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,530
Which raises the question,

162
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,298
what is your problem with her?

163
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,636
He is intimidated
by her intelligence.

164
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,141
Why would that bother Taub?

165
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,688
He's been working with people
smarter than him for a long time.

166
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,810
I think perky new girl
makes him feel old.

167
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,974
She's basically the
same age as Thirteen.

168
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,178
She's a student, makes you
contemplate your med school days,

169
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,153
back when you had
hair, muscle tone

170
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,053
and no need for a
regular prostate exam.

171
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,488
Makes sense.

172
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,083
Just like E coli.

173
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,538
Orchards make cider out of
apples they can't sell otherwise.

174
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,531
Like if they've fallen
onto the ground...

175
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,395
Like into some cow feces.

176
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:25,335
Which would mean our esteemed
patient is literally full of BS.

177
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,498
Cool.

178
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,405
Go get the ingénue
and start the patient

179
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,706
on Aztreonam and plasmapheresis.

180
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,012
He said to start
the patient on...

181
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,815
The cell-sorter
separates the plasma

182
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,406
from the remaining
cellular components,

183
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,547
thereby removing...

184
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,251
The toxins, antibodies,
cryoglobulins.

185
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,089
I think we should tell our patient
about breaking into his house.

186
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,253
Why would we do that?

187
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,682
Because the
reason not to tell him

188
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,631
was that he might
hide something,

189
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,132
now that rationale is moot.

190
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,932
The rationale now is
no upside, big downside.

191
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,200
How can we ask our
patients to trust us

192
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,473
if we're not honest with them?

193
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,032
How can we ask
the patient to trust us

194
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,941
after we tell him
he can't trust us?

195
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,742
Fine. Tell him.

196
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,649
Clear your conscience
because that's what's important.

197
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,432
Well, if you had
let me run that ad,

198
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,324
everybody would be talking
about immigration instead.

199
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,070
All right, look, here's
what we're gonna say.

200
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,962
"Yeah, he was in Iraq and
we're all grateful for his sacrifice.

201
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,574
"You chose to honor
your country through

202
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,295
"public service and
have voted 46 times

203
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,336
"to expand the Pentagon's
budget for programs

204
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,906
"which, by the way,
Moreno wants to cut."

205
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,339
All right. I'll draft it
up and send it over.

206
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,138
You should probably slow down

207
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,839
until you're out
of the hospital.

208
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,138
It's a busy week.

209
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,789
Aren't you curious how we
came up with this diagnosis?

210
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,450
You're doctors.
Isn't that your job?

211
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,585
But how we knew you
were drinking apple cider.

212
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,459
You had to have
found that at my house,

213
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,259
so I guess you
guys broke in there.

214
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,462
It doesn't bother you?

215
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,799
Medicine is like politics.

216
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,871
At the end of the day,
all that matters is results.

217
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,033
That's not true.

218
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,268
Respect matters.

219
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,505
Honesty and integrity matter...

220
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,732
Have you ever thought
about running for public office?

221
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,477
Because I would love to have
someone like you as an opponent.

222
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,320
Watch the
replacement fluid line.

223
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,720
Oh, right, sorry.

224
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,489
You ever wonder why
American voter turnout rates

225
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,552
are among the lowest
in the developed world?

226
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,164
Mr. Dugan?

227
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,628
Mr. Dugan?

228
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,396
What's wrong? Can you hear me?

229
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,343
He's paralyzed. Call Foreman
and Chase. Get them down here.

230
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,006
Mr. Dugan?

231
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,746
We think it's a transient
ischemic attack.

232
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,731
The clot must have broken
up before we could find it.

233
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,816
He's temporarily paralyzed, but
he's regaining mobility and speech.

234
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:02,123
So what causes
rash, liver failure, clots

235
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,825
and the uncontrollable urge
to rat out your co-workers?

236
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,334
Oh, no, wait, that last one
was you, not the patient.

237
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,202
I wasn't trying to rat.

238
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,139
I was clearly trying to
honor my ethical obligation.

239
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,976
Portal vein thrombosis could
be caused by Wilson's disease.

240
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,377
Hooray!

241
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,344
You popped your cherry,

242
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,146
diagnostically speaking.

243
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,518
Unfortunately, first
time always sucks.

244
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,953
Pitch doesn't make any sense,

245
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,514
Dugan's cornea was normal.

246
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,217
You're obviously brilliant.

247
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,022
Why would you hide your mind?

248
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,488
I was brainstorming.

249
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,674
I'm not talking about your
stupid ideas about the patient.

250
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,394
I mean your stupid
ideas about morality.

251
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,230
My stupid ideas are
what most doctors

252
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,794
consider the rules for
professional conduct.

253
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,039
What about a
neuro-endocrine tumor?

254
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,872
Not without diminished mental
capacity, loss of judgment.

255
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,007
Disseminated intravascular
coagulation, however, fits.

256
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,050
Rules are just
helpful guidelines

257
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,312
for stupid people who can't
make up their own mind.

258
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,184
You obviously don't fit into that
category, so why put yourself there?

259
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,221
Masters is right

260
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,259
about a neuro-endocrine tumor.

261
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,386
Because, yes, Dugan
has had a loss of judgment.

262
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,054
He made this
totally inflammatory

263
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,497
anti-immigration campaign
commercial for Anderson.

264
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,659
It just got leaked online.

265
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,294
You're arguing Dugan's politics

266
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,813
are a sign that he's
mentally compromised?

267
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,397
No, his tactics. He's most
likely the one who leaked it

268
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,385
and all the commentators are saying
Anderson will catch a major backlash.

269
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,002
And honesty is a great idea

270
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,173
until your patient asks if her
distended abdomen makes her look fat.

271
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,410
House, I hate to interrupt
your ethics debate,

272
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,083
but we have two solid
ideas on the table.

273
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:38,416
CT from his neck to his abdomen
for neuro-endocrine tumors.

274
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,426
And run a D-dimer
and fibrinogen for DIC.

275
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,695
Masters,

276
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,368
if lying to a patient would
save their life, would you do it?

277
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,230
No.

278
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,741
That's a lie.

279
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:59,108
If your grandma gave you a
really crappy tea cozy for Christmas,

280
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,578
would you tell her you liked it?

281
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,412
Yes, but that's different.

282
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,922
So you lie when it doesn't
matter, but you won't when it does.

283
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,750
How'd you get so screwed up?

284
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,561
How mad would you
be if I fired Masters?

285
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,096
Very.

286
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,266
Unless you had
cause. Real cause.

287
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,261
Cause that a human
being would consider cause.

288
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,895
Never mind, then.

289
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,599
She's got principles.

290
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,666
She's like the love child of
Einstein and Mary Poppins.

291
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,975
Didn't even get Einstein's hair.

292
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,344
It's worth having
someone on the team

293
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,848
who doesn't see the world
entirely as shades of gray.

294
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,577
It is gray. To you.

295
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,682
She has a fresh perspective.

296
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,080
Unless that threatens you.

297
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,481
It does not...

298
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,795
You thought I'd get defensive,
keep her out of pride?

299
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,626
Girl can hope.

300
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,858
House,

301
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,499
I gave this a lot of thought.

302
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,763
She deserves a chance.

303
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,166
A real chance.

304
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,009
House is gonna fire me.

305
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,806
No, he isn't.

306
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,545
Because you told him not to?

307
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,486
Butting heads with
House is par for the course.

308
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,887
House has strong beliefs,

309
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,790
and he respects other
people with strong beliefs.

310
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,522
It's not my beliefs
that are the problem.

311
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,857
It's my personality.

312
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,364
I'm not good at working
with other people.

313
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,230
You've been in there
for less than a day.

314
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,566
I wasn't looking for
encouragement, it's a fact.

315
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,802
Growing up, my
whole life, really,

316
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,207
I spent a lot of time by myself.

317
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,188
No one in high school
wants to hang out with a kid

318
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,238
that's three years
younger than them.

319
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,907
And studying Anosov
diffeomorphisms,

320
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:48,545
determining whether an unattributed
landscape is a Blakelock or a Ryder...

321
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,053
I'm actually boring
you right now.

322
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:56,159
And yet, you chose medicine,
which is a team activity.

323
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,527
Pretty gutsy, stepping so
far outside your comfort zone.

324
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,532
I'm not trying to
prove anything.

325
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,097
I just wanted to be a doctor.

326
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,731
It was stupid.

327
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,173
Nobody can do everything.

328
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,579
I was vain to think I
could be the exception.

329
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,850
House doesn't care if you're a
team player, or how ethical you are,

330
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,787
or how high your IQ is.

331
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,726
It's all about the cases.

332
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,728
You help him crack this one,

333
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,457
you two are gonna
get along just fine.

334
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,064
We gotta give
Masters some pointers.

335
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,535
Help her figure out
how to deal with House.

336
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,367
Why would I do that?

337
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,068
The entertainment
factor is off the charts.

338
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:46,044
It's like watching a bunny
hopping into a buzzsaw, repeatedly.

339
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,876
And if we don't help
her, she's out of here.

340
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,974
No, something else is
stopping House from firing her.

341
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,111
I'm guessing it's his desire to
keep having sex with Cuddy.

342
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,521
<i>You guys ready to admit
you were wrong yet?</i>

343
00:15:58,758 --> 00:15:59,987
<i>Excuse me?</i>

344
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,827
This tumor you're looking
for, you're not gonna find it.

345
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,331
My judgment is completely sound.

346
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,658
<i>So when you leaked that ad,</i>

347
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,398
<i>you were trying to torpedo
the Senator's campaign?</i>

348
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:16,006
All right. One, I told you
before, I didn't leak that spot.

349
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:17,735
Uh-huh.

350
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,971
And two,

351
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,824
whoever did leak that ad had
nothing wrong with their mind either.

352
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,316
It's gonna save Anderson.

353
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,379
That commercial,
everyone sees through it.

354
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,764
You're just trying to
play to people's fears.

355
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:32,225
You say fears, I say
rational, protective instincts.

356
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,151
And judging by your accent,

357
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,026
immigration
probably isn't an issue

358
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,156
you can be real impartial about.

359
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,626
I waited five years
to get my green card.

360
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,341
If there's anyone who
would resent someone

361
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,167
trying to skip the
queue, it'd be me.

362
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,748
<i>But just because
Moreno favors amnesty...</i>

363
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,831
He doesn't.

364
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,652
You know that picture of
him with the Mexican flag,

365
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,838
seems to be from
a pro-amnesty rally?

366
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,982
That's from an Amnesty
International speech

367
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,984
protesting the imprisonment
of priests in Oaxaca.

368
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,947
<i>Yes, you did just
prove that that ad</i>

369
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,533
<i>is even more disgusting
than you thought.</i>

370
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,753
You also proved
that ad is effective.

371
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,021
You still think my
judgment is off?

372
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,496
Not anymore.

373
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,100
There's no sign of a tumor.

374
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,829
That leaves DIC.

375
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,943
I'll go check how Taub is
doing with the blood work.

376
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,655
I guess when you
get on in years,

377
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,857
it takes a little longer to
run a few simple blood tests.

378
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,511
This whole "Taub's an old
man" thing, kind of rings hollow

379
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,054
considering I'm in better shape
than you are. Pass the dye.

380
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,680
You're in rounder shape than me.

381
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,652
Tonight after work, meet at
the basketball courts in the gym.

382
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,457
You do realize you're two
and a half feet tall, right?

383
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,429
And white. And Jewish.

384
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,760
It'd be very embarrassing.

385
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,266
I get why you'd want to say no.

386
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,508
Tonight, after work.

387
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,597
Crap.

388
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,088
You hear Moreno's
latest stump speech?

389
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,471
He's gonna clean up Washington.

390
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,446
Yeah, right. Like any politician

391
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,108
from New Jersey
has ever cleaned up.

392
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,742
Who else knows that
you leaked that ad?

393
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,981
You and I had the
only two copies, Hal.

394
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,066
I don't care that you did it,

395
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,558
I just want to make
sure it worked.

396
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,821
This morning's tracking
has me within two points.

397
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,230
I told you.

398
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,578
We're gonna pull this thing off.

399
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,630
Your blood test for DIC
came back completely normal.

400
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,796
That's good news, right?

401
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,170
It means the two things we
thought it could be, it's not.

402
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,505
We checked your home
for toxins and didn't find any,

403
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,955
but it's possible you might have
been exposed on the campaign.

404
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,847
Have you visited any industrial
or agricultural facilities?

405
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,076
There was a tomato
farm in Lumberton.

406
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,394
Did they take
you into the fields?

407
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,819
No one wants a photo op
with me. I never leave the bus.

408
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,465
Were the windows
open? Certain pesticides...

409
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,752
Foreman?

410
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:49,922
What? What is it?

411
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,363
It's not just your liver
we have to worry about.

412
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,094
It looks like your kidneys
are having problems, too.

413
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,735
So this guy
spends his entire life

414
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,108
campaigning against
bleeding hearts.

415
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,044
Turns out, he has one.

416
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,174
Bloody urine actually is a
renal problem, not a cardiac one.

417
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,945
Yeah. If I say
something inaccurate,

418
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,282
assume it's for comic effect.

419
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,555
Then laugh, because it's funny.

420
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,558
TTP makes sense.
Where are his platelets?

421
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,184
Two hundred
thousand. It's not TTP.

422
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,886
What about
Henoch-Schönlein purpura?

423
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,122
HSP doesn't cause clots.

424
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,995
HSP doesn't usually
cause clots, but it can.

425
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,228
And the vasculitis would
explain the kidney problem.

426
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,735
She can't diagnose a joke,

427
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,465
but she's making
progress on the patient.

428
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,740
We treat with
chemotherapy or steroids.

429
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,242
We treat with chemotherapy.

430
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,335
I said chemo.

431
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,506
And then you said "or."

432
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,310
Once again, the
bunny meets the blade.

433
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,409
The road to dead patients
is paved with "or's."

434
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,679
Chemo is the more
effective treatment,

435
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,899
which means it will confirm
our diagnosis more quickly...

436
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,585
I agree, but there
is another option.

437
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,092
There are lots of other options.

438
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,991
There's bloodletting,
crystals, prayer...

439
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:57,690
Another medically
accepted option.

440
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,891
Which is both less
effective and less scary.

441
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,891
So the patient
might just choose it.

442
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,801
Unless, of course, we
don't mention it to him.

443
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,099
We can't withhold information.

444
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,074
If we explain both the benefits
and the risks of each treatment,

445
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,906
I'm sure Dugan
will choose chemo.

446
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,570
Well, as long as you're sure.

447
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,247
The better option
is chemotherapy.

448
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,013
It's faster and more likely
to completely cure you.

449
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,111
I'll take the steroids.

450
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,554
Oh, my goodness.

451
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,285
If only someone
could have predicted

452
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,759
that you'd make that
incredibly stupid decision.

453
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,659
The nausea and
fatigue from chemo

454
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,961
will only last a few weeks.

455
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,266
Our poll numbers have stalled,

456
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,030
that's five days
till the election.

457
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,703
Doctor, can you talk
some sense into him?

458
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,469
Would that I could, but ethics
dictate that it's his decision.

459
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,635
So all I can do now
is return to my office,

460
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,578
knowing that even as my
patient endangers himself,

461
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,548
my integrity remains
unblemished.

462
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,550
Please, take some
time to think about this.

463
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,089
I don't need any time. I
want to start on the steroids.

464
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,957
Game to eleven by ones.

465
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,398
Hold on.

466
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,597
Wanna shoot for outs?

467
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,903
You can have it.

468
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,414
One, nothing.

469
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,243
You're gonna guard me?

470
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,151
You can't hit two in a row.

471
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,284
Two, nothing. You're
gonna guard me now?

472
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,951
You can have that shot all day.

473
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,289
Three, nothing.

474
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,032
1-3.

475
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,170
10-7.

476
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:41,826
Seriously?

477
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,419
You're gonna beat me with that?

478
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,593
I was wrong.

479
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,931
You're not so old.

480
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,060
Thank you.

481
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:54,402
Now all we have
to do is figure out

482
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,567
why Masters is making
you feel insecure.

483
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,408
I was just down by Dugan's room.

484
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,495
They were gonna give
him the wrong medicine.

485
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,715
I tried to change the
order, but I'm not a doctor.

486
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,116
Good.

487
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,422
The wrong medicine
is the right medicine.

488
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,960
But he wanted
steroids, not chemo.

489
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,723
He wants to live.

490
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,290
I'm gonna tell him
what's going on.

491
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,731
No, you're not.

492
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,795
I don't mind your
morality, in theory.

493
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,100
But, in practice, you're
risking my patient's life.

494
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:28,702
So you're fired.

495
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,686
You think that's gonna
stop me from telling him?

496
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,236
If you do, I'll get you
thrown out of medical school.

497
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,147
I haven't done anything
that would merit that.

498
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,741
I know, but unlike
you, I'm willing to lie.

499
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,747
Firing her was a mistake.

500
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,692
We need someone like her on
the team, keeping us all in check.

501
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,007
You're incapable of noticing
when I do something inappropriate?

502
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,842
We're like the frogs who've
been in the pot for a while,

503
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:54,959
we're used to the heat.

504
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:57,594
Things have been just fine
without Pippi Long-Division.

505
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,950
Your opponent's out of the race.

506
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,666
You can drop the smear campaign.

507
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,368
Dugan's developed
pulmonary edema, it's not HSP.

508
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,272
Masters was right.

509
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,540
He didn't want the chemo,
he didn't need the chemo.

510
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,047
Masters was wrong,
he doesn't have HSP.

511
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,450
And Masters is gone.

512
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:13,611
Could be an infection.

513
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,967
We had him on Aztreonam
for the E coli, he didn't respond.

514
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,320
Schistosomiasis wouldn't
respond to Aztreonam.

515
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,551
That's a great idea,

516
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,719
if he was running a
political campaign in Africa.

517
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,625
Guy hasn't been out
of the country in years.

518
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,131
Who needs to travel when
you've got a giant fish tank,

519
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,531
loaded with tropical
fish, tropical snails

520
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,193
carrying tropical bacteria,

521
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,770
like schistomiasis.

522
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,534
Go break into his home,
get me some escargot.

523
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,576
Unless you want to ask
the patient's permission,

524
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,509
as a tribute to the departed.

525
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:46,343
Need a minute.

526
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,351
You said you were
gonna give her a chance.

527
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,449
I did. She used that opportunity

528
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,959
to endanger our patient's life.

529
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,656
By insisting he receive the
treatment that he asked for.

530
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,857
That's what I just said.

531
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,990
Your team is there
to challenge you.

532
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,677
I didn't fire her because
she's a challenge,

533
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,966
I fired her because she
is an immutable obstacle.

534
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,048
You gonna make me hire her?
How do you think that'll work out?

535
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,506
How do you think
that'll work out?

536
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:09,667
He's right. I'll just...

537
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,574
You will not quit this job.

538
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,211
What is going on?

539
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:17,147
I want her gone, she wants
to be gone. Why do you care?

540
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,647
You don't actually think she's
a younger version of you?

541
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,519
Because let me tell you,
you're not that smart, or moral.

542
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,853
Socially awkward, maybe.

543
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,155
She's a potential star and
I want her in my hospital.

544
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,026
No problem. Just find
her a different department.

545
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,696
I think I figured it out,

546
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:37,995
why Taub didn't like Masters.

547
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,749
Now you're getting
involved in this, too?

548
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,773
My previous source of
entertainment just got fired.

549
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,901
Exactly. She's gone. It's over.

550
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,774
She's totally moral and uptight,

551
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,246
which made Taub feel
badly about his cheating.

552
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,180
Can we get a move on?

553
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,551
He didn't like her even before
he knew about her morals.

554
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,054
From the minute he saw her.

555
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:00,015
So it's something
about how she looked.

556
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,254
All right.

557
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,589
No snails. Let's
get out of here.

558
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,061
Hello?

559
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,272
Yeah. <i>It's Foreman.</i>

560
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:17,568
What did you find?

561
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,770
Nothing helpful but...

562
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,189
<i>There's gotta be something.
Dugan's gone completely downhill.</i>

563
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,045
Now fluid's
collecting in his chest.

564
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,210
Where the hell are you guys?

565
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,547
In jail.

566
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,979
You gonna come bail us out?

567
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,450
Uh, kind of busy.

568
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,974
<i>Thank you all for coming
down here at this late hour.</i>

569
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,933
<i>I assure you I will be brief.</i>

570
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,826
<i>There has been a lot of
discussion about an attack ad</i>

571
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,997
<i>that leaked online
earlier this week.</i>

572
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,845
There you are.

573
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:57,850
I was starting to think that my
holier-than-thou-dar was malfunctioning.

574
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:02,578
Our patient's liver, kidneys
and lungs are failing,

575
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,316
I need you to help
me figure out why.

576
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:08,451
As I recall, you have three actual
doctors you haven't fired today.

577
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,756
They're in jail.

578
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:10,989
What? Why?

579
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,257
Prostitution.

580
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,030
So, you're re-hired.

581
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,938
It all started in the liver,
but where in the liver.

582
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,034
If in the ducts, then
primary biliary cirrhosis...

583
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,171
Yeah, I don't need to hear
your ideas. Just return the volley.

584
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,545
Primary sclerosing cholangitis.

585
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,483
Nope. His vitamin
A level is normal.

586
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,555
Gall bladder problems can
affect the liver. Cholecystitis...

587
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,835
He's talking about our
patient. <i>I've known Joe...</i>

588
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:41,986
Did you just shush me?

589
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,140
<i>For many years</i>

590
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,391
<i>and thought he was a friend.</i>

591
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:50,402
<i>That is until he leaked
this hurtful, hateful ad.</i>

592
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,199
I think he's lying.
Dugan said...

593
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,331
I think the technical
term is speaking...

594
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,571
<i>Dugan violated my trust.</i>

595
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,973
<i>And therefore I have
no other recourse</i>

596
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,072
<i>than to fire him
from my campaign.</i>

597
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:06,848
<i>Thank you and there will
be no further questions.</i>

598
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,583
Thanks for your help.

599
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,254
Oh. And you're fired again.

600
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,533
He screwed you.

601
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,107
That was a hell of a move.

602
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,938
He used the ad to
shore up the base,

603
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,944
fire the extremist
to hold the center.

604
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,139
No, I mean he
actually screwed you.

605
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,382
Taking weekend
trips down to Bunbury.

606
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,383
He's got a red blotch on his
hand, that's palmar erythema.

607
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:46,117
That and the fact that he's got a
permanent sheen of Nixonian flop sweat.

608
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,326
He's got Hepatitis C.

609
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,952
Which explains
all your symptoms.

610
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:53,123
That's great, but the Senator
and I have not had sex.

611
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,918
Well, then, the two of
you shot up together.

612
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,903
How many high-functioning
heroin users do you know?

613
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,735
Actually, quite a few.

614
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,839
Look, I know you've got Hep C.

615
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,067
So either you shared
a bed together,

616
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,240
you shared a needle,

617
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:10,849
or you shared a straw.

618
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:16,553
I'm talking about
coke, not Coke.

619
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,817
You can get Hep C
from doing cocaine?

620
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,350
Look, I will deny
it... Don't care.

621
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,225
They tested me for Hep C when
I came in here, I don't have it.

622
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:28,061
Well, apparently your liver picked
up a few of your campaign tactics.

623
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,931
It's hiding all your secrets
by producing cryoglobulins

624
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,699
so the Hep C tests
come back negative.

625
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,832
Now, I could look for
all the associated toxins,

626
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,500
but the plasmapheresis
got rid of those.

627
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,306
So, basically,
you've got a disease,

628
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,744
but there's no way to prove it.

629
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,178
It's pretty cool, huh?

630
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:44,406
What is that?

631
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:49,011
This is interferon. It delays
the onset of rigor mortis.

632
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,095
When did your lawyer say
he was coming to get us?

633
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,599
He said, and I'm quoting here,

634
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,563
"Soon."

635
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,934
I know...

636
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,571
The reason you hated Masters
from the moment you saw her...

637
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,767
Come on.

638
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:12,140
That was not the
first time you saw her.

639
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,473
That is brilliant.

640
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,411
It's really not.

641
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,550
Is that guy seriously
using the toilet?

642
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,112
Oh, my God, he's sitting down.

643
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,748
Don't try to change the
subject. Did you sleep with her?

644
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,727
No wonder he's in jail. Anyone
who would do that has no shame.

645
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,765
Or maybe he tried to sleep
with her, and she shot him down.

646
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,299
I don't know her.

647
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,801
Is he grunting? I
think I hear grunting.

648
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,565
You realize we're
not gonna drop this.

649
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:43,970
I didn't sleep with her.

650
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,844
I interviewed her for
Hopkins Med School.

651
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:51,179
So you're holding a grudge
because she chose a different school?

652
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,678
We talked for an hour.
She didn't remember me.

653
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:59,250
She remembers the 20th
digit of some math constant,

654
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,783
but she doesn't remember a guy
she had a one-on-one meeting with.

655
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,661
I barely remember you.

656
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,289
Mystery solved.

657
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,767
Now we can all
go back to our lives.

658
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,181
Great news.

659
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,441
I've decided to re-hire you.

660
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:26,985
Find another sounding board.

661
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,044
Dugan's got Hep
C... I'm not doing this.

662
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,214
But he's not
responding to interferon.

663
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,316
You must think I have
absolutely no self-esteem.

664
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,728
Ethics and self-esteem?
You really are a pain in the ass.

665
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,860
What treats Hep C
besides interferon?

666
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,162
Now you want me to talk?

667
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,396
Yeah.

668
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,897
Come on. Stop pretending
you're not gonna do this.

669
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,170
As much you hate me,
you hate failing more.

670
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,679
I didn't fail. You
fired me, repeatedly.

671
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,807
But if you walk away now, after
I just re-hired you, that's quitting.

672
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,552
A German research study showed

673
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,352
that 15% of patients with Hep C

674
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,188
were cured after
contracting Hep A.

675
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,524
Of course other studies
have shown that up to 85%

676
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,722
of doubly-infected
patients die very quickly.

677
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,595
So, in theory, if we can find
something that mimics Hep A...

678
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,998
There is one thing
that mimics Hep A,

679
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,593
Hep A.

680
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:19,898
Good work.

681
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,871
You're fired.

682
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,101
No.

683
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,511
Hep A could cure him.

684
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:28,877
Better chance it will kill him.

685
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,712
Tell the lab to release a Hep A
culture to me. We'll see who's right.

686
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,378
It's not an approved treatment
and exposes us to liability.

687
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,012
There's no way I
can let you do this.

688
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,056
That's an extremely
cowardly position.

689
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,552
Listen to the genius.

690
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,720
You're the one that
insisted he run this by me.

691
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,128
It's proper protocol for an
unconventional treatment.

692
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:49,633
But we shouldn't compromise
patient care just to avoid lawsuits.

693
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:53,569
What about the fact that we don't
have any proof he actually has Hep C?

694
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,198
That is a perfectly
valid objection.

695
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,300
Don't listen to her. She
doesn't even work for me.

696
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,777
If you really think that this
is the only way to cure him,

697
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,439
I will risk the lawsuit,
but I need to know

698
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,575
that he actually
has the disease.

699
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,777
Get me proof.

700
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,877
I've given you... Proof.

701
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:13,050
Get me proof he has Hep C
and then you can give him Hep A.

702
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,148
I can't.

703
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:15,454
You'll figure something out.

704
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,223
The two of you have a
combined IQ north of 300.

705
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,997
That's also true of five morons.

706
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,832
Go. Work.

707
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,299
So what do we do now?

708
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,919
Considering the fact that I'm
about to do something unethical...

709
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,935
Oh, right, yeah. I'm fired.

710
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:40,285
Missed you. We need a
false positive Hep C test.

711
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,116
And why would
we want to do that?

712
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,747
The world changes
when you're on the inside.

713
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,689
You just got to roll
with it once you get out.

714
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,625
You think he contracted
Hep C from the Senator, right?

715
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,356
Test Anderson. If he's positive,

716
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,773
that's evidence that
Dugan has it, too.

717
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:53,958
Evidence. Not proof.

718
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,001
Are we presenting this
to a jury of our peers?

719
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,278
That should be enough for Cuddy.

720
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:58,463
Should be, but it won't be.

721
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,769
The test for Hep C
is 99.9% accurate.

722
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,366
That means one in every
thousand tests is a false positive.

723
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,707
We do enough,
maybe we get lucky.

724
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,311
I smell like jail.

725
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,779
A false false positive.
That's the best we can do?

726
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,853
Okay, go do it.

727
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,209
I have a problem.

728
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,916
A medical problem.

729
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,650
Which could become...

730
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,159
I have lied to
Cuddy 10,000 times.

731
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,431
How do you think
she'd feel about 10,001?

732
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:04,332
I think you probably
already know the answer.

733
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,703
But it doesn't make any sense.

734
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,831
You don't understand why a woman

735
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,785
might be upset because
her boyfriend lied to her?

736
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,710
I wouldn't be lying
as her boyfriend,

737
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,336
I'd be lying as her employee.

738
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,813
That's not how
relationships work.

739
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,810
My patient is gonna die.

740
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,685
Does a lie guarantee he'll live?

741
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,582
No.

742
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,592
You've got two
choices, either be honest

743
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,992
and face the medical
consequences,

744
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,031
or lie and face the
personal consequences.

745
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,865
Now that you're my doctor,
you can't tell anybody, right?

746
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,764
Who would leak a story
about a sitting senator

747
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,204
who got Hep C
from doing cocaine?

748
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,114
You didn't fill out
any paperwork.

749
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,739
I'm going to run this test
under an assumed name.

750
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,449
Trust me, no one will
ever know you were here.

751
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,230
Blood test confirming Hep C.

752
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,898
He got sicker, his
viral load came up,

753
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,300
finally showed up on the test.

754
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,434
Thank you.

755
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:52,240
There was a time
when you would have

756
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,472
completely ignored my request.

757
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,481
It means a lot that you
respect me enough to do this.

758
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,380
I've come a long way, baby.

759
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,412
Now if you would only
hire a new team member...

760
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,587
I'm on it.

761
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,560
How would you like
to come work for me?

762
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,334
It's like I'm on a Möbius strip.

763
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:22,066
We've had this conversation.
You want this job.

764
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:27,236
Prove yourself to
me, no more games.

765
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:30,171
At least the current game
ends, others may start.

766
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,480
You have my deeply-flawed word.

767
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,086
What do I have to do?

768
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,086
Get Dugan to let
us give him Hep A.

769
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,937
And while you're figuring out
the best way to coax a patient

770
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,453
into a treatment that
has an 85% mortality rate,

771
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,829
here's some advice, don't.

772
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,366
I'm not gonna lie to him.

773
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,535
You have a math degree, so let's
see if you can follow along here.

774
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,003
You lie to him.

775
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,473
He definitely
consents, he might live.

776
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,677
You tell him the truth, like
last time, he might not consent.

777
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,679
He definitely dies.

778
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,514
Remind me what's
so wrong about lying.

779
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,553
We're going to inject
you with Hepatitis A.

780
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,824
That doesn't
sound like medicine.

781
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:18,796
I know it seems counterintuitive,
but in some people,

782
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,889
the virus can enhance
immune function

783
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,797
and clear out the Hepatitis C.

784
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,028
Some?

785
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,137
How many are we talking about?

786
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,136
A fair amount.

787
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:35,647
Give me a percentage. What
are the odds of this thing working?

788
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:41,244
There's an 85% chance
that this will kill you.

789
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:50,560
So you want to give me something
that works 15% better than arsenic?

790
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:54,758
Technically, it works infinitely
better because arsenic has a 0%

791
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,260
chance.

792
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,673
This is your only shot.

793
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,731
Both Dr. House
and I believe that.

794
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,208
He faked a blood test

795
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,575
in order to get you
approved for this treatment,

796
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,410
and then, he tried to bribe me
into lying to you about the risks.

797
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,609
If either of those
incidents came to light,

798
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,710
he'd be suspended and
probably lose his license.

799
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:17,881
I'm sure some other
people would suffer.

800
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,184
He's risking his career
to give you this chance.

801
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:26,527
He wouldn't do that if
there was any other choice.

802
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,732
I did it and I
didn't have to lie.

803
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,239
And you feel good about that.

804
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,502
Yes.

805
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:38,736
So I'm hiring an idiot.

806
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,540
You can pretend you wanted
me to lie, but you didn't.

807
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,257
You want the people on
your team to challenge you.

808
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,559
Otherwise, you'd just be a
bully instead of a great doctor.

809
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,348
You hired me because I don't
compromise my principles.

810
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,786
Or I want a front row seat

811
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,053
when you wake up and realize
how useless your principles are.

812
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,765
I don't want you to
just lie to a patient,

813
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,625
I want you to want
to lie to a patient.

814
00:39:58,296 --> 00:39:59,855
It's not gonna happen.

815
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,023
See you tomorrow.

816
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,752
I heard that Dugan is already
responding to treatment.

817
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,730
Yeah, his ALT level is
already beginning to normalize.

818
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,610
I want to apologize
for the way I've...

819
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,658
Wait.

820
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,469
You interviewed me, right?

821
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,572
For Hopkins?

822
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,634
Oh, my God. You're right.

823
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:48,812
Wow.

824
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,643
That memory of yours...

825
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,842
I wanted to say
something the first day.

826
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,951
I've felt really awkward
about the whole thing.

827
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,650
Don't worry about it.

828
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,324
Is this Grandma's tea cozy?

829
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,821
What?

830
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,993
Nothing. I'll see you upstairs.

831
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,166
If I knew hiring her meant dealing
with medical school paperwork,

832
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,002
I might have reconsidered.

833
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,175
You really got nothing better
to do than watch me sign this?

834
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,745
And miss the ultimate admission

835
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,474
that I was right about
Masters all along?

836
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,641
She had me when she
called you a coward.

837
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,845
You heading out?

838
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,351
I have to work late.

839
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,349
Gloating requires
a lot of paperwork.

840
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,525
<i>Thank you, New Jersey,</i>

841
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,661
<i>for re-electing me to
the United States Senate.</i>

842
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,308
<i>We ran a positive campaign,</i>

843
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:54,506
<i>a campaign about the dire
issues facing this great nation.</i>

844
00:41:56,814 --> 00:42:00,080
<i>There are many people who
gave their all for this campaign,</i>

845
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:03,450
<i>but there is one person
that stands out among them.</i>

846
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,482
<i>My beautiful wife
Loretta. Loretta?</i>

847
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,396
<i>Thank you.</i>

848
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,538
Do you know where the
Senator's records are?

849
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,597
House was treating
Anderson's campaign manager,

850
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:23,800
not the Senator himself.

851
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:24,875
Oh.

852
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,535
Why did you think
he was a patient?

853
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:28,944
House saw him in the clinic.
I guess it wasn't medical.

854
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,208
When?

855
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,084
Friday, around 3:00.

856
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,353
House's team ran a Hep C
test on Joe Dugan on Friday.

857
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,118
Can you look up the time?

858
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,389
Chase, Taub and Foreman
were running tests all night.

859
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,192
All negative.

860
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:52,365
Positive test at 3:17 p.m.

861
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:53,871
House ran it himself.

862
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,202
Is everything okay?

863
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,772
I don't think so.
