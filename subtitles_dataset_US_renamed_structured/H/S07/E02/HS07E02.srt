1
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,576
<i>Let's hear it for Della Cart.</i>

2
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,509
Dude, your sister
kicks serious ass.

3
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,781
Competed in the
boys' league this year.

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,219
Kicked their asses, too.

5
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:01,595
Nice job, Del. You...

6
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,342
I went faster on the
50-50. You were right.

7
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,770
All right. Who wants next?

8
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,962
Yeah, yeah, I'm a little biased.

9
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,341
Custom decks. Start
the bidding at 400 bucks.

10
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,430
Trust me, the kids'll force
their parents to buy them.

11
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,013
You got to see this.

12
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,132
You made a great
event today, hon.

13
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:41,693
Fast enough for you?

14
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,294
I'm already in a wheelchair,
what are you so afraid of?

15
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,272
All right!

16
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,934
That wasn't what I meant!

17
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,281
Della? You okay?

18
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,383
Mom, Dad!

19
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,497
We got to stop parking like
this. People are gonna talk.

20
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,297
Well, that's why I plan
on doing some talking first.

21
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:58,778
I want us to formally report our
relationship to Human Resources.

22
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,747
Okay. You get them,
I'll cover everybody else.

23
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,418
I would appreciate it if we could
keep it quiet until we had that meeting.

24
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,430
It's gonna be hard with me
grabbing your ass all day.

25
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,922
Grabbing stops at the threshold.

26
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,285
Of the parking garage.

27
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,021
Handicapped plates.
I get special access.

28
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,597
I just don't want our
relationship affecting our jobs.

29
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,695
Or the other way around.

30
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:32,203
Why, Dr. Cuddy, how
was your weekend?

31
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,108
I got a call about
a case for you.

32
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,983
14-year-old. EMTs think
her heart stopped while she...

33
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,544
Sounds great.

34
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,521
You haven't seen it yet.

35
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,216
I sense something
fascinating about it.

36
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,617
I'm gonna get us in to
see HR this afternoon.

37
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,629
Think you can hold
your tongue till then?

38
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,191
Mom!

39
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:53,890
Fine.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,320
People are gonna
know soon enough.

41
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,462
I think I can
hold it till lunch.

42
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,576
I'm seeing Cuddy.

43
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,714
Generally without
her clothes on.

44
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,650
Use your imagination. Hope
it's got a wide-angle lens.

45
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,591
You don't actually need that.

46
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,839
I'm gonna go check my
office for whoopee cushions.

47
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,195
This is not a prank.

48
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,755
This is not me
walking out the door.

49
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,670
Really? You and Cuddy?

50
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,163
For reals.

51
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,432
Foreman can translate.

52
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,599
So, junior miss everything.

53
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,770
Skateboarder, basketballer,
science clubber, seal clubber.

54
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,979
I'm actually guessing
with that last one.

55
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,209
Healthy one day, heart
arrhythmia the next.

56
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,979
Are you sure it's
a good idea to be

57
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,713
yanking on the chain of command?

58
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,187
Way to go, House.

59
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,175
I'm surprised you two
didn't get together sooner.

60
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,658
EKG, echo and head
CT are all spotless.

61
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,456
There's nothing on
her neurological exam.

62
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,191
Interesting. In favor,
indignant, indifferent.

63
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,129
I think I'd like the
female perspective.

64
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,064
Or Thirteen's. Where is she?

65
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,135
She's gone.

66
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,228
She said was taking
a leave of absence,

67
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,434
wanted us to think it was for
a Huntington's study in Rome.

68
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,619
They've never heard of her.

69
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,154
Cell and home phone
are disconnected,

70
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,703
apartment's already
been vacated.

71
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,743
And what's with the
death's head cane?

72
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,945
They didn't have a
death's ass cane in my size.

73
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,115
I guess we'll just have to wait.

74
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,791
Conditions that cause intermittent
heart arrhythmias. Taub?

75
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,953
Three years you've been trying to
game out Thirteen. Now you don't care?

76
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,894
Sorry, not caring
about Thirteen is not

77
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,829
part of the differential
for heart arrhythmia.

78
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,477
But you do get a home
version of the game.

79
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,596
Patient's brother has severe
congenital muscular dystrophy.

80
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,164
Life expectancy of about 25.
If she's had a latent case of it...

81
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,243
Wouldn't be
sudden-onset. Foreman?

82
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,888
Do you know something
about Thirteen that we don't?

83
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:49,405
She's entitled to her privacy.
Just as I'm entitled to a diagnosis.

84
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,143
And you're glossing
over Thirteen's departure

85
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,811
because you actually
respect somebody's privacy.

86
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,083
I agree. It's weird
of me not to care.

87
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,023
So either I'm a changed
man because of Cuddy,

88
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,503
or I'm pretending
to be a changed man

89
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,838
because I do know
something about Thirteen

90
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,139
and I'm trying to
throw you off the scent,

91
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,403
or I've just gone nutty-bananas
because I lost a patient.

92
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,764
All of which you are free to
discuss after I get a diagnosis.

93
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,428
If it's long QT syndrome,

94
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,482
any startling stimulus in that skate
park could've triggered the arrhythmia.

95
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,974
Loud noise, flashing lights.

96
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,601
Scare the patient to
death to confirm long QT.

97
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,545
Fine. If you insist, do it in a room
with one of those thingamabobs

98
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,930
that brings people back to life.

99
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,188
Scare test is insane.

100
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,814
The scare test is legitimate,
simulates real-world conditions.

101
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,860
This fling with Cuddy's insane.

102
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,689
Flare gun? Scary enough?

103
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,114
How about just telling her
we're planning this stupid test?

104
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,375
And I'm hoping House and
Cuddy are more than just a fling.

105
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,644
It's clearly mellowed him out.
He didn't even care about Thirteen.

106
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,588
Right, the guy who ordered us to
stop the patient's heart is mellowed out.

107
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,630
It's gonna be horrible,
because it's doomed.

108
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,906
Which is just gonna make
House 50 times more of a crank.

109
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,408
Firecrackers. We
can hide them under

110
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,004
one of those covered food trays.

111
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,313
Find any itching
powder in your hanky?

112
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,220
Any fake poo in
your desk drawer?

113
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,417
Yes, the lack of
dime-store pranks

114
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,688
is proof that you're
actually dating Cuddy

115
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,801
and not just mocking me
for being worried about you.

116
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,237
What do I have to do
to prove this to you?

117
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,368
Tattoo a cane on
her inner thigh?

118
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,266
Tattoo her inner
thigh on my cane?

119
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,372
You told everybody, didn't you?

120
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,839
Repeatedly.

121
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,585
This one's not buying
it. Need a little help.

122
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,907
I'm not selling it.

123
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,412
And it's time for our
meeting at Human Resources.

124
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,416
Human Resources. Now why would
I need to go to Human Resources?

125
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,142
House, you've been
to Human Resources

126
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,016
74 times in the last six weeks.

127
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,888
Never after doing this.

128
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,117
Well, I'm convinced.

129
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,922
Come on, one peck. Just
enough to arouse him a little.

130
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,628
Hey, I'm not even...

131
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,029
I didn't mean you.

132
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,328
If I confirm it, can we leave?

133
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,459
Yes.

134
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,136
It's true.

135
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,787
I've been more passionate
with my great-aunt.

136
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,780
Mabel? Up high.

137
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,353
Are we done here?

138
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,799
She didn't even ask me to cough.

139
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,203
I think you straightened
out my limp a little.

140
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,598
Now, how would you describe
the exact nature of the relationship?

141
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,877
Have you ever seen <i>Wild Kingdom?</i>

142
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:35,482
Those insects that rip their
partners' heads off after copulating.

143
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,649
It's a sexual relationship.

144
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,993
Go slowly now.
He's writing it down.

145
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:55,296
I believe that I can still
supervise Dr. House effectively,

146
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,270
but we both want to follow
hospital policy to the letter.

147
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:02,002
Our concern is to make sure
that there's no conflict of interest,

148
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,270
no liability for the hospital...

149
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,336
You think we're gonna
sue if things go south?

150
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,176
Let me tell you, she
actually does go...

151
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,476
House.

152
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,281
Let him talk.

153
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,787
I know that you're
not going to sue,

154
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:19,121
because you are both
going to sign love contracts,

155
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,952
consensual
relationship agreements.

156
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,996
Well, obviously
outside counsel will have

157
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,329
to review the
crotchless undies clause.

158
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,666
We'll also need to watch for
any favoritism toward Dr. House.

159
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,273
Does that mean she has
to sleep with everyone?

160
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,539
I promise not to give him a
raise or a promotion of any kind.

161
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,137
There's got to be a joke there
about keeping up with inflation.

162
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,146
Or bias against him.

163
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,277
Are there any supervisory issues

164
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,788
with Dr. House's
current caseload?

165
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,381
Nope. Current case is solved.

166
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,460
Patient has long QT,
we're gonna scare her

167
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,290
into a cardiac
arrest to confirm.

168
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,556
No, we're not.

169
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,359
Okay. No, we're not.

170
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,194
See? Everything
is under control.

171
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,197
I know you're still planning
your ridiculous scare test.

172
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,774
But the patient is nowhere near

173
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,673
sick enough to justify the risk.

174
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:14,407
An angiogram and an EP study
are much safer, and very effective.

175
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,484
Fair point. I'm not
doing the scare test.

176
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,915
I'd invite you to watch
me not doing the test,

177
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,600
but having not done
it many times before,

178
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,525
trust me, it's pretty
not interesting.

179
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,994
<i>House?</i> Scare test
was not approved.

180
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,934
Do an angio and
an EP study instead.

181
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,992
<i>First of all, that's
not as effective as...</i>

182
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,673
How come you're not doing
the more specialized test?

183
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,011
This test is virtually
just as effective.

184
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,574
And Dr. House puts a
premium on patients' safety.

185
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,346
But frequently changes his mind?

186
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,885
Hugo, give him
a break. I'm fine.

187
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,733
You should go to the
bathroom before we go.

188
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,437
We've been hydrating
you for quite a while.

189
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,787
I don't have to pee.

190
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:04,023
Once we start the test, you won't
be able to move for at least an hour.

191
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,124
I really don't have to pee.

192
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,700
How much fluid
have we given her?

193
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,394
2.5 liters.

194
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,948
When's the last time
you went to the bathroom?

195
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,440
Last night, I guess.

196
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,371
What does that mean?

197
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,240
Your daughter's kidneys
seem to be failing.

198
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:29,417
So what could cause her heart
to stop, and her urine not to drop?

199
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,516
House, I was expecting
your relationship with Cuddy

200
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,424
to complicate our
work long-term.

201
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,124
I am now concerned it might
be affecting us short-term.

202
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,291
All due respect.

203
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,525
None taken.

204
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:45,405
I listen to Cuddy all the time. She's
my boss. Also yours, by the way.

205
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,431
You'd listen, then tell her she's being
an idiot, and do whatever you want.

206
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,966
I find I can skip the idiot part
when she's not being an idiot.

207
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,080
And since the scare test
would've led to this same dead end,

208
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,345
she was right to stop it. Which
means your problem's about you.

209
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,343
This should be interesting.

210
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,910
Losers love company.

211
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,185
And if even a misanthrope like
me has a chance at happiness,

212
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,227
it's gonna be pretty
lonely on that landfill

213
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,194
of loser-dom you
call a marriage.

214
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,694
Heart, kidneys, go.

215
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,626
Could be Fabry disease.
Lipid deposition in her tissues.

216
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,759
Dad's history was clean.

217
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,067
What about protein deposits? They
wouldn't show in her parents' history.

218
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,638
Amyloidosis. Explains
both the symptoms.

219
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,268
Marrow transplant to treat.

220
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,812
Her brother's a match.

221
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,575
Confirm and do.

222
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,046
I've been experiencing
fatigue and weakness.

223
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:40,560
Wouldn't have anything to do with
the fact that you're 102 years old?

224
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,596
Usually he's strong as an ox.

225
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:43,823
102-year-old ox.

226
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,059
He has tingling in
his feet and his legs.

227
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,125
I want a full battery of tests.

228
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,226
Carbon dating?

229
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,772
I'll pay cash if
it's not covered.

230
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,399
It's nice of you to
float your friend...

231
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,105
He's not my friend, he's my
father. He's 22 years older than me.

232
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,614
Well, if that's true, he's
definitely had his jowls done.

233
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,917
Statistically, if he didn't
have these symptoms,

234
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,885
he'd be like most
people of his age,

235
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,785
dead for the past
several decades.

236
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,346
Do the tests, I'm sick.

237
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,448
You have a bad case
of natural causes.

238
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,458
Do the damn tests.

239
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,756
If the vial fills with sand,
we take that as a bad sign.

240
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,330
Hugo should be here.
Why'd you ask him to leave?

241
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,167
We wanted to be able
to discuss this openly.

242
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,036
But it obviously affects him.

243
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,336
Honey, let the doctor finish.

244
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,586
It's a standard procedure.

245
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,375
We use general anesthesia,
harvest a very small amount of his...

246
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,710
No. I'm not taking
my brother's marrow.

247
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:36,841
Del, it's...

248
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,848
These harvests are harmless.

249
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,318
With the meds we give,
there's almost no pain,

250
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,356
almost no risk of
infection... Almost?

251
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,225
His life's hard enough as it is.

252
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,991
<i>Small problem
with the treatment.</i>

253
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,228
Patient won't take
marrow from steel wheels?

254
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,069
We're finding another
match. And how do you know?

255
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,470
What other problem could there
be with a problem-free procedure?

256
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,509
Boys' sports, science club.
She's living his life, not hers.

257
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,836
Makes sense she's being
a self-denying moron.

258
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:10,213
She loves her brother, she's
thinking selflessly. How is that at all...

259
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,878
Moronic? Hmm. If I could only
think of a harm-free medical treatment

260
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,010
she'd turned down lately.

261
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,632
You're right. If everyone
were more selfish,

262
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,090
the world would
be a better place.

263
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,652
See? I can skip the idiot part
when you're not being an idiot.

264
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,923
Yeah, I had that same facial
expression for the first 48 hours.

265
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,535
Had another one, too, but
only for 15 seconds at a time.

266
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm happy for you. You're
happy for you. This is huge.

267
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:36,941
So who's gonna supervise you?

268
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,341
Cuddy.

269
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,310
I guess maybe that can work.

270
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,675
Maybe? Nothing's changed.

271
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,076
You showed up for
clinic hours, voluntarily.

272
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,916
Fine, a little bit has changed.

273
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,889
House, everything's changed.
You're sleeping together.

274
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,983
You want something
from her besides

275
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,325
sign-off on scaring
your patient to death.

276
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,420
You talked to Taub.

277
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,999
He's worried about
you. He's a jerk.

278
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,259
I'm worried, too.

279
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,358
Do I need to say it?

280
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,227
I want this to work.

281
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,269
I'm not doing
anything differently.

282
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,705
She changed my mind
about one diagnostic test.

283
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,607
And she was right.

284
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,606
Even though it's your
emotional default, stop worrying.

285
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,411
I can handle it.

286
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,043
I hear you're a pretty
fierce skateboarder.

287
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,787
I do okay.

288
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,255
All your activities,
don't they seem

289
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,056
like things a 16-year-old
boy would do?

290
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,964
Some people might think
you're trying to live his life for him.

291
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,426
I am.

292
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,031
Sort of.

293
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,096
I got into skateboarding when
some of Hugo's classmates did,

294
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,937
and he realized
he could never do it.

295
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:47,270
It's the same with a lot of
things. We live through it together.

296
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,579
And you're not worried you're being
selfless to the point of self-denial?

297
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,489
You've never been
inspired by someone?

298
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,223
Why don't you take your pills.

299
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,157
Need some help in here.

300
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,292
Hemothorax, we need
to bronch her now.

301
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,960
Clear an OR. She's
drowning in her own blood.

302
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,231
It's not amyloidosis.

303
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,982
She's bleeding to
death, out of her lung.

304
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,678
I want to fill a
quarter of it with foam.

305
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,186
That'd stop the
bleeding, all right.

306
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,183
Thought it made more
sense than diet and exercise.

307
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,283
And if she doesn't have enough
lung function left, you'll have killed her.

308
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,125
The only alternative is
slowly suturing the lung,

309
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,755
hoping the bleeding
stops in time

310
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,356
and she doesn't die on her own.

311
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,658
But we would walk
away with clean hands.

312
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,896
Except for all the blood.

313
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,842
You're right. Faster and
riskier is better. Foam the lung.

314
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,853
You got a green light?

315
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,393
No. Suture the lung.

316
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,921
Scalpel, rib spreader.

317
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,066
I can't handle it.

318
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,873
What happened?

319
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,172
She said yes, I heard no.

320
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,777
But I didn't actually hear no.

321
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,872
I just was sure that's
what she meant.

322
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:33,177
The way she tilted her head
and half-arched her eyebrow.

323
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:36,379
But what do I even
care what she meant?

324
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,220
She said yes, that's
all that matters.

325
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,556
I'm screwing this up.

326
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,398
It's not completely bad, House.

327
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,229
You care enough to pull your
punches. That's not a bad thing.

328
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,031
But you and Cuddy
have got to figure out

329
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,764
a way of avoiding this problem.

330
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,139
Set some ground rules.

331
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,304
Yeah. I have to
avoid this problem.

332
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,643
If I can restrict
our interactions

333
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,479
to places where neither
of us are wearing pants.

334
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,953
Yeah. That's not avoiding the
problem, that's avoiding the issue.

335
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,320
Since avoidance is my plan
for dealing with the issue,

336
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,157
technically, that's
not avoiding it.

337
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,328
Thanks. No problem.

338
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,499
The stitching worked. This time.

339
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,799
No guarantee bowing to
Cuddy'll work next time.

340
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:32,111
Heart arrhythmia, kidney
failure, and now a bleeding lung...

341
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,922
I don't want to criticize
your girlfriend, but...

342
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,075
Hey, you've been on me for
years to respect someone's opinion.

343
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,595
Just because I had to go outside
this group to find one I respect...

344
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,487
Multi-system involvement
centered in the lung. Sarcoidosis.

345
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,988
Doesn't explain the hemothorax.

346
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,986
TB can infect all three organs.

347
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,045
Skin test was negative.
What about Goodpasture's?

348
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,624
Affects the lungs, kidneys.

349
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,923
And autoimmune explains
the out-of-the-blue arrhythmia.

350
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,162
Goodpasture's it is.

351
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,965
Immunosuppressants
and plasmapheresis to treat,

352
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,299
kidney biopsy to confirm.

353
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,673
Dr. House!

354
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,646
Don't tell me.

355
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,484
Your father's hairline is
receding and he needs more tests.

356
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,953
He's 102, his next
test is an autopsy.

357
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,931
Look, I love the old man, but I've
got to get him out of the damn house.

358
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,100
He can't do anything without me.

359
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,636
He needs to be
in a care facility.

360
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,399
So tell him. He's a big boy now.

361
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,598
I can't.

362
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:38,373
I'm his whole life. But if
it comes from a doctor...

363
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:45,843
That's very generous.

364
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,385
When you were 30.

365
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,785
Pretend to run the tests.

366
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:57,793
And then tell him he
can't live with me anymore.

367
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,970
I didn't run into
you all afternoon.

368
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,606
I missed you.

369
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,907
Busy day.

370
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,182
Maybe we should
plan on lunch tomorrow.

371
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,388
Problem is, at lunch
you tend to wear tops.

372
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,359
This is much better.

373
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:45,209
Cuddy and I are naked. So
I'm having trouble focusing.

374
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,438
Use small words.

375
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,706
Kidney biopsy was clean,

376
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,772
so we re-checked a piece
of her lung from the OR.

377
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,716
You lost me. Sorry,
who is this calling again?

378
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:54,896
<i>It's not Goodpasture's.</i>

379
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,912
There's intimal thickening
of the blood vessels.

380
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,787
<i>And lymphocytic infiltrate.
We tested for LAM, it's positive.</i>

381
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,293
Plus her lung's fried. She
needs a donor lung to live.

382
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,386
<i>Which is the only
treatment for LAM anyway.</i>

383
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,974
Taub's gone to the
transplant committee.

384
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,364
They may have
found a donor lung.

385
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,563
So this call is
purely expositional?

386
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,704
We should really get dressed. I
told the nanny I'd be home by 9:00.

387
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,305
And I slipped the nanny 40
bucks, told her to stay till 10:00.

388
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:23,982
Really?

389
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,312
Really.

390
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,766
Good news.

391
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,270
<i>Surgery was uneventful.</i>

392
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,571
But the donor lung started
failing about an hour into recovery.

393
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,840
We know we're right about
LAM, tests confirmed it.

394
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,437
Well, that leaves
us with two options.

395
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,243
Her body is rejecting
the new lung,

396
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,909
or we should've
rejected the new lung

397
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,179
because it's infected.

398
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,652
Let's biopsy, see
which one it is.

399
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,848
No guarantee we'd
hit the affected spot.

400
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:06,482
If we give steroids for rejection,
it'd make an infection worse.

401
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,112
If we give antibiotics for
infection, it'd make rejection worse.

402
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,027
Which worse is worse?

403
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,842
If we treat her for infection and we're
wrong, she'll be dead within hours.

404
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,666
And if we treat for
rejection and we're wrong?

405
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,464
She'll probably
hang on a day or two.

406
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,597
You're assuming her rejection's
hyperacute. Odds are it isn't.

407
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,441
Got to head off the
worst worse first.

408
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,640
I studied under Dr. Seuss.

409
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,840
Start with IV methylprednisolone
for hyperacute rejection.

410
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:33,044
If that fails, we'll switch her
to broad-spectrum antibiotics,

411
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,485
and hope we're not too late.

412
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,524
Cat got your legs?

413
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:44,892
We just decided to give meds that
could kill the patient, based on a guess.

414
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,556
You need approval from Cuddy.

415
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,109
And she'll want to
take the safer course.

416
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,329
And you're gonna fold
like an origami crane.

417
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:54,066
So I'll just wait here until
we get our actual orders.

418
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,504
Fine. You do it.

419
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:01,411
Tell her she's being an idiot for
always choosing the safer course.

420
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,574
She's sitting on her ample, if
well-formed, bureaucratic ass

421
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,151
while our patient's dying.

422
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,016
We'll see who folds
like an origami shrimp.

423
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,750
You want me to get
Cuddy's approval?

424
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,356
I've gotta be
somewhere important.

425
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,722
Sitting at your desk?

426
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,758
I'm running late.

427
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,371
Forget the tests.

428
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,506
I think junior might have a
few words to say about that.

429
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,075
I love him but he can't let go.

430
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,712
40 bucks says he can.

431
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:48,591
I can't do anything without
him helping me like I'm senile.

432
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,563
If I go back there, I'm
gonna rip his throat out.

433
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,859
You sure you won't
warm up to him over time?

434
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:00,866
Skip the blood work.

435
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:05,570
Tell my son it's grim news, I
need to be in a nursing home.

436
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,307
A private room.

437
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,443
Make it a suite.

438
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,312
It'll be our little secret.

439
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:18,115
I sit around on my
"bureaucratic ass"?

440
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,555
I was relaying your words.

441
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,754
I said "well-formed."
I said "well-formed"!

442
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:25,743
What were you... I
needed to be aggressive.

443
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,126
You're an idiot.

444
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,743
She was siding with
Foreman's analysis.

445
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,828
The odds are against it
being hyperacute rejection...

446
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,098
Stop.

447
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,674
I agree with you. That was
our analysis from the start.

448
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:42,137
If you've got a problem with a
team decision, you come to me.

449
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,442
I'm sorry. I'll deal
with him later.

450
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,152
I said "well-formed."

451
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:59,155
People who have not seen Cuddy
naked should not throw stones.

452
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,959
She does have great cans.

453
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,998
Cuddy has House
on such a short leash,

454
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,869
she might as well start
giving him chew-toys.

455
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,841
Let's give the antibiotics
at least another hour.

456
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,708
Amazing. And House hasn't
given you one ounce of grief

457
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,145
for your complete lack
of interest in his love life.

458
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,878
Did it ever occur to you
that House is just happy,

459
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,463
and could give a crap about
other people's lives because of it?

460
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,457
Well, that's ironic
and depressing.

461
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,890
And by that logic,
the reason you don't

462
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,951
give a crap is
because you're happy.

463
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,692
Which means you've got
someone new giving you chew-toys.

464
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,491
You're one-fourth right.

465
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,967
Wait. Are you saying...

466
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:39,965
You're dating four women?

467
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,579
BP's dropping. Means the
antibiotics aren't working.

468
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:49,807
Put her in Trendelenburg.

469
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,374
Can we save the lung?

470
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,437
Believe it or not, we've
got a better chance now.

471
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,452
This means it's
rejection, not infection.

472
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,750
We'll start her on IV
methylprednisolone right away.

473
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,995
Wow. You hate salad. She's
really got you tied up in knots.

474
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,902
I caved. Through
an intermediary.

475
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,067
I need a plan C.

476
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:18,677
What you need is a plan that
you actually develop with Cuddy.

477
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,406
Antibiotics didn't work.
And then steroids didn't work.

478
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,076
Her new lung's ruined and
it's not rejection or infection.

479
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,914
The only two options were wrong.

480
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,114
Unless it's not LAM.

481
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,723
It is LAM, the
test was positive.

482
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,292
Then the test had to be wrong.

483
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,621
Deep fryer's working again.

484
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,460
Still working on that?

485
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:43,400
That was here when I
sat down. I need to think.

486
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:16,461
I want to make sure you're
trying everything to save my sister.

487
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:20,465
Everything. That must be it.

488
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,302
See, I thought you guys
checked the box marked,

489
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,001
"Try every other thing."

490
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,443
I'm the one that's
supposed to die first.

491
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,482
I'm the damaged one, not her.

492
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,172
She never even gets a cold.

493
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,478
Damage has a way of
spreading to everyone around you.

494
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,745
For example, your
obvious emotional damage

495
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,915
is now making me have a
philosophical conversation,

496
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,515
instead of dealing
with your sister.

497
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,359
See how that might be damaging?

498
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,162
Never?

499
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,053
When's the last
time you had a cold?

500
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,977
Any minor aches,
swelling, anything?

501
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:04,044
It's been years.
She never gets colds.

502
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,516
I didn't ask when's the
last time she mentioned it,

503
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,611
I asked when she had
one, even a tiny one.

504
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,989
It's nothing. Sometimes
my ears ache a little.

505
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,352
So now tell me the
rest of the nothing.

506
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,964
My chest, soreness,
some congestion...

507
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,694
You never said
anything about that.

508
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,968
I barely noticed it until that
skateboarding tournament in Denver.

509
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,066
How long ago?

510
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,507
A year?

511
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,909
Cold's nothing. When I think of
what Hugo goes through every day...

512
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,078
Yeah, we get it. Your brother,
the saint, his sister, the martyr.

513
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,718
Thank God you followed me.

514
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,667
Now you can go back to
the transplant committee

515
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,062
while I get confirmation.

516
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,223
Confirmation of what?

517
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,597
What causes low-level
cold symptoms for a year,

518
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:58,000
can ruin two lungs, is
immune to drug therapies

519
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,699
and gets worse in cities
nicknamed Mile-High?

520
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,001
A clotting disorder?

521
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,975
She has a nasty
case of sickle cell trait.

522
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,874
Her heart arrhythmia
wasn't sudden at all.

523
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,243
The screwed up blood cells
screwed up the blood vessels,

524
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:11,181
which gave us the
screwed up positive for LAM.

525
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,185
If she'd told us about
her symptoms sooner,

526
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,186
like, ever, she
might not be dying.

527
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,346
You were right after all.

528
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,445
I never said sickle...

529
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:21,550
If everyone were more selfish,
the world would be a better place.

530
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,426
So she's gonna die.

531
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,795
Unless we can find...

532
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,199
She burned through
one donor lung,

533
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,795
transplant committee's never
gonna give her a second one.

534
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,103
Well, then, I guess
you're right again.

535
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,908
Unless we don't
need their approval.

536
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,926
You can't advise
your patient's parents

537
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,521
to take marrow and
half a lung from their son.

538
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:02,028
Guess I could just chat
with them about the weather.

539
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,763
But the blood tests just
confirmed sickle cell trait,

540
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:08,637
so they might be curious
about the only treatment option.

541
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,539
Though we are having
weird weather lately.

542
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:14,408
There is a huge reason not to
take lungs from living patients.

543
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,674
So their siblings can die?

544
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:17,750
Their son has CMD.

545
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,615
As it is, he's gonna die
of respiratory failure by 25.

546
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,526
We could cut whatever
time he has left in half.

547
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,318
That qualifies as a bad reason
for them to reject the idea.

548
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,435
It's a much worse reason
for them not to get the choice.

549
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,621
It's coercive to tell them.

550
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,186
You ever hear of "do no harm"?

551
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,788
That was second year,
right? I had mono all that fall.

552
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,163
Their son's not
even our patient.

553
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,787
Why don't we just
take half a lung from

554
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,313
some guy in the
clinic with a toothache?

555
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,581
It's a great idea. Now I can
give the parents two options.

556
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,541
We don't compromise
one life for another.

557
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,541
Okay.

558
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,884
"Okay"? Seriously?

559
00:30:58,724 --> 00:30:59,851
You made an argument.

560
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,231
If you don't want me to defer
to you, why make it at all?

561
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:07,364
But are you deferring to me just
because we're seeing each other?

562
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,197
Maybe.

563
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,335
Yeah. I think so.

564
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:21,036
Look, this is screwing me up.
Why is it not screwing you up?

565
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,076
It is.

566
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,150
I don't know why I okayed
you foaming that lung.

567
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,382
I realized it was wrong
as soon as I said it.

568
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,358
I knew it! I knew when
you tilted your head.

569
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:37,885
House, we are screwing this up.

570
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,892
I'm gonna call HR.

571
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,267
And find someone else to
supervise you, as soon as they can.

572
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:04,917
I've got your test results.

573
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,358
You have the
metabolism, blood counts,

574
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,727
liver and kidney
function of a 92-year-old.

575
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,595
Which is great
'cause you're 102.

576
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,191
What's not so great is the
average life expectancy is 78.

577
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,013
It is my recommendation
that you move into a home

578
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,699
with round-the-clock care.

579
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,209
I can't believe it.

580
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,879
Can't my son give me
round-the-clock care?

581
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,312
Not unless you've done
your two-year certification

582
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,247
in Tiburon swab technology.

583
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,046
There must be some other way.

584
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,519
Just because he
has a little tingling,

585
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,921
and some trouble
feeling hot and cold,

586
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,253
and some difficulty...

587
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,623
You can't feel hot and cold?

588
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,128
Not lately. But at my age...

589
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,061
Show me your teeth.

590
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,099
Dentures. Fairly worn.
I'm guessing 10-years-old.

591
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,465
Show me your denture cream.

592
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,575
Why would he
carry denture cream?

593
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:05,811
Because he has zinc poisoning.

594
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,780
To get it from denture cream,
he'd have to take so much of it.

595
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,498
Trust me, he never
leaves home without it.

596
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,990
How much do you use, Pop?

597
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,491
About a tube a day.

598
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,588
I buy it online. So
what does this mean?

599
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,358
Bizarrely, this explains
all your symptoms.

600
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,692
Better-fitting
dentures, you'll be fine.

601
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,597
Medically, there's no
reason to go anywhere.

602
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,811
Hospital rebate.

603
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:40,482
You might want to put it
toward couples therapy.

604
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,834
The transplant committee's
never gonna give

605
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,964
my daughter another
lung, are they?

606
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,063
No.

607
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,069
Are there any other options?

608
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,512
We're looking into it.

609
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,638
Looking into what?

610
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,012
Please.

611
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,853
Tell me, give me
some kind of hope.

612
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:20,424
I'm afraid I can't do that.

613
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:24,690
We're talking about my daughter's
life, what can't you tell me?

614
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:31,360
If there's any chance
you can save her,

615
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,171
anything you can try.

616
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:44,571
We can take marrow and
half a lung from your son.

617
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:49,884
It would likely shorten
his life significantly.

618
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:56,126
He'd never be able to go on
a respirator if he needed to.

619
00:34:56,227 --> 00:35:00,562
Most people with CMD need to as
their respiratory function declines.

620
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:12,774
How long do we have to decide?

621
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,181
Morning at the latest.

622
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,453
Thank you.

623
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,422
Where are my parents?

624
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,724
They're probably dealing with
committee issues or something.

625
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,890
They were arguing.

626
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:13,728
I saw my mom crying, looked
like my dad was yelling at her.

627
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,665
They care about you a lot.

628
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,310
Hugo was a marrow match.

629
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,846
We're way past that now.

630
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,992
They want a lung from him,
too. Is that what this is about?

631
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:43,101
No. It's nothing you
need to worry about.

632
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,638
Everybody's working on getting
you the best care possible.

633
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:06,048
How do they expect
us to go on from here?

634
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:12,222
We make a choice,
we live with it.

635
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,000
There's no living with it,
no matter what we decide.

636
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,583
Still cold and clammy,
she had a respiratory arrest.

637
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,121
Oh, my God!

638
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,434
What is she doing here?

639
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,184
She figured out
what was going on.

640
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,392
She's pinking up.

641
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,696
She must have yanked
off her IVs and oxygen.

642
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,834
Came here to die.

643
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,143
<i>By unhooking herself
from everything,</i>

644
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,154
<i>she delivered a hypoxic
insult to her body.</i>

645
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,520
<i>It started a downward spiral.</i>

646
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:16,959
<i>If you're gonna make a decision,
you're running out of time.</i>

647
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,602
HR can't find you
a new supervisor.

648
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,037
How come?

649
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,932
Because you're
unsupervisable, House.

650
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,610
Two department
chairs threatened to quit.

651
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,077
Well, I guess we're
stuck with each other.

652
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,218
I have no idea why
I'm making this call,

653
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,619
or if it's the right
call to make.

654
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,887
But if you feel strongly
about presenting

655
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,985
the parents your
treatment option,

656
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,357
you can do it.

657
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,126
Thank you. I will.
Several hours ago.

658
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,198
You told them?

659
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,796
I told him. He
came to my office.

660
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,711
I'm sorry.

661
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:14,653
Well, I should probably
be more mad at you.

662
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,783
Yeah.

663
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,558
Dr. House?

664
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:24,723
We've decided.

665
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,493
We're not gonna take
the lung from our son.

666
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,232
She's still on the waiting list.

667
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:34,949
We're gonna do whatever
we can to find her another...

668
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:38,808
What ginormous crack pipe
have you people been sucking on?

669
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,034
House!

670
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,322
Are you gonna
pretend that you're not

671
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,556
choosing your own
daughter's death?

672
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,878
Our daughter doesn't want it.

673
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,143
Probably doesn't want
to floss her teeth either.

674
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,446
She's a mindless teenybopper.

675
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,713
Don't put this on them.

676
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,464
What do you mean
"put it on"? It is on them.

677
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,466
As much as they may want
to "pass the lung" here...

678
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,086
Of course they do. You're
handing them an impossible choice...

679
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,696
Life has handed
them a crappy choice.

680
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,356
And they're picking
the crappier option.

681
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,366
Trading who-knows-how-many
healthy decades

682
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,096
for four or five years in which
roller-boy will be a limp rag.

683
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,728
Not everything is
a math equation.

684
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,883
You need me to explain the
difference between decade and year?

685
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,341
Their son is a human being.

686
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,877
You know what they
are, right? Intrinsic value.

687
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,071
We don't get to decide...

688
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,256
Come on. We do it every day.

689
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,757
The two of them
needed the same lung...

690
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,409
He needs to keep
the one he's got.

691
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,748
You don't get to play
God by ripping out...

692
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:23,378
That train left the station when
we learned to do transplants.

693
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,886
The rest is just paper-pushing.

694
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:27,687
And of course now, we're
onto your real area of expertise.

695
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,727
I thought we were
moving onto yours,

696
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:34,562
bullying your patients into
embracing your own lack-of-a-moral...

697
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,294
Hugo, honey...

698
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,150
We didn't mean for
you to hear any of this.

699
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,534
Hugo, please.

700
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,286
I want you to take half my lung.

701
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,453
No.

702
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,564
I am not.

703
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,603
You do so many great things.

704
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,099
I just watch.

705
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:20,270
I get to watch and
coach and cheer.

706
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,981
But that's not me out
there. Never will be.

707
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,255
If you take this piece
of me, carry it with you,

708
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:37,759
then I really can share
in everything you do.

709
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,629
This is the great thing
I can do with my life.

710
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,835
Don't make me live without you.

711
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,101
We got lucky.

712
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,510
I did give them an
impossible choice.

713
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,745
The kid took it away from them.

714
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,852
That fight

715
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:41,590
was the first honest interaction

716
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,094
you and I have had since
we came back to work.

717
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:50,033
If we're painfully, brutally
honest with each other,

718
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,002
maybe we'll get lucky again.

719
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:57,973
You've got a big ass.
