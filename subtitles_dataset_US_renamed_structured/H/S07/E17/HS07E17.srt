1
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,142
One small step for man.

2
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,181
One giant waste of
your monthly allowance.

3
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,748
Safety's disengaged.

4
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:24,781
We are go for launch in
five, four, three, two, one.

5
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,489
That was freaking awesome!

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,298
Whoa.

7
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,501
Aw, jeez, come on.

8
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,717
My father's gonna kill me.

9
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,159
Can I film that, too?

10
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,903
Whoa.

11
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,805
What?

12
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,746
Oh, man. Is that guy dead?

13
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,086
I think so.

14
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,663
Get the rest of the flames out!

15
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,337
You gonna be okay, mister?

16
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,079
It smells like...

17
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,739
Like liquorice?

18
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,115
Think House is coming in today?

19
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,483
Maybe if we start
offering spa treatments.

20
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,946
He already jumped
off of a hotel balcony.

21
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,919
Who knows what he'll do next?

22
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,790
Ride some kind of
prostitute chariot to work?

23
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,072
First person to offer me an
interesting case gets to ride her,

24
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,166
single or double team.

25
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,113
My scooter.

26
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,313
Which now said out loud
sounds even more inappropriate.

27
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,648
Seriously? You're
bringing them to work now?

28
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,448
23-year-old homeless man brought

29
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,490
into the ER with
burn injuries and...

30
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,581
Let me guess. The
diagnosis was fire?

31
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,093
He said his burning
flesh smelt like liquorice

32
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,290
and the ER antiseptics
like blueberry muffins.

33
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,460
Cool.

34
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,464
Dysosmia could be anything
from an environmental factor

35
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,507
to an early sign of a
degenerative brain disease.

36
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,972
Smells like a winner.

37
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,606
Okay, you and Chase go check
out the park where they found him.

38
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:38,448
You two, load him up with
prednisone, give him an odor ID test.

39
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,488
If he's still mistaking
his body odors for candy,

40
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,717
problem's definitely
in his brain.

41
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,454
Also find out what
else he's lying about,

42
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,656
since I'm assuming Ferris
Bueller is not his real name.

43
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,858
Why?

44
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,728
Seriously, who is that?

45
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,030
They say he's a righteous dude.

46
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:04,634
And before I forget, I
want you to meet Dominika.

47
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:08,409
She's about to become a
permanent member of Team House.

48
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,977
Nice to be meetings you all.

49
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,314
Doing what exactly?

50
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,409
Me.

51
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,769
We're getting married on Friday.

52
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,083
Mount up.

53
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,471
I don't think that two
people are supposed...

54
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,020
Living on the edge, baby doll.

55
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,259
How's the arm? Hmm?

56
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,029
It hurts.

57
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,332
Do I have to check out now?

58
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,400
Not until we figure out why
your sense of smell is off.

59
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,276
When was the first
time you noticed it?

60
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,943
Maybe a couple months ago.

61
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,894
We also need you to
tell us your real name

62
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,581
so we can review
your medical records.

63
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,248
I didn't ask to come here.

64
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,088
Okay, I'm not
paying for any of this.

65
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,459
Don't worry, I don't think the collection
agency has an office in the park.

66
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,266
I don't have a medical history.

67
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,596
I've always been healthy.

68
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,567
What about those
scars and burn marks?

69
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,069
Lean forward.

70
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,052
My Dad.

71
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,684
We didn't exactly get
along when I was a kid.

72
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,251
How many times
were you hospitalized?

73
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,427
Never.

74
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,925
He was good at it.

75
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,275
Made sure he never did anything

76
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,271
that couldn't be covered
up by a sweatshirt.

77
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,572
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,744
No, don't be.

79
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,404
I'm not.

80
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,971
The past is the past, that's
why I don't like talking about it.

81
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,496
You can't ride
that thing in here.

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,502
Speaking of things, I'm
having one on Friday.

83
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,403
If you want to drop by,
we'd love to have you.

84
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,467
No pressure.

85
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,836
You're still standing on it.

86
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,836
So I am. Perhaps
you're not familiar

87
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,608
with the New Jersey
handicap ordinances.

88
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,943
Or perhaps I am.

89
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:29,188
They apply to wheelchairs and
powered scooters only. Not toys.

90
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,918
Have you any idea
how much this toy costs?

91
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,255
I don't care.

92
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,171
For some reason, my leg's
been hurting a lot this week.

93
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,824
For some reason,
I still don't care.

94
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,560
Fine. I'll return it.

95
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,126
Do I have to walk
it out of here?

96
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,800
Stop.

97
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,204
I'll make an
exception, for your leg.

98
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,139
But next time,
check with me first.

99
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,550
Congratulations on
your engagement.

100
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,186
I hear a strange voice.

101
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,864
A very soft-looking man.

102
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,400
Must be the Wilson.

103
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,833
I know we said no secrets,

104
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,996
but I think I need to take
this alone, honey bunny.

105
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,899
Okay.

106
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,668
Nice to be meeting you.

107
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,887
You're trying to
screw with Cuddy.

108
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,424
Yeah, it's the classic
"you dumped me

109
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,517
"so I'm gonna get
married a week later" ruse.

110
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,092
'Cause not only
is she that stupid,

111
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,893
but apparently I'm that stupid.

112
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,263
Then what? You're
openly mocking marriage?

113
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,647
Trying to prove
it means nothing?

114
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:49,897
It doesn't,

115
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,768
but you proved that
yourself years ago.

116
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,899
I'd love to keep guessing, but
I've got people with tumors waiting.

117
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,740
Why do you want us to think
that you're getting married?

118
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,076
Only one theory left. I am.

119
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,283
Dominika needs a green card.

120
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:08,014
So you're just doing some
random stranger a favor? It's illegal.

121
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,081
People go to jail for
that, pay huge fines.

122
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,915
Have you seen me
practice medicine?

123
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,072
You know how much it
costs to have a live-in maid,

124
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,430
personal assistant, cook,
massage therapist, whore?

125
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,135
I do.

126
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,206
She's willing to work
four days a week for free.

127
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,901
It's gonna save
me about $33,000,

128
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,138
and all I have to do is say
two stupid words, "I do."

129
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,481
And if she doesn't
see it this way?

130
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,554
Ironclad pre-nup. We
go our separate ways.

131
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,153
Your stunned look,
I take it, is your way

132
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,455
of saying, "Brilliant
idea, House."

133
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,567
Wow.

134
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,401
You look different.

135
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,876
The prednisone
has had time to work,

136
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,312
so we need to give
you the odor ID test now.

137
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,275
Sure.

138
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:12,114
We need you to tell
us what you smell.

139
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,318
Oh.

140
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:18,415
Something spoiled,
maybe rotting meat?

141
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,621
It's baby powder.

142
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,102
I kind of like that
one. Peppermint?

143
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,168
It's extremely bad body odor.

144
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,670
You got to admit, that one's
kind of a good deal for me.

145
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,709
My backpack. Oh.
Where'd you find it?

146
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,187
In the park, right next
to a big pile of questions.

147
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,690
What kind of drugs
you shooting up?

148
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,056
Vitamin supplements. I've been
trying to boost my immune system.

149
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,894
All right, test me if
you don't believe me.

150
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,079
Ferris tell you
his real name yet?

151
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,537
Peter Johnson.

152
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,000
Danny Jennings.

153
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,972
I bought those books used.

154
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,477
All from the same guy?

155
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,345
I'm sorry, but I think I
should check out now and...

156
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:18,943
What's wrong?

157
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,816
Oh, my stomach...

158
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,247
Gastrointestinal bleeding.

159
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,420
Is anyone else
disturbed by this?

160
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,393
What?

161
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,532
She offered.

162
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,002
Danny may have
lied about his name,

163
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,062
but he was telling the
truth about the vials.

164
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,573
Tests confirm they
were vitamin A and B-12.

165
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,837
He also enjoys vitamin H.

166
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,071
Kid's a junkie.

167
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,672
Tox screens were
negative for drug use.

168
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,909
His hair wasn't.
I had it tested.

169
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,181
Because unlike Santa
and the Easter bunny,

170
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,656
homeless, non-mentally
ill 20-somethings

171
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,091
without drug
problems don't exist.

172
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,685
He was a heavy user
sometime in the last five months.

173
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,094
Wow, that was
incredible. Thank you.

174
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,728
No, thank you. I like men
with the big, strong, sexy feet.

175
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:12,702
He really puts the
mani in the pedi.

176
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,741
If he has a history
of snorting heroin,

177
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,367
he could've caused
the dysosmia himself.

178
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,742
But we still need to explain
the bleeding in his GI tract.

179
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,643
Vitamin injections
could have caused that.

180
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,079
Hypervitaminosis A syndrome.

181
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,582
So his symptoms
aren't connected?

182
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,448
House, you buying this?

183
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,821
Not usually.

184
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,924
But this guy has been
sleeping on a bed of dog poop.

185
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,670
I wouldn't be surprised if
he's got six different symptoms

186
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,787
for six different reasons.

187
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,296
The bleed could be
caused by a GI obstruction.

188
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,799
Vitamin OD makes sense
and it's easier to treat.

189
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,961
Give him tocopherol and zinc
supplements for the excess vitamin A.

190
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,596
If we're right, he could
go homeless tomorrow.

191
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,734
And if we're wrong, his intestines
could get further distressed

192
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,675
while we ignore
the GI obstruction.

193
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,542
See what happens
when women don't have

194
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:55,514
to serve men to
stay in the country?

195
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,413
They get all uppity.

196
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,309
This is why we
invented green cards.

197
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,212
Go x-ray the guy's abdomen,

198
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,450
if it'll make you
feel all equal.

199
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,163
I need a favor.

200
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,798
I want to add my fiancée's name

201
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,035
to my health insurance
a few days early.

202
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,544
She wants to get a tooth
capped before the big day.

203
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,012
I'm not signing this. I agree.

204
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,147
I think she looks
beautiful the way she is.

205
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,719
Oh, no. Wait. You're not
signing that for moral reasons?

206
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,490
You're declaring yourself
the sole arbiter of true love?

207
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,724
'Cause you covered
Taub's wife for years.

208
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,532
It's fraud.

209
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,039
She wanted me to bribe you
like they do back in the old country.

210
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,572
Tell her what I said.

211
00:12:58,645 --> 00:12:59,806
This is America.

212
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,211
The land of the home,
and the free of the braves.

213
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,386
I just get teary-eyed every
time I hear her say that.

214
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,715
She brought you a gift.

215
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,914
Almond kulich.

216
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,980
I make with own
hands. It's delicious.

217
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,286
Almond kulich.

218
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,486
How do you say no to that?

219
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,156
You realize if I do sign this

220
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,790
and you don't get
legally married,

221
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,925
you'll lose your
insurance with our carrier.

222
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,163
Yes.

223
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:29,735
Fine.

224
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,902
It's your life.

225
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,439
I wish you both
the best with it.

226
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,576
Thank you.

227
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,482
North, Miss Teschmacher!

228
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,490
Your blood test was clean,

229
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,589
but your hair showed heroin use.

230
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,462
I've been clean over
three months now.

231
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,004
How'd you kick it?

232
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,868
I had to die first.

233
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,675
I OD'd back in November.

234
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,678
And they said I was clinically
dead for several minutes.

235
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,135
It was like God gave
me a second chance

236
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,948
to do things right this time.

237
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,155
You're saying God cured you?

238
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,383
No.

239
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,356
State rehab cured me.

240
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,322
But I should be
dead, but I'm not.

241
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,857
That has to mean something.

242
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,466
I mean, I must be
here for a reason, right?

243
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,872
Did you figure out the reason?

244
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,574
My goal is to become
a doctor one day.

245
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,343
I am smart.

246
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,035
I mean, I got a scholarship
for pre-med out of high school.

247
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,582
Chase?

248
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,651
Look.

249
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,524
We found 13 masses spread
across the wall of his colon,

250
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,396
ranging from 2 to 8 millimeters.

251
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,544
They can't be tumors. Edges
are too sharp and defined.

252
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,746
I thought they
might be parasites,

253
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,205
but we didn't see any movement
between x-ray exposures.

254
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,265
And no larvae or eggs were
observed in any of the stool samples.

255
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,619
Which is kind of surprising

256
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,839
for a homeless
junkie living in a park.

257
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,076
Ex-junkie. He claims he's
been clean for over three months.

258
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,515
And he's not planning
on staying homeless.

259
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,551
He's trying to
protect his health,

260
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,953
which is why he's been
taking vitamin supplements.

261
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,182
He wants to be a doctor.

262
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,535
He's just telling you
what you want to hear.

263
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,687
Once an addict,
always an addict.

264
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,666
Can you please not
do that in front of me?

265
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:34,757
Doubt it.

266
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,696
You're the main
reason I'm on the stuff.

267
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,197
We could be looking
at fungal masses

268
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,798
hanging off the
walls of his colon.

269
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,706
Start him on
amphotericin B tonight,

270
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,336
and in the morning, run a scope
up where the sun don't shine

271
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,886
and see if you can
find any truffles.

272
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,812
I think we should boycott
this wedding on principle.

273
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,947
I kind of have to go.

274
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,322
His fiancée did give
me a foot massage,

275
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,328
and he invited me to
be in his wedding party.

276
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,158
What about Chase? He ask him?

277
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,425
Yeah, he's in it.

278
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,727
What the hell?

279
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,927
You just said you
weren't even going.

280
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,470
I still have feelings.

281
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,005
What's that?

282
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,707
That's definitely not a fungus.

283
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,987
You were bleeding
because you had

284
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,207
13 pieces of bone
in your digestive tract.

285
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,743
We think you have pica,

286
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,444
a craving for non-food items.

287
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,419
That's caused by a
chemical imbalance...

288
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,567
I didn't crave them.

289
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,952
I kind of volunteered
to eat them.

290
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,021
What, why?

291
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,562
There's this great Italian
restaurant I like to frequent.

292
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:42,528
And by restaurant I mean
their dumpster out back.

293
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,399
The cook is kind
of a friend of mine.

294
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,632
He challenges me to eat stuff.

295
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:50,143
Sometimes it's raw squid, or I
have to chew on a chicken bone.

296
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,474
But if I do it, then he
hooks me up with real food,

297
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,740
not just the garbage.

298
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:54,974
Great friend.

299
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,834
These fragments could have
perforated your colon and killed you.

300
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,477
You have to
promise us you'll stop.

301
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,223
I think there's something
wrong with my eyes.

302
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,722
What is it?

303
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,990
It's like I'm looking at you
from the bottom of a well.

304
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,400
If we add tunnel
vision to the dysosmia,

305
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,774
we can subtract the
bone-induced abdominal bleeding.

306
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,309
I thought the dysosmia
was from heroin.

307
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,610
He said he never
snorted, he just shot up,

308
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,628
so that wouldn't have
affected his sense of smell.

309
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,212
And we believe
the lying liar why?

310
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,551
House.

311
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,884
Are you even listening to us?

312
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,928
I'll start when you decide
what the symptoms are

313
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,553
and give me some theories.

314
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:47,430
If we combine the dysosmia
with the tunnel vision,

315
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,267
the symptoms fit for
western equine encephalitis.

316
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,166
But the patient
doesn't. No fever.

317
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,708
Ow.

318
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,575
What the hell?

319
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,975
Negative reinforcement.

320
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,479
What about
Foster-Kennedy syndrome?

321
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,277
He could have a
meningioma, or plasmacytoma,

322
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,376
started by pressing on his olfactory
nerves, affects his sense of smell,

323
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,819
and now it's growing and
pressing on his optic nerve.

324
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,290
Good. MRI his head and find it.

325
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,025
Your potential donation could...

326
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,221
Hey, hey.

327
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,658
Would have an immediate
impact on our community.

328
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,703
We could extend our...

329
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,864
Something wrong? No.

330
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,637
I just think maybe
it'll be a better idea

331
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,338
to have a tour
of the clinic first.

332
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,243
It's right this way.

333
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:50,087
We have several
patients that are children

334
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,563
and we find that it's important

335
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,009
to give them the
opportunity to play

336
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:57,197
to make the hospital a
less intimidating place.

337
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,465
<i>My Dad used to
lock me in a closet</i>

338
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,874
<i>and it feels like
I can't breathe.</i>

339
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,805
We need you to stay still.

340
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,080
Give him a break.

341
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,049
You want him squirming
around? We'll have to do it twice.

342
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,284
I want you to show
him a little respect.

343
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,414
You really think this kid
can turn his life around?

344
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,893
He believes God gave
him a second chance.

345
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,361
That kind of belief
can be powerful.

346
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,429
Masters doesn't surprise me,

347
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,195
he plays the fellow med student

348
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,168
who dreams of being a
doctor and reels her in.

349
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,569
But you? Falling for his
deep connection with God?

350
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,971
He has hope.

351
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,702
After all he's been through,

352
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,053
it kind of makes
me root for him.

353
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,477
We don't even know who he is,

354
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,776
except that he lies
about who he is.

355
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,079
The bit about his abusive
father is probably all made up.

356
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,248
And he faked the scars?

357
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,964
He's a punk, probably
got in a lot of fights.

358
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,116
And he sucked you
in using the dad story.

359
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,353
<i>I don't think I'm feeling
very well. I think I'm...</i>

360
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,795
He's vomiting.

361
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,825
Should I ask him to stay
still while he does that?

362
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,667
He has two dark spots
in the parietal cortex.

363
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:12,802
They're not tumors, maybe
some kind of injury or inborn defect.

364
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,608
Apparently, he
was clinically dead

365
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,376
for several seconds
when he OD'd.

366
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:20,385
The dark spots could be brain
damage from oxygen starvation.

367
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,318
Except it's not.

368
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,913
I've seen MRI imagery like that

369
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,582
in schizophrenics.
Three serving two.

370
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,319
But schizophrenia
doesn't explain

371
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,861
why his blood
pressure skyrocketed

372
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,191
and he threw up in the MRI.

373
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,924
Panic attack. He's
claustrophobic.

374
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,842
He was fine once we let him out.

375
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,267
The dysosmia and tunnel
vision could be hallucinations.

376
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,234
Except, as was already covered,

377
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,000
he was screened for
mental illness down in the ER.

378
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,300
In your head!

379
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,375
It's face.

380
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,672
On your face!

381
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,906
Close enough.

382
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:51,241
The ER docs missed it because he
didn't present with major symptoms yet.

383
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,590
We're seeing it in its infancy.

384
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,284
So we treat him, and then what?

385
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,455
He becomes just
another schizophrenic

386
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,868
homeless man
wandering the streets.

387
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,452
- We have to help him.
- I'd love to,

388
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,461
but I got four million
other crazy people

389
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,088
ahead of him on my to-do list.

390
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,859
Along with milk.

391
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,570
You two spent months trying
to figure out a way to date

392
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,908
and not have it affect
your working relationship.

393
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,210
Now you need to do the
same thing for not dating.

394
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,551
No, I don't.

395
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,281
This is serious.

396
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,946
Did you know that she's...

397
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,652
She's dying of guilt and
feels horrible for dumping me.

398
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,485
It's great.

399
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,458
Not the dumping part,

400
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:42,228
but the part where she'll
now let me do whatever I want.

401
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,797
So you're just
trying to punish her?

402
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,600
She feels bad and your only
goal is to take advantage?

403
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,677
That's not true. I
have plenty of goals.

404
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,514
One of them is a 60-inch
flat screen, right there.

405
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,820
You're a lot of things, House,
but you've never been a sadist.

406
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:06,451
You're pummeling an
opponent who isn't fighting back.

407
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,644
I already gave him
his second dose

408
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,778
of clozapine, you don't need...

409
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,533
I'll bet you 50 bucks his
favorite sport is hockey.

410
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,816
How could you
possibly know that?

411
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,900
Just a hunch.

412
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,243
How you feeling?

413
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,677
My arm kind of hurts.

414
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:30,182
I'll talk to the nurse about
upping your pain meds.

415
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,584
Hockey, eh?

416
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,280
Oh.

417
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,654
My nephew bought it for
me. Knows I'm a huge fan.

418
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,052
I hate hockey.

419
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,194
If this is schizophrenia,

420
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,999
you're gonna need regular care.

421
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:53,334
I've found some shelters

422
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,067
that have full-time
medical staff

423
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,267
and also offer college...

424
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:57,833
My arm really hurts.

425
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,139
Let's have a look.

426
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,577
It feels like it's on fire.

427
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,023
We need to take a look
under the bandages.

428
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,913
No, no, no, not
that one. This one.

429
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:18,662
Ahoy there, me hearties,
permission to come aboard.

430
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:37,839
Danny said his left arm felt
like it was on fire last night.

431
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,751
We assumed it was a
schizophrenic delusion, but...

432
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,947
It's not. He's on clozapine.

433
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,388
He'd be getting
better, not worse.

434
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,989
Sounds like regional
pain syndrome.

435
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,550
Has to be a genetic disorder.

436
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,228
Would you slow down?
You're gonna get us arrested.

437
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:55,495
I wouldn't worry about
it. We'll probably die first.

438
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,502
Don't make me take my shoe off!

439
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,271
We need to run his DNA. He could
have early onset of Parkinson's.

440
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,000
Or cortical-based
ganglionic degeneration,

441
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:07,342
or Huntington's or any one of
a dozen other genetic diseases.

442
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:10,212
If you let us out,
we can start testing.

443
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,860
If you're gonna test for
them all, it'll take weeks.

444
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,945
I'm not canceling my
honeymoon to treat this kid.

445
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,523
It's a fake marriage,
but a real honeymoon?

446
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,613
Most are.

447
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:20,215
Danny could also
have died before

448
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,386
we get through testing
for all the possibilities.

449
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,623
So we cheat. Since it's genetic,

450
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,256
daddy or mommy's got it, too.

451
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,731
They're either sick or dead.

452
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,044
He doesn't know
where his mother is,

453
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,264
and he won't tell us
where his father is.

454
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,376
He's a homeless ex-junkie.

455
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:41,073
You telling me that you four
geniuses can't outwit him?

456
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,615
Green light!

457
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,482
Cuddy got it for me.

458
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,926
I'm now drafting a request for
studying the effects of caffeine

459
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,726
involving an Italian
espresso machine

460
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,789
and a massage
chair. Make it quick.

461
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,390
I found Danny's father.

462
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,293
Well done.

463
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:08,636
Kid said he was in a
state-sponsored rehab last November.

464
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,676
There's only one Danny Jennings

465
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:11,987
that was in
treatment at that time,

466
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,243
and he listed his father's
address as his primary next of kin.

467
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,814
The "Well done" was
for making it quick.

468
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,261
Now I'm gonna have
to take that back.

469
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,686
He lives about 30
minutes from the hospital.

470
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,849
And the reason you're continuing
to talk instead of driving there?

471
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,951
Chase and Masters
are already on their way.

472
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,602
Why didn't you ask me to
be part of your wedding?

473
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:43,366
You're genuinely upset at being
mockingly snubbed by a mock wedding?

474
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,272
Is it because I haven't
been here as long as them?

475
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:51,340
Or is it that you
really don't like me?

476
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,885
Or are you just screwing...

477
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,556
I'll...

478
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:08,290
I'll come back
when she's finished.

479
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,564
She is.

480
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:17,202
Oh, my God, what did
you think she was doing?

481
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,578
She's just installing the cable.

482
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,473
That's not a euphemism.

483
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,951
Oh, I feel sorry
for the little one.

484
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,453
Isn't there something we can do?

485
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,823
Can I help you?

486
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,869
We need to talk to you
about your son Danny.

487
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,006
Danny? Who are
you? We're his doctors.

488
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,234
We need to know if you
or perhaps his mother

489
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,173
have any family history
of genetic disease.

490
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,875
Why, what difference
would it make?

491
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,745
You may not care
about your son, but...

492
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,819
Is that what Danny told
you when he was in rehab?

493
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,376
We didn't love him?

494
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,679
Not why we came here.

495
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,383
We just want to
know if there's any

496
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,057
diagnosed genetic
disease in your family.

497
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,560
We're trying to
make your son better.

498
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,826
Better?

499
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,391
He died of a drug overdose.

500
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,197
We buried him three months ago.

501
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,889
Who are you?

502
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,714
What are you doing?

503
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:40,791
Test.

504
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,229
Who are you?

505
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:48,363
The important
question is who are you?

506
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,229
Danny Jennings is dead,

507
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:54,068
which means that Danny
Jennings has no pulse,

508
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,472
which you, on the other hand,

509
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:57,968
do.

510
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:01,236
Ergo, you are not
Danny Jennings.

511
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,707
Or I did the test wrong.

512
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,686
So why don't you cut the crap
and tell me your real name?

513
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,748
No.

514
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:17,290
Hiding your identity. Either
you're a criminal or a superhero.

515
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,188
I'm not a criminal.

516
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,568
Awesome. What
color is my underwear?

517
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,866
I'm not telling you my name.

518
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,539
No problem. I just
need your father's name.

519
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,014
Forget it.

520
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,313
Care to tell me why?

521
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,222
He's looking for me.

522
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:50,953
He supposedly

523
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,565
cleaned up and got sober.

524
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,259
And now he...

525
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,463
He wants to be
part of my life again,

526
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,973
and I can't let that happen.

527
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:08,273
You're a big boy now. You
still think he can hurt you?

528
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,846
You don't get it.

529
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,253
If I ever see my Dad again,

530
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,152
I'll kill him.

531
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,477
What's happening to me?

532
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:46,614
Well, luckily for you, we don't
need daddy to figure that one out.

533
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,086
Did you find out his real name?

534
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,493
Cerebellar Ataxia.

535
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,322
That's a weird name.

536
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,392
Guy whiffed twice trying to
pick up a cup right in front of him.

537
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,029
That plus everything else...

538
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,508
means that we have whittled
our list of genetic diseases

539
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:20,411
all the way down to one,
early-onset Parkinson's.

540
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:26,217
After everything he's been
through, now we have to tell him,

541
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,760
"Hey, you have an
incurable disease

542
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,659
"that gets progressively worse."

543
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,522
You could lie,
I'm fine with that.

544
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:35,943
But you'll probably
both feel better

545
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,426
if you give him Levodopa
and confirm with DNA tests.

546
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,013
He's gone too far.

547
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:53,347
He's taking up six handicapped
spaces with a monster truck.

548
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:55,596
It's only four, and he's gonna
get rid of it after the wedding.

549
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,145
And the chapel?
He's turned the chapel

550
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,884
into his own
personal catering hall.

551
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,051
Who cares? Other than a
janitor sleeping off a bender,

552
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,186
he's the first person
to use it in two weeks.

553
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,090
Appeasement is never the answer

554
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,445
in the face of naked aggression.

555
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,769
It won't be long
before his tanks

556
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,567
are rolling down
your Champs-Élysées.

557
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,839
I know what House is doing.

558
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,368
You, on the other hand, why do
you care? He isn't hurting anyone.

559
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,388
You're the first boss he's
ever had who could handle him.

560
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,224
Before you, he was either fired

561
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,491
or buried under a mountain
of malpractice suits.

562
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,827
He needs someone to say no.

563
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:47,203
He needs someone he'll
listen to when they say no.

564
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,239
If you really care about House,

565
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,867
you'll stop feeling
sorry for him,

566
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:56,039
and get out there and start
kicking him where he needs kicking.

567
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,619
I changed my mind.

568
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,226
You want the fish
instead of the chicken?

569
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,784
This room is for
patients' families,

570
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:12,262
not for doctors trying to
defraud the government.

571
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,396
Oh. So you've decided
to take a moral stand?

572
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:18,630
Yes.

573
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,638
The chapel still has
sanctity for some people.

574
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,470
You're right. I think I
saw Blue the janitor

575
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,102
passed out in one
of the pews last week.

576
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,374
It's Lou, and I would
have thrown him out, too.

577
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,316
Where are we gonna go?

578
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,578
We got caterers staging
everything downstairs as we speak.

579
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:39,887
We got floral arrangements,
place settings, other weddingy stuff.

580
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,658
It's not my problem.

581
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:47,757
I sent out the invitations.
People are coming here.

582
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,229
That's also not my problem.

583
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,934
And I want the TV back.

584
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,452
You should just let me die.

585
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,519
The world's better
off without me.

586
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,130
It's normal.

587
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,831
People feel depressed
when they get bad news

588
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,803
because it's bad news,

589
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,371
obviously.

590
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,138
I didn't OD by accident.

591
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,878
I was trying to kill myself.

592
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,615
Why?

593
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,888
Because I've done things.

594
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,494
Horrible things.

595
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,731
I've hurt people.

596
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,638
But when I didn't
die, I thought...

597
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,340
I thought God forgave me.

598
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:15,487
But he just wanted me to suffer,

599
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,357
and I deserve it. No.

600
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,228
You don't deserve it.

601
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,434
I had a girlfriend in college

602
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,933
and I almost killed her.

603
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,237
I just snapped

604
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,685
and I started hitting her.

605
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,553
And if her roommate
hadn't come home...

606
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:59,295
I'm evil.

607
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,269
I'm just like my dad.

608
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,574
We're both monsters
that deserve to die.

609
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,143
I can't... I can't...

610
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,978
I feel dizzy.

611
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,955
I need a crash cart in here!

612
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:41,139
His heart is
dilated and failing.

613
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:43,284
And at the rate it's happening,
he'll need a new one soon,

614
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:47,177
and there's no way we'll
get him on the transplant list.

615
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,678
What are we missing?

616
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,444
Everything. We know
nothing about this kid.

617
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,975
Except that he's gotten
worse since we admitted him.

618
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,886
Why?

619
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,186
Most of our patients tend to
do that, unless we cure them.

620
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,192
Yeah, but why so fast?

621
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,481
He had dysosmia for
a couple of months,

622
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,464
never even came
here to get it treated.

623
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,194
He was just a
random burn victim.

624
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,030
We get him,

625
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,334
boom, he's got tunnel vision,
peripheral polyneuropathy,

626
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:17,342
Cerebellar Ataxia and
now cardiomyopathy.

627
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:20,512
What's different here than say,

628
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,911
living in a filthy state park?

629
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,381
You think cleanliness
is making him sick?

630
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,214
An allergic reaction?

631
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,755
We treated him with Vicodin,
clozapine and one IV bag of Levodopa.

632
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,975
His condition started
deteriorating before that.

633
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:38,821
Stop that man!

634
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,726
I need the meal card
for the patient in 243.

635
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,040
He's eating healthy

636
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,672
because he can.

637
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,416
Most of the meals in
here are vegetarian.

638
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,688
Adult Refsum disease.

639
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,625
It fits all the symptoms.

640
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:12,090
His body can't process the
phytanic acid in chlorophyll.

641
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,733
It's his healthy diet of green
vegetables that's killing him.

642
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,228
So if we change his diet...

643
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,395
We can save his life.

644
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,462
Run him through a
plasmapheresis treatment

645
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,871
to remove the excess
phytanic acid from his blood.

646
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:24,933
Confirm with gene testing.

647
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,909
Okay, I got to go get married.

648
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,779
They say true love
doesn't exist anymore.

649
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,808
Maybe it never did.

650
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,476
So without further ado...

651
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,790
Do you, Dominika
Patrova, take this man

652
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,656
to be your
lawfully-wedded husband?

653
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,456
I do.

654
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,595
And do you, Gregory
House, take this woman

655
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,299
to be your lawfully-wedded wife?

656
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,170
Yep.

657
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,247
Then by the power vested in me

658
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,613
by the state of New
Jersey just for today,

659
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:42,450
I now pronounce you man
and wife. You may kiss the bride.

660
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,689
Those of you with
cameras, please feel free

661
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,729
to provide legal documentation.

662
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,576
It's okay, I'm just
angry at myself.

663
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:17,383
Promised I wouldn't let this
get to me, and it got to me.

664
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:22,485
Just say the word, and we will
climb out that window right now.

665
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,523
I wouldn't give
House the satisfaction.

666
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,899
You see? Things are
getting back to normal.

667
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,700
Yeah.

668
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:38,571
Normal.

669
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,843
You feeling better?

670
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,517
So, all I have to do is eat the
right kinds of food and I'll be okay?

671
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:50,850
Basically, yeah.

672
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,255
It's pretty limiting and it
is for the rest of your life,

673
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,692
but if you follow the diet
and get checked up regularly,

674
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,559
you should be fine.

675
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,430
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

676
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,334
For not giving up on me.

677
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,670
You're not a bad person.

678
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,834
You made mistakes,
but we all do.

679
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,456
Maybe when you get out of here,

680
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,282
you can go talk to
someone, a professional.

681
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:25,422
Yeah. Yeah, some of those places
you suggested have people on staff.

682
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:31,754
You know, I think God really
does have a plan for me.

683
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,588
And all this?

684
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,532
It was just his way
of testing my resolve.

685
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,603
I wouldn't have
passed it without you.

686
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,283
See you tomorrow, Danny.

687
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,947
That's not my real name.

688
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,884
Doesn't matter.

689
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,912
I know this is
not real marriage,

690
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,619
but I really like you.

691
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,424
I like you, too.

692
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,609
I can't. Why not?

693
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,313
I never sleep with
married women.

694
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,861
I'm going to bed. You
can take the couch.

695
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,078
What's going on?

696
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,979
Danny disappeared
without checking out.

697
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,513
So you called the FBI?

698
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,146
We didn't call them,
they just showed up.

699
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,654
Danny's DNA, when we
sent it to the lab for testing,

700
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,822
it set off alarm bells
all over the country.

701
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,389
Alarm bells for what?

702
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:54,872
He's linked to 13 unsolved
murders in 10 different states.

703
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:58,000
He's a serial killer
who eats his victims.

704
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,772
And we saved him.
