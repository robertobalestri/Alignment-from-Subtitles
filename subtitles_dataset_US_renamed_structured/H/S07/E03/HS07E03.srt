1
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,870
They have a cure
for that, you know?

2
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,703
It's called a computer.

3
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,454
We're done for the day, or do I
need to find something else to read?

4
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,639
I'm done.

5
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,082
It's done.

6
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,382
No way. It's finished?

7
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,421
How's it end? I mean,
you gotta let me read it.

8
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,990
Not this time.

9
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,819
Well, you at least gotta
tell me what happens.

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,805
Come on. How am I supposed to
help with the next book if you don't...

11
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,991
There isn't going
to be a next book.

12
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,659
You can't be serious. Why?

13
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:12,768
You wouldn't understand.

14
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,034
Try me.

15
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,014
I just can't do it anymore.

16
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,383
I'm not brave like you.

17
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,152
But writing's your whole life.

18
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,522
What are you
gonna do without it?

19
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,926
What I should have
done years ago.

20
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:40,458
What are you doing? Put it
down or I'll... I'll make you.

21
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,103
How, Jack?

22
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,140
You don't even exist.

23
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,238
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,786
Miss Tanner! Miss Tanner!

25
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,151
Dear God!

26
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,859
Which of these says I
want to sleep with you more?

27
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,938
Penguin or beaver?
Beaver, beaver, beaver.

28
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,830
You're right. It's
too high school.

29
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,466
What did you do
to piss Cuddy off?

30
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:30,967
I can't be romantic?

31
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,643
House, you're stealing
from a woman in a coma.

32
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,274
We're fine. I've never
seen her happier.

33
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,314
Yeah? What about you?

34
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,113
I'm worried.

35
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,679
Because she's happy?

36
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,315
No, because I am.

37
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,486
House, that's...
Ironic, weird, crazy?

38
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,792
I was going to say normal.

39
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,892
For now. We're in
the honeymoon period.

40
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,496
Our brains are flooded
with endorphins.

41
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,061
And when she snaps out of
it, where does that leave us?

42
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,197
In an adult relationship.

43
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,800
Name one thing that Cuddy and
I have in common besides work.

44
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,243
There's...

45
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,713
You're both...

46
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,749
Wait... Exactly.

47
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,812
Long-term relationships
are based on compatibility.

48
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,355
And right now we only have sex.

49
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,551
House, you don't actually think
she'd dump you because you, what,

50
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,253
don't do yoga,
listen to the B-52s?

51
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,920
Not right away.

52
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:29,728
We'll fight, makeup sex, fight,
maybe sex, and then she'll dump me.

53
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,263
With possible goodbye sex.

54
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,568
So instead of enjoying
the honeymoon phase,

55
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,109
you've decided
to skip it entirely?

56
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,703
I need to find something that we
both like doing, besides each other.

57
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,341
Right. Or you could
just talk to her about it.

58
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,216
No, then she'll start pretending
to like things that she really doesn't

59
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,222
just to make me feel better,
which will make her feel even worse,

60
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,622
which won't be my
fault, so I'll resent her,

61
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,785
and that won't be her
fault, so she'll resent me.

62
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:59,763
At least with my plan, I get my
One A Day with iron till the bitter end.

63
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,043
Is there a reason why
you're following me?

64
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,126
Oh! Yeah.

65
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,462
You're not gonna believe
who just checked into the ER.

66
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,436
The doctor hasn't
examined you yet.

67
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,376
There's nothing wrong with
me. My maid just overreacted.

68
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,742
Great!

69
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,745
This won't take long, then.

70
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,810
EMTs found her unconscious.
Her maid said she had a seizure.

71
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,411
I fainted.

72
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,287
Huge Jack Cannon fan, by
the way. I love your books.

73
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,926
Really?

74
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,430
My fans tend to be overly
annoying teenaged girls.

75
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,096
I know.

76
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,365
And all they care about is
who's hotter, Jack or Deacon.

77
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,393
Like Sarah can't
love both of them.

78
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,429
I may belong to one
or two online fan clubs.

79
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,936
So how's the new
book coming along?

80
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,845
I don't talk about my work.

81
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,444
Okay.

82
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,178
How about nodding your
head to a few yes/no questions?

83
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:53,845
But I'll make you a deal.

84
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:58,954
You finish this exam quickly,
and I'll answer one question.

85
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,124
About anything? Anything.

86
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,961
Who is Jack's real father?
Who kidnapped his uncle?

87
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,830
Deal.

88
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,600
I will have to go with...

89
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,001
Why did you try
to kill yourself?

90
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,339
The burn on the side of your
face is caused by gunpowder.

91
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,536
So, did you change your mind at
the last second or just a lousy shot?

92
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,569
I'm out of here.

93
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,670
You can't. We had a deal.

94
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,379
Try and stop me.

95
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,543
Okay.

96
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,616
This woman is on a
72-hour psychiatric hold.

97
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,781
If she tries to run, shoot her.

98
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,950
With a sedative, if
that's more convenient.

99
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,196
He called us back to work because
a lady might have had a seizure.

100
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,833
A seizure while trying
to commit suicide.

101
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,303
So send her for a psych eval.
What's that got to do with us?

102
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,740
What is the matter
with you people?

103
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,841
We're talking about a
human being who's suffering.

104
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,218
You're right, that's not enough.

105
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:05,554
She is also the writer of
<i>Jack Cannon, Boy Detective.</i>

106
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,218
Beloved by millions
around the world.

107
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,728
By girls between 10 and 14.

108
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,062
Look, the point is,
if she kills herself,

109
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,832
millions of fans, of all ages and
genders, will be very disappointed.

110
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,705
So we're taking this
case 'cause you're a fan?

111
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,709
No, that would be crazy
and unprofessional.

112
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,376
You're taking this
case 'cause I said so.

113
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,013
You and Taub do a full
workup, observe her overnight.

114
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,810
See if she has another
seizure. You can go.

115
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:29,992
Why does he get the night off?

116
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,680
Because he brought
a smoking hot babe.

117
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,291
I have plans with my wife.

118
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,590
Yeah, nice try.

119
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,928
You hate your personal life.
And you obviously don't have one.

120
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,530
Hey.

121
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:54,504
I'd stay myself, but I just
bought the flowers, so...

122
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,711
Reservation for Dominica isn't
until 8:00. So we got plenty of time.

123
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,214
You need to pick something
up from a haunted house?

124
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,877
This is a gothic
revival masterpiece.

125
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,511
I hope one day to
live in a house like this.

126
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,854
Your friend's a writer?

127
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,421
One of the best.

128
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,792
She wants me to read
her latest manuscript.

129
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:27,066
"Alice Tanner." Why does
that name sound familiar?

130
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,542
I gave you a couple of
her books a few years ago.

131
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,210
No.

132
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,279
She's the woman you
put on the psych hold.

133
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,911
This isn't a date.
We're on a case.

134
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,081
Ever hear of multitasking?

135
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,624
Did you steal her keys?

136
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,560
You think I'd take the Dean
of Medicine on a B and E?

137
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,823
How did you get in here?

138
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,123
Well, I guess you
have your answer.

139
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,209
When was your last physical?

140
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,298
A while ago. I
don't like doctors.

141
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,406
Any history of
seizures before today?

142
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:08,938
Not that I recall. Are we
almost done? I'm tired.

143
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,816
The exam would go faster if
you would cooperate with us.

144
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,480
I am.

145
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,783
You're evading
every question we ask.

146
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,856
Why do you say that?

147
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:18,948
That.

148
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,860
I didn't ask for help.

149
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,989
Committing a suicidal
gesture says otherwise.

150
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,498
It wasn't a gesture.

151
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:30,802
I had the damn seizure before I
could get the gun in my mouth.

152
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,264
You want to tell us why?

153
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:36,332
You want to know my life
story, my secret inner pain?

154
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,141
Maybe if I just open up a
little, you'll be able to save me?

155
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,347
We're just trying to help you.

156
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,644
Thank you.

157
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,983
I want a woman doctor.

158
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,455
And back to being evasive.

159
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:55,394
It's my right as a patient.
So, please, get out now.

160
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,827
We need to observe
you overnight.

161
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,626
You really think
I'm stupid enough

162
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,758
to try and kill
myself in a hospital?

163
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,393
To see if you have
another seizure.

164
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,898
We'll be up there and
we won't disturb you

165
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,634
unless there's a problem.
That work for you?

166
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,541
Whatever it takes
to get you out of here.

167
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:15,547
House, Christina has
agreed to not call the police.

168
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,480
She's probably illegal.

169
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,678
Same reason she didn't
report the suicide attempt.

170
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,750
I called 911, but when
Miss Tanner woke up,

171
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,690
she said she would fire me if
I say anything about the gun.

172
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,193
And if she whacks herself,
what happens to your job?

173
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,723
I think she's a very
depressed person.

174
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,998
Never goes out,
doesn't have friends.

175
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,934
She has all this money,
but all she does is write.

176
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,439
I need to see her
latest manuscript.

177
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,575
She always locks
up her writing in there.

178
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,682
Has she ever complained
about physical pain or stress?

179
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,613
Yes. Her back and
her hands hurt a lot.

180
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,749
A writer with back and hand
pain. That's very helpful. Let's go.

181
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,124
Sometimes I hear
her cry at night

182
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,391
when she thinks
nobody is listening.

183
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,130
I should have done something.

184
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,293
True.

185
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,763
What are you doing?

186
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,806
Before there were
hard drives, there were...

187
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,920
How many of these
does she eat a day?

188
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,013
Two for lunch. Sometimes three.

189
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,262
Still no seizure
activity. It's your turn...

190
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,699
What the hell?

191
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:46,967
Close. House.

192
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:53,543
She's fine. Both the EEG
and all her vitals have been...

193
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,183
You. What do you want?

194
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,618
You wet the bed.

195
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,692
I'm just not sure how yet.

196
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,160
Good morning, gentlemen.

197
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,010
Well, if it's any consolation,
I didn't get any sleep either.

198
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,874
Unilateral
hyperhidrosis. Interesting.

199
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:31,076
She also admitted she tried to
kill herself, but won't tell us why.

200
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,208
House searched her home,

201
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,584
found she's been eating two
cans of tuna a day for years.

202
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:35,713
Mercury poisoning?

203
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:39,554
Explains the seizures, hand and
back pain, also the depression.

204
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,619
Explains everything
except the fact that it's not.

205
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,706
We got her urine and blood
samples back. They're normal.

206
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,975
If it's low level, it might
not show up in a spot check.

207
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,839
We'd need to run
continuous testing to find it.

208
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,029
We can't. She wants
a female doctor.

209
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,703
She only asked for a
woman to waste time.

210
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,673
She's cooperating just enough
to get through the psych hold.

211
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,738
Put some lipstick on Chase
and start chelation therapy.

212
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,837
Confirm with another urine test.

213
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,711
Okay, I'll go talk to Cuddy.

214
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,084
Maybe she'll let us
borrow a dress, too.

215
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,127
This would be me ignoring you.

216
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,266
What if we got
arrested last night?

217
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,971
And whatever happened to keeping our
professional and personal lives separate?

218
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,236
I'm not the one talking
about our relationship at work.

219
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,403
What's behind your back?

220
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,881
Peace penguin.

221
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,828
What room should I return it to?

222
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,047
243.

223
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,988
I need some help with Alice
Tanner. She wants a vagina.

224
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,321
I'm pretty attached to mine.

225
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,487
I told you to hire a temporary
replacement for Thirteen two weeks ago.

226
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,620
I've been busy.

227
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,097
Doing what? You.

228
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,393
So you'll talk her out of it?

229
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,515
You'll hire a woman doctor?

230
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,872
Do you think we just sit around

231
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,066
talking sports and
belching and farting

232
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,506
when chicks aren't around?

233
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,510
By when? Next week.

234
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,340
Next week it is.

235
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,658
What makes you
think it's mercury?

236
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,911
Your symptoms.

237
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:15,011
I can perform the procedure myself
if you still prefer a woman doctor.

238
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,113
But the team you
have is our best.

239
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:20,191
That's an interesting
perfume you're wearing.

240
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,591
It was a gift.

241
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,152
From Dr. House?

242
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,792
It was all over him last night.

243
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,933
If you'd prefer another female
doctor, I can arrange that as well.

244
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,030
I also smelled it somewhere
else more recently.

245
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,274
Faint, but unmistakable.

246
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,405
You should have worn a different
cardigan this morning, Christina.

247
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,211
Something you'd
like to tell me, dear?

248
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:49,486
When I found you yesterday,
I thought I was too late.

249
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,255
I talked to them so I
could help you get better.

250
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,158
I just don't want to
see you suffer anymore.

251
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,391
That won't be a problem.

252
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,522
You're fired.

253
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,929
This woman cares about
you. If it weren't for her...

254
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,334
I wouldn't be here now, would I?

255
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,964
I should have done it yesterday.

256
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,599
I understand
that you're in pain,

257
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,735
but lashing out
isn't the answer.

258
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,439
Treatment is.

259
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,606
I agree.

260
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,405
Send the men back.

261
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,913
At least they're not a bunch
of dewy-eyed crybabies.

262
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,415
What's that?

263
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,584
It's the new <i>Jack Cannon</i> novel.

264
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,619
Suggestions?

265
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,063
Yeah. Stop. It can't be done.

266
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,792
People wonder why
you never cured cancer.

267
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,565
Did you get this before or
after your date with Cuddy?

268
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,974
Yeah, probably would have
been a wiser choice. Huh.

269
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,803
This is actually good, House.

270
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,481
She's committing crimes.
What does that tell you?

271
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,782
I'm a horrible influence.

272
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,821
True. A horrible influence
she's reaching out to.

273
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,550
She's looking for
ways to connect.

274
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,992
Sure, they're self-destructive,
juvenile and insane,

275
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,892
but so are you.

276
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,755
You do have something in common.

277
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,796
You're both trying to find
things you have in common.

278
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,498
And not finding them.

279
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:21,244
You don't look so hot.
You want to talk about it?

280
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,477
Those days are over.

281
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,596
Who are you talking to?

282
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,687
Myself.

283
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,858
If you're seeing things, it
could be another symptom.

284
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,633
It's not.

285
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,537
It's only in my imagination.
I make things up for a living.

286
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,308
And talking to them?

287
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,005
It's a writer thing.

288
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,614
We're also good
at reading people.

289
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,441
Like you, for instance.

290
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,781
Recently divorced.

291
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,448
You slept with a girl last
night, her place, not yours.

292
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,118
You probably won't
return her calls.

293
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,225
That...

294
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,355
How?

295
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,826
The tan line from your
former wedding ring.

296
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:21,864
You stink of smoke, but no
yellow on your fingers or teeth

297
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:27,174
means she's the smoker and
you either didn't shower or change.

298
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,976
Either way, her place.

299
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,850
Do him.

300
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,684
We're wasting time,
which is her main goal here.

301
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,723
I need your arm for this.

302
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,724
You remind me of my ex-husband.

303
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,387
A cute man, but problems
in the bedroom department.

304
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,128
Not even close.

305
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,135
The ones I caught him in.

306
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,398
He cheated on me
every chance he could.

307
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,537
The first time with my
best friend. The second...

308
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,772
Bastard.

309
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,091
BP and heart rate are spiking.

310
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,155
Must be an allergic reaction
to the chelation agent.

311
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,777
I didn't give it to her yet.

312
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,384
Pain, seizures, hyperhidrosis,

313
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,087
and sudden onset of
radically high blood pressure.

314
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,153
The continuous blood
and urine tests came back.

315
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,425
It's definitely not mercury
poisoning. They're clean.

316
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,228
Could be haemolytic
uremic syndrome.

317
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,112
It's not. There weren't any blood or
protein markers in her urine either.

318
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,415
We also caught her talking to
herself. She could be delusional.

319
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,600
She's a writer and a recluse.

320
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,268
I'd be more surprised if
she didn't talk to herself.

321
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,811
You done playing
with your ribbon?

322
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,071
What was she doing
when it happened?

323
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,671
Sitting in bed.

324
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,751
She claims it was only in
her imagination, but still.

325
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,081
When her BP spiked.

326
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,986
Comparing Taub to her
ex-husband. She really hated the guy.

327
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:47,683
And her first symptom was
when she had a gun to her head.

328
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:54,500
Excess adrenaline would explain
the seizures and skyrocketing BP.

329
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,068
A pheochromocytoma.

330
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,797
Get an MRI and find it.

331
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,616
Would you hold this?

332
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,722
I meant now.

333
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,693
Have I mentioned
I'm claustrophobic?

334
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,289
Have I mentioned we don't care?

335
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,328
What's wrong?
Nothing, just a leg cramp.

336
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,388
Get her out of here!
She's got metal in her leg!

337
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,682
She has three
screws in her right leg

338
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,050
from a skiing accident
she didn't tell us about.

339
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:51,114
The MRI's magnetic field superheated
the metal, causing third-degree burns.

340
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:55,123
Skin ruptured from
internal heat pressure here.

341
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,461
It's not our fault.

342
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,942
She signed the consent forms.
Denied there was any metal in...

343
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:05,370
Normally I'd say it, but maybe
this way it'll finally sink in.

344
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,443
She wants to die. We
cannot trust anything she says.

345
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,264
Treating the soft tissue injuries
in her leg cost us most of the day.

346
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,645
We also had to
replace the screws.

347
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:19,617
And finding a pheochromocytoma
without using the MRI could take us a week.

348
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,581
Longer if she doesn't
stop lying to us.

349
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,116
Or we could figure out a way to find it
in the 39 hours left on her psych hold.

350
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,791
We need to make her cooperate. We
need to offer her something she wants.

351
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,532
She wants to kill
herself, House.

352
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,932
I can work with that.

353
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,016
I want you to write more books.

354
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,820
I'm done writing Jack
Cannon's adventures.

355
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:57,220
And when I get out of
here, I'll just be done.

356
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,989
Now don't you say
that, you dirty birdie.

357
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,170
You know, there
are easier ways to go

358
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,789
than shooting yourself in the
head or tearing apart a limb.

359
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,356
And this is one of them.

360
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,362
The best part?
You'll feel so good,

361
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,496
you won't even
notice you're dead.

362
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:17,468
You expect me to believe
you're going to help me kill myself?

363
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,705
You are the perceptive
one. You tell me.

364
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,404
Why?

365
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:26,543
We can't find your tumor in
time without your cooperation.

366
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,414
So I'm giving you a choice.

367
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,787
Give us a chance
to make you better

368
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,189
or stick this anywhere and push.

369
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,026
Why do you care about me?

370
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,892
You think you know me
because you read my books?

371
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,235
No. I know pain.

372
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:49,538
You think you can handle it,
and then one day you can't.

373
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:54,245
And when that happens, you either
find reasons to go on or you don't.

374
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,181
I'm...

375
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,244
I'm all out of reasons.

376
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,375
Now.

377
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:05,220
When you're pain-free, you're gonna
wanna live and start writing again.

378
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,257
And if I'm wrong, you got a
backup plan to take home with you.

379
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,064
Okay.

380
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:17,861
Good choice.

381
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,969
If I were you, I'd hide
that if you want to keep it.

382
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,708
I know the perfect place.

383
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,287
Morning, sunshine.

384
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,526
You're a real bastard.

385
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:49,499
You were supposed
to choose life.

386
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,695
You're also an excellent liar.

387
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,661
Wasn't lying about the cure.

388
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,508
If we find and remove that
pesky adrenaline-secreting tumor,

389
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,340
you'll get better.

390
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,182
You'd better hurry.

391
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:08,221
My lawyer will have me out
of here this time tomorrow.

392
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,880
Yeah, about that.

393
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:13,482
It seems that last night, you
found and self-administered

394
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,994
what you thought was a
potentially lethal narcotic.

395
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,196
Your psych hold has been
extended an additional 24 hours.

396
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,558
I know. Bummer, right?

397
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,303
You want to know
something about my book?

398
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,511
Sure. Jack Cannon dies.

399
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,675
I know. Bummer, right?

400
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,297
We finished analyzing the
PET scans from last night.

401
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,653
There's no sign of a tumor.

402
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,886
We sampled blood from six different
areas looking for any spikes in adrenaline.

403
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,032
All of them were negative.

404
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,188
If she told us her symptoms, where
it hurts, when the pain first started,

405
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,255
we could at least
focus on a specific area.

406
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,266
Or use them to rule areas out.

407
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,565
She'll only lie. We're better
off not even talking to her.

408
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,936
You think you can get her
to try to kill herself again?

409
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,736
We're gonna need more time.

410
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,337
There might be a way to get
her symptoms without asking her.

411
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,375
If writers write what they know.

412
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,939
I thought you said it was
about a boy detective.

413
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,417
And his mentor, Aunt Helen,

414
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,387
who happens to be around
the same age as Alice.

415
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,020
The answers could
be in the book.

416
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,085
Great. You finish reading
your typewriter ribbon yet?

417
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,766
Look for the tumor
with ultrasound.

418
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,068
I drove across town
to treat a ribbon?

419
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,766
That's why I prefer lying.
It makes things easier.

420
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,843
Whatever he has you doing, stop.

421
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,173
You told him?

422
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,373
We do live together. I generally
tell him when I show up at his work.

423
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,546
He told me it was a
matter of life and death.

424
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,251
It is. My patient
wants to kill herself.

425
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,764
He's just trying to read a book.

426
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,916
The latest <i>Jack
Cannon, Boy Detective.</i>

427
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,755
Alice Tanner is your patient?

428
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,291
You're a Fannon, too?

429
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,590
I'm Team Deacon.

430
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,497
Oh, come on. Why
can't she love them both?

431
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,802
The typewriter keys should have
left impressions on these ribbon fibers.

432
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,997
They would also
remove a layer of ink.

433
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:10,736
It's just a question of
tweaking the software, really.

434
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,415
Does Cuddy know you're
using the MRI for this?

435
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,077
Let's say yes.

436
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,757
So do you think Jack finally
hooks up with Sarah in this one?

437
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,660
No. Debbie Wright
is his true love.

438
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,754
She's dead.

439
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,596
Presumed! All
we really know is...

440
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,262
There are actual patients
waiting to use this machine.

441
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,535
Congratulations.

442
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,974
It's a book.

443
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:58,521
Wilson just told me we're going on a
double date with him and Sam tonight.

444
00:25:58,624 --> 00:25:59,744
You don't like double dates?

445
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,393
I'd just like if
you'd ask me first.

446
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,860
You don't like surprises?

447
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,898
Is this Alice's book?

448
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,333
Sam reprogrammed the MRI
to read Alice's typewriter ribbon.

449
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,736
You used a $3 million
piece of hospital equipment

450
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,068
so you could read a novel?

451
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,301
Cool, right?

452
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,074
Well, as your girlfriend,
I'm impressed. As your boss,

453
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,479
you're a jackass.
Don't do it again.

454
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,881
As your boyfriend, I thank you.

455
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,714
As your employee, I resent you
because I need this for my case.

456
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,416
As your boss, you just got
six more clinic hours next week.

457
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:33,992
So, what's the plan for tonight?

458
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,083
Whatever you want.

459
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,040
I don't care. Just pick
something we both enjoy.

460
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,724
Yeah? What would
that be exactly?

461
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:39,974
I don't know, you
know what I like.

462
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,398
I got to get back to work.

463
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,075
Found something.
It's not a tumor.

464
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,111
Whatever it is, it's
encased around her heart.

465
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,365
She has a pericardial effusion.

466
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,234
Which wasn't there last night
when we did the PET scan.

467
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:09,057
Means she's getting worse, and
there's no sign of a pheochromocytoma.

468
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,824
Seizures, sweating,
rapid blood pressure

469
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,558
and an effusion point
to something viral.

470
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,894
Or maybe a cancer.

471
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:18,131
We could use your opinion,
House. Or at least your attention.

472
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,772
Jack Cannon is not dead.

473
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,339
It's worse.

474
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:29,643
Ten books leading up
to a final confrontation.

475
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,650
She ends it on a cliffhanger.
I mean, who does that?

476
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,515
People who want
to sell you the 11th.

477
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,763
She was gonna kill herself.

478
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,416
This is the final <i>Jack Cannon,</i>
and nothing gets resolved.

479
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,089
Who's his father?
Who killed his brother?

480
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,993
How'd he get that
damn scar on his cheek?

481
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,860
And why is he
obsessed with yo-yos?

482
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,494
Is there anything in it
that pertains to our case?

483
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,469
Yeah. I know why she
wanted to kill herself.

484
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:59,969
His mentor, Helen Rutherford,
has contracted a mysterious illness

485
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,776
which consists of
joint pain, fatigue,

486
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,978
sensitivity to light
and depression.

487
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,783
How do we know this mentor
character is really Alice?

488
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,790
Helen dies halfway
through the book.

489
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,494
Shoots herself in the head to save
Jack from having to care for her.

490
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:22,228
If we add those to the symptoms
we've seen and the pericardial effusion?

491
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,358
It's lupus.

492
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,332
It can't be lupus.

493
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,363
Why not?

494
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,806
It isn't curable.

495
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,209
That's not an
answer. It's treatable.

496
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,872
We'll start testing to see which
drugs she best responds to.

497
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,576
We're not gonna be able
to take her pain away.

498
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:42,519
She's still gonna kill herself as
soon as she gets released tomorrow.

499
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,749
I can't let <i>Jack
Cannon</i> end this way.

500
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,885
We're treating a
patient, not a book.

501
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,635
Retest to confirm.

502
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,936
Go-karts? Really?

503
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,614
Your mom said
you loved go-karts.

504
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,082
You called my mother?

505
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,445
I loved them when I was 12.

506
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,554
This is so cool! I haven't
done this since I was 12!

507
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,424
Winner picks the restaurant.

508
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,291
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

509
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,260
Are we ready, racers?

510
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:37,809
On your marks, get
set, and go away.

511
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,076
Hey. Watch it.

512
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:49,915
You having fun?

513
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,117
You know who wins these races?

514
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,791
The person who weighs less.

515
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,189
My parents never let
me drive one of these.

516
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,234
Yeah, I can tell!

517
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,596
Oh, my God!

518
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,214
Whoa!

519
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,977
What is her problem?

520
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,578
She hates Jews.

521
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,054
Never again.

522
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,902
Atta girl!

523
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,344
See you at the finish line!

524
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:20,572
Oh, yeah?

525
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,001
Yes!

526
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,947
Hey! You're banned
for life, mister!

527
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,283
Your Fun Stop privileges
are officially revoked!

528
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:07,023
You, too, blondie.
All of you! Get out!

529
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,787
I avenged my lady.

530
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,126
The seat belt nearly broke
my neck. I'm done for the night.

531
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,632
It's not my fault Wilson's
attracted to psychos.

532
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,691
You picked the place.

533
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,470
That's just the pain talking.

534
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,142
Oh, wow.

535
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,654
It was a car crash,
not a skiing accident.

536
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,994
What? The screws in your leg.

537
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,363
You got me. I'll be
going back to sleep now.

538
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,867
You damaged your
thyroid gland in the crash

539
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,904
when the shoulder
strap cut into your neck.

540
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:55,235
You don't have lupus.
What you have is curable.

541
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:56,834
Go away.

542
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,677
I read your book.
Sucks, by the way.

543
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,943
Nice try, but impossible.

544
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,648
Helen Rutherford kills herself

545
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,714
because she feels useless and
doesn't want to be a burden...

546
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,883
Just like you do now.

547
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,923
You have hypothyroidism.

548
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,061
It's why you feel so
tired and worn-out.

549
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,662
With medication, you'll
feel 20 years younger.

550
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,479
Or whatever age you were the last
time you didn't want to kill yourself.

551
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,665
How did you... You can
finish the story the right way.

552
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,400
The way Jack Cannon deserves.

553
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,369
You think you know
what Jack deserves?

554
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,421
I know that he deserves
better than what you gave him.

555
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:37,075
You don't know anything about
him! Why can't you just leave me...

556
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,385
What did you do to me?

557
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,386
I can't move. I
can't move anything.

558
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,604
How can I be right and wrong?

559
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:03,132
I deduced car accident
because thyroid fit the symptoms.

560
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,067
But a damaged thyroid
wouldn't explain the paralysis.

561
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:09,137
How can I be wrong about the
thyroid, but right about the accident?

562
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:10,941
What if you're not?

563
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,712
I like the way you think, kid.

564
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,582
At least not completely.

565
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,753
A posttraumatic syringomyelia
from a 15-year-old car crash.

566
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,158
Slowly growing over the years and
pressing against her spinal column.

567
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,253
Causes pain, fluctuating
blood pressure, seizures.

568
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,129
And if untreated, eventually
leads to paralysis and death.

569
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,630
We find it and remove it. She
should be able to regain full function.

570
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,414
If we can get her medical
records from back then,

571
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,134
we can use them to
pinpoint the location.

572
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,771
Do it.

573
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,442
We're dead on our feet.
I've barely slept in four days.

574
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,478
Aw, that's sad. You
know what's even sadder?

575
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,450
Thirteen was the
only man on my team.

576
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,763
Yeah, it'd be nice
if you'd hurry up

577
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,153
and hire someone
to fill her spot.

578
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,954
Do it. Cuddy
wants it to be a girl.

579
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:56,971
There are a couple of people...

580
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,835
I was talking to Chase, but I was
just looking at you to screw with you.

581
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,907
I am meditating.

582
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,276
From where we're standing,
it looked like sleeping.

583
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,178
We can't find her
old medical records.

584
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,579
You woke me up for that?

585
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,081
We woke you up
because it doesn't matter.

586
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,619
Alice is refusing
any more treatment.

587
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:23,120
She doesn't want the surgery.

588
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:24,952
She kicked us out.

589
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,493
Why would she lie
about the accident?

590
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,155
Everybody lies.

591
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:34,364
Everybody has a reason.

592
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:43,866
I know. Alice is
refusing surgery.

593
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,841
She'll be dead in a
few days without it.

594
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,674
Which is why I've
spent the last four hours

595
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:48,990
trying to find a
legal way to do it

596
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,038
without her permission.

597
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,983
Unsuccessfully. I'm sorry.

598
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:57,147
As your boyfriend, I'm
grateful for the effort.

599
00:35:57,222 --> 00:36:00,158
As your employee, I'm
disappointed at your ineffectiveness.

600
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,354
Why would she not tell us
about the pins in her leg?

601
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,365
'Cause she wants to die.

602
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:10,664
By having her leg ripped off?

603
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,433
She wants to punish herself

604
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,701
for something that happened
before she was famous,

605
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,904
before she even
started to write.

606
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,978
I think the answer's in
her old medical records,

607
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,981
but Dopey, Sleazy and
Uptightey can't find them.

608
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,181
Maybe "Alice Tanner"
is just her pen name.

609
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,683
Your boyfriend is an idiot.

610
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,924
I'll contact the
national records archive

611
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,858
and run the type
of screws in her leg

612
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,694
against blood type, age
and anything else I think of.

613
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,255
Her first name could be Helen.

614
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,391
Even better.

615
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,199
Don't bother to get up.

616
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:53,402
Now the way you write Jack
always made him feel real to me.

617
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,570
Now I know why.

618
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,611
Because I'm a good writer.

619
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:05,550
He's cool, but he's awkward. He's
brilliant, but he makes mistakes.

620
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,889
He's funny, but sometimes
he takes it too far.

621
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,228
Sounds like a great kid.

622
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:15,022
Please, just leave me alone.

623
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,036
You weren't alone
in the car crash.

624
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,736
Your son was with you, Helen.

625
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,078
The books are your
way of keeping him alive.

626
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:39,722
Why can't you just
let me die in peace?

627
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,226
You haven't been at
peace since it happened.

628
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,500
I killed him.

629
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,935
No, you didn't.

630
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,604
I let him drive.

631
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:00,507
He only had a learner's
permit. It was raining.

632
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,547
I deserve this.

633
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,607
No, you don't.

634
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,457
He could always get
me to do what he wanted.

635
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,925
He's always been my muse.

636
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,861
Yeah, all that may be true,

637
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,161
but I've been reviewing
your muse's autopsy results.

638
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,497
It wasn't the crash
that killed him.

639
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:30,039
Your son had a brain
aneurysm. That's why he crashed.

640
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,370
He was dead before the impact.

641
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,776
There was nothing you
could do to save him.

642
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:36,545
They would have told me.

643
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:40,483
They had no reason to dig any
deeper, it was a car accident. I did.

644
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,945
It's easy to miss.

645
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:46,150
But you can see the
blood build up here.

646
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:48,716
Your son would
have died that day

647
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:52,161
on a bus, in school,
sitting on his bed.

648
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,024
The only thing the
crash is killing is you.

649
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,833
We need to repair
that syrinx in your neck.

650
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,910
He was my world. Writing...

651
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,212
I could feel him with me.

652
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,988
It wasn't my fault, Mom.

653
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,326
And it wasn't mine.

654
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,344
Her son didn't have
a brain aneurysm.

655
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:50,081
Nope. She shouldn't have
let him drive in the rain.

656
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,685
Jack was never very coordinated.

657
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:58,060
As your boss, I am opposed
to you lying to a patient.

658
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,226
As your girlfriend,
I'm glad you care.

659
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:01,425
I don't.

660
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,866
I just wanted to
save Jack Cannon.

661
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:08,506
I can see why you like him.

662
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,413
I started reading one of
the books you gave me.

663
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,674
I find that very
hard to believe.

664
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,237
Why? Because I can't
like something you like?

665
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,058
We couldn't possibly have
something in common?

666
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,074
Because I lied about
giving you the books.

667
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,052
Oh. Oh...

668
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,550
Wilson told you. Yeah.

669
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,455
He's such a gossip.

670
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:32,087
I'm not gonna dump you because
we like different food or books or music.

671
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:35,724
On the other hand, I might
dump you if you don't talk to me

672
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,411
when you have a problem
with our relationship.

673
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,405
I know you believe that
now. But the fact is...

674
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:44,909
Who cares about
common? Common is boring.

675
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:49,370
It's common. I
like being with you.

676
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,313
You make me better.

677
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,885
Hopefully, I make you better.

678
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,983
What we have is uncommon,

679
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,092
and I've never been happier.

680
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:21,440
Mind giving us a
moment alone, Christina?

681
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,252
I'd like to thank you.

682
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,918
Great. You can dedicate
the next <i>Jack Cannon</i> to me.

683
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,022
I can't.

684
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,152
You're still in pain?

685
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,229
No.

686
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:42,199
You did everything
you said and more.

687
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,134
I can finally move on.

688
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,330
Thank you.

689
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:47,930
Move on, where?

690
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,667
I want to write
books for adults.

691
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:56,978
What about Jack? Your last
book, you didn't answer anything.

692
00:41:57,048 --> 00:42:00,541
The way I ended
Jack's story is perfect.

693
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:04,846
Each reader can decide what
fate they want for him themselves.

694
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:09,385
Yeah, but that's stupid.
That doesn't make any sense.

695
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,720
How many answers
do you get in real life?

696
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,825
This is a book. Books have
beginnings, middles and ends.

697
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,336
You can't just leave it on a
cliffhanger. Who does that?

698
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:22,465
I'm sorry. His story's done.

699
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:27,877
There's really nothing you
can say to change my mind.

700
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,072
Your son

701
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,393
was very lucky to
have you as his mother.

702
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,934
That was... Oh, shut up.
