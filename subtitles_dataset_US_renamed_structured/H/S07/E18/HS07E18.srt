1
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,207
Book you for 9:00 o'clock?

2
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:17,510
Uh-huh.

3
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:20,782
Take the day off. All right.

4
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,729
So, what did you do?

5
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,828
You figured out I was in
jail, but you don't know why?

6
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,729
I've been busy.

7
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,464
Excessive prescribing.

8
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,006
Not that busy.

9
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,005
I know that you pled down
to excessive prescribing.

10
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,240
My question was,
"What did you do?"

11
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,278
Thirty-six-year-old, non-smoking,
junior high science teacher

12
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,347
started coughing blood in
the middle of homeroom.

13
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,551
Uh...

14
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,318
House says he's gonna be
out for the next three days.

15
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,260
Sweet. If I go
straight to the airport,

16
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,795
I can make Cabo for last call.

17
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,333
He also said to call
him if we find a case.

18
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,844
Which we didn't. MARTHA:
What do you call this?

19
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,202
It could be a case, it could be
nothing. Sadly, we'll just never know.

20
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,225
He's coughing blood.
A lot of people are.

21
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,587
Right now I have
to get to Vernon

22
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,286
while there's still
enough powder to ski on.

23
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,475
<i>This is where a lesser man would
make a "black guy skiing" joke.</i>

24
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,441
You owe me a body shot.

25
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,820
Make it fast, I'm driving.

26
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,482
I don't want to
end up in jail, like

27
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,354
a person should who used
their phone illegally while driving.

28
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,954
<i>Thirty-six-year-old male
with hemoptysis, headaches,</i>

29
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,829
chills and chest
pain. Where are you?

30
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,563
On my way to the Greater Schenectady
Chili Cook-Off and Spud Gun Competition.

31
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,835
<i>That's your honeymoon?</i>

32
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,339
Nope. Dominika went
to A.C. with her boyfriend.

33
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,310
<i>ER ruled out bronchitis,
pneumonia and lung cancer.</i>

34
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,812
So, diagnosis
boring. It's epistaxis.

35
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,559
It's a nose bleed. Blood runs into
his lungs, he coughs it back out.

36
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,893
The flu explains the
rest of the symptoms.

37
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,351
<i>Going once,</i>

38
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,579
<i>going twice...</i>

39
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,419
Toxic exposure to ammonia or
sulphites can traumatize the lungs,

40
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,516
cause neuralgias or fevers.

41
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,528
Fits better because of
his radiating chest pain.

42
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,655
<i>Sold to Masters.</i>

43
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,997
Do a home search for toxins.
Draw cultures for bacteria and fungi.

44
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,902
You're married?

45
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,940
You were gone so long.

46
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,371
Green card.

47
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,099
Thanks for not saying anything.
I just need some time to...

48
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:45,549
I didn't do it for you. Some
puzzles are just too good to share.

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,281
This is my exit.

50
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,220
Chili?

51
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,356
Hate chili.

52
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,294
Love spud guns.

53
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,506
You get nose bleeds?

54
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,905
Yeah. Yeah.

55
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,418
You think that's where
the blood came from?

56
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,604
I don't just
think it, I hope it.

57
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,055
When was the last
time it happened?

58
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,103
At the quarterfinals.

59
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,738
I coach volleyball,

60
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,209
and during warm-ups, I got hit
in the nose a few months ago.

61
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,756
You coach volleyball
in a gym? Yes.

62
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,287
With showers? Yes.

63
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,586
Clean showers?

64
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,129
Not particularly.

65
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,673
Blood you were
coughing out wasn't blood.

66
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,098
Dirty gym washroom
means Serratia infection.

67
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,065
Your lungs are
full of red bacteria.

68
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,265
You're right. It was
an interesting case.

69
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,307
You start him on Levaquin, I'll
start looking for my good flip-flops.

70
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,651
I think that might be blood.

71
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,116
What's this really
all about, House,

72
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,661
as convincing as I find your deep
devotion to vegetable trajectory?

73
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,887
First of all, it's a tuber.

74
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,758
And you're just jealous
because your potato-related plans

75
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,891
are more of the
serving-up-fries variety.

76
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,305
You did time,

77
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,100
means your license is suspended,

78
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:17,005
which means your leave of
absence is definitely indefinite.

79
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,004
What exactly are
you going back to?

80
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,208
I'd only have to serve up fries

81
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,980
until the medical board hearing.

82
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,948
I stand corrected.

83
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:31,150
You obviously have a
rich, full life waiting for you.

84
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,159
I'll slow down the car
and you can roll out.

85
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,859
I don't even have
a change of clothes.

86
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,023
Damn.

87
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,167
If only I had planned for that.

88
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,679
Okay, here's what I got.

89
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,544
One, you were in
jail for six months,

90
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,174
but you were gone about a year.

91
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,128
Which means that when you
left, you hadn't been arrested.

92
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,884
Two, you enjoy being
known as a number.

93
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,551
You don't want people to know the real
you 'cause you think the real you is weak.

94
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,326
You were running

95
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:15,802
a bleeding heart medical
consulting business for illegals

96
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,701
or some other
sympathetic underclass.

97
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,830
No.

98
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,635
Overclass? This interrogation
thing is getting annoying.

99
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,973
Studies have shown that
un-annoying interrogations,

100
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,205
50% less effective.

101
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,693
Why are you so determined
to bring me to this competition?

102
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,976
Why don't you bring Wilson?

103
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,449
Wilson thinks it's stupid.

104
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,349
I think it's stupid!

105
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,381
Junior year of high
school, you placed fourth

106
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,392
in the West Virginia
All-County Science Fair.

107
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,560
Your project, clean combustion.

108
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,531
Yeah. I also wore a training
bra. Things have changed.

109
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,692
Not that much.

110
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,765
I've been going to this
contest for four years.

111
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,739
And for four years,
I've come second

112
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:58,174
to a pissant named Harold Lam.

113
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,209
This is serious?

114
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,174
Second!

115
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,355
Okay.

116
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,584
I can help you.

117
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,126
But, I'm going to need to make
a personal stop along the way.

118
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,286
What kind of stop?

119
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,190
Personal. Did I
not mention that?

120
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,111
<i>You gonna tell me
where you were last night?</i>

121
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,626
I ran into a friend.

122
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,263
We had 50 bucks on the Bulls. I
had to eat a large pizza by myself.

123
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,466
You missed me.

124
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,204
Not as much as I missed my $50.

125
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,793
Where'd you meet
her? At the hospital.

126
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,252
If it's Masters, just lie to me.

127
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,254
It's the new CNA
in the third floor.

128
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,621
The redhead? She's hot.

129
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,785
Yeah, and I'm seeing
her again tomorrow night.

130
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,923
I don't know how you do it.

131
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,198
Is it the cute, harmless vibe,
the self-deprecating humor,

132
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,757
or just straight-up roofies?

133
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,170
If you're interested,
I do seminars.

134
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:23,085
No electric. No gas,
either. It's cold in here.

135
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,429
The good thing is, I found a guy who
makes you look like a good roommate.

136
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,568
Maybe hoarding's a symptom.

137
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,765
Could be caused by brain
injury, or early onset Alzheimer's.

138
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,484
Most likely that
it's psychological.

139
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,739
As to what's making
him cough blood,

140
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,938
dealer's choice.

141
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,005
<i>Declutter Your Home.
The Hoarder's Handbook.</i>

142
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,674
He's hoarding books on hoarding.

143
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,578
Ugh.

144
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,448
He doesn't have running water.

145
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,183
How does this guy live,

146
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,768
let alone make it to work every
day, and teach a bunch of kids?

147
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,194
Fridge is on. He's hooked it
up to a neighbor or something.

148
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,160
Cat.

149
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,306
I might have to throw up.

150
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,341
He'll wanna keep that, too.

151
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,505
Aspergillosis.

152
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,544
Explains the coughing blood,

153
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,618
and if he's formed
small aspergillomas,

154
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,445
it could explain the
headache and chest pain.

155
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,455
I'll be in the car.

156
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,856
Okay. Turn right.

157
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:35,859
You were writing bogus
prescriptions for medical marijuana.

158
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:41,064
Please say no because you have to
be an idiot to actually screw that up.

159
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,075
No.

160
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,145
I mean, I was, but
I didn't get caught.

161
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:50,179
I have to admit, you have one of
the best game faces I've ever seen.

162
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:53,416
Also one of the
best game bodies.

163
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,681
Pull over.

164
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,356
Just a second.

165
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,663
Didn't know you were
a Jehovah's Witness.

166
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:51,802
Yeah, the weak lost faith when Christ
didn't return in '75, but I still believe.

167
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,283
So you're really not gonna
tell me what just happened.

168
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,521
I don't know about
you, but I'm starving.

169
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,469
You broke into my home?

170
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,971
We slowly pushed into your home.

171
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,641
So, what did you find?

172
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,370
A compost heap in your fridge.

173
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,239
We think you have aspergillosis.

174
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,473
It's treatable
with anti-fungals.

175
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,813
You do remarkably well
for living like you live.

176
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,219
I use bottled water
and flashlights.

177
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,822
Just like camping.

178
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,687
Fun.

179
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,238
We're also gonna
need a psych consult.

180
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,417
I'm not a hoarder.

181
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,865
Just a major slob.

182
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,597
You save ear wax.

183
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,609
You know, I'm actually kind of
hurt that you don't know what I did.

184
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:01,875
I'm not worth bribing a court
official or hacking into police records?

185
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,109
What's the fun in that?

186
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:06,675
You could've at least hired
Cuddy's weird boyfriend.

187
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,385
Lucas? Mmm-hmm.

188
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,115
You don't know?

189
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,456
What, is he dead or something?

190
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,422
No.

191
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,902
Actually, until a couple of weeks
ago, I was Cuddy's weird boyfriend.

192
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,971
You're gonna have to
do a lot better than that.

193
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,720
Are you okay?

194
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,546
Yeah, I'm fine.

195
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,920
It's not a big deal.

196
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,261
I killed a man.

197
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,155
Psych eval gave us nothing.

198
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,660
So our patient is just an average
Joe with a 2-foot pile of used Q-tips?

199
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,821
Whatever he is, he
doesn't have aspergillosis.

200
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,693
Pain's intensified and
now he needs oxygen.

201
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,742
There's gotta be all kinds
of toxins in that place.

202
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,010
Exposure issues
don't make sense.

203
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,179
He's been here a full day,
he'd be getting better, not worse.

204
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,765
Unless exposure was
keeping him from getting worse.

205
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,786
Gas was off at his place.
How does he stay warm?

206
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,071
Portable heater? Or
portable gas heater,

207
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,509
which emits carbon monoxide...

208
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,207
Which is a vasodilator.

209
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,907
The low-grade exposure was
actually improving his lung capacity.

210
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,260
We bring him
here, he gets worse.

211
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,049
If we're right, don't need House
and we still get two days off.

212
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,321
Still have to prove it.

213
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,553
Someone's gotta go back
into that place and test for CO.

214
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,127
Chase and I can go.

215
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:58,721
It's only fair.

216
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,528
Fairness is important.

217
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,441
You're awfully quiet.

218
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,708
Sorry. It's just how I get around
people who've recently killed a man.

219
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,714
It wasn't...

220
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,893
You know, I've had
a pretty rough year.

221
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,028
Do you think maybe we could
just give this whole thing a rest?

222
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,782
You killed a man!

223
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,048
You pled out to drugs.

224
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,954
Hit and run, under
the influence.

225
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,461
The guy you kneed in the groin

226
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,090
was your date who
dropped a dime on you.

227
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,325
I'm asking you to let it go.

228
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,097
Yeah, I really wish I was the
kind of person who could do that.

229
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,338
Ruby, right?

230
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,973
Yeah.

231
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,814
Hey, how are you liking PPTH?

232
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,785
It's great. Everyone's
so friendly.

233
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,153
Yeah. Especially Dr. Taub.

234
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:02,458
Don't worry. I'm not gonna bust your
chops. I just wanna know one thing.

235
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,123
How did he get you
to go out with him?

236
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,660
Why? Is there something...

237
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,599
No, no, no. He's great.

238
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,298
You know, I'm just
asking because...

239
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,832
Well, he's...

240
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:19,871
Um...

241
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,681
You know what? Never
mind. It's none of my business.

242
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,148
You guys have fun tonight.

243
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,447
I'm not seeing him tonight.

244
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,180
We had plans but, he canceled.

245
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,071
This thing's got no fuel valve.

246
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,077
Means you can't
regulate the input.

247
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,147
What is this? A
barbeque lighter?

248
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,650
Your gun sucks.

249
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,690
We should treat this
like an archeological dig.

250
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,397
Grid the site, excavate,
catalog, analyze.

251
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,563
You like it here?

252
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,880
What, you don't think
this is fascinating?

253
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,710
Not nearly as fascinating as the
fact that you think it's fascinating.

254
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,874
But this guy kept everything
he ever came into contact with.

255
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,214
An interactive life history.

256
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,082
It's an indiscriminate
pile of rubbish.

257
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,588
Mmm.

258
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,422
For the most part,
so are our lives.

259
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,228
There's no carbon monoxide.

260
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,899
A bit of a blow to Foreman's
exposure hypothesis.

261
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,491
And my plan to get
out of here quickly.

262
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,108
Maybe we don't just figure out
the "what," we figure out the "why."

263
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,174
Then, maybe...

264
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,802
From the size and
the undigested seeds,

265
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,675
I'm guessing this
came from a raccoon.

266
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,439
If you're thinking Q fever,

267
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,281
it fits.

268
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,528
So, why are you still looking?

269
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,783
Well, we only found one thing.

270
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,083
And it fits perfectly.

271
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,516
Yeah, but that
doesn't mean it's...

272
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,955
Chase?

273
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,845
You missed
something at his place.

274
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,819
His wife.

275
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,145
Nina.

276
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,366
I didn't know where you were.

277
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,121
I'm so sorry. I
couldn't get home.

278
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,018
You okay?

279
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,121
We think you both have Q fever.

280
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,008
We found raccoon feces
in the kitchen cupboard.

281
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,365
We're gonna start
you on doxycycline.

282
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,195
Why wouldn't you
tell us you're married?

283
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,314
Fewer people who know
about it, the easier it is.

284
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,465
When can I go back?

285
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,593
She gets anxious when
she's away from her things.

286
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,235
She's the hoarder.
He just lives there.

287
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,003
On purpose?

288
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,847
She's my wife.

289
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,128
How do they not
have half-inch drill bits?

290
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,749
By the way, Harold's
probably gonna hit on you.

291
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,990
Everything I have, he
wants. Just turn him down flat.

292
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,656
Unless... Yes.

293
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,997
Let's stop shopping. I'll just do
him and get him to throw the contest.

294
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,832
I'm not suggest...

295
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,374
Would you do that?

296
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,136
How is this thing judged?

297
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,939
Hang time, distance
and accuracy.

298
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,172
Okay, how about this?

299
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,272
You met a guy in a club, you
brought him home, he ODed.

300
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,681
So, the guy now
writhing on his front porch

301
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,777
was the dealer who
sold you the faulty goods.

302
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:48,964
Categories weighted the same?

303
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,012
Yup.

304
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,370
Screw accuracy, we're gonna
double distance and hang time.

305
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,723
Beat Harold on points.

306
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,853
We need raw power.
Where's the fertilizer?

307
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,964
By all means, Kaczynski.

308
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,044
Hi.

309
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,712
You and Taub sharing phones now?

310
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,717
He's seeing the
redhead on the third floor.

311
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,963
Please tell me you're not talking
about the hot, new CNA with the dimples.

312
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,011
She confirmed it.

313
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,992
What she didn't confirm was
her date tonight. He bailed on her.

314
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,304
He's standing her up. He must
have something better going on.

315
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,797
Better than sex
with a 22-year-old?

316
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,921
Who's RT-92?

317
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,431
Presumably a 21-year-old.

318
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,629
Whoever it is, Taub's meeting
him at my place at 8:00,

319
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,604
which is usually
when I go to the gym.

320
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,631
Guess you'll be
missing spin class.

321
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,783
<i>Okay, contestants. Field
is now open for practice.</i>

322
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,318
<i>You've got one hour. Have fun.</i>

323
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,821
Schedule 80 PVC is
pressure-rated for 220 psi.

324
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:59,347
Fuel valve 300. We
can easily push it to 250.

325
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,950
Have your friend, Harold,
peeing in his pants.

326
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,536
Damn.

327
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,074
Be cool.

328
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,026
Harold.

329
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,099
House.

330
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,899
You look good.

331
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,829
I like that jacket on you.

332
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,673
Thanks.

333
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,065
You filled out a little.

334
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,869
Who's the babe?

335
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,407
She's the boot in your ass.

336
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,783
Perhaps you've heard of famed
Russian physicist, Olga Petrovich.

337
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,683
Olga Petrovich is 72-years-old.

338
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,554
And her granddaughter

339
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,291
works in a little
place called JPL.

340
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,561
I did an internship
there last summer.

341
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:19,928
She killed a man.

342
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,141
I'm guessing she didn't
do it with a spud gun.

343
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:30,307
Just a bad combustion valve.

344
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,752
Shut up.

345
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,225
On my sofa.

346
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,762
Oh!

347
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,728
Hey.

348
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,938
You remember my wife?

349
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,569
Hi, Eric.

350
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,013
Hey.

351
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,017
RT-92.

352
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,794
I hope you like rhubarb.

353
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,268
We're celebrating.

354
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,137
We're going rogue.

355
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:33,137
We rip out the combustion
valve, replace it with this,

356
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:37,013
so there's enough pressure to
blow out at maximum velocity.

357
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:39,312
Turning the spud

358
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,149
into spudnik.

359
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,953
What do we use for discs?

360
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,557
Here's a hint. I
actually hate rhubarb.

361
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,792
Pie tins.

362
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,463
You're a genius.

363
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,201
You know that I'm a doctor?

364
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,371
Any interest I have in the
human body is purely clinical.

365
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,465
Yeah, that line never
works for me, either.

366
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,474
That line always works for you.

367
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,922
So what did you do?

368
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,519
No more guessing?

369
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,030
I need to know.

370
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:33,934
I could make some phone calls,

371
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,032
see if we can speed up
your medical board hearing.

372
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,805
In the meantime,

373
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:42,075
no one can stop me
from hiring an assistant.

374
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,489
You were right this morning.

375
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,428
I met a guy at a coffee shop,
we went back to my place,

376
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:06,061
and he ODed.

377
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,233
Damn.

378
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,275
Could've saved
myself a job offer.

379
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,673
We both acted like idiots.

380
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,910
And I ended up doing time.

381
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:22,418
Guess he did more.

382
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,097
When we first moved into the
house, we had people over all the time.

383
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:42,203
And then she just
started collecting things.

384
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,301
I figured it was a hobby.

385
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,044
Piles turned into art projects,

386
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,950
and art projects turned
into what you saw.

387
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,818
So why do you stay?

388
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,556
To everyone else,
the world is full of junk.

389
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,455
Meaningless,
ugly, broken things.

390
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,500
But to Nina,

391
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,057
every shape,

392
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,971
every color, texture, smell,

393
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,864
they all tell a story.

394
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,671
They're all worth treasuring.

395
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,474
I wouldn't wish what
she has on anyone,

396
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:23,038
but every now and
then, I get a glimpse

397
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,515
of what she sees,

398
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,410
and it helps.

399
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,427
Your lungs are
clearing up nicely.

400
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,534
Respiratory rate's
normal, temp's normal.

401
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,365
Looks like you're gonna be fine.

402
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:49,705
Is she okay?

403
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,704
Something's wrong
with her heart.

404
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,083
The husband is fine, the wife
is worse. She had a heart attack.

405
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,314
Her heart attack could
be from a complication.

406
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,448
Q fever would've caused congestive
heart failure, not myocardial infarction.

407
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:42,392
So she had Q fever and something
else that causes heart attack?

408
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:44,987
And the hoarding. Now that
the wife is the only patient,

409
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:46,258
hoard is back on the board.

410
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,299
Or we were wrong about Q fever.

411
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,744
I don't buy that it's
just a coincidence.

412
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,761
<i>It's not a coincidence.
Diagnosis X caused the hoarding,</i>

413
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,874
which caused the Q fever
when the raccoons came

414
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,499
to spend spring
break at her house.

415
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,268
<i>Now all we have
to do is solve for X.</i>

416
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,313
I remember somebody saying
that hoarding could be a symptom.

417
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,904
We should do an MRI.

418
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,779
Hydrogen sulphide.

419
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,309
It's given off by
eggs and rotting food,

420
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,787
long-term exposure could
cause the pulmonary issues,

421
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,066
headaches... CHASE:
And the heart attack.

422
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,150
Hydrogen sulphide
is also a vasodilator.

423
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,785
<i>Which my crack team
never tested the place for,</i>

424
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,963
whereas half my crack team
never tested the place for people.

425
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,433
<i>So we should go
back. Check it out.</i>

426
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,941
Might be safer to just assume
we're right and start treatment.

427
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,474
<i>Go with God. And
some air freshener.</i>

428
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,168
You know, maybe Taub was right,

429
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,540
so I'm gonna stay here with him

430
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,301
and help him with the MRI.

431
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,721
<i>Shine up your spuds, folks.</i>

432
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,454
<i>We're gonna start shooting for
hang time in just a few minutes.</i>

433
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,193
Okay, wind's coming
from the south-east.

434
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,833
So we're gonna have to
aim five degrees to the left.

435
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,087
We're gonna break
14 seconds. I can feel it.

436
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,029
When I was 10 or 11, my dad
used to take us to this county fair,

437
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,799
and there was this kid.

438
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:06,343
What?

439
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,008
Who's "us"?

440
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,048
My mom and me.

441
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:16,488
Your mom, who had
advanced-stage Huntington's.

442
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,860
You have a sibling, which
you've never mentioned.

443
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,393
Why did you slip up now?

444
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,023
Not everything means something.

445
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,729
We're gonna be up soon. I
wanna check the pressure.

446
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:38,704
You don't wake up in the middle of
the night to cry over a dead stranger.

447
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,542
You don't confess to killing a
man and then hide the details

448
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:46,244
unless the details reveal more
about you than the crime itself.

449
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,846
You pled down to drugs,

450
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,054
you've got a horrible
genetic disease

451
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,219
and a sibling who's
suddenly on your mind.

452
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,259
You euthanized your brother.

453
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,298
And the guy back at
the house was the doctor

454
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,871
who wouldn't help
you cover it up.

455
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,732
Guy back at the house,
he's my cellmate's boyfriend.

456
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,074
He cheated on her
when she was inside.

457
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,605
But I was right about
everything else?

458
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,882
Congratulations.

459
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,505
You're mad.

460
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,467
No.

461
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,939
Actually, I'm impressed.

462
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,311
Messing around on a 22-year-old
hottie with your wife, on my sofa.

463
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:50,858
You're a full-throttle
head case.

464
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,851
I was doing you a
solid with the sofa.

465
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,311
Rachel wanted
to do it in your bed.

466
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,186
You've got the memory foam top.

467
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:58,814
Let's make this really simple.

468
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,224
If I own it, I don't
want you doing it on it.

469
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:05,962
You might wanna get
rid of your kitchen table.

470
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,526
Look, I'm sorry.
But it was worth it.

471
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:10,693
Yeah, I bet.

472
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,714
You get to mess with her
physically and emotionally.

473
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:13,831
I still care about her.

474
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,136
Not enough to let her
move on with her life.

475
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,146
And while we're talking
about your bad ideas,

476
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,874
MRI is clean.

477
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:28,378
There has to be some kind of
inciting psychological incident.

478
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,387
This is perfect for you.

479
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,124
You get all the human
interaction you crave

480
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,057
without any actual
human interaction.

481
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,493
She was a cheerleader. Hah.

482
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,741
You know, when you're interested
in something and nobody else is,

483
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,700
the polite thing is
to keep it to yourself.

484
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,430
Popular, beautiful, gregarious.

485
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:48,871
Hydrogen sulphide is about two parts
per billion, the size of a healthy fart.

486
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,676
I'll be back for you in July.

487
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,561
He couldn't do it himself.

488
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,534
He was...

489
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,129
The disease had
progressed too far.

490
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,730
He was flailing,

491
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:26,301
he didn't have any
control over his own body.

492
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,576
He'd pretty much lost
control of his mind, too,

493
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:38,447
but every once in a while, he
would have a few seconds of lucidity.

494
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,121
He turned to me, and he said,

495
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,285
"It's time."

496
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,730
I hooked up the IV,

497
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,438
I used gloves. I knew
they'd get me on the drugs,

498
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:56,669
but they couldn't prove
who pushed the plunger.

499
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,257
I put in the needle, and he just

500
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,752
got quiet.

501
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,425
And it was over.

502
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,800
And I was alone.

503
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,976
And one day, I
will be that sick,

504
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,274
and there will be no
one there when it's time.

505
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,205
I didn't expect
compassion from you.

506
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,240
I would've taken commiseration.

507
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,333
Hell, I would've
taken revulsion.

508
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,345
Any emotional engagement at all.

509
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,383
It's no wonder Cuddy
broke up with you.

510
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:42,677
<i>Folks, Chad Mochrie just won
first place in the Chili Cook-Off.</i>

511
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,912
<i>Congratulations, Chad, that
cocoa powder really did it.</i>

512
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,678
Dumped in a field in
Schenectady. Ouch!

513
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,085
You mind if I make a move?

514
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:54,925
I know she's out of my league,

515
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,088
but she's at a spud gun
contest with a soon to be

516
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,063
five-time runner-up,

517
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,259
so she's probably got
some self-esteem issues.

518
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,540
You wouldn't.

519
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,437
So?

520
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:51,873
Warning.

521
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,248
They gave you a warning?

522
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,320
Well, it turns out
our friend, Harold,

523
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,254
felt up the Sheriff's daughter
last night at the potato mash mixer,

524
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,656
so Sheriff's feeling
kind of ambivalent.

525
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,186
You always get
your way, don't you?

526
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,762
Not always.

527
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:14,599
Today would have been
our one-year anniversary.

528
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,668
Hmm.

529
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,636
Which is an incredibly
arbitrary thing to celebrate.

530
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,328
If you want to get to
the bottom of something,

531
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,446
you literally have to
dig down to the bottom.

532
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,355
So, stratigraphically,

533
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:35,586
the oldest stuff I found
was in the bedroom,

534
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,459
and the oldest stuff in the
bedroom was in the closet.

535
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,099
And at the bottom
of the closet...

536
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,465
Tell me about this.

537
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,511
<i>We have a new
symptom, infertility.</i>

538
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,376
<i>They wanted kids
but couldn't have them.</i>

539
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,677
She started collecting
things to fill the void.

540
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,649
<i>We should run a full
hormone blood panel.</i>

541
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,483
Hey, Harriet the Spy,

542
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,054
<i>before you get
too full of yourself,</i>

543
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:05,954
<i>you might want to
go back to Bio 101.</i>

544
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,617
It takes two to not tango.

545
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,023
<i>Hubby could be shooting blanks.</i>

546
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:13,689
So, either it's a new symptom
that will help us save her life,

547
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,078
or it's a complete
waste of time.

548
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,037
Figure out which is fried,
the bacon or the eggs.

549
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:20,536
I'll start the hormone work-up.

550
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,904
<i>There's another option.</i>

551
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,908
<i>House, who's that?</i> Radio.

552
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,342
<i>Sounded a lot like Thirteen.</i>

553
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,040
It's a Thirteen tribute band,

554
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,707
<i>with their new song,</i> I Got A
Better Theory Than Masters.

555
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,444
<i>She said they never had kids.</i>

556
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:34,679
Oh, my God.

557
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:35,982
Where the hell have you been?

558
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:37,613
I think we've all got something

559
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,521
a little more important
to worry about than...

560
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,425
<i>No, we don't. She's
been missing for a year.</i>

561
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:45,053
And you can ask her all about it
when she comes in on Monday.

562
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,188
Monday? This Monday?

563
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,665
<i>Can I talk?</i>

564
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,931
She said they never had kids,
and you all jumped to infertility.

565
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,767
You never considered
the other option.

566
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,943
And the bitch is back.

567
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,390
We think you have
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

568
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,184
It would explain the symptoms.

569
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,021
It also causes miscarriages.

570
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,430
Is that something you
think you might have?

571
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,413
Were you pregnant?

572
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,916
Three times.

573
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,991
The miscarriages
trigger the hoarding.

574
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,331
Hoarding eventually
made you sick, too.

575
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:58,893
Can you cure her?

576
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,997
We can treat the physical
symptoms as they arise,

577
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,109
make her life a lot better,

578
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:07,307
but the hoarding,

579
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,672
we're the wrong kind of doctors.

580
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,311
You lied to me?

581
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:18,981
For nine years?

582
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:23,592
I was so afraid of losing you.

583
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,535
What have I ever done
to make you afraid of that?

584
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,539
I need to get some air.

585
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,657
I've been selfish.

586
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:02,190
I need to let you move on.

587
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,870
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

588
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,465
No.

589
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,136
I just want you to be...

590
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,873
The last time you
got all noble on me,

591
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,472
we ended up dividing our dishes.

592
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,574
This time, I want to
make the decision.

593
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,644
You don't feel weird about this?

594
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,588
Of course I feel
weird about this.

595
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,216
It's confusing, and messy,

596
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,863
and dirty, dumb.

597
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:35,023
But we spent our whole lives trying
to do everything right, and it sucked.

598
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,199
Wasn't all bad.

599
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,326
It sucked, Chris.

600
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,498
And this,

601
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,164
whatever it is,

602
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,204
it's fun.

603
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,934
So,

604
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:49,173
I'm not taking advantage of you?

605
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,878
The fun is fading.

606
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,776
You know,

607
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,285
there's something
seriously wrong with us.

608
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,558
I know.

609
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,716
Home sweet home.

610
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,691
You owe me 87 bucks for gas.

611
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,664
I'll kill you.

612
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,036
When the time comes,
if you want me to.

613
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,149
I'd do it now if you like.

614
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,917
Yeah. I've got a
baseball bat in the back.

615
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,167
I'll see you Monday.
