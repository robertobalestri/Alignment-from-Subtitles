1
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:06,498
I have been fantasizing
about this for months.

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:10,237
Forget it. We're not here to fool
around. I'm not fooling around.

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,778
I need this.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,914
You're an idiot, you know that?

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,280
Just shut up and
give me a boost.

6
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,688
Hurry your ass up!

7
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:55,320
Hey, sometimes a guy's
gotta do what a guy's gotta do.

8
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,550
Jaguar One to Control.

9
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:02,119
Sorry for the delay. Glenn had
to take a leak. It was unavoidable.

10
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,893
Target area is clear. Repeat,
target area confirmed clear.

11
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,304
Dr. Lee, target area's cleared,
launch vehicle's in range.

12
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,968
All systems go. Thank you,
Cesar. Whenever you're ready.

13
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,810
The CT-10's light enough
to launch from a UAV,

14
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,782
but can penetrate 8 feet of 6,000
psi concrete before detonation.

15
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,943
Bombs away.

16
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,011
The precision guidance system's
not affected by darkness or weather

17
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,488
and can hit a 2-foot wide
target from 69,000 feet.

18
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,136
- What about sound?
- None in-bound at all.

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,425
We've developed a new fin
and a baffling design that...

20
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:40,126
Ordnance on target
in three, two, one.

21
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,105
I feel better already.

22
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,440
You need to see a shrink.

23
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,145
Seriously.

24
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,985
Well done. That's
really... Wendy!

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,514
Call 911!

26
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,246
<i>Karma's a bitch.</i>

27
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,821
You think her seizures
are the result of bad karma?

28
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,332
I think if you spend your days

29
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,882
designing ever more effective
ways to blow people up,

30
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,893
stuff's bound to
come back to you.

31
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,240
Thirsty. Side effect of the
new antihistamine I'm on.

32
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,400
You don't seem congested.

33
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,671
Intriguing. You have any
thoughts about our patient?

34
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,806
Got some questions about whether
Thirteen really believes in karma

35
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,042
or just wants to.

36
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,983
As to the patient, it's not gonna
be easy to break into her office.

37
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,363
You might want to
start with her home.

38
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,322
We could ask to look
through her office.

39
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,721
And we could do an MRI first.

40
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,584
Sure. Go ahead.

41
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,026
If you're not interested in
the case, why'd you take it?

42
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,326
I'm definitely interested.

43
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,424
Could be a tumor,
could be a CNS bleed.

44
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,697
But what do you do when
you got two interesting puzzles?

45
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,829
Two?

46
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,871
50 bucks! Pay up.

47
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,014
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Bet's off.

48
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,249
The fight was fixed.

49
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,290
The punch barely
even touched him.

50
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,758
You bet on Foley
to beat Zachary?

51
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,193
Speed beats power.

52
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,130
Unless speed has been
paid to speedily take a dive.

53
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,098
He touched him enough
to put him on the canvas

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,344
and the official
counted him out,

55
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,894
which means you
officially owe me

56
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,439
50 bucks.

57
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,765
We bet on a sporting event.

58
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,241
That was not sporting.

59
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,302
At less than 30 seconds,
that was barely even eventy.

60
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,713
Okay, here's what I
saw, you lost and I won.

61
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,262
Well, you can take that to your
grave. You're not taking my 50 bucks.

62
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,745
Prove it. Prove it or
pay up. You got one day.

63
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,453
And don't make me send
my boys out looking for you.

64
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,584
What?

65
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,930
All right.

66
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,936
So, two puzzles.

67
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,904
Tie goes to the one
that cost me money.

68
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,462
We'll keep each other posted.

69
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,168
I've always been healthy.

70
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,009
I never even get colds.

71
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,981
I guess your luck
finally ran out.

72
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,618
I take it she doesn't like
people who make bombs.

73
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,750
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to... It's all right.

74
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,590
Half of my family
feels the same way.

75
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,561
Of course, they all
work on Wall Street, so...

76
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,932
Ever since the first Fourth
of July I can remember,

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,765
I've always loved explosions.

78
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,806
When I got to college
and I had to pick a major,

79
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,898
I figured I might as well pick
something I'm passionate about.

80
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,240
Destroying things. You weren't
passionate about anything else?

81
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,578
Bombs are tools
just like anything else.

82
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,311
You can use it to
make things better,

83
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,319
or you can use it t
make things worse.

84
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,519
I also like romantic
poetry and picnics.

85
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,635
Is there anything else you wanna
know before we do this MRI?

86
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,254
No. Try to stay
as still as possible.

87
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,922
This shouldn't take long.

88
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,703
Hey, how's it going?

89
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,510
You mind? There are
plenty of other seats.

90
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,839
I'm not here to judge.

91
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,506
You did what was best for you,
and I got no problem with that.

92
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,107
I'm not gonna ask you
nice again. Just go away.

93
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,551
Or what? You're
suddenly gonna fall down?

94
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,216
Listen, I got a problem.

95
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,723
A guy who knows absolutely
nothing about boxing,

96
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,294
because of you
now thinks he does.

97
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,956
You can imagine the
potential ramifications.

98
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,966
I need you to get on the phone
with him, and tell him you took a dive.

99
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,160
I didn't take a dive.

100
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,671
Take a picture of you to prove that
it was really you, and we're done.

101
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,034
Just enough to convince him, not
enough to get you in any trouble.

102
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,474
I didn't take a dive.

103
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,476
Yeah, that story's
getting boring.

104
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,218
Look, I'm not from the
commission, I'm not some bookie.

105
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,150
I'm a doctor. Here's my ID.

106
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,220
If you were a bookie,

107
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,557
you'd know no one pays a guy to
throw a fight he has no chance to win.

108
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,432
I was a 12-to-1 underdog,
lost my last five fights.

109
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,830
But you were the better fighter

110
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,369
and that last punch
barely touched you.

111
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,339
You ever been barely touched
by a guy who weighs 230 pounds?

112
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:24,902
Look at me. Look where
I am, what I'm wearing.

113
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,242
Do I look like a guy
who just got a payday?

114
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,248
I didn't throw the fight,

115
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,520
I just suck.

116
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,395
Ha!

117
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,421
Proof.

118
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,438
Just because he
wasn't hit in the face...

119
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,734
Look at his pupils.

120
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:59,039
He has anisocoria, which, given his
age, the adrenaline surge in the fight,

121
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:02,139
and the fact that he's still
alive, means he was tachycardic.

122
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,876
He has Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome.

123
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,350
The bet was on who would win,
not who would live the longest.

124
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,913
If he's physically unable to continue
because of a pre-existing illness,

125
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,426
then it's technically a no contest,
which means all bets are off.

126
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,755
You know that just because I
was right about this one fighter,

127
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,423
doesn't make you
any less of a man.

128
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,433
Actually, it would
if you were right.

129
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,230
Then, as I said
earlier, prove it.

130
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:27,798
And one possibly photoshopped cell
phone pic does not a diagnosis make.

131
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,413
Excuse me, Dr. House.

132
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,648
I'm a co-worker of Wendy
Lee's. I'm also her boyfriend.

133
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,918
Great. I'm a guy
who doesn't care.

134
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,821
She's your patient.

135
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,402
You thought I didn't know
who Wendy Lee was?

136
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,554
That makes sense.
I'm not good at names.

137
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,828
Did Dr. Fortune tell you that?

138
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,592
Her last boyfriend was a real
nut. He's basically stalking her.

139
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,105
See, this is what
I don't care about.

140
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,433
I don't care who cares about
her, who used to care about her.

141
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,303
If either one of you falls down
dead, you can drop me a note, but...

142
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,342
I think I know what's
wrong with her.

143
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:07,270
What, you screwed up in the lab and
accidentally spilled some bomb on her?

144
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,679
No.

145
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,850
He really is crazy.

146
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,247
<i>Poisoned?</i>

147
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,122
Apparently our mad scientist
is also a slutty scientist,

148
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,651
whose milkshake's got all the
nerds in the yard fighting over her.

149
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,664
She's a slut because she's
dated two different guys at work?

150
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,927
I'm sorry, I thought we
were still judging her.

151
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,469
She's not a slut
and it's not poison.

152
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:32,281
When we tested her blood and
cerebral spinal fluid for toxic exposure,

153
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,016
it was negative for every
poison we could think of.

154
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,805
Well, that just leaves every
poison we didn't think of.

155
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,187
She works in a bomb factory.

156
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,622
So do a lot of other
not-sick people.

157
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,524
If the guy had any actual
evidence she was poisoned,

158
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:43,380
he would've gone to
the police, not to us.

159
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,127
And if we had any evidence
of what was wrong with her,

160
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,952
you'd be showing us MRI results.
I assume they were negative.

161
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,514
Couldn't hurt to start activated
charcoal, see what happens.

162
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,490
You know what
else wouldn't hurt?

163
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,358
This case is
getting interesting.

164
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,862
Let's add a little danger.

165
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,320
Just because he has guns
doesn't make him a murderer.

166
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,582
Tell that to the bear.

167
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,129
Look in the desk. See if
he's got a diary or a journal.

168
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,457
Something tells me he's
not exactly a diary kind of guy.

169
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,223
Maybe a manifesto.

170
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,373
Just look. I'm gonna check
out the rest of the place.

171
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,491
See if he's got a computer.

172
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,034
It's Foreman. Yep.

173
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,162
<i>You break in yet?</i> Yeah,
we're in the abattoir now. Why?

174
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,003
You can leave. I think Taub
and I found what we're looking for.

175
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:47,213
Looks like she actually was being poisoned,
but she's been doing it to herself.

176
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,015
- I'm not an alcoholic.
- I know, I know,

177
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,248
the whole label
thing is so limiting.

178
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:58,587
You're a person who happens
to suffer from alcoholism.

179
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,525
You broke into my house and
now you're being a smart ass?

180
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,393
During your history, you
said you didn't drink. At all.

181
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,023
I don't. You just
collect bottles.

182
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,432
Yes.

183
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,505
I collect them for my friend.
She uses them in her art projects.

184
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,905
And you're ashamed of these art
projects. The bottles were hidden...

185
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,876
That's because my housekeeper
keeps throwing them out.

186
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,412
I've told her a
dozen times not to,

187
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,072
but either she doesn't
understand or she doesn't care.

188
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,720
Why would she lie?
That's the easy question.

189
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,017
She needs a government
security clearance for her job.

190
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,249
And what's the hard question?

191
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,415
If she's an alcoholic,

192
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,236
why doesn't she have at least
some partially full bottles in the house?

193
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,196
And why keep the empties?
Why not just throw them away?

194
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,927
So she's probably telling
the truth. So what do we do?

195
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,966
We start her on Valium
for alcohol withdrawal.

196
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,904
It's the best we've
got right now.

197
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:58,945
One normal EKG does
not a healthy person make.

198
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,580
Look, I told you, I just suck.
Oh, you make me so sad.

199
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,624
Don't talk like that. Why
do you care so much?

200
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,125
Kill me for loving my
patients. It's just what I do.

201
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,761
Hey, stop.

202
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,129
Stop!

203
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,673
My leg hurts. Just talk
to me for a moment.

204
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,340
You don't have to
be a loser. Thanks.

205
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,977
Whatever's wrong
with you, it's real.

206
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,680
Sick is good.

207
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,314
Sick means it can get
better. You could get better.

208
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,457
I don't mean healthier. I mean,

209
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,158
maybe you don't have to suck.

210
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,934
Figure out what's wrong with
yourself and leave me alone.

211
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,508
Abdominal pain.

212
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,380
She said it felt like
she was being stabbed.

213
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,055
Give her morphine,
5 milligrams IV.

214
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:13,686
Is it a symptom of the underlying
condition or a symptom of our treatment?

215
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,524
We'll know soon. I stopped our
treatment. We should restart it.

216
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,174
Acute pancreatitis from alcoholism
would cause this kind of pain.

217
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,496
It's stress related.

218
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,278
She's in a lot of pain.
She's under a lot of stress.

219
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,895
She's got two guys
fighting over her

220
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,881
and she just got done with
the final test of a new bomb.

221
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,339
Her guilt is killing her.

222
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,286
As far as you know, she likes being
the center of attention and loves her job.

223
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,387
As far as you know,
she doesn't drink.

224
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,488
What if it's a kidney infection?

225
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:36,142
Acute pyelonephritis could kill her
if we don't start her on IV antibiotics.

226
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,911
Would kill her if it
was pyelonephritis.

227
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,195
But since her urine and CSF
don't show signs of infection...

228
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,744
I paged House.

229
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,688
What? We got nothing.

230
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,193
Less than nothing since he's
actually ignoring my pages,

231
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,231
which means we have a sick
patient and apparently a sick boss.

232
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,908
Tell him you admit he's right.
Let's get him back to work.

233
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,384
If he's ignoring you, it's
because he trusts you.

234
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,944
No, it's not. No, it's not.

235
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,114
But he does. Thanks,
I feel warm inside.

236
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,127
But right now I'm debating which
bad idea I should pretend is a good idea

237
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,371
and force everybody
to implement.

238
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,863
I think this is good for him.

239
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,365
Obsessing over a bet is good?

240
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,061
And doing his actual job,
treating actual patients, that's bad?

241
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:32,469
House only doing what House
wants, is the only way he can function.

242
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:36,805
Since the breakup, he's been seeking
out crazier and crazier things to do

243
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,571
because they're crazy.

244
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,443
This... Well, it's not crazy.

245
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,039
No, just irresponsible
and possibly dangerous.

246
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,483
By House standards, it's dull.

247
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,487
This he's doing just
because he's interested.

248
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:52,047
I think House getting back
to doing stupid House stuff

249
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,653
for stupid House reasons is the
best thing that could happen to him.

250
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,829
I'll go explain
that to the patient.

251
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,704
<i>It's definitely
not pancreatitis.</i>

252
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,586
Restarting the treatment
obviously didn't help anything.

253
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,214
Assume you
tested for infections.

254
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,850
And I assume that look
means yes and I was wrong.

255
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,087
You call for a psych consult?

256
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,160
Wow, that's the same
look I just got from Chase.

257
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,167
So an hour ago, we had three
theories we couldn't agree on.

258
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,760
Now we've got no theories,
but we're in agreement.

259
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,774
CT and ultrasound show
inflammation in the renal capsule.

260
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,109
Could be an obstructing
calculus or perinephric abscess.

261
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,725
Blood cultures came back negative.
It's probably just a benign cyst.

262
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,061
Yeah, so let's just dismiss an
idea because it's probably nothing.

263
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,563
It could be gas in
the perinephric space,

264
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:31,854
in which case we should be
prepping her for emergency surgery.

265
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,292
What looks like
Wolff-Parkinson-White, but isn't?

266
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,133
Her EKG was normal. So was his.

267
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,261
That's why I said looks like, as
in similar to, but not the same.

268
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:49,239
You want us to help you
get out of paying your bet,

269
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,402
while your actual
patient lies in agony.

270
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,804
Who's the real bad guy here?

271
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,610
The guy who doesn't
care enough to help,

272
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,151
or the four guys who aren't
competent enough to help?

273
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,721
Works out too much,
gets pounded too much,

274
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,153
and not in the romantic way,

275
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,225
his pupils... I got it.

276
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,586
Your patient? No.

277
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,754
Plenty of time to save her
life after we save my money.

278
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,834
Underlying neurological condition
exacerbated by an acute UTI

279
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,836
brought on by her
sexual escapades.

280
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,634
Slut, escapades. How
do we treat? A scarlet A?

281
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,336
Sorry. Acute UTI brought on by her
healthy enjoyment of her womanhood.

282
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,003
We start her on IV ampicillin
and an aminoglycoside.

283
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,924
You ignore us all the time, you
go on crazy joyrides all the time,

284
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,518
but you answer pages, you sleep.

285
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,758
I know I'm gonna regret
doing this, but I'll ask anyway.

286
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,359
Is there anything
I can do to help?

287
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,097
Although...

288
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,490
Great news.

289
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,826
You have an underlying
neurological condition,

290
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:19,059
which together with your heart...
You said my heart was fine.

291
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,566
Yeah, I also said that I would
get you your career back.

292
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,666
But that doesn't seem to matter

293
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,641
since you've so clearly been
handed the golden spit bucket here.

294
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,711
Sympathetic overdrive.

295
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:37,313
It's a medical term,
so is "great news."

296
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,820
'Course if you
prefer wallowing...

297
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,521
All you need is a chin,

298
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,321
and a heart, apparently.

299
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,852
You can go back to being the
guy who won 20 of his first 20

300
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,229
instead of the guy who
lost five of his last five.

301
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,564
Technically I counted the
last one as a no contest.

302
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,570
And you save 50
bucks. I'm a doctor.

303
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,436
I don't tell a fat guy to lay
off bacon for less than 300.

304
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,737
This is about
dignity. For both of us.

305
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,576
Give me your arm.

306
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,943
Give me your arm.

307
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,213
What the hell?

308
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:22,016
Don't worry, it's just
epinephrine. Is it dangerous?

309
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,724
In the wrong hands,
very. So yeah, sort of.

310
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,929
This will only take
a few seconds.

311
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:33,300
And you are tachycardic.

312
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,239
You're... Are you psycho?

313
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,471
We combine the increased
heart rate with chest trauma

314
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,639
by applying a little sweet
science to the science.

315
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,115
Don't worry. I'll explain
more when you wake up.

316
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,017
Now, the punch that
supposedly knocked you out

317
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,955
looked like it was thrown by
an old cripple. Kind of like this.

318
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,493
Stop it. Three, two, one...

319
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,065
Huh.

320
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,597
Guess I must be older and
more crippled than I thought.

321
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,728
You're embarrassing me.

322
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,837
It doesn't make sense.

323
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,499
Maybe if I...

324
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,480
Get the hell out of
my life, you lunatic.

325
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,360
She's in V-tach. BP's dropping.

326
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,571
Whatever you're
doing isn't working.

327
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,791
Again. There's gotta be
some way to stop the seizures.

328
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,475
It's not a seizure. She's
having a heart attack.

329
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,659
No pulse. CESAR: That's
impossible. She runs marathons.

330
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,170
Charging 200. Clear.

331
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,603
Still no pulse.

332
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,110
Charging 300. Why
is this happening?

333
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,475
Clear.

334
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,710
My theory is that he's only avoiding
us because he really wants to avoid you.

335
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,081
<i>Mah nishtana?</i>

336
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,355
You made it through med school
without ever attending a seder?

337
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,152
It means, "Why is this night
different from all other nights?"

338
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:02,059
I'm not sure it is, but usually when
push comes to shove he shows up.

339
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,272
If the patient's still alive, then
push hasn't met shove yet.

340
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,816
The patient is hanging by a
thread and we don't have a clue why.

341
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,558
Then we have to assume
he does, and she isn't.

342
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,537
We could. Or we could assume that
something is seriously wrong with House,

343
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,039
and try to do
something about that.

344
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:18,043
This way, even if we're
wrong, nobody dies.

345
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,079
House is fine.

346
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,045
House is always fine.

347
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,547
I'm expanding my theory.

348
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,518
He's avoiding you and you're avoiding
him, and this patient is gonna die.

349
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,514
Not if you do your job.

350
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,101
You're an idiot.

351
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,204
How'd you get in here?

352
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,772
My boss has me break
into places all the time.

353
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,381
Pain's been getting worse.

354
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:05,788
Figured if I upped the Vicodin any
more, I'd end up back in a rubber room.

355
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,585
So this seemed like
the smarter choice.

356
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:12,697
You're an idiot.

357
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:17,064
You drove all the way over here
to break in and call me an idiot?

358
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,896
No, I drove all the
way over here to tell you

359
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,938
we're implanting an
automated cardio-defibrillator,

360
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,684
which won't actually do
anything to help the patient

361
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,753
except maybe give us enough
time to come up with a guess

362
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:27,542
as to what's actually
wrong with her.

363
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,945
Oh, that makes more sense.

364
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:34,919
And I broke in here because Cuddy
and Wilson, both, separately, asked me to.

365
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,546
Even more logical.

366
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,854
And that's not heroin.

367
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,087
Which means you knew
I was coming over here

368
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,595
and Cuddy and Wilson are
right. You're just playing a game.

369
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,963
Throwing out a bone and
watching us fight over it.

370
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,561
There is another theory.

371
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,741
Compound CS-804.

372
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:04,773
It's an experimental drug that's
supposed to re-grow muscle.

373
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,413
This experiment
was done on rats.

374
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,155
It's groundbreaking.
A huge success.

375
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,760
In rats.

376
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:23,899
They got four legs. Think
how fast it should work on one.

377
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,432
You're an idiot.

378
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,227
We've got a problem.

379
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,461
AICD not working?

380
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,512
If it was the defibrillator,
I'd be looking elsewhere.

381
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,368
Smells like bleeding. Rectal?

382
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,464
And vaginal.

383
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,986
Is it possible something got
perforated during surgery?

384
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,034
Is that an accusation?

385
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,340
Sounded like a question.

386
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,972
Just a straightforward inquiry

387
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,847
that only someone with serious
insecurities would take issue with.

388
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:17,151
Okay. So in answering I have to
decide between the only two possibilities,

389
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,128
"No," and "Yes," we
might have screwed

390
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:21,387
something up but are
intentionally hiding it

391
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,928
"because we're incompetent
and we're asses."

392
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,158
The answer's no. Glad we
didn't short-change that avenue.

393
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,428
It's a blood disorder,
a coagulopathy.

394
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,880
That's not a diagnosis. It's like
saying she has a runny nose.

395
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:35,170
True. But not saying she has a
runny nose risks getting snot all over us.

396
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,436
We can treat it. Cause
could still be a toxin.

397
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,753
She must have been
exposed to who knows...

398
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,679
Past tense. Which means she
would've been better now that she's not.

399
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,545
Same goes for House.

400
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,329
If this was about Cuddy, he
would have checked out weeks ago.

401
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,379
Something else is
going on. Something new.

402
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,895
That's an awfully simplistic
approach to matters of the heart.

403
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,501
House is rational.
He prides himself on...

404
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,393
No one is rational about emotions.
That's why they're emotions.

405
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,454
What do you think?

406
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:00,123
Me? I didn't say anything.

407
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,177
Exactly. You always have
some opinion on these things,

408
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,445
especially when
it comes to House,

409
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,413
doubly especially when it
comes to men and romance,

410
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,633
but suddenly you're
keeping your mouth shut.

411
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,206
House can't help us.

412
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,975
I respect his privacy,
no matter how stupid,

413
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,416
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd respect mine.

414
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,387
We need to treat the
underlying condition.

415
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,792
Could be cancer, sepsis, trauma,
liver disease, haemorrhagic fever...

416
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,593
I'm gonna start treating the symptoms while
you finish listing the possible causes.

417
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,182
The rats are doing great.

418
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,266
"Great" is a little vague.

419
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,310
Even better than
the previous study.

420
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,541
12% increase in
strength, 22% in flexibility,

421
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:24,674
and some improvement in
at least 60% of the subjects.

422
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,048
Have you done maximum
tolerated dose studies?

423
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,553
Not yet. But that's
part of the beauty.

424
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,988
Since the compound is
easily excreted in the urine,

425
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,719
as long as they keep hydrated,

426
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:37,456
there's really no reason to expect
any danger at virtually any dose.

427
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,328
I mean, obviously,
can't know for sure, but...

428
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,039
If it's worthy of the
preface "obviously,"

429
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,231
then obviously, it only needs
to be explained to idiots.

430
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,999
Do I look like an idiot?

431
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,679
Sorry. Cranky.

432
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,410
What I meant to say was, why
don't scientists have groupies?

433
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:58,848
Because I'd do you right now

434
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,546
if society wasn't telling me that
you're just an underpaid dork.

435
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,481
Thank you.

436
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,358
Are you all right?

437
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:11,928
Leg hurts.

438
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,163
Would you mind
getting me a coffee?

439
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,228
How does coffee help your leg?

440
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,533
It will prevent me from
walking to get the coffee.

441
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,331
Right.

442
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,195
The page said she's now
bleeding from her mouth.

443
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,636
You started treatment?
I said I would.

444
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,003
A "yes" would have been fine.

445
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:58,134
Not asking the question
would have been even better.

446
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,304
Any breathing issues? No.

447
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,144
But I'm not sure it's internal.

448
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,659
If it's coming from
both ends, it's internal.

449
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,743
Her gums look like
they were burned.

450
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,743
Experimental drugs?

451
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:46,114
That's unfair. 'Cause at one point,
even Vicodin was an experimental drug.

452
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,018
I have to go. Well, unless
you're going to do your job,

453
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,783
it can wait. I'm
going to do my job.

454
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,154
I'll give you a lift.

455
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,455
I'll give you two minutes.

456
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,157
But first I'm going to tell
you that I'm off the drugs

457
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,110
and then you'll feel silly because
you got nothing to say for two minutes.

458
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,134
Hmm.

459
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,295
Why are you off them?
'Cause they don't work.

460
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,830
Why were you on them? Because
they come in banana flavor.

461
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,206
You know the answer.

462
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,678
You think fixing your
leg will fix your life.

463
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:18,876
I think that my life will be
somewhat better if part of my life,

464
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,112
specifically my leg,
is somewhat better.

465
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,712
You think all your
problems are your leg.

466
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,968
So you're here to tell me that no matter
how depressed I may be, it's not enough.

467
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,552
I think you want
everything to be physical,

468
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,129
tangible, simple.

469
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:34,564
You want unhappiness to have
a cure. House, you obviously...

470
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,725
I hate that word.

471
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,400
I have to go now.

472
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,201
Actually, I don't. It would be rude
to walk out without saying anything.

473
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,566
<i>What about this?</i>

474
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,304
28-year-old woman presenting
with burn-like wounds in her mouth

475
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,404
and esophagus from
a candidiasis infection.

476
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,506
Interesting. And it would also be
relevant if the woman had had seizures.

477
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,303
If the fungus had
entered her bloodstream...

478
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,048
We would have seen
it in the blood work.

479
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,964
Acute myeloid leukemia can
cause swelling of the gums...

480
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,367
Again, interesting, but not
relevant. Again, you're being an ass.

481
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,669
She doesn't have a history
of blood diseases in her family,

482
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,754
her blood count's normal, and she
hasn't been exposed to a chemical toxin.

483
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,887
Not that we know of.

484
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,343
The guy she works the most
closely with is also her boyfriend.

485
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,677
You don't think
he would've told us

486
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,330
if there'd been some sort
of chemical spill or accident?

487
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,805
There is one other cause of AML.

488
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,084
Wait, where are you taking her?

489
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,723
We need to get her
into an isolation room

490
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:23,807
and prep for a hematopoietic
stem cell transplant.

491
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,975
Isolation? Why?

492
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,961
We think her blood and immune
system have been destroyed

493
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,749
by an exposure to
ionizing radiation.

494
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,332
We don't work with radiation.
Well, apparently your girlfriend does.

495
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,383
No. She doesn't. You're
wrong, it must be something else.

496
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:37,372
We found reports that your company
was developing tactical nuclear warheads

497
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,557
for bunker busting bombs.

498
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,543
Where? On Wikipedia?
Some paranoid idiot's blog?

499
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,310
I don't care where
you read it. It's not true.

500
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,912
You're saying there's absolutely no
chance that anyone in your company

501
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,599
is doing any experimental
research that you don't know about.

502
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:50,369
No. But I know Wendy,
and she wouldn't.

503
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,153
Maybe you don't know her
as well as you thought you did.

504
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,043
Excuse me. We have to go.

505
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,753
You need a drink.

506
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:10,021
I'm fine.

507
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,188
That wasn't a question.

508
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,129
You really do need a drink.

509
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,430
<i>We found a match.</i>

510
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:22,531
We'll start treatment as soon as
we get the HSC from the donor.

511
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,973
Shouldn't be long.

512
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,771
Where's Cesar?

513
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,709
Uh, he's, uh, in
the waiting room.

514
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,145
I want to see him.

515
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,615
We can't. It's too dangerous with
your immune system this compromised.

516
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:37,481
Why can't he just put on a
gown and a mask like you?

517
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:38,613
I'm sorry.

518
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,716
The more people you're exposed
to, the greater the chance of infection.

519
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,263
I'm scared.

520
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,160
I know.

521
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,328
We're doing everything that we
can. Cesar will be with you soon.

522
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,770
Dr. Foreman, you
should look at this.

523
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,072
What is it? You feeling any
pain in your pelvic region?

524
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,948
No, why? Your genitals,
they're engorged.

525
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:13,687
I drink anymore,
I'm gonna explode.

526
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:16,112
You're not gonna explode.
You're just gonna have a seizure.

527
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,162
Which will prove that your
kidneys are not working,

528
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,860
which will also prove they
weren't working Saturday night.

529
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:27,195
That's why a glancing body blow
sent your blood pressure into the toilet

530
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,331
and you onto the canvas.

531
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,375
How many bottles is
this supposed to take?

532
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,605
Six.

533
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,814
And I've drank how many? Eight.

534
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,785
It's not an exact
science. In other words,

535
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,617
nothing's gonna prove you wrong.

536
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,467
You're just gonna keep making me
miserable because you're too miserable...

537
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,959
You're an idiot.

538
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,796
And no, you're not gonna hit me.

539
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,697
Because somewhere deep in
that way too thin skull of yours,

540
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,200
you know that
you're full of crap.

541
00:33:57,302 --> 00:34:01,069
That's why you stopped jogging for
me, it's why you drank eight bottles.

542
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,092
Because even though you want to
think that I'm wrong because it's simpler,

543
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,974
you also desperately
want me to be right.

544
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,015
I'm only an ass for building
your hopes up if I'm wrong.

545
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,686
Last one.

546
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,699
You're an ass.

547
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,026
You were wrong, it's
not the end of the world...

548
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,765
Anything else you want to say?

549
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:05,964
You have a problem.

550
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:09,041
I think if you seriously
look at everything that...

551
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,743
Anything else?

552
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,040
Okay, look, this isn't...
Okay! Okay, okay.

553
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,046
No, I don't.

554
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,284
Just get out of here.
Go home, we'll talk later.

555
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,189
Someplace without
any of my stuff.

556
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,751
Nothing to talk about.
That was my point.

557
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,765
Inflammation of the genitals
means we were wrong.

558
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,400
Thanks for the
statement of the obvious.

559
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,552
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

560
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,487
Foreman wants to keep
treating for radiation poisoning.

561
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,242
Because the seizures have stopped,
because her fever's gone away,

562
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,612
because she's improved. By luck.

563
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,344
I don't think the patient cares.

564
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,895
Yes. She's gonna die in considerably
less discomfort thanks to you

565
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,115
treating a few of the symptoms
instead of the disease.

566
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,952
I paged... Shut up.

567
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,151
<i>You're drunk.</i>

568
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,462
Well, whose fault is that?

569
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,624
Give me another
scotch. I can't serve you.

570
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,200
Is it because I'm black?

571
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,705
Because I'm not,
so... Come on, buddy.

572
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,674
What? You can't get me drunk and
then give me crap for being drunk.

573
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:21,110
That's like dumping someone, and
then giving them crap for being upset.

574
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,613
It's just not decent.

575
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,186
Let me explain why
people come here.

576
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:31,889
They come here to drink.

577
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,654
Which causes us to ask,
"Why do people drink?" Mmm?

578
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,127
Is it sustenance?

579
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,158
No. Is it taste?

580
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,394
Nope. Don't be a jerk.

581
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,200
Is it the company of
stout-hearted men?

582
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,399
I don't think so.

583
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,333
Is it killing pain?

584
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:58,479
Yes. 7.5% life duller.

585
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,694
That's the business you're in.

586
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,983
You're in the
screw-the-world business.

587
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,678
You're in the reality-sucks-
and-fantasy-temporarily-

588
00:37:05,702 --> 00:37:07,388
appears-to-not-suck business.

589
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:10,519
Just get the moron a drink
so he'll shut the hell up.

590
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:14,660
No.

591
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,130
I'm giving you your
drink. Have you no pride?

592
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:23,141
Either serving me is a
good idea or it's a bad idea.

593
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:27,308
Shutting me up is a crappy reason
for compromising what you believe.

594
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,677
And not even an
effective one, apparently.

595
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:40,759
Am I gonna have to hit
him? Not a good idea.

596
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,655
But what if it's the
right thing to do?

597
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,323
Compromise is never the answer.

598
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,895
Stand up.

599
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:57,436
I will allow you to
throw the first punch.

600
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,011
Sit down. I'm not gonna hit you.

601
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,404
Just as well,
'cause I was lying.

602
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,425
You can relax.

603
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,592
She's getting better?
The bad news is,

604
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,636
because of your extended
exposure to her and her workplace,

605
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,536
we're gonna need to
treat you as well. I feel fine.

606
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,417
Unfortunately, that's the
way it can be with radiation.

607
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,467
No symptoms until it's
too late to do anything.

608
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,257
You're gonna need a
bone marrow transplant.

609
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,313
No.

610
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,692
A marrow transplant does leave
you exposed to all sorts of illnesses,

611
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,036
but there's really
no choice here.

612
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,781
She doesn't have radiation poisoning.
- She's getting better.

613
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,765
We need to start our
treatment before it's too late.

614
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,087
No.

615
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,158
You're either suicidal,
or you know we're wrong.

616
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,726
And the only way you can know
for sure what wasn't killing her

617
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:01,830
is if you knew what was.
And you do, don't you?

618
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,568
Because you've
been poisoning her.

619
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,561
And the reason she's getting better,
is because you haven't been near her.

620
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,239
Our co-workers are on their
way to your home right now

621
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:10,577
to search it for poisons.

622
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:11,826
You mind saving
them the trouble?

623
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,217
Attempted murder
is better than murder.

624
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,761
What are you doing here?

625
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,633
Training for my big
fight. Just need you to...

626
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,606
Drink five more bottles, get
punched a few more times?

627
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,267
Look, just get out and give up.

628
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,422
Nah, that's your specialty.

629
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,727
Ooh, looks like you
already lost your big fight.

630
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,647
Look, I may not be able to take
a punch, but I can still throw one.

631
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,690
Three, two...

632
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,492
What a lovely day.

633
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,798
Where's Cesar?

634
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,399
Uh...

635
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,472
In jail.

636
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,942
He was trying to kill you.

637
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,279
He found out about
you and Glenn.

638
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,345
Which, he admitted,
shouldn't have surprised him,

639
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,983
since he started seeing you
while you were dating Tony.

640
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,328
He poisoned me? Repeatedly.

641
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,955
With Spanish fly.

642
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,899
The active ingredient
cantharidin is a potent toxin

643
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,903
and can cause a lot of the
same damage as radiation.

644
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,006
He poisoned me?

645
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:22,746
I'm sorry.

646
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,714
He had a security clearance.

647
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,490
What's this?

648
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,192
A palm.

649
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,996
Hmm. Useful for many things.

650
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:45,435
Slapping, greasing, probably
some other applications, too.

651
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,734
Right now it's ready
for $50 and humiliation.

652
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,441
He was actually sick? He
wasn't knocked out by the punch,

653
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,774
he was knocked out by
the clinch before the punch.

654
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,404
He took a shot to
the back of the neck.

655
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:01,680
More specifically, to an abnormal growth
of nerves caused by a glomus tumor.

656
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,746
Kind of like a built-in taser sent a
massive shock to his entire body,

657
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:05,880
shut everything down.

658
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:12,390
Wow. Fascinating. Completely
explains exactly how he lost.

659
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:16,093
Oh, you are not gonna be like that,
because you've got a lot more posters here.

660
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,568
No. I'm not. Well done, House.

661
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,265
You might have saved that
guy. Given him his life back.

662
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,605
No, no. He needs surgery.
He's never gonna fight again.

663
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,042
What happened to
your eye? You okay?

664
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,416
Better than okay.
