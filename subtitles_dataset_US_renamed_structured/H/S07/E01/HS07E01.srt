1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,134
Damn it. I waited too long.

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,671
Please, come on, do something.

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,206
Come on, do
something! Do something!

4
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,434
Couldn't have saved her.

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,379
It's your choice if you
want to go back on drugs.

6
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:19,852
You think I can fix myself?

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,652
I just need to know
if you and I can work.

8
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,205
Let me see.

9
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,621
It's okay.

10
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,022
It's gonna get infected.

11
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,962
Hey, you're not gonna...

12
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,630
You are.

13
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:27,940
Don't... Don't...

14
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,039
It's okay.

15
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,941
I love you.

16
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,139
So now what?

17
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,416
Everything's good. We
don't have to talk through it all.

18
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,380
No, I meant it literally.

19
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,548
Now what?

20
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,487
I can make breakfast,
we could go bowling...

21
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,862
We can stay here.

22
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,664
I have to go home,
get dressed. Go to work.

23
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,772
So that's it?

24
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,851
I'm hoping this is
the beginning of "it."

25
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,850
Yeah.

26
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,385
Mmm.

27
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,328
Your assistant's new.

28
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,098
It's a 50-50 chance he just
can't find the light switch.

29
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,331
Hello?

30
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,309
Dr. Cuddy?

31
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,242
No, this is Dr. Cuddy's nanny.

32
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,941
She's feeling a little
under the weather now,

33
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,294
so she won't be coming in today.

34
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,948
Oh, I hope she's all right.

35
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,257
Would you mind asking her if...

36
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,879
No, can't do that, I'm afraid.
She's locked in the bathroom.

37
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,355
Terrible bug going around.
What's the problem?

38
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,519
Well, I'm sorry to disturb
her, but it's Dr. Richardson.

39
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,755
He must have the
same stomach flu.

40
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,575
He threw up in the OR, and I'm not
sure how she'd want me to handle...

41
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,363
Hold on a second.

42
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,048
I've talked to Dr. Cuddy, and she
would like you to do three things.

43
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:15,508
One, send him home, two, sterilize
the OR, three, use your own brain.

44
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,609
See ya.

45
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,883
It was about puke.
That's what's so important.

46
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,246
Puke.

47
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,289
Well, I guess I don't
have to rush back in.

48
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:36,287
But whatever "now
what" we do decide on,

49
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,662
it comes after you take a bath.

50
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,198
Here's one.

51
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,206
Twenty-five-year-old man with
numbness and tingling in his legs

52
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,538
and a speech disorder, three...

53
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,770
Anybody see House?

54
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:54,372
It's 10:00 a.m. I'd be worried if he
was here. Twenty-five-year-old...

55
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,440
He was in pretty bad shape
yesterday, after his patient died.

56
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,076
House has lost patients before.

57
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,087
We all have. He's a big boy.

58
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,187
You didn't see him.

59
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,934
Best thing we can do for him now
is find him a new puzzle to solve.

60
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,927
Thus bringing us back
to my 25-year-old...

61
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,691
Yet you're the only person here
without a potential case in front of you.

62
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,929
I haven't found the right one yet.
- Oh.

63
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,833
I thought maybe it was because
you were asking for a leave of absence

64
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,030
and wouldn't have time
to see a case through.

65
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,698
- I didn't say anything.
- He didn't.

66
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,018
I saw an envelope on House's
desk with your name on it,

67
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,171
so naturally I steamed it open.

68
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,239
What's wrong with you? You
steam an envelope to keep it secret.

69
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,045
Which is why I just ripped it.

70
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,281
You gonna tell us
where you're going?

71
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,954
It sure sounds like a "no."

72
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,728
There's glass everywhere.

73
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,731
Couldn't you have just put the
mirror down nice and gentle?

74
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,635
I was in a mood.

75
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,844
I'll be right back.

76
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,045
Don't get that.

77
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,311
It could be important.

78
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,417
This is important.

79
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,166
Right now, we are more important

80
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,159
than what's going
on at the hospital.

81
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,389
So, I say we turn off our phones

82
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,762
and give the morning to us.

83
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,598
Okay. I'll go turn it off.

84
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,134
Thank you.

85
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,211
You're distracted.

86
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,285
I'm not.

87
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,219
You are. You turned
off your phone,

88
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,452
but you're still wondering,
"What could it have been?

89
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,120
"What emergency will bring
down the entire hospital,

90
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,872
""cause I decided to
take the morning off."

91
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,330
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,668
The clinic is facing reduced
funding from the state,

93
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,797
Nurse Jeffrey is filing
his 12th HR complaint,

94
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,569
and Richardson's
threatening to quit,

95
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,110
because he's basically
been a prisoner at the hospital

96
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,339
for almost a week.

97
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,075
Richardson? The neurosurgeon.

98
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,325
He's the only one
I have right now,

99
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:12,114
which means he has to stay
on the premises at all times

100
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,711
or else the hospital technically
isn't a level-one trauma center.

101
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:16,789
Which means?

102
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,290
I'd have to shut down the ER,

103
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,835
transfer all the
patients out of the ICU...

104
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,886
Okay, stop. Turn around.

105
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:23,962
Why?

106
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,396
Because you need to relax.

107
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,733
Where are we going?

108
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,102
I am going to make
you a magical bath.

109
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:40,042
It'll have bubbles
and Eastern spices,

110
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:44,448
and blue diamonds, green
clovers, transformative powers.

111
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,383
But I must have solitude to
focus my creative energies.

112
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,205
Hello?

113
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,797
Interesting factoid.

114
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,919
Did you know that if we
don't have a neurosurgeon

115
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,275
on the premises,

116
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,473
all the puppies in the world will
choke to death on all the babies?

117
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,983
Yeah. You got a
note from Thirteen...

118
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,114
So how come we don't
have, like, five neurosurgeons?

119
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,919
<i>Well, we had three,
but Kapur retired,</i>

120
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,289
and then Nichols just took
off for his daughter's wedding.

121
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,520
I got good news.

122
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:31,429
For the next 16 hours, you
are the new neurosurgeon.

123
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,827
I'm not a neurosurgeon.

124
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,270
Which would matter if you actually
had to do some neurosurgery.

125
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,395
<i>House, it's a hospital.</i>

126
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,783
<i>The odds of having
to do neurosurgery</i>

127
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,241
are higher than in most places.

128
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,502
If an EMT calls in with
a brain or spinal trauma,

129
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,478
just divert him to
the nearest hospital.

130
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,148
All you got to do is stand
around and keep the ER open.

131
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,331
This is an administrative
problem, not a medical one.

132
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,287
House, where the hell are you?

133
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,683
Great. Glad you're on it.

134
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,361
All systems go!

135
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,499
Why are you going to Rome?

136
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,973
I found the flight
information in your locker.

137
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,668
I love how everyone thinks
it's so quaint and childlike of me

138
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,643
to expect a modicum
of privacy around here.

139
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,202
Your flight's tomorrow.
What's so urgent in Rome?

140
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,885
I hear they wanna tear down the
Colosseum to build a karaoke bar.

141
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,781
The Buona Speranza Medical Center
in Rome is doing a Huntington's trial.

142
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,220
Seriously, I live to sing.

143
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,815
I know that they've been doing
fetal neural transplantation.

144
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,166
I also know that their subjects

145
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,527
have increased risk of
intracranial hemorrhage.

146
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,497
This isn't the time
to join their trial.

147
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,397
This research is in its infancy.

148
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,627
So is your condition.

149
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,601
You read my note, you
go through my locker,

150
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,249
and then you decide
you wanna round it off

151
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,105
by lecturing me
on my life choices?

152
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,303
I'm worried about you.

153
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,740
Oh, well, that makes
it all right, then.

154
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,759
So what exactly is this?

155
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,064
It's soapy, open and
casual, and fun if you want.

156
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:15,901
Open?

157
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,229
You think I want to
see other people?

158
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,002
Well, last night was
emotional for you.

159
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,442
We both lost that patient,
we watched people die.

160
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,175
I came back here, and
I went for the Vicodin,

161
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,615
and you dumped your
fiancé, and you came here.

162
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,346
Which I don't regret.

163
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,307
I'm not saying you do. I'm just
saying it was an impulsive move.

164
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,550
Don't do this.

165
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,005
Why do you have to
analyze things to death?

166
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,124
Why can't you
just let it be nice?

167
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,535
You're right. That was
very anti-secret-bath.

168
00:12:58,978 --> 00:12:59,978
House?

169
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,046
Yeah?

170
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:06,551
The secret bath is
burning my lady parts.

171
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,656
How do you think my anus feels?

172
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,555
Burning means it's working.

173
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,396
Can we get out now?

174
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,659
I was so waiting
for you to say that.

175
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,770
Could I speak to Dr. Jankowski?

176
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,035
No. I don't need to
disturb him in Bermuda.

177
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,236
Everything okay?

178
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,007
Dr. Cuddy's phone keeps
going directly to voice mail,

179
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,049
and I need to get a neurosurgeon

180
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,913
to replace
Dr. Richardson for the day

181
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,104
or else she's screwed and...

182
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,643
I'm a neurosurgeon.

183
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,022
No, you're not.

184
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,601
I've cut into people's
heads more often than...

185
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,903
You did a residency in neurosurgery
at the University of Melbourne

186
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,271
but you were never
board-certified.

187
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,820
You've worked
here two days, how...

188
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,126
Dr. Cuddy's first assignment

189
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,463
was for me to get to know
everything about Dr. House's team.

190
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,970
And not to believe
anything any of them told me.

191
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,435
I am not a neurosurgeon.

192
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,247
And <i>voilà!</i> The first course.

193
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:12,149
I have flaked some
tender young ears of corn

194
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:17,623
with a side of assorted exotic
breakfast meats in a chili sauce reduction.

195
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,925
And the second course?

196
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,894
A single grape. To
cleanse the palate.

197
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,090
Which is kind of a waste,
'cause there's no third course.

198
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,898
I'm glad we stayed in.

199
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,961
This is actually pretty good.

200
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,736
I can always tell when you lie.

201
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,339
I mean, always.

202
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,240
I slept with my
freshman roommate.

203
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,112
A lie. A truth.

204
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,947
You have a tell. What is it?

205
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,453
First admit that you were lying.

206
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,546
Fine. I was lying.

207
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,649
My sexual history is
boring and predictable.

208
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,728
What is my tell?
Are you kidding?

209
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,787
If I tell you your tell, you'll get
rid of it, and I won't be able to tell.

210
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,908
Well, then you have
to tell me something

211
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,110
I don't already know about you.

212
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,045
Even though technically
you didn't tell me something

213
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,662
that I didn't already
know about you.

214
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,536
Quit being so damn
logical and just tell me.

215
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:13,675
I used to have an intimate
relationship with a photograph of you.

216
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,342
Well, actually, a sock
and a photograph.

217
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,680
I know.

218
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,111
I was lying.

219
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,553
The photo you took of me as
Sleeping Beauty on Halloween.

220
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,023
Why else would
you take that picture?

221
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,161
I have to pee.

222
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,832
Ha! You can't tell, 'cause
I actually have to poo.

223
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,332
What?

224
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,675
Cuddy's assistant decided
to "use his own brain."

225
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,977
<i>Who put that idiot
idea into his head?</i>

226
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,709
Perhaps you could
follow the same advice.

227
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,311
He notified DPH that there's no
neurosurgeon on the premises.

228
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,221
Said he legally had to.
Which he legally had to.

229
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,303
Sounds like you got the
situation under control.

230
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,793
No, I don't. You know I don't.

231
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,262
When DPH shows up, they're
gonna shut down our ER.

232
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,492
<i>This can't be fixed.
It is what it is, House.</i>

233
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,626
Great. I've got every faith in
your ability to solve the problem.

234
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,242
I have called every neurosurgeon

235
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,336
within a 45-mile
radius. Nothing.

236
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,756
Do you think House
is just testing us?

237
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,078
He's always testing us.

238
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,615
Test or not, it's a problem.

239
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,517
It's not our problem. Why
the hell is it House's problem?

240
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,985
Where the hell is Cuddy?

241
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,155
We either report this and half
the hospital gets shut down,

242
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,089
or we cover it up
and run the risk

243
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,923
that the entire hospital
gets shut down.

244
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,824
Or we get Richardson.

245
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:37,896
He's sick.

246
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,365
And we're doctors.
We get people better.

247
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,797
Fing, fong, fooey?

248
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,075
Can I open them yet?

249
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,441
Just a second.

250
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,807
Okay. Hold out your hand.

251
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,544
Oh!

252
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,617
I've always wanted to open a bottle
of champagne with one of these things.

253
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,560
You might want to
stand behind me for this.

254
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:12,963
Okay.

255
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,191
Oh!

256
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,235
Yeah.

257
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:23,176
Mmm, I think I might
have got that slightly wrong.

258
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,402
Well, good thing I got a case.

259
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,008
House! Open up. We need to talk.

260
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,356
We should just let him in. No.

261
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,583
House!

262
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,064
If we just ignore
him, he'll go away.

263
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,489
House!

264
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,693
I think he finally left.

265
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:56,601
But just in case he hasn't, what can
we do that does not involve talking?

266
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,443
You turned on my ringer?

267
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,455
I know you're in there. I can
hear your cell phone ringing.

268
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,782
Just let him in.

269
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:11,915
No.

270
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,357
He's like a stray.
He'll eat everything,

271
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,398
shed all over the place
and crap on the floor.

272
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,959
Hi, this is Gregory House.

273
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,435
I can't take your call at the
moment, please leave a message.

274
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:30,267
If this is Wilson, I'm fine,
not suicidal, not on drugs,

275
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,254
coping very well with
the loss of my last patient,

276
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,975
so feel free to go about
your day without worry.

277
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,379
Beep!

278
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,520
House, you can't just
not show up to work.

279
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,722
What's Cuddy gonna say?

280
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,156
If this is still Wilson,
she gave me the day off.

281
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,817
And tomorrow.

282
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:52,729
Okay, maybe not tomorrow,
but today. I'm fine. Now go away.

283
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,566
Beep!

284
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,274
If you're not in
tomorrow, I'll be back.

285
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,054
Look, you're the only
neurosurgeon we've got.

286
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,488
You have to suck it up
and go back to the hospital.

287
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,424
We're not asking you to
operate. Just to be there.

288
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:24,827
Unless you can transport this toilet
with me, I'm not leaving the room.

289
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,057
I'll get a bucket.

290
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,125
You're missing the point. I ate
bad sushi, I'm sick. Go away.

291
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,566
We can give you
promethazine for the nausea.

292
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,437
Already took it. And
trimethobenzamide.

293
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:38,745
Maybe this isn't food poisoning.

294
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,324
Whatever it is, it must have
damaged the lining of his stomach.

295
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,246
Till that heals,
nothing's gonna work.

296
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,427
So we need to treat
both that and the nausea.

297
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,784
And whatever's wrong with him.

298
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,516
We give him ondansetron
and prostaglandins.

299
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,789
And whatever's wrong with him.

300
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,817
Neither of those will treat any
possible underlying condition.

301
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,226
Who cares? He's not
our patient, the hospital is.

302
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,127
I can hear you.

303
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,707
You're pretty
miserable, aren't you?

304
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,543
Would you be willing to take a fairly
risky drug if it would make it all go away?

305
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,519
Why didn't you let him in?

306
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,001
You were thinking about
Wilson while we were having sex?

307
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,197
That's so cool, so was I.

308
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,405
You were hiding me from him.

309
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,872
Why?

310
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:49,475
I wasn't hiding you. I was
protecting your privacy.

311
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:56,482
I wasn't sure if you were ready to
go public with the whole "us" thing yet.

312
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,987
Why would I be doing all
this if I wanted to be private?

313
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,332
I never even asked.

314
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,439
Maybe you're not ready yet.

315
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:27,485
You read the list of side
effects on those drugs?

316
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:28,885
We could crash his BP.

317
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,118
I haven't heard a thump, so I
assume he's still quietly puking.

318
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,059
We could be making him worse.

319
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,823
Bigger picture, we're
making the hospital better.

320
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,955
We can test for whatever
you wanna test him for

321
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,071
once he's stable enough
to get back to the hospital.

322
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,500
Now stop being a girl and move.

323
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,865
So, you gonna ask me
about this Huntington's trial?

324
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,499
And by "ask," I mean,
"Give me your opinion."

325
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:50,837
No.

326
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,939
There is one thing, though.

327
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:55,976
Will you have sex with me?

328
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,417
What?

329
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,919
Well, this trial means
you're leaving right away.

330
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,116
I was playing a long game.
Deadlines have been moved up.

331
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:13,059
Wow. That stuff is good.

332
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,876
Think you can make
it back to the hospital?

333
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,959
Uh-huh.

334
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,661
That lamp is shiny.

335
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,333
I mean, the way it shines is

336
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,308
shiny.

337
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,777
I take it this is one of the
side effects of the drugs.

338
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,745
Who cares? Let's go.

339
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,954
What are you doing?

340
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:42,562
You think I'm afraid to go
public? I want to prove you wrong.

341
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,096
With a tripod?

342
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:45,426
With a sex tape.

343
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,725
We'll send it to
Wilson. It's a win-win.

344
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,134
We get to do it again, and he
might actually learn something.

345
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
It sounds like someone's
trying to break in.

346
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:03,014
It's probably
nothing. Stay here.

347
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,285
Hey. Stuck?

348
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,065
Bummer. Looks painful.

349
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,432
Chamomile or English Breakfast?

350
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,233
Would you stop being an
ass and pull me out of here?

351
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,375
You didn't get my
message earlier?

352
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:37,007
Yeah, but someone once
told me everybody lies.

353
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,848
I'm fine. Just staying
home, chillaxing.

354
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:44,287
Your patient died, you ignore my
calls, and you won't open the door.

355
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,449
I don't think you're fine.

356
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,254
I think you might be throwing
away a drug-free year.

357
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,091
Or I'm ignoring you
for a different reason.

358
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,994
Sex with my girlfriend.

359
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,060
Hmm.

360
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,637
Will you please
just... Please let me in.

361
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:15,877
Thank you.

362
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,887
And since when did you start
referring to hookers as girlfriends?

363
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,017
She's not a hooker.

364
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:26,297
What... Really?

365
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,695
Begins with "C,"
ends with "Uddy."

366
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,938
How many Vicodin have you taken?

367
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,006
I'm serious.

368
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,733
Cuddy and I are now Cuddy
and I. There's an "I" in "Cuddy."

369
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:43,949
House, it's okay. Almost all
addicts relapse a few times.

370
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,917
She's in my bedroom.

371
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,051
You're hallucinating, House.

372
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,024
Honeybuns, we got company!

373
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,610
Pupils are normal,
pulse is normal.

374
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:16,214
Better than that, they're
both totally awesome.

375
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,874
I'm not on drugs.

376
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,452
So, why did you lie about Cuddy?

377
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,384
To make a point.

378
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:27,654
Probably something to do with
shutting you up. That's my go-to idea.

379
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,326
You do seem okay.

380
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,183
You want me to stick around?

381
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,789
I could do my usual
thing of pretending

382
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,459
I like watching
monster truck rallies,

383
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,711
if that would make
you feel better.

384
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,328
No, you go.

385
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,168
House, you could have died.

386
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,835
You had a patient who did die, in
your arms. You shouldn't be alone.

387
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,380
I know. That's why
I called a hooker.

388
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,276
Now go away, you'll be extra.

389
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,881
Are you really okay?

390
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,753
Are you gonna break in again?

391
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,827
You checked my pulse,
you checked my pupils,

392
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,954
I'll mail you the urine sample.

393
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,842
How come I've never
even met you guys?

394
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,383
You're like the greatest guys.

395
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,579
You know fluorescent lights flicker at
the same frequency as the human brain?

396
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,497
You know the human
brain doesn't flicker?

397
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,099
It doesn't take a brain
surgeon to figure out

398
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,422
that he can't
perform brain surgery.

399
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,486
What's wrong with him?

400
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,393
High blood sugar.

401
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,559
He'll be fine as soon
as we rehydrate him.

402
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,631
That's a relief.

403
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,396
Thank God. All right, the DPH
guy will be here in 20 minutes.

404
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,706
What is wrong with him?

405
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,039
High blood sugar.
You just said so.

406
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,369
Chase is running labs.

407
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,381
Right now, the top two contenders
are hepatitis and peptic ulcer disease.

408
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,317
So, is today really
your last day?

409
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,648
Flying out tomorrow.

410
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:05,021
How long a leave are you taking?

411
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,050
Depends. On the
drug trial. Sounds risky.

412
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,120
Yada yada, you don't think I
should do it. Message heard.

413
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,687
No, I approve.

414
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,526
Living fast and
dying young is crap.

415
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:19,697
If you have a chance to
get better, I say good for you.

416
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,370
I brought Wilson in here
specifically to go public.

417
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:26,776
Just like you requested.

418
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:32,211
I pressured you. Wilson coming
through the window pressured you.

419
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,444
If you're forced into
this, it's not gonna work.

420
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,751
Do you have any
response to that?

421
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,431
Game on.

422
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,126
Is he better?

423
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,330
Yep.

424
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,581
You're lying to me
again, aren't you?

425
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,605
Yep.

426
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,938
Then we're screwed.
Don't we have to tell...

427
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,707
Oh. Damn. Dr. Richardson's
prepping for surgery.

428
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,906
Yeah, I need to talk to him.

429
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,074
He's prepping for surgery.

430
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,149
So you said.

431
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,747
I just need to confirm
he is who you say he is,

432
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,845
and that he's a
licensed neurosurgeon.

433
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,049
Well, here's his paperwork.

434
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:14,651
His hospital ID is right
there. You can see it's him.

435
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,527
Yeah, I should
still talk to him.

436
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,706
They've already scrubbed,
he'd have to be re-sterilized,

437
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,495
the patient's anesthesia
would have to be adjusted.

438
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,326
Why did you report
he wasn't here?

439
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,168
I must have misunderstood.

440
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,716
Why is it so hot in there?

441
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,289
La de da.

442
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,289
Woodstock, baby.

443
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,492
Is he stoned?

444
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,558
No, we're pretty
sure he's got...

445
00:28:56,635 --> 00:29:00,128
Oh, I'm sure you have an
explanation, but I don't care.

446
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,037
See, you need to have
a doctor on the premises

447
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,507
who can actually
do neurosurgery.

448
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,772
Tell the attending to
divert all ambulances away.

449
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,178
And start calling
other hospitals

450
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,877
to see who can take your
stabilized ICU patients.

451
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,885
Those departments
are shutting down.

452
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,882
"Design" for
five points. Got it.

453
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,084
"Hear."

454
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,524
Got it. Both versions.

455
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,526
"Love."

456
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,588
You didn't see "love"?

457
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:30,462
Wow. I didn't think you'd take my
lack of board game skills so personally.

458
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,263
Why didn't you tell
me you loved me?

459
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:39,508
Didn't a wise woman once say,
and by once I mean, two hours ago,

460
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,546
"Why do you have to
analyze everything to death?

461
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,275
"Why can't this just be nice?"

462
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,284
I told you I loved you. You
didn't tell me you loved me back.

463
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,378
You don't think that should
give me cause for concern?

464
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:52,048
No. Because words don't
matter. Actions matter.

465
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,886
You're really gonna
take a stand here?

466
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,224
You can't say it? No.

467
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,363
Why?

468
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:02,959
Because I forgot to grab a "V."

469
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,307
"Lobe" gets you one point.

470
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,140
One.

471
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,866
Labs show he's
negative for everything.

472
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,958
I'm guessing at least
one of them is wrong.

473
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,503
Who cares? The ER and
the ICU are half empty,

474
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,664
the place is crawling
with suits, it's over.

475
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,732
You do know we still have
a sick patient here, right?

476
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:47,109
He's the guy sitting right behind
you taking off his clothes again.

477
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,844
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

478
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,778
Why don't you just sit
down and take it easy?

479
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,128
He should be coming down by now.

480
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,485
And yet I'm not.

481
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:01,587
What if his behavior isn't a
side effect of the ondansetron?

482
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:02,793
What if it's a symptom?

483
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,861
Thank you.

484
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,693
What causes delirium and nausea?

485
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,608
He's been stuck here in
the hospital a few days.

486
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,067
Nobody else is sick, so it
can't be environmental...

487
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,967
Not exactly stuck. I snuck out.

488
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,636
Freedom is my birthright.

489
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,168
Where did you go?

490
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,042
The seafood festival
at the convention center.

491
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,388
We're screwed.
The seafood festival

492
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:21,789
has stuff from all
around the world,

493
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,475
in combinations
nobody ever thought of.

494
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,744
We could be here all year.

495
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,582
You had shrimp? And crab?
Lobster? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

496
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,481
And?

497
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,114
I ate whatever looked good.

498
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,024
Did you eat any
roe? Little tiny eggs?

499
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,095
Nummy.

500
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:41,395
Toad eggs will cause nausea,
and they can get you high.

501
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,001
If I'm right, the
antidote is fast-acting.

502
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,080
If we can get him to keep
his clothes on long enough,

503
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,165
he can pass as a
functioning neurosurgeon.

504
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,205
Um...

505
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,349
France. And not
Paris or the Riviera.

506
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,115
But there's this place in
Normandy. It's on a tidal island.

507
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,156
Everyone who's not staying in
one of the small inns has to leave

508
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,316
before the tide comes in.

509
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:10,221
You have this 900-year-old
fortress all to yourself.

510
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,064
It's called...

511
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,132
Mont-Saint-Michel.

512
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,532
That's it. Have you
been there? Nope.

513
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,799
But I got a pretty good
idea what it looks like.

514
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,003
How did you know?

515
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,154
You used to have a picture
of it as a screensaver.

516
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,874
And that was years ago.

517
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,608
I guess it's a memorable place.

518
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,810
Now unfortunately, we
can't fly straight to Normandy,

519
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,444
but the layover in London
is only a couple hours.

520
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,564
What are you talking about?

521
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,588
It's all there.

522
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,215
All you got to do
is click "confirm,"

523
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,691
and we'll be eating croissants

524
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,194
and being insulted by stinky
people this time tomorrow.

525
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,659
Don't worry. I used
Wilson's credit card.

526
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:48,961
I can't.

527
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:50,034
I'm kidding.

528
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,702
I used your credit card.

529
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,538
House...

530
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,598
The hospital does
not need your body.

531
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,405
I do. So does my daughter.

532
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:02,209
Well, she can come, too. Or to
Grandmother's house she can go.

533
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,241
This is crazy.

534
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,647
So, you can break
off your engagement,

535
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,248
but you won't
adjust your schedule.

536
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,354
I can't.

537
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:21,823
Not tomorrow.

538
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,859
But two weekends from now.

539
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,333
If Rachel's gonna
stay with my mom,

540
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,068
I'm gonna need a
little bit of prep time.

541
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:33,635
Okay.

542
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,796
What if it doesn't work?

543
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,118
What if I stay this way forever?

544
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,450
The antidote works quickly.

545
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,834
If we're right, you should be
back to your old self in no time.

546
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,453
My old self was boring.
Can't we keep the new self?

547
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,088
Just lay down and
stop unbuttoning.

548
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:59,002
I'm sorry that I read your
note and looked in your locker.

549
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,971
You get used to that
kind of thing around here.

550
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,806
Do you have anyone
going with you to Rome?

551
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,086
Is that your
passive-aggressive way

552
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,874
of asking me if I'm
seeing somebody else?

553
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,745
I hope you are. I mean, I hope
you have someone with you.

554
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:15,547
If I'm scared about this, I can't
imagine how you must feel.

555
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,145
You shouldn't be alone.

556
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:21,148
If you want, I could
fly over for a few days.

557
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:22,992
Friends.

558
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,724
I appreciate that,
but I think I'll be okay.

559
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,135
I guess we took the long way
round to being friends, huh?

560
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,609
I guess we all did.

561
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,482
Thank you for everything.

562
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,381
You're welcome for everything.

563
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,516
I'll see you tomorrow.

564
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,228
I really do have to leave.

565
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,762
I know.

566
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,744
Then what's the problem?

567
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,540
This isn't gonna work.

568
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:30,620
That's it? You can't
just say that and shut up.

569
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:35,030
It's a statement of fact. It's
not a debatable proposition.

570
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:39,534
Right. Because you
can see the future?

571
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,131
No. But I can see the past.

572
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,075
And you're gonna remember
all the horrible things I've done.

573
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,912
And you'll try to convince
yourself that I've changed,

574
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,993
but then I'm gonna start doing
those horrible things again

575
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:54,145
because I haven't changed.

576
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,419
Then you'll realize that

577
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,424
I am an insane choice
for someone who has a kid.

578
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,354
And from there,
it's a short step

579
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:09,993
to the inevitable
conclusion that all of this

580
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,938
was a mistake.

581
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,373
Tell me any of that isn't true.

582
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,986
Mercy doesn't have enough room in
their ICU to handle the overflow, so...

583
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,167
Don't worry about it.

584
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,559
I believe you wanted to talk to
Dr. Richardson, our neurosurgeon.

585
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:39,291
I'm sorry that we met under
such trying circumstances.

586
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,992
I hope you'll restore our rating
as a level-one trauma center

587
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,093
and re-open the ER
and the ICU immediately.

588
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,932
An accidental case of poisoning.

589
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,064
Dr. Richardson has been treated
and is ready to resume work.

590
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,074
Touch your nose
with your index finger

591
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:56,205
and tell me how you'd
treat a cerebral contusion.

592
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:01,148
I would watch for edema
and transtentorial herniation.

593
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:05,749
Good enough. Turn it around.

594
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:11,490
You're gonna be up late.
Next time, avoid responsibility.

595
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,095
Cake?

596
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,101
Taub thought we should have a
little party to see you off properly.

597
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:18,830
He gets sentimental
about these things.

598
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,304
I never should have flashed him.

599
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:25,104
Speaking of which, earlier
today I asked you about

600
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:27,869
having sex.

601
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:31,439
You gave me a look that almost
certainly could only mean no.

602
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,580
However, on the other hand,

603
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:36,678
I'd be remiss if I didn't
follow up and confirm.

604
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,355
See? That's the same look.

605
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,519
So if it didn't mean
"no" the first time, then...

606
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,792
No. No, no, no.

607
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,833
No pressure.

608
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,025
Does that method ever work?

609
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:53,096
At least once.

610
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,310
I'm getting mixed signals.

611
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:07,149
I'll see you at the cake.

612
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,754
The only time you're
afraid is when you're happy.

613
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,221
You just don't
expect it to last.

614
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,388
Because it doesn't.

615
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,829
You don't know that.

616
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,227
I've done horrible
things to you.

617
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,671
I will do horrible things again.

618
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,002
To you.

619
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:35,537
But because of one stupid moment
with a dying girl in a pile of rubble,

620
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,642
you think I can change.

621
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,378
Tell me where I'm wrong.

622
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,122
I don't want you to change.

623
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:53,027
I know you're screwed up.

624
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:56,158
I know you are always
gonna be screwed up.

625
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:59,534
But you're the most
incredible man I've ever known.

626
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:09,578
And you are always gonna be the
most incredible man I have ever known.

627
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,515
So unless you're
breaking up with me,

628
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:17,313
I am going home now.

629
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,201
I love you.

630
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,782
Where's Thirteen?

631
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,652
I don't think she's coming.

632
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,852
What's going on?

633
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,288
She's not going to Rome.

634
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,641
You mean she changed her mind...

635
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,665
I called the hospital in Rome to see
when she was scheduled for surgery.

636
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,223
Why would you...
It doesn't matter.

637
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,359
The point is she's
not even in the trial.

638
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,269
Never heard of her.

639
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,741
She's been lying to us all day.

640
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,343
Well, have you tried...

641
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,131
Both her phone lines
have been disconnected.

642
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,611
She's just gone.

643
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,218
It's gonna be great.

644
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,689
Yeah.
