1
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,890
Are we almost done here?

2
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,889
I have to call my mother, get
my daughter, call the hospital.

3
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,626
So he didn't threaten you?

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,332
No.

5
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,461
No fight? Not really.

6
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,063
Sounds like a yes.

7
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,177
Was there any indication
that something would happen?

8
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,472
Yeah.

9
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,005
Every moment
I've spent with him.

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,978
I was always waiting
for something to happen.

11
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,253
But this?

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,422
And no idea where he is?

13
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:58,584
No.

14
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,224
These domestic situations, it's
not uncommon to get cold feet.

15
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,765
You're asking me
to file charges?

16
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,998
Just give me the paperwork.

17
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:16,067
If Greg House steps
foot in my hospital again,

18
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,338
comes anywhere near me,

19
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,074
I want him thrown in jail.

20
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,872
<i>So, we can use any of these?</i>

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,111
<i>Yeah.</i>

22
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,680
<i>And just do whatever
we want to her?</i>

23
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,955
<i>That's what they're there for.</i>

24
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,596
Hey! We're just
getting to the good part.

25
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,631
Is there a good part?
It's performance art.

26
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,758
That's Afsoun
Hamidi. She's a genius.

27
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,200
She just won the
MacArthur, legally proving it.

28
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,571
Just had a retrospective
at the Tate Modern.

29
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,802
Nobody reads <i>The New Yorker?</i>

30
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,104
No, but I subscribed
to her patient file.

31
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,222
House, you should relax.
You had surgery this morning.

32
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,044
Minor surgery, removing a drain.

33
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,981
Put there during major surgery.

34
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,712
My doctor says it's okay as long
as I don't leave my hospital bed.

35
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,948
Which doctor was
that, Seuss or J?

36
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,622
Nurse!

37
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,010
Dr. Hourani wrote
it in his chart.

38
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,799
I'm surprised he approved it.

39
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,801
I'm more surprised
you actually asked.

40
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,331
I do things like that now.

41
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,069
I'm making some changes.

42
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,571
Like skipping
ahead to minute 37.

43
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:04,944
What is that, paint thinner?

44
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,566
I'm not gonna watch a
woman get set on fire.

45
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,067
Philistine.

46
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,052
Who's the guy with the notebook
who can't decide what to do?

47
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:32,012
Her assistant. He's been
instructed not to intervene.

48
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,971
Spoiler alert, he does.

49
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,983
For her, it is, literally,
heartbreaking.

50
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,185
Let the games begin.

51
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,625
Arrhythmia, high hematocrit

52
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,686
and inconsistent RR variability.

53
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,265
You forgot about the fourth
symptom, "being completely crazy."

54
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,198
One man's crazy is
another woman's art.

55
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,362
Her work explores things like
gender politics and self-image.

56
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,270
And the pressing issue of
shaving your entire body in public

57
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,808
while wearing a monkey mask.

58
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,503
She saw her mom commit suicide

59
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,704
and was abused by
her stepdad for years.

60
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,190
Didn't say the crazy
wasn't motivated.

61
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,445
Well, she took that pain
and transformed it into art.

62
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,280
That's better than a
lot of the alternatives.

63
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,375
I still vote for nuts.

64
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,546
We should run a resting
state functional MRI

65
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,714
to look for increased
activity in the dorsal nexus.

66
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:17,847
She's not nuts.

67
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,936
The monkey mask shaving
medium really speaks to you?

68
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,896
What speaks to me is she's
elevated being full of crap

69
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,727
to a genuine art form.

70
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,667
And made a fortune doing it.

71
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,226
People who pay 20 grand
for one of her video stills,

72
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,464
on the other hand,

73
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,530
really do need their
dorsal nexi checked.

74
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,132
Maybe the paint thinner
set off an allergic reaction.

75
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,336
Not without bronchospasm.

76
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,869
There was a space heater
next to her in the gallery.

77
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,675
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,813
It fits.

79
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,323
Put her in a hyperbaric chamber.

80
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,268
Lisa?

81
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,305
You're Lisa Cuddy.

82
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,873
What's this about?

83
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,158
I'm sorry. I'm Jerry Barrett.

84
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,378
I recognized you
from the photos.

85
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,385
They barely do you justice.

86
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,818
The usual.

87
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,998
I'm friends with your sister.

88
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,183
She showed me your photos.

89
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,850
I work at the bank
across the street.

90
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,657
Julia's my client. She
wanted to set us up.

91
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,794
I'm afraid you have me
mixed up with somebody else.

92
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:38,464
No, I don't think so. I've seen
many pictures of you, several times.

93
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,164
That didn't sound the way I...

94
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,761
I guess I just have
one of those faces.

95
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,539
Nice to meet you.

96
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:50,245
Yeah. Say hi to Lisa Cuddy when
you meet her in the office you share.

97
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,686
Oh, thank God!

98
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,986
The ICU isn't being attacked
by giant radioactive spiders.

99
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,721
Did I text you that? That was
meant for my dream journal.

100
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,554
I wanted to return your stuff.

101
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,995
Don't worry, I didn't go AWOL.

102
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,557
I had my wife-maid
bring it over.

103
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,270
My sweater, a coffee mug,

104
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:16,409
half used bottle of lotion
and a DVD of <i>Marley & Me.</i>

105
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,909
Given your thing
for Owen Wilson,

106
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,922
I thought you might want
those last two back ASAP.

107
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,746
I don't get it. You
masturbate to Owen Wilson.

108
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,044
I meant the box.

109
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,375
Oh.

110
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,583
It's a symbolic gesture.

111
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,583
I want things to go back to the way
they were before we started dating.

112
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,094
No more bad feelings,
no more issues. Just work.

113
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,162
Thanks for coming.

114
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,145
I haven't even spoken to
you since you hurt yourself.

115
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,432
I was self-destructive.

116
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,438
It won't happen again.

117
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,337
I'm making changes. I'm
gonna stop doing stupid things.

118
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,840
Great.

119
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:58,378
The smart thing to do would
be to talk about why you did it.

120
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,680
If you don't understand...

121
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,722
I think I can avoid putting
another hole in my leg

122
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,068
without talking about my mother.

123
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,151
I don't wanna find
out you're wrong

124
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,889
by getting another phone call
from you in a bloody bathtub.

125
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:12,626
I'm a big believer that the
best way to get past the past

126
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,962
is to shoot it in the head,

127
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,696
bury it in a deep pit
and pour lye on it.

128
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,762
I'm just asking
you to talk about it.

129
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:19,931
You owe me.

130
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,107
Forget about saving your life,

131
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,269
you exposed my daughter to
that obnoxious pirate cartoon.

132
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,547
Bring me lunch tomorrow
and we can plumb my depths.

133
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:59,010
I should have known the
gallery wasn't ventilated enough.

134
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,171
Hey, if it wasn't for you,

135
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,166
we'd be treating her for
third-degree burns, too.

136
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,409
That was a mistake.

137
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,174
He shouldn't have interfered.

138
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,446
I told you I'm sorry.

139
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,763
I want to share your commitment,

140
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,027
but it's hard for me sometimes.

141
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,247
Like when she
read your love letters

142
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,604
in the middle of the New Museum?

143
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,992
Yes, I read <i>The New Yorker.</i>

144
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:20,659
That was a year ago, and
we're not together anymore.

145
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,832
Seriously, you weren't really
gonna let that guy set you on fire?

146
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,907
He was just a plant to
get the crowd going, right?

147
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,466
If that's your
interpretation, I welcome it.

148
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,945
Afsoun believes explaining
her work limits its potential.

149
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,984
But between us, he
was real. And a total dick.

150
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,075
No sane person
would let themselves

151
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,745
be burned alive
for the sake of art.

152
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,587
My work is meant to force the
audience to break with the rational

153
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,626
and see things in a new way.

154
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,255
Fine. No sane person would
let themselves be burned alive

155
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,696
to break with the rational.

156
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,163
I feel...

157
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,670
Luca, hand me the
oxygen mask behind you.

158
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,140
Luca!

159
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,881
Congratulations,
it's a gestational sac.

160
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,778
You can't see anything
this early. I know.

161
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,950
I just figured this would help
me process what's happening.

162
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,345
There's a lot we
gotta figure out.

163
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,622
We have almost eight months.

164
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,048
You're not having
doubts, are you?

165
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,060
No. Are you?

166
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,131
Definitely not.

167
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,630
A nice, cozy home
for little Ruben.

168
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,208
It's a family name.
It's a sandwich.

169
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,141
Named for my family.

170
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,881
It's just House.

171
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,350
I swear to God, stay
out of my personal life.

172
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,020
Where's the downside here?

173
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,392
Huh? Jerry is cute,

174
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,231
he's a Senior VP,

175
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,564
he kite-surfs in Costa Rica every
winter, and he loves his mother.

176
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,796
Seasonally?

177
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,666
Or is that just
the kite-surfing?

178
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,805
Is this about House?

179
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,000
What?

180
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:12,445
Like, I secretly wish I could
alter the laws of the universe,

181
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,981
change who we are and
magically make it work out?

182
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,448
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm asking.

183
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:17,950
And my sarcasm indicated "no."

184
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,986
No. Your sarcasm
indicated you wanted

185
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,544
to avoid actually
saying anything.

186
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,880
Look, Lisa...

187
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,225
All I know is you seem stuck.

188
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,488
And I don't like
seeing you like that.

189
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,002
She got worse in the hyperbaric
chamber, it's not CO poisoning.

190
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,733
I think we should consider
infection and test the assistant.

191
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,740
I couldn't get his
attention, he was in a daze.

192
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,853
You think that's a symptom?
He's in love with her.

193
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,021
He's probably just overwhelmed
and couldn't decide what to do.

194
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,809
What's he been doing
since she was admitted?

195
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,194
Did he bring anything from the
patient room into the treatment room?

196
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,586
Few things. A handbag,
flowers, a stuffed elephant.

197
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,358
Does she seem like the kind of
woman who needs a stuffed animal?

198
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,074
Who are you calling?

199
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,599
Oh. Of course.

200
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,037
What are you wearing?

201
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,073
Oh. I can see what you're
wearing. Go to her room.

202
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,122
<i>Now go address the
elephant in the room.</i>

203
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,061
This is a nanny cam.

204
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,401
<i>The reason Luca couldn't decide</i>

205
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,135
<i>what to do in the treatment room</i>

206
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,471
<i>is the same as in the gallery.</i>

207
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,443
<i>He's been told not to intervene.</i>

208
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,876
Congratulations. We've
become her latest work of art.

209
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,200
It shouldn't have surprised us.

210
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,216
All her work is based
on personal traumas.

211
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,057
She's had Luca taking notes,
videotape her treatments,

212
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,926
collect things, like
sharps and bandages.

213
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,659
It'll all go into a
gallery installation.

214
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,526
Well, then, I guess as long as the
exploitation is properly motivated,

215
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,127
it's all okay.

216
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,500
Ultrasound showed a cyst on
her pancreas. We drained it...

217
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,987
Why are we even
discussing this case?

218
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,640
She lied to us, it's opening
us up to malpractice...

219
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,182
Our practice opens
us up to malpractice.

220
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,911
How do we know
she's actually sick?

221
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,078
Her being sick is a clue.

222
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,598
She would have let that guy set
her on fire for the sake of her work.

223
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,422
You think she's scared
of a little arrhythmia?

224
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,634
She probably
huffed paint thinner.

225
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,035
She would have let
him set her on fire

226
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,527
because of the
honesty of her work.

227
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,688
Faking an illness
doesn't fit. Thirteen's right.

228
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,421
At least her conclusion was.

229
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,023
Everything else
was laughably wrong.

230
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,928
If the patient
induced pancreatitis

231
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,312
and a heart attack,
she'd be suicidal.

232
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,805
Exactly. She's risking
her life all the time.

233
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,807
Exactly. If she
wanted to be dead,

234
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,342
she'd be dead a long time ago.

235
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,707
Pretending to cheat death
pays better than watercolors.

236
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,575
Coxsackie B fits.
But do a spiral CT

237
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,947
of her biliary tree to
rule out gallstones.

238
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,543
Fine. I'll get the CT.

239
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,332
Sure, I'd be happy
to come with you.

240
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,211
Thanks for asking.

241
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,189
You're supposed to stay
in bed. Doctor's orders.

242
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,520
If you really cared about me,

243
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,688
you wouldn't be so obvious when
you scheme to prove me wrong.

244
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,456
You volunteered because
you want to CT her lungs,

245
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,694
not her biliary tree.

246
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,498
You want to find fibrosis and
prove your paint thinner theory.

247
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,198
If I don't come
with, when you fail,

248
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,400
you'll pretend you never tried.

249
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,636
I don't really have
a choice now, do I?

250
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,165
Since I've seen your pay
check, I probably shouldn't...

251
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,108
But canned beans aren't so bad.

252
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,008
Once they're cooked
over an oil drum fire

253
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,243
under a bridge with
the king of the hobos...

254
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,840
<i>I feel dizzy.</i>

255
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,925
Pale, diaphoretic, tachycardic.

256
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,589
BP 80 over 40.

257
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,426
Internal bleeding?

258
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,261
Get her out of
here and scope her.

259
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,404
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,959
The colonoscopy
didn't find the bleed,

261
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,253
so we gotta look by your liver.

262
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,317
Luca, please. We need
to document everything.

263
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,321
Hold this.

264
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,762
I'm just below
the celiac artery.

265
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,297
No blood.

266
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,804
Could it be leaking
into her thighs?

267
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,003
No swelling, no asymmetry...

268
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,269
So where's the blood going?

269
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,645
Why are you looking down there?

270
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,310
Because I don't like beans.

271
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,420
You stood me up. Sorry.

272
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,357
I should have scheduled my
patient's internal bleeding for Thursday.

273
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,159
You're still playing the same
petty passive-aggressive games.

274
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,697
Got you to go all the
way to the second floor

275
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,702
of the building you work in.

276
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,930
Boy, did I screw with you.

277
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,870
You said you were
going to change.

278
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:40,996
Check the sign.

279
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,351
It says you got to treat
me with intensive care.

280
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,469
I'm expressing my
anger. You should try it.

281
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,370
Right now. Let's
finally have our fight.

282
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,140
All we do is fight.

283
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,275
No, all you've
done is pull pranks,

284
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,945
or have temper tantrums
with Wilson, never me,

285
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,420
marry mail-order prostitutes,

286
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,598
make me go to your wedding...

287
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,989
Dominika is a
licensed esthetician.

288
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,993
You cut open your own leg!

289
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,100
So all this was about you?

290
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,561
You don't think it
was even related?

291
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,394
House, we've never even had a
conversation about our breakup.

292
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,127
You are obviously
still angry at me,

293
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,321
and it's hurting both of us.

294
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,668
Wow. I didn't realize the
incredible healing power of lunch.

295
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,230
I know one conversation
isn't gonna solve everything,

296
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,468
but it is a start.

297
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,473
It's a privacy curtain.

298
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,809
It wasn't working.

299
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,847
Lunch at 1:00, tomorrow
in the cafeteria. You happy?

300
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,406
How many of those
have you had today?

301
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,729
I don't know. Is "your
mother" a number?

302
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,092
The patient is a fraud.

303
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,213
I found a puncture in the
dorsal vein of her left foot.

304
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,414
Shooting up heroin
wouldn't explain...

305
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,531
Not heroin,

306
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,650
she was injecting herself
with her own red blood cells.

307
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,754
It caused her heart issues,

308
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,019
and when her
hematocrit evened out,

309
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,421
we mistook it for
internal bleeding.

310
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,245
That must've been a
very distinctively shaped,

311
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,714
and awfully talkative puncture

312
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,874
for you to get all of that.

313
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,885
The browser history
on her laptop helped.

314
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,180
She was researching blood
doping, among other things.

315
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,320
She was researching me?

316
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,454
For months.

317
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,327
This isn't about creating
art in the moment.

318
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,923
It's about you.

319
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,592
She set you up.

320
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,313
We sent a uni over to his
apartment and the hospital.

321
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,320
Yeah, he won't be there.

322
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,787
Any ideas?

323
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,735
When you find him,
you're gonna arrest him?

324
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,439
Is there some reason
you think I shouldn't?

325
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,065
Knowing him, he'll be in a bar.

326
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,000
He'll find one that matches
how he feels inside.

327
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,164
It'll be the most
dark, depressing hole

328
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,902
you can find in New Jersey.

329
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,605
Now you're just pissing me off.

330
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,276
I'm really sorry. I didn't
know she researched you,

331
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,390
I had no idea she... HOUSE:
You don't know anything?

332
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,546
Then why are you talking?

333
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,797
Please, don't
take it out on Luca.

334
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,266
I'll take it out on whoever I
think will irritate you the most.

335
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,770
I thought you would
understand someone

336
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,090
who uses their work
to deal with pain.

337
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,606
I didn't realize that search
engines could look within the soul.

338
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,963
You're standing in front
of me in a hospital gown.

339
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,376
What the hell is
the point of this?

340
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,528
What personal trauma
are you exploiting...

341
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,504
Sorry. Mining for
its artistic potential?

342
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,006
My illness.

343
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:35,380
I did the blood doping to
intrigue you, but I was already ill.

344
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,279
Wait. You're really sick?

345
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,778
Why me? LUCA: Do
you know what you have?

346
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,947
Yes. So tell him.

347
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,684
If I do, there won't
be any game for him.

348
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,123
And then, there
won't be any art for us.

349
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:49,852
Why me?

350
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,228
I don't answer those questions.

351
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,379
You know, there's a
lot of games I could play

352
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:00,567
that don't involve dealing with
narcissistic, manipulative posers.

353
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,009
But this is a puzzle
tailor-made for you.

354
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,142
You don't know which
of my symptoms are real,

355
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:11,014
which are fake, which ones
I'm not even telling you about.

356
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,713
I know that intrigues you.

357
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,748
Do you really
want to end it now?

358
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:26,759
No.

359
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,762
You want us to
waste a bed on her?

360
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,166
You took an oath,

361
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,331
an oath to be cool.

362
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,372
At least that was the one I
mumbled under my breath

363
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,019
while everyone else
was doing the boring one.

364
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,478
Even if she is sick,
which I don't believe,

365
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,207
she also says she
has a diagnosis.

366
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,715
So, it's either just a
lie or it's just a game.

367
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,884
So what? I like
the game, it's fun.

368
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,921
Go get a blood culture. Check
for parasites and bacteria.

369
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,233
This is the new House?

370
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,249
Half the leg power,
twice the irresponsibility?

371
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,794
The new House is about
making my life healthier.

372
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,295
I never said
anything about yours.

373
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,360
Go get her blood.

374
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,063
I'll do it.

375
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,784
He's going through a
tough patch right now.

376
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,118
If this is the
distraction he needs

377
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,420
to keep him in his hospital bed,

378
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,380
I'm sure it's better than
any of the alternatives.

379
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,640
That was incredibly
condescending. Did it work?

380
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,429
Why do you keep
ducking your wife's calls?

381
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,557
Ex-wife.

382
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,464
I'm sure she just wants
to congratulate you

383
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,595
about knocking up
a 22-year-old nurse.

384
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,799
I haven't told her yet.

385
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,205
But you have told
her you're not gonna

386
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,335
sleep with her anymore, right?

387
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,612
How are you planning
on letting her know?

388
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,014
Just invite her to the bris?

389
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,109
I'm trying to let her down easy.

390
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,463
Rachel never
wanted to have kids,

391
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,597
I don't want to
hurt her feelings.

392
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,489
Yeah, you are
all about feelings.

393
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,186
I've loved Rachel for 20 years.

394
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,922
What if she never
speaks to me again?

395
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:07,296
She's gonna find out.
It better be from you.

396
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,136
You can't cheat your
way out of this one.

397
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,302
What is it?

398
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:20,271
Just the nausea.

399
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,172
She said her back
was hurting earlier.

400
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,959
What's the pain level
on a scale of one to 10?

401
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,042
Five.

402
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,162
We know we can't take her word for it.
- We can't.

403
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,210
Fun, huh?

404
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,780
Roll on your side.

405
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,725
Grey-Turner's sign.

406
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,190
We're done playing.

407
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,391
Your pancreas is releasing
corrosive enzymes.

408
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,228
It'll eat away at the
surrounding organs.

409
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:43,859
But you must know that.

410
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,480
The doctor who diagnosed
you would have said

411
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,837
what will happen if
you don't get treatment.

412
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,041
Just tell them.

413
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,254
If you know what's
wrong with you,

414
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,507
tell them so they can fix it.

415
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,481
How many projects
have we done together?

416
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,313
You're always so worried.

417
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,081
Have you ever gone
wrong trusting me?

418
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,898
That pancreatic cyst
we drained, it's back.

419
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,729
And she doesn't care at all.

420
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,847
You think she
actually is suicidal?

421
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:19,930
I would.

422
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,837
But how does she
give herself the cysts?

423
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,537
Tox screen was negative,
and there's no sign of trauma.

424
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,744
There is another explanation.

425
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:36,687
The reason that she didn't
react isn't 'cause she wants to die.

426
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:40,692
It's 'cause she knows she
can't do anything about it.

427
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,284
Whatever she has, it's fatal.

428
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,733
That should narrow it down.

429
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,167
What are we doing here?

430
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,368
Testing a theory.

431
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,035
It's based on some stuff
you can't understand,

432
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,669
like RR variability.

433
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,078
And some stuff you can,

434
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,706
like the fact she
shaved her head

435
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,410
in an art piece four months ago.

436
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,248
That was a commentary
on society's...

437
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,913
It was a commentary on the fact

438
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,321
that it was gonna
fall out anyway,

439
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,552
and she wanted to hide why.

440
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,531
Cancer?

441
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,429
Are you sure about that?

442
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:25,603
See that tumor-ish thingamajig
near her brainamabob?

443
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,906
Are you getting this?

444
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,273
Game's over. I won.

445
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:36,108
Primary CNS lymphoma with
associated paraneoplastic syndrome.

446
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,247
Is that really what it is?

447
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,744
Yes.

448
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,956
Four months ago, I had some
vision and balance problems

449
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,757
and New York Mercy diagnosed me.

450
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:53,924
The tumor was too close
to the brain stem to cut out,

451
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,067
so they did a few
rounds of radiation.

452
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,029
But it didn't work, and
they sent me home.

453
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,074
That was around the
time you broke up with me.

454
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:05,407
We were having a fling. It wouldn't
have been fair to involve you.

455
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:09,311
I'm involved now. You
just didn't want to open up.

456
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,078
Luca, my mind
was not clear then.

457
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,751
And then you cleared it.

458
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,589
You realized you could use your
death to make your magnum opus.

459
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,993
Maybe you wanted to show
that no one can cheat death,

460
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:26,429
even with an entire team of
doctors with unlimited resources.

461
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,026
Or maybe your first doctors

462
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,763
didn't treat you like a person,

463
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:31,997
just a series of symptoms.

464
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,664
You wanted to recreate
that depersonalization,

465
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,298
and I was the man to see.

466
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:43,348
If that was what I
thought, I don't any longer.

467
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:47,009
You spent time with me,

468
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,780
you took this personally.

469
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,154
No, I didn't.

470
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,663
And I don't actually think
your piece is about anything.

471
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,357
I think you just figured
out that you were mortal.

472
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,527
Just a bag of cells and waste

473
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,503
with an expiration date.

474
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:09,006
You wanted to act out,
you wanted people to notice.

475
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,872
Maybe you even prayed for
a different answer this time.

476
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,155
<i>I got a title for your piece.</i>

477
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,716
<i>"It doesn't mean anything."</i>

478
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,038
You're forging my name
on prescriptions again.

479
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,404
No.

480
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,312
What you just said implies
that I stopped at some point.

481
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,974
Twenty minutes ago, I put a
notice out to all local pharmacies

482
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,745
to require verbal authorization

483
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,061
before filling in
my prescriptions.

484
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,714
You have any idea how much
extra work you've just given yourself?

485
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:56,965
You're not gonna last a week.

486
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,582
I've been dealing
with this for years,

487
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,090
but it's over.

488
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,820
Your liver, your hearing,

489
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,387
never mind the fact that each
scrip you write is a separate felony.

490
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,056
You will serve time. So could I.

491
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:10,193
You've chosen this moment to
give me crap about my Vicodin use?

492
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,703
You filled this three days ago,

493
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,068
now it's almost half gone.

494
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,231
So is my leg.

495
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,865
It's a month's supply.

496
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:19,037
The amount you're taking has
nothing to do with physical pain.

497
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,204
Okay.

498
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,715
So, maybe I am trying
to numb myself a little.

499
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,942
Because I'm trying to change.

500
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,495
I'm trying to stop
being self-destructive.

501
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,581
So, you can only handle not
self-destructing by being self-destructive?

502
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,749
What do you want from me?

503
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:35,453
I don't know, House.
But I'm worried about you.

504
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:36,805
I don't know how many
times I can watch you

505
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,297
cut off pieces of yourself.

506
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,593
Now it's the ICU, next
time it'll be the morgue.

507
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,597
You're miserable
and you're angry.

508
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,730
And I want you to
actually deal with that

509
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,901
and not just try to
medicate the issue away.

510
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,479
No.

511
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:58,244
You know what I feel right now?

512
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,446
I don't feel miserable or
angry. I don't feel good or bad.

513
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,058
I feel nothing.

514
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,122
Which feels great.

515
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:11,755
What are you doing?

516
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,925
Moving on. In the
direction of my house,

517
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,298
where I've got some more pills.

518
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,871
You're discharging yourself
against doctor's orders,

519
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,204
you've got to check that box.

520
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,112
I'm a doctor, so technically...

521
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,647
Wouldn't it be easier if
you just checked the box?

522
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,127
Why are you still here?

523
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:55,401
I'm going as soon as the nurse
brings me something for my eczema.

524
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,248
I figured it was irritated
by the paint thinner

525
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,579
poured on me in the gallery.

526
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,284
Does this mean something?

527
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,679
It's not eczema.

528
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,522
And it's not cancer.

529
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,291
It's Wegener's granulomatosis.

530
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,443
The biopsy confirmed that
what you thought was eczema

531
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,469
was actually a swelling of
the blood vessels in your skin.

532
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,495
It also explains the pancreatitis
and the mass in your brain.

533
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,005
And it's treatable.

534
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,105
What's the treatment?

535
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,773
We could do steroids alone,

536
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,544
to shrink the
growth in your brain.

537
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,017
But it's much better to add
another course of radiation.

538
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,952
Radiation? On my brain?

539
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,350
But it made me fuzzy last time.

540
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,018
It was harder to work.

541
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,387
I'm still slowed down from it.

542
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,628
And it'll get worse.

543
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,834
But, you know, dying can also do
a number on your ability to think.

544
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,065
I'm sorry. I can't
do the radiation.

545
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,074
They just said it was
the better treatment.

546
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,514
It could save your life.

547
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,716
My life's not worth
anything if I can't do my art.

548
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,686
You have friends, people
who care about you.

549
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,432
This is my brain, my
work and my life, Luca.

550
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,366
You have more!

551
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:37,233
This is not some great
performance piece anymore.

552
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,179
This is just crazy.

553
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,215
I'm sorry.

554
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,090
I can't watch you die.

555
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,861
Not when you can save yourself.

556
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,061
Goodbye, Afsoun.

557
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,807
Good for you.

558
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,632
So... So...

559
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:40,598
Why did I ever ban
alcohol from the cafeteria?

560
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,902
Before I forget,
there's a brush,

561
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,846
tortoise shell handle,
natural bristles.

562
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,077
It wasn't in the box. If
you could look for it?

563
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,177
Like the Lindbergh baby.

564
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,786
You dating anyone?

565
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,084
We don't have to...

566
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,754
Look, it's just standard
lunch conversation.

567
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,263
Not for us.

568
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,099
Okay, well, if you've gone over

569
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,964
to the "we don't talk
about things" side,

570
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,129
then I got a pot
roast in the oven.

571
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,365
No.

572
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,668
I haven't dated
anyone since you.

573
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:22,104
You know what they
say, once you go gimp...

574
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,049
We should talk about your leg.

575
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,952
You think I have
unresolved issues,

576
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,752
and you are the
unresolved issues.

577
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:33,883
Yes.

578
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,158
But I think it's more than that.

579
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,990
Your life, your choices...

580
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,727
I did it to fix my life.

581
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,898
No, wait.

582
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:47,336
No, I did it because I am
a deeply unhappy person.

583
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:50,870
No, I did it to get
sympathy from you.

584
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,336
I did it to piss you off. I did
it because I'm not over you.

585
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,507
Or I was over you
and I was moving on.

586
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,413
I did it because I wanna know

587
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,076
what it's like
not to be in pain.

588
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:03,519
I did it because I
wanna feel more pain.

589
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,656
Whatever the reason, it was
a bad reason and a bad idea.

590
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,165
That's all that matters.

591
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,325
Good lunch.

592
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,268
House! Talk to me.

593
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,436
I already did.

594
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,013
No, you just parroted back

595
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,091
what Wilson and I have been
saying to you the last few days.

596
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:31,549
Get out of my way. No.

597
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,208
You pulled a stitch.

598
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,083
House, please. Just talk to me.

599
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,418
You want to know how I feel?

600
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,864
I feel hurt.

601
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,370
I know.

602
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,447
I'm sorry.

603
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,048
It's not your fault.

604
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,605
Did I make the wrong choice?

605
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:37,176
Five years, through every
opening, every installation,

606
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,013
every day and every night,

607
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,682
he was there the whole time.

608
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,882
Except the first time
you were diagnosed.

609
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:50,191
You broke up with him and you
had to go through all of that alone.

610
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,477
Maybe that's the real
reason you're doing this piece,

611
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,400
so that this time, you
can have him with you.

612
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,632
You still could.

613
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:13,977
Hi.

614
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,614
Lisa Cuddy. Nice to meet you.

615
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:19,800
I'm sorry about the other day.

616
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,623
I... There was some personal
things going on in my life

617
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,821
and I wasn't at my best.

618
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,389
Well, in retrospect,

619
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,492
my approach could've
come off as a little creepy.

620
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:31,729
No.

621
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,238
On a scale from one to creepy,

622
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,639
you were, maybe,
mildly unnerving.

623
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,183
Rach.

624
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:56,319
Sorry I ducked your calls. I
keep making the same mistakes,

625
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,521
but at some point... Chris.

626
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,828
I'm pregnant.

627
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,367
I didn't expect that.

628
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:19,008
Sorry, I was checking
the stitches on my penis.

629
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,445
Your leg okay?

630
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,321
It's healing. Good.

631
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,515
Just came to grab the
radiation therapy forms.

632
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,482
What?

633
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,822
Afsoun changed her mind.

634
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:36,993
Get out.

635
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,606
You made a decision.

636
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,504
I changed my mind. Why?

637
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,942
Because there are more
important things than...

638
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:55,010
Than what? Than your
brain? Your abilities?

639
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,298
That's where
everything comes from,

640
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,188
any meaning in your
life, any happiness.

641
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,349
Not all happiness.

642
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:01,825
He's already left once.

643
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,287
He's gonna leave you again.

644
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:07,489
You don't need to depend on
people who are gonna let you down.

645
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,336
If you do this, you're
a pathetic hypocrite.

646
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,837
You're saying
that your whole life,

647
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,515
all your work up until
him was a pointless...

648
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,531
Why are you doing this?

649
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,693
House, I can hear
your phone ringing.

650
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,420
You all right?

651
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,329
Did you go to lunch with Cuddy?

652
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,585
Yeah.

653
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,419
How was it?

654
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,527
The pasta arrabiata was cold.

655
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,330
Why don't we get a drink?

656
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,765
We could go to the Sawmill.

657
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,323
Cuddy's is on the way.

658
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,725
I need to return this.

659
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,629
You think she's going to
have an emergency tangle?

660
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,861
It was on my mind.

661
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,831
I want to get it off.

662
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,208
Want me to come?

663
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,537
You think I'm
gonna get in trouble?

664
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,910
I'm delivering a hairbrush.

665
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,542
What just happened?

666
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,818
Get out.

667
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,751
What just happened?

668
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,116
Get out.

669
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,391
House, what are you mad about?

670
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,058
Just let it out,
you'll feel better.

671
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,125
You're right. I
feel much better.

672
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,280
You want another one?

673
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,520
No, I think I've had enough.

674
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,385
What do you think
I should do today?

675
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,628
I don't know, go home?

676
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,302
Not tonight.

677
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:20,866
Cheers.
