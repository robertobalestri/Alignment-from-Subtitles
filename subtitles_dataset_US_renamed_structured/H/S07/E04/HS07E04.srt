1
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,186
Billy?

2
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,188
Is anyone here?

3
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,303
Billy?

4
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,596
<i>Hey.</i> Hey.

5
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,828
I just noticed the
front door was open.

6
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,200
<i>Maybe you left it that way?</i>

7
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,699
I don't know, I thought
I heard something.

8
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,007
I mean, I know the whole
house creaks, but I was just...

9
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,340
<i>You have any doubts,
go to the Cassanos'.</i>

10
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,610
<i>I'm in the car, I'm
a few blocks away.</i>

11
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:25,050
No, I'm sure it's
nothing. Love you.

12
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,434
Oh, God.

13
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:27,704
The door banged shut, I'm
sure it was just the wind. God.

14
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,908
It's okay.

15
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,749
It's okay, it's just me.

16
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:31,951
Huh.

17
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,347
You all right?

18
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:38,750
Margaret.

19
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,358
Hey!

20
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,096
Margaret! You okay?

21
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,257
My stomach!

22
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,298
I get it!

23
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,491
You're jealous of my new cane,

24
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,333
so you hired a new doctor
that you could lean on.

25
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,499
Exactly. Nothing to do with the fact
that you instructed me to hire one.

26
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,511
Dr. House, this is Dr. Kelly
Benedict, your new fellow.

27
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,606
Nice to meet you.

28
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,108
Um...

29
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,278
I just finished my psychiatry
residency at St. Jude's.

30
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,754
And I loved studying the mind,

31
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,267
but I thought I could make
more of a difference, or at least...

32
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,452
Man, you're hot.

33
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,357
I mean, seriously.

34
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,173
Thirty-year-old female... I
know what you're thinking.

35
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,634
"She looks like Cameron, and he's
hired her solely to sleep with her."

36
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,192
No. None of us
were thinking that.

37
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,293
Well, you should have.

38
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,202
But you'd be foolishly wrong.

39
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,969
Yes, he's been dating at a
near-Clooney pace recently,

40
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,479
but at this point, the only hole
he's trying to fill is the one in his soul.

41
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,516
Which means it's the emotional
connection with Cameron he misses.

42
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,677
Did you ever marry a dying man,
and if so, did you freeze his sperm?

43
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,518
Okay, so Cameron's
his ex, but the sperm...

44
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,819
She's not like Cameron.

45
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,803
Then why did you make
her wear Cameron's clothes?

46
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,523
No. I'm wearing my own clothes.

47
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,739
Thirty-year-old female.

48
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,459
Severe vomiting
and abdominal pain,

49
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,696
preceded by three days of
moderate pain, slightly elevated LFTs.

50
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,361
Could be lead...

51
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,929
Ah-ah-ah. If I know
Dr. Shameron, and I think I do,

52
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,471
she'll want this chance
for a little stuff-strutting.

53
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,948
Okay. Hepatitis A...

54
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,511
Serologies are negative.

55
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,645
Right. Uh...

56
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,285
Appendicitis... That
hasn't ruptured by now?

57
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,689
It's hepatic fibrosis.

58
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,890
At the risk of having
Foreman snark at me, too,

59
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,728
lead poisoning could also work.

60
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,862
Liver angiogram
to check for fibrosis,

61
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,372
search the home
for heavy metals.

62
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,954
What's your position on the
legality of illegal break-ins?

63
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,207
That's more of a second-week
type activity. We'll do the angiogram.

64
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,305
I'll meet you in
radiology, third floor.

65
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,719
She was nervous.
Give her a break.

66
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:55,979
Oh.

67
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,551
And she's not like Cameron.

68
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,556
True. Cameron had
much smaller breasts.

69
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,722
By which I mean,
she was smarter.

70
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,540
How are things going with Cuddy?

71
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,738
Great.

72
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,006
We've gotten to fifth base.

73
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,750
That's two home runs, and
then she gives me back a triple.

74
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,418
I could see you on this one.

75
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,186
Am I wearing a dashiki?

76
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,689
<i>Easy Rider</i> auditions
ended four decades ago.

77
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,854
Are you sleeping over there yet?

78
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,626
Nope. She comes over,
we hook up, she leaves.

79
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,957
Whose idea was that?

80
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,195
Mine.

81
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,204
But I let her think it's hers.

82
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,569
It's the fun of a relationship.

83
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,608
You get the sex, the dinners,

84
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,733
videogame partnership.

85
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,471
I also get a full night's sleep.

86
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,104
Okay. Taking it
slow. That could work.

87
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,046
You are spending
time with the kid.

88
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:59,280
As little as possible.
That is one boring child.

89
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,086
House, she's a toddler. I know.

90
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:05,087
Grading on a
curve. It's that bad.

91
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,889
You think you were a
scintillating wit at two and a half?

92
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,055
I wasn't trying to eat shoes.

93
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,827
Cuddy could have
adopted a golden retriever.

94
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,630
Yeah, things are
definitely going great.

95
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,698
We'll get to it
when we get to it.

96
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,942
You really like these, or are you
just avoiding a touchy conversation?

97
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,070
Nah. This one's too metrosexual,

98
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,479
this one is too heterosexual.

99
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,605
They're identical.

100
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,249
Do you even want my input?

101
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,479
No.

102
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,053
Then why did you invite me?

103
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,386
Who would drive my
car home if I buy a bike?

104
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:44,226
You did fine. House is
just trying to get at me.

105
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,266
And he's wrong, by the way.

106
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,132
I hired you because you were
the most qualified applicant.

107
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,828
Injecting dye.

108
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,431
Dr. Foreman didn't
seem to like me, either.

109
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,773
Oh, well, he takes a
little while to warm up.

110
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,405
In my case, I'm hoping
year seven does the trick.

111
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,243
Tapering cutoff in the left
branch of the hepatic artery.

112
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,751
Tumor?

113
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,447
Looks more like scar tissue.

114
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,247
From what? Surgery?

115
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,484
Probably.

116
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,120
Look at her rib cage.

117
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,492
She broke five or six
bones at some point.

118
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,994
She didn't tell us about this?

119
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,495
No, she didn't.

120
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,702
I checked the
pipes and the paint.

121
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,039
It's not lead poisoning.
You got anything?

122
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,874
Yeah. I was looking around,
and in the corner over there,

123
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,778
I found a question about why you
have a problem with our new doctor.

124
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,684
Sorry. We should all be super polite
in the DDxs, fail to correct each other,

125
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,866
and then treat patients for
diseases they don't have.

126
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,685
Dude, is this about Thirteen?

127
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,055
No. Why are you
calling me "dude"?

128
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,994
Maybe it's hard seeing House
replace her when you still got feelings?

129
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,396
One, I don't have feelings
for Thirteen beyond friendship,

130
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,559
two, it's a temporary
replacement,

131
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,329
and three, "Dude"?

132
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,031
It felt right.

133
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,717
The day the patient collapsed,
she say where she was working?

134
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,853
A cleaning job in Summit,
then she went straight home.

135
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,177
Then why's she got a credit card
receipt for lunch from a cafÃ© in Trenton?

136
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,382
I'm not hiding anything.
I just got the days wrong.

137
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,453
I worked in Trenton on Tuesday,

138
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,421
I worked in Summit on Monday.

139
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,854
I guess it slipped my mind.

140
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,017
And breaking eight ribs,
that slip your mind, too?

141
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,189
You know how I was on the
cycling team when I was at UMass?

142
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:26,063
Well, during training, I fell off my
bike, right onto a sprinkler head.

143
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,429
Why didn't you tell us?

144
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,695
That was 10 years ago.

145
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,203
I didn't think it could be
related to my stomach problems.

146
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,466
We're gonna need to see
the records from the operation.

147
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,564
You think it is related?

148
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,052
The strange stuff
we found in your liver,

149
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,874
it's probably hepatic fibrosis,

150
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,989
but it could also just be a
screw-up from your old surgery.

151
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,847
The operation was done
at the university hospital.

152
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,516
Hopefully, they still
have the records.

153
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,884
Come back. Just one
more time. You'll love it.

154
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,517
My wrists are tired.

155
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:57,189
I can't defeat NoobDecimator98
all alone. Come on, we're a team.

156
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,492
You understand, right?

157
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,697
Babysitter's leaving
in half an hour.

158
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,231
Oops! You're right.

159
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,672
Scram, I got a massage
coming by in five.

160
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,702
It was at that moment she realized
the romance was already gone.

161
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,411
Headshot!

162
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,456
Oh! Hi.

163
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,386
Hi.

164
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,707
I called UMass. There's no
record of any surgery for Margaret.

165
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:46,973
You use her maiden name?

166
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,400
No, Kelly knows nothing about
the concept of married names.

167
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,315
It wasn't covered in
her psychiatry residency.

168
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,216
Margaret was never even
registered at the university.

169
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,085
Call the other
hospitals in the area.

170
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,488
Done. Nothing.

171
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,869
So I ran her social security number
through one of those websites.

172
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,623
Her number matches her name.

173
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,924
But she's got no credit
history until three years ago.

174
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:08,093
And based on her number,
she was born around 1945.

175
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,269
She stole someone's identity.

176
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,446
Supraventricular
tachycardia, 150 bpm.

177
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,414
Carotid massage? Not responding.

178
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,592
- I'll get the adenosine.
- Tried already.

179
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,778
Get the pacemaker,
we can overdrive her.

180
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:37,695
Dorothy. Dorothy. Dorothy,
dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

181
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,756
What's wrong with me?

182
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:44,866
Well, on the one hand, you've got some
mysterious heart and tummy problems.

183
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,431
On the other, you look
great for a 65-year-old.

184
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,971
So who are you?

185
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,241
And no, that's not some weird
Canadian pronunciation of "how."

186
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,712
They're saying you
changed your identity.

187
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,650
What are they talking
about, Margaret?

188
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,380
I don't know.

189
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,892
Well, that falls in the
"obviously stupid lie" category.

190
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,090
Which you're familiar with from the
one you told us about your bike accident.

191
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,563
You thought we'd never check?

192
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,602
Five years ago, I was married.

193
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,000
Who was he?

194
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,967
Just a guy. I met
him in high school.

195
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,409
He was older.

196
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:31,812
He used to get
jealous, do drugs.

197
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:32,977
Those broken bones?

198
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,854
He would tell me to
take off all my clothes,

199
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:42,088
so he could inspect
me, then he would hit me.

200
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,924
I got a restraining order, ran
away. And he found me anyway.

201
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,333
That's when he broke my ribs.

202
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,963
I moved away again, to Arizona.

203
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,868
Came back from work one day,

204
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:02,381
he'd broken in, fed
pesticides to my dog, killed her.

205
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,443
I bought a dead
woman's identity,

206
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,283
changed my name, moved here.

207
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,119
Is this related to why you
were in Trenton yesterday?

208
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:16,727
There's a support group for
abused women at Trenton General.

209
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,865
I go a lot.

210
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,592
What's his name?

211
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,329
Please don't do this. I don't...

212
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,734
Just tell me.

213
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,900
Carl.

214
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,006
Carl what?

215
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,102
This is why I didn't tell you.

216
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,008
'Cause you go confront
him, he'll kill you.

217
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,515
Well, I got another name you
could tell us instead. Yours.

218
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,344
It's Jenny.

219
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:50,553
Now, some person seemed to think that I
was not being fair to you in our last DDx,

220
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,495
because I made you nervous.

221
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,535
So this time, I'm
gonna put you at ease.

222
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,837
It's just you and old Doc House.

223
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:02,270
Couple of pals
chittin' the chat.

224
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,843
Why not just place her chair above a
trap door with a shark tank underneath?

225
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,781
Because Wednesday's when
I get my shark tank cleaned.

226
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,613
Also, because I'm
giving her a chance.

227
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,812
You're giving her a test.

228
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,013
This whole job is a test.

229
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:18,286
I'm giving her the chance to
fail it sooner rather than later.

230
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,620
Or pass.

231
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:26,761
Arrhythmia and elevated LFTs rule out
hepatic fibrosis. So heart and stomach.

232
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,677
Gastritis. Explains the
stomach, not the heart.

233
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,846
Atrial fibrillation? Explains
the heart, not the stomach.

234
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,305
Sorry, sorry. Cystitis.

235
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,705
Explains the... Nothing.

236
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,403
I meant cholecystitis.

237
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,139
Would have showed
up on the physical exam.

238
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,452
Do we have to sit here all day?

239
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,358
You got a better answer than
she does, then let's hear it.

240
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,476
I'm sure she's already
starting to think how,

241
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,884
if we add the symptoms
to an abusive ex,

242
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:51,447
the fact that she'd just
eaten, the opened door...

243
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,322
Rhymes with "moison"?

244
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,624
You think her ex-husband
tried to poison her?

245
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,664
Even if he found her somehow,
these abusers have a pattern.

246
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,233
He beat her with his hands.
Poison's too impersonal, it doesn't fit.

247
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,466
Exactly, but the
counterargument is...

248
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,900
Her ex poisoned her dog.

249
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,872
Oh.

250
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,004
Right.

251
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,842
She said he used pesticides. He
could have stuck some in her dinner.

252
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,651
Treat with pralidoxime.

253
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,780
A for effort?

254
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:36,030
House was wrong trying to come up
with a complicated reason you hired Kelly.

255
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,861
Thank you.

256
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,837
It's actually quite simple.

257
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,000
You think she's hot and
you want to sleep with her.

258
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,306
Well, it's nice to see you finally
taking an interest in my life.

259
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,490
We should go bowling sometime.

260
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,541
I'm just saying if you spend all your
off-work time and energy getting laid,

261
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,211
it's gonna spill into
your work as well.

262
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,618
She's smart. You
didn't interview her.

263
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,955
I did glance at her rÃ©sumÃ©.
Middling grades, middling med school.

264
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:03,554
She was editor for Rutgers'
daily undergrad newspaper.

265
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:07,122
That shows a lot more guts and
determination than med school grades.

266
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,865
Uh-huh?

267
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,829
How long did you interview her?

268
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,532
Forty-five minutes, at least.

269
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,132
How much of that was
after you decided to hire her?

270
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,179
You saw what you wanted to see.

271
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,515
This guy broke into our house?

272
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,181
That's the theory.

273
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,812
I don't know. It could be true.

274
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,288
And you didn't tell me about
him because you didn't trust me?

275
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,870
I just didn't want
you to get involved.

276
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,693
I'm already involved.
We're married.

277
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:41,325
It was the worst time in my
life. I wanted to block it out.

278
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,229
I'm sorry.

279
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,469
I gotta get out of here.

280
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:47,666
Where are you going?

281
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,174
I don't know.

282
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,543
Hey.

283
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,080
So I'm seeing you tonight.

284
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,586
Yes.

285
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,747
And you would have even
if you hadn't told me that.

286
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,020
I was just wondering...
Your masseuse?

287
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,186
Brandi.

288
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:12,164
I'm sure I'm imagining this, although
not as sure now that I know her name,

289
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,760
but she seems a little... How
do I say this? I don't know.

290
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,730
A bit slutty. Well,
she is a hooker.

291
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,574
If she's not slutty, she's
doing something wrong.

292
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,008
What?

293
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,003
Did you have sex with her?

294
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,274
Yesterday?

295
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:32,144
Ah! You're getting
confused by the hooker thing.

296
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,881
No, of course
not. I'm dating you.

297
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,920
But you used to
have sex with her?

298
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:42,192
Well, it was a
massage-plus-happy-ending sort of thing.

299
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,724
Now it's more of a sad ending.

300
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,195
Because of you.

301
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:54,704
I've tried 15 different massage
therapists in the last few years.

302
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,039
I don't know why, but
she's the best I've found.

303
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,907
She makes my leg feel better.

304
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:01,777
So you really think that
I would be okay with you

305
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,908
getting a massage from a
hooker you used to have sex with?

306
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,452
You don't mind the massage part.

307
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,953
You mind the sex part,
which doesn't exist anymore.

308
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,717
I know a great
physical therapist.

309
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,123
I will give you her number.

310
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,305
Why would I give up one who
definitely works for one who might work?

311
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,820
Because I asked you to.

312
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,092
Well, that's not really
an argument now, is it?

313
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,095
I won't see you until
you stop seeing her.

314
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,102
Well, that's an argument.

315
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,138
How's our patient doing?

316
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:38,440
Well, she's stable but it's too early
to tell if the pralidoxime is working.

317
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,417
Come on, go home. You can't
re-cram all of med school right now.

318
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,023
I'm feeling a lot
of pressure here.

319
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,724
You were the editor
of your school paper,

320
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,422
I think you know how
to deal with pressure.

321
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,757
No, I wasn't.

322
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:56,030
On your rÃ©sumÃ©, it said, "Rutgers
<i>Daily Herald,</i> Editor." Didn't it?

323
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,603
I wasn't head of the paper.

324
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,502
That's called "Editor-in-Chief."

325
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,665
I was just a writer.
We're all called editors.

326
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,765
Ah.

327
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,835
Did you hire me because of that?

328
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,371
Not entirely.

329
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,109
Look, if you're having
buyers' remorse...

330
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,208
I'm not. I'm not.

331
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,948
You might wanna check out
volume two on infectious diseases.

332
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,718
Patient's husband just
got admitted to the ER.

333
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:33,638
Let's say you had a
really fantastic handyman.

334
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:38,602
I was hoping you'd interrupt my
cooking to ask about handymen.

335
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,678
Do go on.

336
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,839
Would Sam ask
you to stop using him,

337
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,627
because you might have had a
sexual relationship with him in the past?

338
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,053
Yes, the age-old
hooker-massage conundrum.

339
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,684
Cuddy might have
mentioned something about it.

340
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:56,161
Let's say you're right, completely
right about everything. Give in anyway.

341
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,509
This isn't a point of pride,
this is a point of principle.

342
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,591
Right, you're the Rosa
Parks of hooker massages.

343
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,533
The principle is
she's being irrational.

344
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,970
I give in on this, it sets the
stage for the whole relationship.

345
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,134
Putting up with irrationality is the
foundation for every relationship.

346
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,474
I agree with Sam when she's
calling her father a monster.

347
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,189
I agree with her when
she's calling him a saint.

348
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,933
And in exchange, I
get to have sex with her.

349
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:18,413
And I'm sure she has
similar tradeoffs with me.

350
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,078
Relationships are hard.
You have to make sacrifices.

351
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:26,516
So, sacrifice being crazy.
Go get her a gift, apologize.

352
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,723
You've finally
made a good point.

353
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,726
Which clearly you've
misunderstood,

354
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,427
based on how quickly you agreed.

355
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,162
Kitchen's burning.

356
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:38,937
Oh!

357
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,733
We gotta get you
thinking like House.

358
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:43,935
The husband's in the ER,

359
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,444
if he's got similar symptoms,
it could mean environmental.

360
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,071
Which helps our
organophosphate theory.

361
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,581
Or maybe it's an infection,

362
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:51,947
which would mean we were wrong.

363
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,110
Exactly.

364
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,018
Or maybe he just got
sick with something else.

365
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,080
A coincidence? Yeah.

366
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,719
Here's one big piece of advice,

367
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,386
House doesn't buy coincidences.

368
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,429
Okay. It's not environmental.

369
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,296
What happened to you?
What does it look like?

370
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,412
It looks like someone kicked
your arse. What happened?

371
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,665
I looked in her address book.

372
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,014
There's a guy named
Carl in Brooklyn.

373
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,472
She told you to
stay away from him.

374
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,804
I'm not so good at following
directions sometimes.

375
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,809
I found him, I got angry,
which I also do sometimes.

376
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,592
He said he didn't know
what I was talking about,

377
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,482
he wouldn't let me
in, I got more pissed.

378
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,963
Next thing I know, I'm on the
floor, and he's called the cops.

379
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,148
You get arrested?

380
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,447
No, he didn't press charges.

381
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,992
Well, you should press
charges. If he tried to poison her...

382
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:36,927
No. He really didn't know
what I was talking about.

383
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,794
He was just some
guy that Margaret...

384
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,330
Damn it, that's not even
her name, Jenny just...

385
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,302
Some guy that Jenny
used to work with.

386
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:49,774
I was stupid. I just assumed
the name Carl was...

387
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,604
I just wanted to find the
guy that poisoned my wife.

388
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,576
What's up?

389
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,011
Pyrexia, 103 and rising.

390
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,021
I'll be right up.

391
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,821
Your wife just
spiked a fever. What?

392
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,486
What's that mean?

393
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,155
She wasn't poisoned.

394
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,372
What are you doing?

395
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:27,277
Just letting you all share in the joys
of my last trip to Carlsbad Caverns.

396
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,090
Which the husband probably
would have beaten up

397
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,946
if he'd found it in
the address book.

398
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,951
Would you mind standing
next to the screen?

399
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,544
Yeah, she'd love to become
a target for your ridicule.

400
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:36,748
She's not already?

401
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,120
Endocarditis?

402
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,455
Normal EKG. No Osler nodes.

403
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,618
Right, Dr. Kelly.

404
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,753
Kelly's her first name.

405
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,558
What's your point,
Dr. Robert? Run an echo.

406
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,099
I already did. No
vegetations, valves are clear.

407
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,829
Snapilicious! But as
I always like to say,

408
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,980
it's better to be a Helpful
Helen than a Negative Nelly.

409
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,496
So while you're cooking
up some ideas of your own,

410
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:58,100
allow me to present theory
2.0 of why Chase hired you.

411
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,669
Dr. Kelly, meet
your doppelgÃ¤nger.

412
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,811
Oh, no. Hold on a second.

413
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,780
Come on. House.

414
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:11,290
Is that... That's Baby
Chase and his mum.

415
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,586
That's adorable.

416
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:15,025
Never mind the
baby. Peep the babe.

417
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,756
Note the cheekbones
and eye shape.

418
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,617
They do actually look alike.

419
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,943
I know what you're thinking,
"Chase wants to sleep with his mom."

420
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,300
But who wouldn't hit that,
if that looked like that?

421
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,930
It's a classic case of what Freud called...
- Stop.

422
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:28,606
This isn't about Chase's mother.

423
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,619
You're wrong. What do
you mean, he's wrong?

424
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,202
It is about your mom? No.

425
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,370
So it's about...

426
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:36,847
I'm assuming he thought I'd
be a good member of the team.

427
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,350
And on that subject,
what about Legionnaires'?

428
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,114
Taub said he saw a rattle-y, old
air conditioner in the patient's house.

429
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,500
I don't care if he saw her
licking a petri dish of bacilli.

430
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,719
There's no lung involvement.

431
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,065
All we know is we don't see it.

432
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,392
Dehydration from the fever
could hide the pneumonia.

433
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,889
Okay. Forget the mom theory.

434
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,231
Now water the patient,
treat for Legionnaires'.

435
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,396
Hey, Taub. You didn't
write up the AC system.

436
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,066
Did you mention it to Kelly?

437
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,166
No.

438
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,175
You mentioned it to Chase?

439
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,678
Yeah.

440
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,375
Whose idea was Legionnaires'?

441
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,209
Dr. Chase's.

442
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,755
Well, you get major
points for trying to trick me.

443
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,653
Unfortunately, you
lose them all for failing.

444
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,658
Hold that, hold that.

445
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:25,254
See, now you're frowning, you
can really see the resemblance.

446
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,930
Who gives a crap
if I prepped her?

447
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,402
House. And that's just
off the top of my head.

448
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,597
Why are you doing this?

449
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,786
You're trying to make me
look bad so you look better?

450
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,039
Or you don't like her? Or
you're angry at me? What?

451
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,240
We hire someone unqualified, it's
just dead weight we'll all be pulling.

452
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,340
Me especially. You
especially, why?

453
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,009
What do you mean,
why? Because I'm...

454
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,713
You're what? You're
my boss or something?

455
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:49,413
Something like.

456
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,615
So that's what it is.

457
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,935
You're angry that House gave
me the chance to hire someone,

458
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,404
'cause you still think you're at a
different level to everyone else.

459
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,363
That's just pathetic. I
am at a different level.

460
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,925
Which is reflected in what,
exactly? Your title? No.

461
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:07,905
Your salary? Not really.
Your responsibilities? Hardly.

462
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,100
Your attitude?

463
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,734
Ah.

464
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,050
I think we've finally found it.

465
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:16,224
Doesn't change the fact that you made a
bad decision because you wanna get laid.

466
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,959
Or the fact that you're
courageously picking on Kelly,

467
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,463
'cause you're scared
to take on House.

468
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,988
Congratulations.
You're a real leader.

469
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,232
I am Felipe.

470
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,884
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

471
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:47,004
Dr. House was worried how you
left things. He is giving you massage.

472
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,445
As an admission
he was wrong? Yes.

473
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:54,417
Well, tell him thanks, but I have a
meeting with Dr. Schatz in 20 minutes.

474
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:58,287
He says you would say that,
and to say, "No, you don't."

475
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:01,191
Well, tell him he needs to
stop canceling my appointments,

476
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,194
because I will just
reschedule them.

477
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:06,288
He says you would
say that, and to say,

478
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,731
uh,

479
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,704
"That Dr. Schatz is
a fat, lonely moron

480
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:18,767
"who, in an effort to have
contact with a human female,

481
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:22,940
"makes the same exact complaint
about parking spaces every month,

482
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:27,342
"and you know you have
to stop enabling him."

483
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,689
I have great fingers.

484
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,962
That's so nice.

485
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,526
Thank you.

486
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,035
How long have you
been a masseur?

487
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,736
What is that, "masseur"?

488
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,711
A massage therapist?

489
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,975
Oh.

490
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,983
No, not long.

491
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,384
How did my boyfriend find you?

492
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,649
Boyfriend?

493
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,215
Dr. House.

494
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:09,384
He is your boyfriend?

495
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,221
Why is that surprising?

496
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:16,097
I just mean, if he found me,

497
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,568
I do not think he's
got no girlfriend.

498
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,097
Are you a prostitute?

499
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,369
Are you a cop?

500
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,476
Then no.

501
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,508
Get your hands off me.

502
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,351
I didn't know you smoked.

503
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,051
I don't.

504
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,889
I don't mind screwing up.

505
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,877
I've screwed up in my
life, and I've gotten over it.

506
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:53,339
But I'm not a cheater and I'm
not a liar, and now I feel like both.

507
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:58,043
You're right. I'm sorry.

508
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,074
You work with House, you kind
of get a messed-up perspective

509
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,701
of what's permissible
in the workplace.

510
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,011
Maybe I should just quit.

511
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,783
No. You're smart,
you're hardworking.

512
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,415
Yeah, but I'm not like you guys.

513
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,024
Use what makes you different.

514
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,290
A lot of this job is reading
people, dealing with them.

515
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,865
You're a psychiatrist.
Use your skills.

516
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,551
You okay?

517
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,955
I checked with Trenton General.

518
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,424
There's no support
group for abused women.

519
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:48,619
Maybe it was just...

520
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,562
If she was lying about that,
what else is she lying about?

521
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:56,591
I mean, maybe she wasn't even
abused. Maybe she's a criminal.

522
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,797
Who the hell knows? You
don't know, that's the point.

523
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,137
The way she's acting, that's
the way abuse victims act.

524
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,576
Their personalities are affected
by what they went through.

525
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,113
They find coping mechanisms.

526
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,149
I gotta talk to her
about this Trenton thing.

527
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,415
If you wake her up, make
her feel defensive, it'll go bad.

528
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:19,491
She doesn't need any more
hostility or aggression in her life.

529
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,157
Okay.

530
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:32,069
Seriously? A massage
from a male hooker?

531
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,672
He was?

532
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,207
Huh!

533
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,368
Well, it doesn't
bother me at all.

534
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,140
I guess we both learned
a valuable lesson.

535
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:45,115
Except that I didn't use to
have sex with him, you idiot.

536
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,814
Plus, he was a gay hooker.

537
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,186
Have you any idea how hard it
is to find a straight male hooker?

538
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:56,293
Come on. It's a massage!

539
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,160
I don't care who
gives it to you.

540
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,097
Why not treat me the same way?

541
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,830
I'm sure that some part
of you believes this idiocy,

542
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,331
but you can't possibly be
stupid enough to think that

543
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,603
you can convince any part of me.

544
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,875
And that can only mean you're
trying to sabotage this relationship.

545
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:20,012
Why would I do
that? We're doing fine.

546
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:24,351
Because the next step from fine is
serious. And you can't handle that.

547
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:27,517
So you're trying to keep me at
arm's length with all this crap.

548
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,528
How about you?

549
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,462
I have been completely
open with you.

550
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,194
You won't let me sleep over.

551
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,733
You basically haven't
introduced me to your daughter.

552
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,170
But do you want to
spend time with her?

553
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:46,568
Honestly, before this,
I would have said no.

554
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:53,579
But, yeah, how are we ever gonna be a
couple if you keep hiding her from me?

555
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,486
House.

556
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,388
I need to protect her.

557
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,719
If I let you into her
life and you go away...

558
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:09,928
I can call it what it is.

559
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,199
I'm not the only one
who's holding back.

560
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,446
Hey, baby.

561
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:30,355
I am not getting mad. I'm just
trying to understand you here.

562
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:36,718
But there's no meeting like you
talked about at Trenton General.

563
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:39,060
You see, it turns
out that... Turns out.

564
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:43,262
The turnout. The turnout.
It's been turned. Turning.

565
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,461
What?

566
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,435
Turning. Hey.

567
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,939
<i>The turnout. The turnout.
It's turning.</i> BILLY: Hey.

568
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,884
You're going to burn.

569
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,924
What's happening to her?

570
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,587
It's hit her brain.
Whatever "it" is.

571
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,822
Opacity in the
left temporal lobe.

572
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:44,362
It could be nothing.

573
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:48,025
Which would get us nowhere,
so let's assume it's something.

574
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,328
What kind of something?

575
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,494
Abscess.

576
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,867
Or lymphoma, or Wegener's.

577
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,874
We'd have to biopsy it to be sure. Any
of them could explain all of the symptoms.

578
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,343
You know, we're assuming
everything is connected.

579
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,282
Because it probably is.

580
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,948
But her delusions are
consistent with mental illness.

581
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,851
Bipolar disease, for example.

582
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:12,481
She's 30, it could be hitting
her right now for the first time.

583
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,493
So her mind just happens to
fall apart right after her body?

584
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,188
I thought I was
having a bad week.

585
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,355
I know it sounds
coincidental, but...

586
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,509
You know what, I'm back
to the Cameron theory.

587
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,173
But you hired the dumb
version of Cameron,

588
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,681
so you can fire her
and get revenge...

589
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,602
Give her a break.

590
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,969
What, you switched sides?

591
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,568
Let me guess, Chase represents
the dumb version of Thirteen...

592
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,513
I realized if we all
just keep pressuring

593
00:33:33,537 --> 00:33:35,579
Kelly, of course she's
gonna get stuff wrong.

594
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,149
It's irresponsible of
me to let that happen.

595
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,317
You are a true leader of men.

596
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,481
Get someone to cut into
her head and get me a biopsy.

597
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:04,668
Whoa!

598
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,440
Just say "hold on" next time.

599
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,879
Her temperature's normal.

600
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,042
So what? She was
on the cooling blanket.

601
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,609
We took her off an hour ago.
She should be febrile again.

602
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,753
Tell House one of the patient's
symptoms just disappeared.

603
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,539
Could it be Legionnaires',
and our treatment worked?

604
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,675
I wish, but no, we've been hydrating
her, and there's still no lung involvement.

605
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,691
So relapsing, remitting fever.

606
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:30,929
Malaria, dengue...

607
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,561
Why wasn't she frozen?

608
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:35,703
This morning.

609
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,552
If you put a healthy
person on a cooling blanket,

610
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,272
they'd be chilled like
a fine chardonnay.

611
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,142
She's a nice warm
merlot, 98.6 all day.

612
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,943
I didn't want her to freeze.

613
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:47,315
So you titrated the blanket. As her
fever dropped, you lower the power.

614
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,478
Exactly.

615
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,153
So it's been on the
lowest setting since when?

616
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,588
Yesterday afternoon.

617
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,923
Which means we could have known that
her fever was gone yesterday afternoon.

618
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:01,298
The fever was brief. Sounds
like a reaction to medication.

619
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,834
The antibiotics?
Without vomiting?

620
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,164
When did she last puke?

621
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,000
Not since she was admitted.

622
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:10,741
Two down.

623
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,780
Shooting for three.

624
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,599
You're gonna turn
her pacemaker off?

625
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,254
You sure that's a good idea?

626
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,416
No. But it might be.

627
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,596
No tachycardia.

628
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,699
So only the delusions are
left, if they're even still there.

629
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,536
Maybe it is a bipolar disorder.
She's female, she's 30...

630
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:46,110
It's not a coincidence.
You gotta stop doing this.

631
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,875
But it could've been prompted
by the physical symptoms.

632
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,214
You couldn't be more wrong.

633
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,954
You got the cause
and effect backwards.

634
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,725
Start her on haloperidol
and lorazepam.

635
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,320
Give it a few hours to take
effect. Call me when she awakes.

636
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,807
Still hallucinating.

637
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,372
Can you hear me?

638
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,581
What are you looking at?

639
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,210
The table, it's on fire.

640
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,681
If it was, you think
I'd be able to do this,

641
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,085
without screaming for my mommy?

642
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,716
Thank you.

643
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:39,260
Don't be too impressed. It's
mostly the happy pills you put her on.

644
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,164
But she can talk to us now.

645
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:46,000
The obviously stupid lie you
told us about your hospital records,

646
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,040
it turns out to have been
un-obviously un-stupid.

647
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,369
You thought you
wouldn't get caught,

648
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,878
'cause you thought that
you'd be cured and back home

649
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,540
by the time we spoke
to the other hospital.

650
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,378
Because you knew
what was wrong with you.

651
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,586
Your doctor was treating
you with risperidone, right?

652
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,194
That's why you were in Trenton.

653
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,386
You had the stomach pain, you went
to see him, he wanted you to taper off...

654
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,928
Her doctor's not in Trenton.

655
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,656
Not the one you know about.

656
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,929
If you haven't figured it out
by now, your wife has a secret.

657
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,933
What the hell is
he talking about?

658
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,369
This about your ex?

659
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,431
The ex was not so much
a secret, more of a lie.

660
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,703
You weren't married
before, were you?

661
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:29,504
I'm sorry, I didn't want
you to know about it.

662
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,447
Know about what?

663
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:35,111
She's sick. She's
been sick for years.

664
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,255
Maybe it put you on the streets,

665
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,518
maybe that's where
you got the broken bones.

666
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,919
She's only suffering
from one condition.

667
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,192
Everything else is side effects
of the drug that was treating it.

668
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,928
When she stopped taking
the drug, the side effects faded,

669
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:53,061
but the underlying
disease is still there.

670
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,035
Why don't you tell your husband?

671
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:08,246
Billy, I'm schizophrenic.

672
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,498
That's the kind of
thing that a recent

673
00:38:20,522 --> 00:38:23,330
psychiatric resident
might have figured out.

674
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,468
What the hell am I
supposed to do now?

675
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,515
Nothing. Her physical
symptoms are gone.

676
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,094
We'll put her on a different
anti-psychotic for the mental ones.

677
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:41,484
You can take a nap.

678
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,452
This is not who I married.

679
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,980
Of course she is.
You just didn't know it.

680
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,821
I don't know if I
can stay with her.

681
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,987
Sorry, as your
marriage counselor,

682
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,360
I'm not allowed to talk to
you without your wife present.

683
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:57,663
Just tell me how hard it would
be for us to handle this, medically.

684
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:02,673
Look, if you want me to give
you a reason to leave her, fine.

685
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:03,884
Apparently you haven't noticed,

686
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,672
but she's got a
serious mental illness.

687
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,340
It's too hard.

688
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,248
It's always hard.

689
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,101
Okay, so I made a mistake.

690
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,431
Kelly will make a fine doctor,

691
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:38,101
but she's not
ready for the team.

692
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,311
Up to you.

693
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,873
What? You like her now?

694
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:47,009
Nope. But she got
me to the right answer,

695
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,986
which none of
the rest of you did.

696
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,319
If you want to give her
another shot, go for it.

697
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,355
Okay. I will.

698
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,919
Great.

699
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,794
It'll make it easier for
you to sleep with her.

700
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,397
Come on. Why else
would you have hired her?

701
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,333
That's not why I hired her.

702
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,164
What are you doing?

703
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,434
Got bored with the
porn on my computer.

704
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,945
You got any girl-on-girl-
on-girl-on-vibrating-object-on-girl stuff?

705
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,912
I wouldn't have to do this

706
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,577
if you'd gave me the name of
that physical therapist you like.

707
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,718
You done with Brandi?

708
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,350
Eh...

709
00:40:58,423 --> 00:40:59,789
Knobby hands.

710
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,388
I will get you the name.

711
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,637
Let's stay at my
place tonight, okay?

712
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,399
Will you get cable? No.

713
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,800
Then we'll have
to have more sex.

714
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,394
Okay.

715
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,276
What are you doing?

716
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,274
Quitting before House fires me.

717
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,111
Hold on.

718
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:27,550
We both know he is.

719
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,116
But maybe there's a bright side.

720
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,418
What?

721
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,320
You really looked out for me.

722
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,123
And you seem like
a really good guy.

723
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,803
And I never date anybody
who I work with, but...

724
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:54,142
Yeah. Sorry it didn't work out.

725
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,182
You want to get
dinner tomorrow night?

726
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,929
You want some more meat?

727
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,795
This is meat?

728
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,865
Yes, please.

729
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,652
Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Kid,
come on, come on, come on.

730
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,822
Come on.

731
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,792
Hey, hey.

732
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,904
Aren't you adorable.
