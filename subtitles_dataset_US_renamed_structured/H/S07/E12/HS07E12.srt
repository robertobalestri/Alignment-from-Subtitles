1
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,098
Excuse me, waitress?

2
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:08,470
I'm afraid the teriyaki
chicken's no longer on the menu.

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:12,136
Oh, I'm sorry, that's
what you had last time.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,076
We've never been here before.

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,206
I definitely remember you.

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,522
No, we never get up north.

7
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,143
We're just up to see a friend of
ours who moved here last summer.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,289
Your hair was lighter, you
had little round glasses.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,782
Sounds like you.
Henry, don't play along,

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,624
it's a gimmick for tips.
Could we get some water?

11
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,292
It was last August,
Saturday the 14th.

12
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,145
You were wearing a
blue dress with polka dots,

13
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,070
your eyes were puffy
like you'd been crying.

14
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,235
The 14th is Darren's birthday.

15
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,743
He said he had
to cancel his party

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,210
'cause his old
girlfriend showed up.

17
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,305
They got in a
huge fight. Henry...

18
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,780
I knew it. Damn it.

19
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,444
Ever since that ski trip, when
the two of you disappeared...

20
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,282
I'll go get your water.

21
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,088
Are you all right? Are you okay?

22
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:09,200
I can't move my legs.

23
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,234
Picture a door, unlocked
with the key of the mind.

24
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:50,800
Two medical cases, both
more fascinating than the last.

25
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,142
That actually makes
no logical sense.

26
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,812
This is not a door
to logical sense.

27
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,145
Also, shut up.

28
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:02,054
Case number one:
a 33-year-old woman,

29
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,250
named something
I can't remember,

30
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,453
you'll see the
irony in a second,

31
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,359
presenting with
temporary paralysis,

32
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,525
high CK levels, and
a perfect memory.

33
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,529
How perfect is perfect?

34
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,163
Perfectly perfect.

35
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,435
Hyperthymesia, complete recall

36
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,909
of every moment of
every day since puberty.

37
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,675
All 7,600,049 of them.

38
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,013
That's cool, huh?

39
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,279
One of only a handful
of recorded cases...

40
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:35,618
So we have two symptoms:
temporary leg paralysis and elevated CK.

41
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,922
Obviously, you're not suffering
from the same condition,

42
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,427
'cause you've already
forgotten my dramatic voice over.

43
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:41,551
There's a third symptom.

44
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,628
Her memory's unrelated.

45
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,597
Why? It's a strange
medical phenomenon...

46
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,099
Hyperthymesia's known
to manifest in adolescence.

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,465
Yeah, in the whole
five documented cases.

48
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,368
To be related, it'd mean
20 years between symptoms.

49
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,908
Plus, I don't know of any
diseases that cause great memory,

50
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,773
only ones that destroy it.

51
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,607
MRIs show no
evidence of a stroke

52
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,307
or tumors, so probably a toxin.

53
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,714
She's a waitress. They're no
strangers to botulism or alcoholism.

54
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,719
We should search the
diner and where she lives.

55
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,049
Or you could search her brain.

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,147
You know, where her
memory lives, and save the gas.

57
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:13,227
You two, check her home, you
two, get a complete patient history.

58
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,626
We'll see who
gets an answer first.

59
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,064
You said there
was a second case.

60
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,059
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

61
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,298
The case of the
45-year-old doctor

62
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,775
who just failed his pathology
re-certification exam

63
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,939
is going to lose his board
certification and get fired.

64
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,225
How did you fail it? You
spend half your life in the lab.

65
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:40,084
I was recovering from the flu. I'm
retaking it next week. It's not an issue.

66
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,452
Normally, I'd let
Darwinism run its course

67
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,958
but Cuddy's in a big tizzy about
her poster boy getting canned.

68
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,291
So, how are we gonna get
the short guy off the short bus?

69
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,973
What about a tutor?
I don't need a tutor.

70
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,262
Tutor it is. Choose your poison.

71
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,928
Chase, if you prefer
pounding Aussie beers

72
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,301
and commiserating over
the suckiness of divorce.

73
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,170
Masters, if you want
nervous energy, flash cards,

74
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,005
and obnoxious
pieces of arcane trivia.

75
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,770
Foreman, if you need to be
berated by a humorless hardass.

76
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,173
Foreman. HOUSE: Interesting.

77
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,316
You must be more
worried than you look.

78
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,518
Need a consult, Dr. Wilson.

79
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,596
So, call me in a
week if it still itches.

80
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,662
Thank you.

81
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,427
And be sure to give
Sarah a kiss for me.

82
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,798
Will do.

83
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,529
Who's Sarah?

84
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,129
Her granddaughter, I think?

85
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,004
Early stages of dementia.
What's the consult?

86
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,269
I need your medical opinion,

87
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,642
on what bar we're gonna
hit for happy hour tonight

88
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:42,171
to kick-off the official end to your
three-month pity-party over Sam.

89
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,807
I can't tonight.

90
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:44,977
Because of Sarah?

91
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,215
Yes, because of my senile patient's
granddaughter, you caught me.

92
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,653
I'm busy.

93
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,726
Who's Sarah? Wilson's friend?

94
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,833
My computer crashed. Lost my
database of his acquaintances.

95
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,065
Or you're both lying to me.

96
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,971
I know nothing about Wilson
having a friend named Sarah.

97
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,408
Satisfied?

98
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,278
Ooh!

99
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,712
What are the eight
types of vomitus?

100
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,483
I can show you four right now if
you ask me one more review question.

101
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,821
Hey, you picked me and you
said you wanted a hardass.

102
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,655
No, House said that,

103
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,571
and I pretended to agree
to get him off my back.

104
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,587
I picked you because
I wanted the guy

105
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,189
who doesn't like getting involved
in other people's problems.

106
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,644
I guess I thought
you'd want to skip

107
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,035
the massive public
humiliation of getting fired.

108
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,571
By treating me
like I'm an imbecile?

109
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,370
I'm totally fine. I aced
my first pathology boards.

110
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,604
Medicine has come a long
way in the last 100 years.

111
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,410
You know, I heard of
a guy who knew a guy

112
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,043
who could get the
exam ahead of time.

113
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,281
It was something I heard.

114
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,858
Patient's file said she lost
some weight on a new diet, right?

115
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,325
Yeah, she went vegan.

116
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,918
Are laxatives vegan?

117
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,392
Hello? FOREMAN: <i>Where are you?</i>

118
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,597
In the parking garage,
searching Wilson's car.

119
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,036
We have an answer,
magnesium poisoning.

120
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,269
<i>We found a pretty
large stash of laxatives.</i>

121
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,141
<i>Abuse can lead to
hypermagnesemia.</i>

122
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:22,410
I admit, that's impressively
outside-the-box thinking.

123
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,747
<i>House?</i>

124
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,918
<i>You still there, House?</i>

125
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,422
<i>Everything okay?</i>

126
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:42,561
No. For a second, I thought
Wilson might have a drug problem.

127
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,862
<i>Turns out it's much, much worse.</i>

128
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,906
Okay... So we push fluids

129
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,021
<i>and wait for her kidneys to
clear the hypermagnesemia?</i>

130
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,640
You'll be waiting a long time
since that's not what she has.

131
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,717
<i>Her BP and respiratory
rate are normal.</i>

132
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,582
While you two were so busy
being impressively outside the box,

133
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,554
<i>you missed the actual box.</i>

134
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,652
Chase and Masters done yet?

135
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,424
Two light beers November 16th,

136
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,887
one really bad glass
of pinot on the 17th,

137
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,558
nothing from the 18th...

138
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,829
Shouldn't you be working
for NASA or something?

139
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,495
You mean, why
am I just a waitress?

140
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,636
No, I didn't mean...

141
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,798
I'm sorry I...

142
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,243
It's okay.

143
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,678
Remembering something is
not the same as understanding it.

144
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,180
I'm not a genius.

145
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,112
I love my job. I'm great at
it. It keeps my mind busy.

146
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,482
Hi, I'm Dr. House,
and you're not pooping.

147
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,196
Question is, are
you also a klutz?

148
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,125
I guess I'm no clumsier
than most people...

149
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,433
What are you guessing for?
You've got a perfect memory.

150
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,167
I was told there'd be
numbers, dates, fireworks.

151
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,667
What do you want to
know? Let's go back to 2008.

152
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,948
How many trips, stumbles,
falls did you have?

153
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,711
Eleven.

154
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,847
This really works. Cool.

155
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,058
How about 2009?

156
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,121
Twelve.

157
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,390
Even cooler. Last year?

158
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,292
Twenty.

159
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,895
That's a big spike
in dyscoordination.

160
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,870
If you add constipation,
it's early onset Parkinson's.

161
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,075
Give her a full neuro-exam
and start her on levodopa.

162
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,886
I'm so surprised you broke into
my apartment without telling me.

163
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:40,986
What is this?

164
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,181
An intervention.

165
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:45,153
Exhibit A: a baggie filled

166
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,389
with <i>Nepeta cataria,</i>
also known as...

167
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,259
That better not
be what I think it is.

168
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,764
If you mean your new
junkie girlfriend, then yes.

169
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,993
House...

170
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,933
Okay, fine, I got a cat.
Release the Kraken.

171
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,566
I don't think you appreciate
the severity of your situation.

172
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,907
You're rapidly approaching
end-stage male spinsterism.

173
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,609
That cat, that diabetic cat, that
you're shooting up with insulin

174
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,845
and buying dime
bags of catnip for,

175
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,751
that means you've given
up on ever finding anyone.

176
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,347
Don't you think you're
completely overreacting?

177
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,621
If I'm completely overreacting,
why'd you lie to me?

178
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,629
Because I knew you'd
completely overreact.

179
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,720
Its name is Sarah.

180
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,793
Cats aren't named that, women
are. What the Freud is that about?

181
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,966
Look, I didn't name her, my
neighbor did. She died and I felt bad.

182
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,766
Sarah would've been
destroyed at the shelter.

183
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,838
Who wouldn't want
a cat that croaks

184
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,744
if you're not home twice
a day to shoot it up?

185
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,807
It's like having your
own button on <i>Lost.</i>

186
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:49,048
You know, I'm pretty
sure there's a river nearby.

187
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,019
I'm keeping her.

188
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,691
Okay, shrug your shoulders
and don't let me push them down.

189
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,534
So, I have to ask, is
there a trick you use?

190
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,005
Mnemonics, meditation?

191
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,405
No. No tricks.

192
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,872
I don't even try,
really. It's just there.

193
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:17,083
Is my memory going to go
away with the Parkinson's?

194
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,379
It's quite possible.

195
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,895
But we still have
a lot of tests to do

196
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,363
before we have a
definitive diagnosis.

197
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,253
Well, here's hoping for cancer.

198
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,489
Nadia?

199
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,425
Your boss called me.

200
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,829
Sorry, I'm Elena,
Nadia's older sister.

201
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,898
You don't have to be here.

202
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,570
But I'd like to pretend you'd
visit me if I were in a hospital.

203
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,307
You brought daisies.

204
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,393
They're your favorite. No,
they're my least favorite.

205
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,613
I was stung in the
face six times by...

206
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,019
Oh, God. What's wrong?

207
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,058
My heart...

208
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,117
Fast, wide-complex
rhythm. Get the paddles.

209
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,643
Cardiac involvement
rules out Parkinson's.

210
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,865
So we're back to transient paralysis
and high CK, plus arrhythmia.

211
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,997
Masters, when you finally
blossom into a woman,

212
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,851
would you ever sleep
with a man who had a cat?

213
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,537
Sure.

214
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,273
Wrong, the answer is "no."

215
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,541
Slut.

216
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,273
Any of you ever had a cat?

217
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,552
Any of you ever had sex?

218
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,219
I think as your people say,
<i>"Quod erat demonstrandum."</i>

219
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,624
An excess of catecholamine
could set off an arrhythmia.

220
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,271
It's not a pheo, her
blood pressure is fine.

221
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,695
Maybe we're missing the obvious.

222
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,231
The heart could be
behind everything.

223
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,894
If it's not pumping effectively,
the muscles shut down,

224
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,062
CK elevates,
coordination suffers.

225
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,469
Why are you asking about cats?

226
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,698
Curiosity.

227
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,902
Can we focus here?

228
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,042
Her heart problem started
when Nadia saw her sister.

229
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:58,551
Stress-induced arrhythmia could
be caused by long QT syndrome.

230
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,458
Her sister was barely
in the room five minutes.

231
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,615
She said they'd been estranged for
over six years. That's a lot of tension.

232
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,783
Run a stress test
to confirm long QT.

233
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,360
It'll have to be drug-induced,

234
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,704
a treadmill would
pull her stitches.

235
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,594
Drugs are never the answer.

236
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,097
We want her heart to go crazy,

237
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,565
there's something
simpler and safer.

238
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,629
Use the sister.

239
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,471
You lied to me.

240
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,510
No, I said I didn't
know anything about

241
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,311
Wilson having a
friend named Sarah.

242
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,578
Under House
rules, that's not a lie.

243
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,152
He's lonely.

244
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,167
The cat's a nice way for
him to get some affection.

245
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,401
That's not the kind of puddy tat

246
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,665
he needs to be getting it from.

247
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,252
He needs the
puddy tat he can tap.

248
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,921
Why is this so important to you?

249
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,760
After divorce number two,

250
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,166
he fell into a committed relationship
with a three-legged Siamese,

251
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,673
stopped answering his phone and
redecorated his place like <i>Gray Gardens.</i>

252
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,251
He wasn't able to
come back to humanity

253
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,042
until a window was left,
suspiciously and heroically, open.

254
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,279
How that cat opened the
window, I will never know.

255
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,010
He just needs more time.

256
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,079
Leave him and the cat alone.

257
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,456
I won't if you will.

258
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,395
Sorry about the daisies.

259
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,590
I always get it confused
if you love or hate them.

260
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:19,975
Do you want to know
exactly how many times

261
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,365
I've told you that I hate them?

262
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,800
I didn't do it on purpose.

263
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,405
Her heart rate isn't moving.

264
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,567
The sister stress
pot needs stirring.

265
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,408
You want me to start a fight?

266
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,711
No. Just agitate a little.

267
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,147
Use something from the history.

268
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,376
You're not lying to them.

269
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,560
In fact, you'd be
telling the truth

270
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,109
and serving their medical needs.

271
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,856
You haven't seen each
other in a while, huh?

272
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,028
I heard the story about the
time you hit Nadia with the car.

273
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,435
That must have
been pretty scary.

274
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,273
Why would you tell them that?

275
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,039
They asked about broken bones.

276
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,755
I swear that I
checked my mirrors.

277
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,008
You know that's a lie.

278
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,278
You knew I was getting the mail

279
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,478
and you just didn't
care enough to check.

280
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,613
Just like you didn't care that
you ruined my 23rd birthday...

281
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,712
Nadia, don't start.

282
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,657
You started it by coming here
and acting like you give a crap.

283
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:22,560
Here we go again! I'm such a
monster because I brought daisies!

284
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:25,808
You need to leave right now.

285
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:26,856
Is she going to be okay?

286
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,559
Elena, get out!

287
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,236
You said you'd be 10 minutes.

288
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,042
I couldn't decide on the cheese.

289
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,677
When are you getting an
apartment? Or at least a storage room?

290
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,250
I'll get to it. I like it here.

291
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,755
They have Video on Demand.

292
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,531
I pulled a practice test
I hate practice tests.

293
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,289
Hey, I never saw
<i>The Usual Suspects,</i>

294
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,505
you want to check it
out before we start?

295
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,259
What are you doing?
You've got three days.

296
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,730
Why is everyone's
first assumption

297
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,165
I'm going to fail
this stupid test?

298
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,429
Maybe because you did?

299
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,164
I was recovering from the flu.

300
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,877
I don't care if you
were dying from Ebola,

301
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,635
you shouldn't have
gotten less than a 70.

302
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,460
You're nothing but
excuses and distractions.

303
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:13,377
Well, it's a nice match with your
condescension and superiority.

304
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,810
Enjoy the movie.

305
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,216
Kevin Spacey is Keyser Söze.

306
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,300
How is she?

307
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,629
We've started her
on a beta blocker,

308
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,640
it should keep her heart
rhythm under control.

309
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,567
She'll be fine while
we run more tests.

310
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,635
Did you hear she
banned me from her room?

311
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,608
I know I'm not
perfect, but she's...

312
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,676
She can be such a bitch.

313
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,279
She never, ever,
ever lets anything go.

314
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,829
Tell Nadia she doesn't need
to worry about seeing me again.

315
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,196
I started the fight.

316
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:12,372
We needed her heart rate
to rise, so I provoked you.

317
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,638
You can't play
with people like that.

318
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,492
Maybe if I explained to Nadia...

319
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,946
No, it doesn't matter.

320
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,143
It's just one more fight
for her to remember.

321
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,249
Guess you're both bitches.

322
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,696
Masters.

323
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,567
Smell her breath. Breathe out.

324
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,111
Ammonia.

325
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,511
What is it?

326
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,940
I think your kidneys
are shutting down.

327
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,284
Failing kidneys puts the heart
back on the list as a symptom.

328
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,667
Maybe she went vegan because
she lost the taste for protein.

329
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,954
Could be amyloidosis.

330
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,358
We would have seen a stiff
heart on the nuclear study.

331
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,397
But autoimmune could account for

332
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,399
multiple organ
systems and paralysis.

333
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,595
There are a number that'd fit:
Guillain-Barre, polymyositis...

334
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,069
MS, polyarteritis nodosa...

335
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,197
SLE.

336
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,560
Why are you giving me these?

337
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,043
'Cause while they're off
running all these tests,

338
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,807
you'll be submitting
the insurance forms.

339
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,323
There's an entire
department for that.

340
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,815
Exactly, the Foreman Department.

341
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,714
Of which you're the
foreman, Foreman.

342
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,062
I know you've got the time,
since a little wallaby told me

343
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,612
that you recently vacated
your post as Taub's savior.

344
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,816
He asked. You're
worse than Masters.

345
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,602
How's this my fault?
He doesn't need a tutor,

346
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,322
he needs Ritalin
and a babysitter.

347
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,296
Consider the forms incentive.

348
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,161
If Taub doesn't pass,

349
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,098
they will become a
permanent part of your life.

350
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,496
This isn't really about
Cuddy, is it? It's about you.

351
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,236
You don't want to lose me.

352
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,179
I think you care.

353
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,611
You don't think
you can disgust me

354
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:08,882
into pulling Foreman off you.

355
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,082
Pulse the patient with
steroids for the autoimmune

356
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,216
and start her on dialysis
for the kidney failure.

357
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:17,559
Treat the Taub with insults
and small slaps for the obstinacy

358
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,656
and start him on studying
for the brain failure.

359
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,506
No, that's not gonna work.
I have a haircut at 4:00.

360
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,835
I'll be in the... I'll be in the
office in about 20 minutes.

361
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,848
Yeah, okay.

362
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,396
You planted something
in my apartment

363
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,197
to make me think
I'm allergic to Sarah.

364
00:18:57,203 --> 00:19:01,299
Paranoia is the first sign
of <i>Toxoplasma gondii,</i>

365
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,399
the parasite linked to
crazy cat lady disease.

366
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,476
I'm not paranoid.

367
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:08,275
I'm allergic to ragweed and
dandelion. I am not allergic to cats.

368
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,458
You're trying to gaslight me.

369
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,110
Maybe your subconscious

370
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:13,118
is afraid that you're
gonna die alone,

371
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,155
and it just comes out as
gibberish and sneezing.

372
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,619
Prove that I'm
overreacting. Boy's night out.

373
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,853
Good Time Charlie's.

374
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,826
They just changed
their slogan to

375
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,057
"Where the trashiest
ladies get trashed."

376
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,327
You do see the hypocrisy
in all this, don't you?

377
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,301
Until recently your lifestyle
of choice was self-exile.

378
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,167
But I never had a cat.

379
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,973
Why don't you
pick me up at 8:00?

380
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,973
You're gonna need
another round of steroids.

381
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,212
In the meantime,
we'll start your dialysis.

382
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,984
So I heard Elena
won't be coming back.

383
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,717
You think I was too hard on her?

384
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,821
We all hold our grudges...

385
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,660
It's not a grudge.

386
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,496
It's common sense,
it's simple math.

387
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,195
She's hurt me more
than she's helped me.

388
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,536
Most people edit their memories.

389
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:09,302
They add small little lies so
they don't have to face the truth.

390
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,644
My memories remain the same.

391
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:15,239
My truth never changes
because my truth is the truth.

392
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,917
So no one ever gets forgiven?

393
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,717
Sounds like a
lonely way to live.

394
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:27,692
No, I do forgive, as long as the
good things they do outweigh the...

395
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,256
I can't... I can't breathe.

396
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,105
Huh.

397
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,376
What? Nothing.

398
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,715
I just always pictured
your place with shag carpet.

399
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,985
Like kind of a <i>Mod Squad</i> vibe.

400
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,823
Not because of the black thing.

401
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,227
I always thought you
were more of a Pete...

402
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,206
You're limited to this room
and Marcus's old room.

403
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,254
Where's Marcus?

404
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,331
He tells me he's working
with our uncle in Florida.

405
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,457
He tells you?

406
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,933
You don't look at
or touch anything

407
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,682
that doesn't belong
to you, including food.

408
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:13,429
You will study
and you will sleep.

409
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,270
You will not leave my
sight until the exam.

410
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,810
Great. I'll be back bright and
early tomorrow and we can...

411
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,074
This is no longer just about
your future, it's about mine, too.

412
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,580
You fail, and I will kill you.

413
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,584
Respiratory distress means we
were wrong about autoimmune.

414
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,956
Could be pulmonary
oedema from the renal failure.

415
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,432
Pulmonary oedema
doesn't give you hives.

416
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,626
You think this is
an allergic reaction?

417
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,499
It can't be, we pumped
her full of steroids.

418
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,335
It can be if it was a
really, really bad one.

419
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,560
I have good news and bad news.

420
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,987
Good news is, I
was right about you

421
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:15,000
having some autoimmune disease.

422
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,797
You're just allergic
to the dialysis.

423
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,137
But if I can't have dialysis
and my kidneys are failing,

424
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,703
won't that mean I'll die?

425
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,141
Well, you figured
out the bad news.

426
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:33,909
What do we do?

427
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,477
We look for another case.

428
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,932
Even if we're right
about autoimmune,

429
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,424
we now don't have
time to prove it.

430
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,302
The transplant board will
never give her a kidney.

431
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,057
Maybe we could go around
them? Get a relative to donate.

432
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,186
Which relative?

433
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,541
The sister who walked away and
told you she was never coming back?

434
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,726
We caused this, you know.

435
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,411
They were estranged,
but we made it worse.

436
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,337
That relationship was broken
long before we got there.

437
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,740
Nadia literally keeps
score. She tallies everything.

438
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,402
She decided Elena's done
more bad things to her than good.

439
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,979
Doesn't deserve her affection.

440
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,105
I'm sure she's right.

441
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,385
Unlike everybody
else in the world,

442
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,115
her memory seems
to let her keep a pure,

443
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,748
objective view of
people and relationships.

444
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,918
There's no petty emotions or
agendas fogging the windshield.

445
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,222
Why's that so wrong?

446
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,094
Because it's making her die
alone of kidney failure in Room 205?

447
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,963
Not necessarily. Nadia's
sister is not like her.

448
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,764
I'm sure she's got plenty of
subjective emotions we can exploit.

449
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,270
Why don't you go
channel your guilt,

450
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,103
see if you can get her
to cough up a kidney?

451
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,641
Me?

452
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,853
I'm not good at that type of
thing. Someone else should go.

453
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,210
Someone else
didn't screw this up.

454
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,713
I didn't...

455
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,773
You were just
obeying orders, right?

456
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,146
Go fix this.

457
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,221
I didn't mean to
make you hate her.

458
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:52,561
And now that her
kidneys have failed...

459
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,794
I've always been a book
and equations person.

460
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:03,001
People are problematic
and random and messy,

461
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,408
and with sisters,

462
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,640
I mean, I had a cousin
who I was close to

463
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,344
and when our menstrual
cycles synched,

464
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,317
it was like gladiator school...

465
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,413
Do you want me to donate
a kidney to my sister?

466
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:20,253
Yes.

467
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,655
Okay.

468
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,761
Really? It might not
fix your relationship.

469
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,169
Probably shouldn't
have said that.

470
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,903
Your left. On your left!

471
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,463
Stop whining already.

472
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,597
I was getting a sniper.

473
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,052
Five minutes left in the break.

474
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,307
But the next level is just
past the cooling tanks.

475
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,937
That was the deal. We take
this break, you do a practice test.

476
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,782
I didn't have the flu.

477
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,982
I just choked.

478
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,691
You make life and death
decisions every day.

479
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,333
You work for House.

480
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,437
You're under constant
pressure and you never choke.

481
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:12,343
I got a perfect score on
my first pathology boards.

482
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,615
I kept thinking whatever
my score is now,

483
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,780
it's going to be a
measure of the distance

484
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,788
between me and
the man I used to be.

485
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:25,314
You gotta stop
psyching yourself out.

486
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:30,329
Well, the last test was before
I lost my wife and my home.

487
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:33,491
So I'm sure the next
one will go much better.

488
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,174
Sometimes I wake up
in the middle of the night,

489
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,411
and I can't sleep
for hours because

490
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,385
I'm worried I got
the diagnosis wrong.

491
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,158
These things work out.

492
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,235
We found a donor.

493
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,496
It's your sister.

494
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,403
Just thought you should know.

495
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,867
Nadia, can you hear me?

496
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,556
You're coming out
of your anesthesia,

497
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,980
you're going to
feel a bit groggy.

498
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,748
You did great.
Everything's looking good.

499
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,988
Nadia? Come on
now, open your eyes.

500
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:13,260
Get me three milligrams of lorazepam,
and I'm going to need suction.

501
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,602
Seizures mean the
steroids aren't working.

502
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,642
And we got the tests back. We
were wrong, it's not autoimmune.

503
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,041
Could be acute porphyria.

504
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,703
No abdominal pain.

505
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,304
Did the patient
thank her sister?

506
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,808
No, not yet at least.

507
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,012
See if she will.

508
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,163
What are you trying to find out?

509
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,348
If she's telling the truth.

510
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,289
She claims she
objectively sees reality,

511
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:40,849
weighing the good
and bad in people.

512
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,723
If that's true, I don't
care how many times

513
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,354
her sister borrowed her
scrunchy without asking.

514
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,490
The free kidney ought
to trump all the bad stuff.

515
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:48,693
And if it doesn't?

516
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:51,027
Then she sucks
like the rest of us.

517
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,547
We haven't considered her blood.

518
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:55,040
Clots could hit her leg,
heart, kidney and brain.

519
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,304
Factor V Leiden: easiest
to treat if we're right.

520
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:01,643
Start her on heparin.
And ask for the thank you.

521
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:06,918
How did I do?

522
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:08,746
Great.

523
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,382
Great? How great?
How many did I miss?

524
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,483
It's not about the
numbers. Don't...

525
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,028
Fifty-four percent?

526
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,563
They make the practice tests
harder than the actual exam.

527
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:21,031
Oh, my God, now I'm
choking in your living room.

528
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,397
This isn't going to work.

529
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,662
Who are you calling?

530
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,671
I found the guy. He can
sell me a copy of the test.

531
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,240
I know it's cheating,
and I suck as a person,

532
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,506
but the test is
tomorrow morning.

533
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,276
It's not about the cheating,
it's about your confidence.

534
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,301
You steal that test and
you'll never get it back.

535
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,650
I can't handle failing at
one more thing in my life.

536
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,992
You're a good doctor.

537
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,336
I've seen what
you're capable of.

538
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,488
You're fast, you're
decisive, and you're bold.

539
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,589
Those are not the qualities of
someone who needs to steal a test.

540
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,565
There's nothing on it
you don't already know,

541
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,033
you just need to
know you know it.

542
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,432
Keep talking.

543
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,497
We need you on the team.

544
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,033
So we're gonna sit here
and take another practice test,

545
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,568
and we're gonna keep taking
them until you've kicked its ass.

546
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,044
You can do this. You feel me?

547
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,675
Yeah!

548
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,363
I feel like we just buried
a hooker in the desert.

549
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,618
There'll definitely
be another time

550
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:38,235
to rise up and
turn things around.

551
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,608
You'll come back from it.

552
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:40,941
Next time.

553
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,254
How're you feeling?

554
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,651
Not any better.

555
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,994
It will take some time
for the clots to resolve.

556
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,333
Your sister's recovering well.

557
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:05,832
If you're really adding
up the good and bad...

558
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:10,800
Can I see her?

559
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:18,075
Too fat. Too thin.
Too desperate.

560
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,118
Not desperate enough.

561
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:23,418
Come on, you can
insult them, too.

562
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,956
I'd rather not.

563
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,857
If you objectify them now,
you'll feel more comfortable

564
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,418
when you tie them to a
table in your basement later.

565
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,331
Or whatever.

566
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,460
Okay.

567
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,200
Too armpit-fatty?

568
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,103
Whoa. Too hot.

569
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:45,675
I actually know her. She's the
new barista at my coffee shop.

570
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,439
She's getting her
masters in finance.

571
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,946
Brains and boobs.

572
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,073
The mother lode.

573
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,639
Total moron as
a barista, though.

574
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:54,050
Every drink I order, ends
up with whipped cream on it.

575
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,916
Even when I say, "No whip."

576
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,479
Girlfriend, that
means she's into you.

577
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,554
Okay.

578
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,128
"Hi, there.

579
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,332
"Wilson, James Wilson.

580
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,464
"I'm a doctor.

581
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,802
"Hoping that's enough to close,

582
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,706
"but I'm also a social moron.

583
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,209
"And I have a cat."

584
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,423
She said my coffee
is not the only thing

585
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,825
she'd like to put
whipped cream on.

586
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,763
But is she interested?

587
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,038
Oh, my God.

588
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,435
Bartender! Champagne
for everyone!

589
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:08,959
Hi.

590
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,027
Hi.

591
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:15,593
Thank you for saving my life.

592
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,266
I love you, you know.

593
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,674
I was thinking about those times

594
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:27,577
we went up to Spofford
Lake in the summer.

595
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,725
Whenever we took out the canoe,

596
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,775
you'd tie up my
life vest for me.

597
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,695
And in the afternoons,
you'd sneak me

598
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,712
into the lodge so we
could steal popsicles.

599
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:42,627
Maybe we could go back.

600
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:44,855
I could drive us up there.

601
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,094
We could get a cabin,
and maybe rent a canoe.

602
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,628
Wow, I haven't
thought of Spofford in...

603
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,802
Nadia, are you okay?

604
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,976
Elena, I'm sorry.
I can't do this!

605
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:21,062
Can you stop? Just stop
pushing me for a minute.

606
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,473
I understand now why you
stuck yourself in that diner,

607
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,169
away from friends,
away from family.

608
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,573
You can't forgive anyone.

609
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:39,341
I don't think you
weigh anything.

610
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,249
I think you're like
a lot of people,

611
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,950
you focus on the bad
memories instead of the good.

612
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,293
I don't have a choice.

613
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,192
Nadia, put your hand
in your lap for a moment.

614
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,063
I'm not doing that.

615
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,138
I know.

616
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,775
It's an involuntary
movement called chorea.

617
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,333
What does it mean?

618
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,140
It means we still don't
know what's wrong with you.

619
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,958
Thank you.

620
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:28,026
Do you know if that OR
nurse that Wilson liked

621
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,068
ever broke up
with her boyfriend?

622
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:32,001
I thought your Wilson
fetish was over.

623
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,005
I'm putting together
a second string

624
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,735
in case things don't go well
with the well-breasted barista.

625
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,909
You've got to let
that guy alone.

626
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,343
He's not supposed to be alone.

627
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,208
Is that what this is about?

628
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:47,377
You feel guilty because Wilson's
the one that's alone and not you?

629
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,511
You still don't think
you deserve this.

630
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,819
Have you met me?

631
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,989
Your happiness
doesn't take his away.

632
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:57,728
It's okay to enjoy it.

633
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:05,760
Yeah?

634
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,066
Chorea. Rules out
the clotting disorder.

635
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,350
It means we're
back to square one.

636
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,652
If it's hit her brain, that could
mean she doesn't have long.

637
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:15,204
So then the question becomes,
"Will the sister show up at the funeral?"

638
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,543
She tried to reconcile.

639
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,244
But the bad memories crowded
out the good and she ran.

640
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,751
Nobody's perfect.

641
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,184
<i>What else?</i>

642
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,855
<i>Come on, the woman has
all the information we need,</i>

643
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,292
she's a bottomless
diagnostic library.

644
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,731
Maybe we're missing something
from the apartment, some lifestyle thing.

645
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,359
Yeah, it's all muscle strain from
doing her hundreds of jigsaw puzzles.

646
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,412
<i>We should do another MRI.
A brain hemorrhage would...</i>

647
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,895
Hey, how many puzzles?

648
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,374
Okay, I was exaggerating dozens.

649
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,147
Do a peripheral blood
smear, look for acanthocytes.

650
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,272
I'll be right in.

651
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,388
Remember me?

652
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,381
Just kidding.

653
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,488
So, jigsaw puzzles.

654
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,121
I find them calming.

655
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,133
You ever left one unfinished?

656
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,793
No, that would drive me crazy.

657
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,629
Speaking of...

658
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,137
Why are you doing that?

659
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,658
More important
question is, why are you?

660
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,682
It's just a habit.

661
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:30,814
It's a habit that compels you in
an obsessive way that's so bad

662
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:31,922
it's a disorder.

663
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,185
I don't have OCD.

664
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,920
Each brain with OCD has
its own way of filtering it.

665
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,691
Some people wash their
hands and hoard <i>TV Guides,</i>

666
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:41,323
you do puzzles and
hoard memories.

667
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:45,501
So what we thought was a gift,

668
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,463
was just you literally
obsessing over your own life.

669
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,540
That's why I can't stop the
memories even when I try.

670
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,511
But everything
else? My kidneys...

671
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:03,850
Your memory was a symptom
of a symptom of a larger disease.

672
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:06,618
You have McLeod's syndrome.
It's a rare genetic disorder

673
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:11,629
that affects the nervous
system, blood and can cause

674
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,462
OCD.

675
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,629
Am I gonna die?

676
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,366
It can't be cured.

677
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:25,205
But your various symptoms
can be managed with medication.

678
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,040
Best case scenario, you
can live another 20 years.

679
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:42,084
If it's any solace,
everybody dies alone.

680
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,525
Probably isn't.

681
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,210
How'd it go?

682
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,514
Well, it's hard to choke when
you have all the answers.

683
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,676
Look at it this way, it's better
to suck at taking one test

684
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,482
than to suck at
saving people's lives.

685
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,679
Wow!

686
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,988
Rachel thought it was too big,
and I can't keep it in my hotel room.

687
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,584
You're giving it to me?

688
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,693
I couldn't stand
the thought of you

689
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,323
having company
over with that other TV.

690
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,163
It's embarrassing.

691
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,599
Thanks.

692
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,506
Thank you.

693
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:39,275
Hey, look. I have the room.

694
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,052
You could stay if you wanted to.

695
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,351
Just until you find
your new place.

696
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:47,084
Who else am I gonna
play <i>SavageScape</i> with?

697
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,721
We could do that online
from separate houses.

698
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,261
Will you shut up?

699
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,692
Okay.

700
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,503
How're you feeling?

701
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,908
Much better.

702
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:10,214
I don't believe what House said.

703
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,283
I'm not sure even House
believes it anymore.

704
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:19,050
You said you didn't have a
choice to be the way you are.

705
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,225
Now you do.

706
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:25,989
These are SSRIs. They've
been effective in treating OCD.

707
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,463
You mean lose my memory?

708
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,558
Not lose it entirely, it'll just
become more like anyone else's.

709
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:34,770
My memory

710
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:41,002
is the only thing that has
ever made me special.

711
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,112
Maybe so.

712
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:49,681
But if you want to be special,
you're going to have to be alone.

713
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:11,836
Hey!

714
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,791
Hey. Hey!

715
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,591
Those are for Sarah.

716
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:33,791
Are they poisoned?

717
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,969
You and your paranoia.

718
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,864
Now, if you'll excuse me,

719
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:47,205
I really should find a better
place to store my ragweed.

720
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,446
It's a very nice gesture,
but it's still in the apartment.

721
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:13,071
So, I want to hear all the
dirty, dairy-specific details

722
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:15,003
of your night
with Java the Slut.

723
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:19,476
All right. First
of all, all real.

724
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:26,477
Second, a true connoisseur
of the dark arts of...

725
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,255
I flaked. I walked her to
her car and said good night.

726
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:38,023
I will get back into it. You just
need to give me a little more time.

727
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,072
I'll give you 10 days.

728
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,738
Fine.

729
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,112
Ew!
