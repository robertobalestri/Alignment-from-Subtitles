1
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,228
BÃ¡jalo. Get him down!

2
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,296
What have you got
against chickens?

3
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,399
One got choked last
night, thanks to you.

4
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,570
33-year-old male with
haemoptysis, fever.

5
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,908
We can't even talk about it?

6
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,144
If you can't apologize, we
can't talk. And puncture wounds.

7
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,845
I'm not apologizing
for doing the right thing.

8
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,114
Lying to me was
not the right thing.

9
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,987
Puncture wounds
are from a crucifixion.

10
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,362
I lied to save
my patient's life.

11
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,764
I didn't lie to you,
I lied to my boss.

12
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,299
Either of those
arguments working yet?

13
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,276
Guess that means I don't have
to go to the wedding on Saturday.

14
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,641
The hospital's
chairman of the board?

15
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,511
I'm not gonna stand him
up and neither are you.

16
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,482
I loathe weddings and their
seven levels of hypocrisy.

17
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,519
But you do seem awfully hissy,

18
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,919
and there's an outside chance
I can get you drunk and score.

19
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,229
So as long as you don't
take it as an admission of guilt,

20
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,454
sure, count me in.

21
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,195
Bit too much honesty?

22
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,992
You're also going to the
rehearsal dinner Friday night.

23
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,592
Dressy casual.

24
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,600
House-keeping.

25
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,843
Either you're crazy or you're
atoning for something naughty.

26
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,646
And you're crazy.

27
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,614
He's a doctor.

28
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,313
I'm not atoning for anything.

29
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,315
That answers that, thanks.

30
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:19,849
My Marisa was diagnosed with terminal
brain cancer, stage IV glioblastoma.

31
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,628
When the doctors said
she had two months to live,

32
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,859
that's when I made my bargain.

33
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,464
With your health
insurance carrier?

34
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,397
With God.

35
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,537
Oh!

36
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,372
I told him I would nail myself to a
cross every year he kept her alive.

37
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,289
So how did that negotiation go?

38
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,972
You lowballed with ear
piercing and God countered?

39
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:44,307
Three weeks later, she was
cancer-free. That was four years ago.

40
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,819
Pontius Pilate,
misunderstood oncologist.

41
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,186
Yeah. My ex-wife
thinks I'm crazy, too.

42
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,985
She moved out the
first time I did this.

43
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,318
At least your daughter
has one viable role model.

44
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,392
You don't believe in God?
- I did.

45
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,090
Then I grew my curly hairs.

46
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,744
So how do you think I was cured?

47
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,862
Maybe you were
misdiagnosed in the first place.

48
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:07,271
You have your answer,
Doctors. We have ours.

49
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,902
Causal determinism, we are
hardwired to need answers.

50
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,080
The caveman who heard
a rustle in the bushes

51
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:15,258
and checked out
to see what it was

52
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,683
lived longer than the guy who
assumed it was just a breeze.

53
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,219
The problem is,

54
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,051
when we don't find a logical
answer, we settle for a stupid one.

55
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,783
Ritual is what happens
when we run out of rational.

56
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,088
If you're done mocking him,
we need to prep for an LP.

57
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:31,927
Good. Another hole in him
should really make God's day.

58
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,067
Why are you late?

59
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,109
Your next dental
appointment isn't until January

60
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,542
and you just saw your
GP eight days ago.

61
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,479
Think stage IV glioblastoma
in an eight-year-old

62
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,913
can disappear in three weeks?

63
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,051
Had a flat tire. Your
patient has cancer?

64
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,279
Your tires have got less
than 5,000 miles on them.

65
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,889
No, and neither does
my patient's daughter.

66
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,619
I hit a piece of rebar
near a construction site.

67
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,262
In three weeks?
It's highly unlikely.

68
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,560
There's no construction site
between here and your home.

69
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,097
I agree, I think it was
a misdiagnosed cyst.

70
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,795
But there is one between
here and my dry cleaner.

71
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:14,034
It could be a misdiagnosis or it
could be spontaneous remission, but...

72
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,766
Why would I lie about
this? I don't know yet.

73
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,397
But you would've dropped off
your tie, it's got a mustard stain.

74
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,750
I was buying an engagement ring.

75
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,421
I'm gonna propose
to Sam at the wedding.

76
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,085
That is the second stupidest
thing I've heard today.

77
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,261
And I'm surprised
how close you came.

78
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,740
You didn't need to
buy her a new ring.

79
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,733
Isn't the first one good
for all-you-can-marry?

80
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,997
I assume you haven't
apologized to Cuddy yet.

81
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,503
Your stupidity
demands equal time.

82
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,232
Nothing to apologize for.

83
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,470
Pretend to apologize.

84
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,542
You want me to lie?

85
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,890
There's a lovely symmetry to it.

86
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,825
A lie got you into it,
a lie gets you out of it.

87
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,611
Everybody lies.
I'm sure Cuddy...

88
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,579
Just need to give her a chance.

89
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,491
Yeah, that must've
been what I meant.

90
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,856
Have you seen the bride-to-be?

91
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,727
Gorgeous woman half
his age. He's a lucky guy.

92
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,357
Yeah. For a while.

93
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,626
My father's 19 years
older than my mother

94
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,502
and they've been happily
married for 32 years.

95
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,439
I'm guessing your dad
wasn't on the Forbes 400

96
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,499
and your mom didn't
look like a swimsuit model.

97
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,601
Sorry, that didn't
come out right.

98
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:30,549
My father was the classics chair at
Columbia and my mother was his student.

99
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:34,051
His gorgeous student.

100
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,181
What's it mean when somebody
takes their cell phone into the bathroom

101
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,450
when they're taking a shower?

102
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,821
Means they don't want you to
check their calls, e-mails or texts.

103
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,489
If we're talking
about your wife,

104
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,725
it means the chickens
are coming home to roost.

105
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,133
Taub has been known to dabble.

106
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,297
Used to be.

107
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,476
Maybe it's just a habit. I do that
with my cell phone and I live alone.

108
00:07:56,543 --> 00:08:00,241
She has a meeting
today at 1:30, at a hotel.

109
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,680
I'm gonna go with
the chicken thing.

110
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:07,580
Negative for toxocara,
bacteroides, ascaris, everything.

111
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,555
So what looks like an infection
but doesn't test like one?

112
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,651
Animals.

113
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,287
I'm sure your wife's
just seeing a dude.

114
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,723
Patient works for Morgan
Timber Works, card's in the file.

115
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,393
"Specializing in
stables, barns and stalls."

116
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,494
He works around
animals. Rhodococcus equi.

117
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,437
Unless this guy's
sleeping in the manger.

118
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,940
Or has a history of open wounds.

119
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,743
We think you have rhodococcus
equi, a horse infection.

120
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,789
It's pretty rare in humans but
easily treatable with antibiotics.

121
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,482
Does it make
your teeth fall out?

122
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,557
No.

123
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:56,430
Then again, maybe we were wrong.

124
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,342
Fever, coughing up
blood, coughing up teeth.

125
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,984
Either God sweetened the deal
with a no-flossing clause, or...

126
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,417
Radiation sickness.

127
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,045
Yeah, maybe the carpenter
builds microwave ovens.

128
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,179
Kaposi sarcoma?

129
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,690
No skin lesions.

130
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:21,387
Heavy metal poisoning fits,
canned tuna, sushi, lead paint.

131
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,521
Heavy metal it is. Do a home
search and a peripheral smear.

132
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,226
I can't. I have a
personal errand to run.

133
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,893
Trying to catch
your wife cheating?

134
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,337
Why would you say that?

135
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,536
Missing mojo, posture
slumped, expression defeated,

136
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,603
you didn't try to back up your
theory. And Chase told me.

137
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,846
Go, find your mojo.

138
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,284
Shopkeeper, I
need a patient file.

139
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,761
Ask records.

140
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,956
Not one of our patients',

141
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,055
my patient's daughter.
Ask your patient.

142
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,192
He thinks I only want
it to debunk his faith.

143
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,934
And why would he think that?

144
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:06,029
Because he's strangely
perceptive for an idiot.

145
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:10,870
And I'm going to violate patient
privacy laws just to keep you happy?

146
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:15,040
You keep me happy, I return
the favor. Think of it as tat for tit.

147
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,950
When we're at work, we need
to focus on our work thoughts.

148
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,455
Why are you wearing that?

149
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,456
It's my dressy casual.
What do you think?

150
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,389
You look like Wilson.

151
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,254
It looks weird.

152
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,424
But you knew I'd think that,

153
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,464
which makes me wonder
why you look disappointed.

154
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,625
If you prick me, do I not bleed?

155
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:40,966
You knew I wouldn't like it but
you thought I would say I did.

156
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,306
That's what this is about. You're
trying to trap me into lying to you.

157
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,743
You sure? That
sounds so juvenile.

158
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,679
You're okay with burglary now?

159
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,984
I asked his permission.

160
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,518
The reason we
don't ask permission

161
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,028
is we're afraid the patient
is going to hide something.

162
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,893
But our patient
hasn't been home,

163
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,660
lives alone, doesn't
have any help,

164
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,667
and has no motive
to hide anything.

165
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,993
You ask for his key, too?

166
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,595
Oh! Doesn't have one.

167
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,544
And now we know why.

168
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,546
You think he's crazy?

169
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,979
Crucifixion's pretty convincing
evidence. Lead paint?

170
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,720
Place is too new.

171
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,450
He believes in a higher
power that can affect his life,

172
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,824
like most people on the planet.

173
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,955
True. On the other
hand, crucified himself.

174
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,898
No canned tuna and I don't
think we have to worry about sushi.

175
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,961
No computer, no television,
no music. What does he do?

176
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,473
He reads. Prayer has
been proven to aid recovery.

177
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,670
Only if the person knows
they're being prayed for.

178
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,841
Means there's
no objective effect.

179
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:59,147
So faith comes from within.
Not exactly a newsflash.

180
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,758
I guess worry is
good for the waistline.

181
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,705
It's not worry, it's starvation.

182
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,418
His tooth didn't fall out because
of heavy metal poisoning,

183
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,933
it fell out because
of malnutrition.

184
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,534
He does have rhodococcus equi.

185
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,404
Taub was right.

186
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,949
He just didn't know why.

187
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,548
It's locked! WILSON: I'm busy.

188
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,726
I'll wait.

189
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,763
I really am busy.

190
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,892
Cuddy got me
the daughter's file.

191
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,061
Well, not Cuddy,
exactly. Her signature.

192
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,468
Well, not exactly her signature.

193
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,601
Another lie?

194
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,388
Thought you could
take a look at it for me.

195
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,404
Maybe you hadn't
heard, I'm kind of busy.

196
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,710
With what?

197
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,375
Sudoku. What do you think?

198
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,952
I'm the head of oncology
in a major hospital.

199
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,258
And yet these files are
not from this hospital.

200
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,752
These are from
Where-My-FiancÃ©e-Works Memorial.

201
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,799
Sam's boss is doing a
clinical review of all of her files,

202
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,197
and she just wanted to make sure

203
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,221
everything's in order
before he starts on Monday.

204
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:26,031
Which explains why Sam
is too busy to look at my file.

205
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,439
If I don't help her, she can't
go to the wedding, and...

206
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,569
We fell in love at
her cousin's wedding,

207
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,977
which is why I want to
propose to her at a wedding.

208
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,309
And now, you have 60
seconds to berate me for that

209
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,011
and for helping my
girlfriend with her homework.

210
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,496
You don't want to
propose at a wedding.

211
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,955
Emotions running
high, people on edge.

212
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:47,357
You want to try somewhere like
a Buddhist temple or an aquarium,

213
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,952
or a Buddhist aquarium.

214
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,431
That only took 10 seconds.

215
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,990
You can spend the rest
of the time on my file.

216
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,735
Rachel?

217
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,149
Hey. How long
before you're home?

218
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,689
<i>Notlong.</i>

219
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,891
Hey. Hey.

220
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:23,962
Uh...

221
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,023
Yeah, you left your laptop on.

222
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:32,002
I saw you today, at the hotel.

223
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,468
Were you checking up on me?

224
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,670
Yes.

225
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,105
Satisfied?

226
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,540
Yes.

227
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,241
Good.

228
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,742
That's it?

229
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,787
You said you're
satisfied, that's enough.

230
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,948
You're not wondering
why it started,

231
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,403
that makes me think you
don't want to talk about this,

232
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:55,725
which makes me think...

233
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,263
You're being paranoid.

234
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,525
You took your cell phone
with you into the bathroom

235
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,999
when you took a
shower this morning.

236
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,633
I made a new friend, online.

237
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,474
In a support group.

238
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,338
A guy?

239
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,436
Yes.

240
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,439
Support group for what?

241
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,779
For people with
unfaithful spouses.

242
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,717
Why didn't you tell us
you were starving yourself?

243
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,263
Well, I wasn't trying to.

244
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,322
I'm on a tight budget and
it seemed like an okay diet.

245
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,560
You seem to be feeling better.

246
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,299
Not really, my
legs are killing me.

247
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,905
How bad is the pain?

248
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,209
On a scale of one to
10, 10 being the worst.

249
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,275
Nine and a half.

250
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,613
Then why are you smiling?

251
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,383
I'm not smiling.

252
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,961
Leg pain and
pseudo bulbar affect.

253
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,636
He's feeling one emotion while
unknowingly expressing another one.

254
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,330
Classic neurohecatia.

255
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,831
Two days of anticholinergics
and you'll be walking out of here.

256
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,303
Really?

257
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:20,707
No. I just made that up to see
your reaction. Diagnostic test.

258
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,078
This is awesome.

259
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,381
33-year-old carpenter
presenting narcissism,

260
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,388
delusions of grandeur
and hallucinations.

261
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,752
He hasn't had hallucinations.

262
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:35,261
I'm not talking about him, I'm talking
about him, with a capital O-M-G.

263
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,058
You want us to do a
differential diagnosis on Jesus?

264
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:42,734
Hears voices, thinks he's the
son of God, probably schizophrenic.

265
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,737
I think you offended him.

266
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,001
You're saying the patient's religious
extremism could be a symptom?

267
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,407
A neuro disorder could
explain all his delusions.

268
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,878
Get an MRI of his brain.
Let's see if we can find God.

269
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:02,352
Heard you got the daughter's
file. Patient change his mind?

270
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,456
I forged your signature.

271
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,055
Thank you for your honesty.

272
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,528
Think of it as a present.

273
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:14,800
See, somebody is about to
turn the big 4-5 in several months,

274
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,133
and somebody else wants
to make a very big deal of it.

275
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,603
4-3.

276
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,971
4-3. Are you sure?

277
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,041
Very.

278
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:27,709
How could I make such a
mistake? In reading your HR file.

279
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,210
Oh, no, wait, I didn't.

280
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,081
And boom goes the dynamite!
Scores are tied. We are even-steven.

281
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:38,784
You're right, I did
lie. To HR, not to you.

282
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,958
When I first applied for the VP
admin job, I was 29 years old.

283
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,227
I knew I'd be taken more
seriously if I were in my early 30s,

284
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,893
so I added two years to my age.

285
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,130
You lied to make yourself older?

286
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,482
Are you lying about
being a woman?

287
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,498
Even if you can trap me,

288
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,168
do you think I'll suddenly
embrace the value of lying?

289
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,076
My point is you already
have. I just need to prove it.

290
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,589
Chickens aren't roosting.
She's just got a friend.

291
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:13,148
A guy she met in an online
support group for cheating spouses.

292
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,354
I've heard of that
group. It's called Irony.

293
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,026
You think she's
cheating on her spouse

294
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,158
with someone from a
cheating spouse support group?

295
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,931
Sounds like the perfect place
to hit on vulnerable women.

296
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:28,202
Look. Multiple dense lesions.

297
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,174
It looks like MS.

298
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,941
How did we miss MS?

299
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,042
It was hiding behind
the malnutrition.

300
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,983
MS. attacks the immune
system. No system, no symptoms.

301
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,216
And now we're feeding
him so they're both back.

302
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,620
How are you feeling?

303
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,956
Terrible.

304
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,896
Obviously.

305
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,198
Where are your friends? Still
casting lots for your clothes?

306
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,199
All I ask is that
they pray for me.

307
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,173
Always sacrificing,
very inspirational.

308
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,236
The lesions are in
your temporal lobes.

309
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,812
When those areas
get messed with,

310
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,677
people have strange experiences.

311
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,081
Like hauntings, alien
abductions, past lives...

312
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,879
Deals with God?

313
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,216
You didn't come to
see if I was better,

314
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,348
you came to see if your medicine
has turned me into an atheist.

315
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,091
I'd settle for agnostic.

316
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,487
Faith is not a disease.

317
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
No, of course not.

318
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,522
On the other hand, it is
communicable and it kills a lot of people.

319
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,406
I can't move my arm.

320
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,574
You feel that?

321
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,050
Your friends are not
praying hard enough.

322
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,752
It's not MS.

323
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,591
Paralysis is a symptom of MS,

324
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,927
so are leg pain and
pseudo bulbar affect.

325
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,842
He's getting worse on
the prednisone. It's not MS.

326
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,301
The MRI was clear,
he has lesions.

327
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,998
It could be an AVM,
cerebral infarction.

328
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,471
Let's put it to the vote.

329
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,804
Vest or cummerbund?

330
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,570
Cummerbund.

331
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,505
You know me,

332
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,675
I can't say no to any of
you guys. You're all correct.

333
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,187
He has MS. But not the
friendly Mr. Rogers MS.

334
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,415
This is the
weird-guy-in-the-panel-van kind.

335
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,488
Marburg MS?

336
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,651
What did I just say?

337
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,820
He'll be dead in two to
three days, at the most.

338
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,272
That's unless we can
get someone to nail

339
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,094
themselves to a cross
as soon as possible.

340
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,064
Or stem cell treatment.

341
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,567
That's an
experimental treatment.

342
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,068
That's had
promising results with

343
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,162
demyelinating diseases.
It's our best shot.

344
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,833
It would be if it wasn't
embryonic stem cell treatment.

345
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,118
Our patient's right of the pope,

346
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,610
he's never gonna
consent to that.

347
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,942
I know that, you know that,
but he doesn't know that.

348
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:50,278
But now she knows that,
he's gonna know that.

349
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,040
Way to go.

350
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:56,715
Confirm Marburg. Then see if
he's a fair-weather flagellator.

351
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,292
You looking smashing,
Miss Moneypenny.

352
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,233
Cummerbund? Very
foolish, Mr. Bond.

353
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,729
The daughter's case checks out.

354
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:17,971
Stereotactic biopsy confirmed
stage IV glioblastoma multiforme.

355
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,976
It doesn't respond to chemo

356
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,311
but they gave it to her anyway
as a Hail Mary and just got lucky.

357
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,716
So either God intervened,
which is a lazy explanation,

358
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,053
or we just don't know why,
which is no explanation.

359
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,151
Sometimes there is no explanation.
And I'm just fine with that.

360
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,593
Which annoys me to no end.

361
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,394
I need that file, that
chair and that desk.

362
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,606
Your woman is fudging the facts.

363
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,940
Five of those cases,
the stated doses

364
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,740
don't explain the
radiation damage.

365
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,212
Sensitivities vary.

366
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,407
Not that much.

367
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,247
Yeah. That's what I thought.

368
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,187
I asked her
point-blank about this.

369
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,559
She said the dosages
were accurate,

370
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,029
and that she had
done nothing wrong.

371
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,127
Because morally she didn't.

372
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,268
All five patients were terminal,

373
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,771
she exceeded the dosing
protocols to try to save their life.

374
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,273
You'd have done the same.

375
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,036
She's a sap and
she's perfect for you.

376
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,182
I hate rehearsal dinners almost
as much as I hate weddings.

377
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,087
The only reason
anyone gets married

378
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,850
is because Homo erectus females

379
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:40,517
needed protection from
predators while breastfeeding.

380
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,128
And the only reason these
two are getting married

381
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,461
is to throw an obnoxious gala to
make the rest of us feel unworthy.

382
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,665
Even though we know in two years

383
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,774
the lawyers are gonna be
fighting over the Bentleys.

384
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,238
That'd make a lovely toast.

385
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,275
She's got looks, he's got money.

386
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,470
One of them is bound to run out.

387
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,914
I give it 19 months.

388
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,539
That's very specific.

389
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,377
No fault divorce in
New Jersey requires

390
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:10,855
couples to live at
least 18 months apart.

391
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,692
I'm actually only
giving it a few weeks.

392
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,071
I thought I was supposed
to be the dark one.

393
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,335
Not today.

394
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,762
Yeah.

395
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,299
You're gonna have to go stag.
My patient is refusing treatment.

396
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:26,663
And you care?

397
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,971
No, but it's an excuse
you can't argue with.

398
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,844
Accepting this treatment
is an insult to God.

399
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,283
I can't expect him
to keep our deal.

400
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,814
You already broke it.

401
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,620
Your blood test shows you
were loaded with ibuprofen.

402
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,451
Taking painkillers
breaks my deal?

403
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,584
The point is to suffer
like your savior did, right?

404
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,890
Well, he didn't take myrrh,
the Tylenol of ancient Rome.

405
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,657
And his nails went through
his wrists, not through his palms.

406
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,928
Palms are for sissies.

407
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,827
And what about the 39 lashes,

408
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,997
and the beatings and
the crown of thorns?

409
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,640
What you go through is closer to
a bad manicure than a crucifixion.

410
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,370
It's not about
showing God my pain,

411
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,572
it's about showing him my faith.

412
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,974
If he asks me to die for
my daughter, I'll do it gladly.

413
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,575
Don't make this
about your daughter.

414
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,089
You're just worried that we'll find
a cure that will cost you your faith,

415
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,466
and you'll be
like the rest of us.

416
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:23,087
Alone and afraid? You're
right. I don't want that.

417
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,162
You're smiling.

418
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,460
Does that mean that you're
comfortable with your choice

419
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,364
or that you're afraid?

420
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,935
Because this may
be your only hope.

421
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,597
You can prescribe a lot of
things but hope isn't one of them.

422
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:36,472
Sticking by your convictions
and damning the consequences.

423
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,337
You two have a lot in common.

424
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,705
You're both idiots.

425
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,879
All convictions
equally ridiculous?

426
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,052
Just when they're applied
indiscriminately to all circumstances.

427
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,320
He needs to see his daughter.

428
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,955
He needs to see
<i>Inherit the Wind.</i>

429
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,491
And tell her he's dying because God
doesn't want him to take his medicine.

430
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,870
Honesty's not all bad.

431
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,400
Get her in here.

432
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,816
You don't have to die. Not
if you take the medicine.

433
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,057
The treatment
violates God's laws.

434
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,756
He doesn't want me to take it.

435
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,522
But God doesn't want you to die.

436
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,659
He doesn't want anyone
to die. He's all about love.

437
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:38,279
I know this is coming
from your mother.

438
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,169
This is coming from me.

439
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,707
I'm the one who almost
died, I know what it's like.

440
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,176
You're my daddy, you can't die.

441
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,179
I wish I didn't have to.

442
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,047
You don't have to, Daddy.
Just take the medicine.

443
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,781
You always tell me to
take the medicine. Please.

444
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,894
One day, you're
going to understand.

445
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:04,962
No, I'm not.

446
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,965
I'm never going
to understand that.

447
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:13,130
If God could do
this, I hate God.

448
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,079
I just spotted a couple of hot
girls by the chocolate fountain.

449
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,566
Weren't you just
upstairs with...

450
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,731
It wouldn't have happened
if not for you, buddy.

451
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,507
Someone had to
distract the sober friend.

452
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:53,944
I'm not here to be your wingman.

453
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,571
I'll be your wingman this time.

454
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,775
I didn't come here
to get laid either.

455
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,850
Then don't.

456
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,011
Talking to beautiful women
isn't nearly as much fun

457
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,351
as watching Taub
not talking to his wife.

458
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,390
I went through your e-mails.

459
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,229
There's nothing in
there that's inappropriate.

460
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,799
We're friends, Chris.

461
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,461
But you tell him things
that you've never told me.

462
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,233
I tell him things I can't
tell you, that's the point.

463
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,104
Not things about me, about you.

464
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,343
About your new job,
about coloring your hair,

465
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,607
about how you felt
when your mother died.

466
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,907
I want to know those things.

467
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,018
He's easy to talk to.

468
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:39,986
He's open and honest.
He makes me feel safe.

469
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,788
Sounds like you love him.

470
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,261
I'm not having an affair.

471
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,788
He lives in Oregon. I've never
met him. I probably never will.

472
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,301
You are having an
affair, an emotional one.

473
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,601
Are you equating what
I'm doing with what you did?

474
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,334
I've done terrible
things to you.

475
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,706
And I deserve all
of this and more.

476
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,779
But you can't pretend that
what you're doing isn't hurtful.

477
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,282
Someone looks lovely tonight.

478
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,789
Thank you.

479
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,617
I meant me.

480
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,993
But someone else
looks simply stunning.

481
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,393
That was you.

482
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,900
And the blonde at the bar.

483
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,665
Just to be clear, this whole
little act isn't gonna work.

484
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,833
I need an apology, not flattery.

485
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,240
It's not an act.
It's the wedding.

486
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,336
You hate weddings.

487
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:37,406
I thought I did. Then I
realized I've never been to one.

488
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:38,711
Never?

489
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,843
Turns out they're kind of fun.

490
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,388
Well, I can't complain about
my boss. He's right here.

491
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,858
You're his boss?

492
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,037
Only Mondays through Fridays.

493
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,826
On the weekends, he's my bro.

494
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:58,464
This round's on the bro?

495
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,013
Um...

496
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,882
I'm sorry about your daughter.

497
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,178
I never meant to hurt her.

498
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,384
You just thought
she'd change my mind.

499
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,895
I was surprised she didn't.

500
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,523
So was I.

501
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,095
I didn't tell you the truth.

502
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,002
When I said I'm
not afraid to die.

503
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,369
But you're going
straight to heaven, so...

504
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,240
That's what I believe.
But I'm human.

505
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,508
So you know you may be wrong.

506
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,552
How could you do
what you just did?

507
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:55,020
That's why we have beliefs, so
we can still see the right thing to do

508
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,062
when we're blinded
with doubt and fear.

509
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:03,130
Our beliefs define us. If
we lose them, who are we?

510
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:15,541
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean for it to go that way.

511
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:23,655
You think I'm being
selfish but I'm not.

512
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:30,160
He makes me feel better
about me and about us.

513
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,598
Well, that is hard to believe

514
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:38,403
because all I feel
right now is betrayed.

515
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,264
I never wanted that.

516
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,339
Good.

517
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:45,841
Because just like you asked
me to stop my behavior,

518
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,310
I'm asking you to stop this.

519
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,713
No?

520
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,447
I'm not gonna lie to you.

521
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,283
Is this revenge?

522
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,224
I don't know.

523
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,989
But I do know that it's
something I need right now.

524
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,971
What would you wear?

525
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,039
I'm a sucker for the white gown.

526
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,879
Traditionally for
young, first-time brides.

527
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:29,646
Well, I may not be
young but I'd be first-time.

528
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,292
That is a lie.

529
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,293
You were married before.
In 1987, for six days.

530
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,837
Your knowledge of New Jersey
divorce law made me suspicious,

531
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,999
so I looked it up.

532
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,035
So this was all your trap?

533
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,240
Trap's primitive, I
prefer inveiglement.

534
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:01,844
Anyway, the point is, I lied to
you, you lied to me, I forgive you.

535
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,393
Well played.

536
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,696
You're tired, aren't
you? All those files.

537
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:22,500
No, no, I was thinking...

538
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,510
I mean, if those two even have
the slightest chance of making it,

539
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,515
then we have to be a sure thing.

540
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,681
And we've already
made all our mistakes.

541
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,519
And...

542
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,289
I've come to realize
that I love you

543
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,264
even more than I thought I did.

544
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,728
Sam, will you marry me again?

545
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,410
Wow. I don't even
know what to say.

546
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,143
I have a suggestion.

547
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,242
Where did this even
come from? When did you...

548
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,386
You just came to realize?

549
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,651
What made you love me even more?

550
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:19,455
Everything you've done, your
work, your sense of morality.

551
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,102
The five cases.

552
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:28,101
I not only agree with
what you did, I admire it.

553
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,072
I didn't do anything.
You already asked me

554
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,610
about the files and
I told you the truth.

555
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,010
I know, and I get it.

556
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,646
You don't believe me.

557
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:42,015
I believe that you are
a wonderful person.

558
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,349
Who lies and cheats.

559
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,445
No, Sam.

560
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,152
Listen, I'm on your side.

561
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,023
I can't believe this.

562
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,160
What? Sam. Sam, don't do this.

563
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,790
So how many do you think?

564
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,363
At least three.

565
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,961
Hat-trick Chase.

566
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,865
See? Life of the bachelor.
All of the sex, none of the guilt.

567
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:37,336
It's not over, okay? I
just really miscalculated.

568
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,403
I thought she'd forgiven
me for everything

569
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:45,007
but all those hurt feelings,
they never really went away.

570
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,914
That makes a lot more sense.

571
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:54,549
Ignore him, he just got an idea.

572
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,492
I have one more test to run.

573
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,426
Uh, I hate weddings.

574
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,547
Won't be long now.

575
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,060
You'll be staring down the
yawning void before you know it.

576
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,589
You came from a
wedding to tell me that?

577
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:36,691
No, I came from a
wedding to run a PET scan.

578
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,561
Thought you'd given up on me.

579
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,901
I have. PET scan
was for your daughter.

580
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,298
I was wrong about her.

581
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,745
She did have glioblastoma.

582
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,443
And she still does.
Cancer never went away.

583
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,988
Yes, it did. They
tested her every year.

584
00:35:58,223 --> 00:35:59,816
With a CT scan

585
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,323
which misses all the tiny little
tumors that a PET scan doesn't.

586
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:08,423
You made a mistake. She
does not have cancer anymore.

587
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,498
I ran it twice, no mistake.

588
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,106
Looks like God broke your deal.

589
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,270
I'm sorry.

590
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,514
But I'm also right.

591
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,512
You're a bastard.

592
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,660
Do whatever you want to me.

593
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:42,832
Good call.

594
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,437
Surprised you've got enough
strength to come to work today.

595
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,309
Thirty-six hours is long
enough for me to recover.

596
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,016
And not nearly long enough
for this guy to be getting better.

597
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,881
House wanted us checking
every 12 hours anyway.

598
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,844
Sorry I took off on you.

599
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,614
Twice.

600
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,716
First one was my bad.
Second one I had no choice.

601
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,222
It was a threesome.

602
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:12,961
They're overrated.

603
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:15,896
He's bluffing. He's bluffing.

604
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,170
Get House.

605
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,906
Got something to show you.
Your daughter's PET scan.

606
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:26,740
It's clean.

607
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,041
She's fine.

608
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,846
My bad.

609
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,545
Got her mixed up
with Marion Silver.

610
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,748
Marisa Silva. That's
believable, right?

611
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:43,085
Anyhow, good news for
you, bad news for Mr. Silver.

612
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,995
You tricked me. God
didn't break our deal, I did.

613
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:51,226
You led me into
temptation and I followed.

614
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:53,100
And God will
punish you for that.

615
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,105
He has to. 'Cause if he didn't,

616
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,932
it'd make you
wonder, wouldn't it?

617
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,202
He will.

618
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,774
Well, that's why I'm
so confused by this.

619
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:06,443
This is your MRI. Shows
incremental improvement.

620
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:07,678
You're getting better.

621
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:10,834
I double-checked
the name on this one.

622
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:16,360
But it's not all good news.
This patient is screwed.

623
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,765
Technical term is
dead as a doornail.

624
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,290
Who is that?

625
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,623
God.

626
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,027
You broke your deal with him

627
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,047
but your daughter's fine
and you're getting better.

628
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,564
Nothing bad happened.
Which can only mean one thing,

629
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,974
there is no God.

630
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:36,043
'Course, if your daughter
gets hit by a meteorite today,

631
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,276
I would have some
serious egg on my face.

632
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:43,913
You're smiling. I assume
that means you're miserable.

633
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,485
It means I'm happy.

634
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,890
This doesn't mean
God doesn't exist,

635
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:53,488
it just means
he's truly merciful.

636
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,065
My beautiful Marisa was right,

637
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,300
God is all about love.

638
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:03,101
Punishment is proof of God and
no punishment is proof of God.

639
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,839
Ingenious argument.

640
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,441
Faith isn't an argument.

641
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,685
I'd like to see my daughter.

642
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,026
Everyone else knew?

643
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,668
Everyone I could trust. So, yes.

644
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:33,966
If you had told me,
he'd be dead by now.

645
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,198
So why do I still
want to tell the truth?

646
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:41,676
Either you're naÃ¯ve, or you have
scruples. I'm not sure which is worse.

647
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:45,474
This is insane. We
can't work like this.

648
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:47,879
I can.

649
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,149
Sam?

650
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,854
Sorry, I was hoping to be
done before you got home.

651
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,792
We had a fight.
We had one fight.

652
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,966
And I admitted I was wrong.

653
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:06,636
We can talk about
it, we can get over it.

654
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:07,695
This is about trust.

655
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,138
I never lied to you
about anything.

656
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,837
I know, and I
always trusted you.

657
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,110
Maybe we could
talk to a counselor.

658
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,877
You said that helped
after our divorce.

659
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,680
It did, and I think
I changed a lot.

660
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:25,156
And I haven't. This is my fault?

661
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,923
I know where this is going.

662
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,552
And I don't want
to go there again.

663
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:37,597
You're quitting, Sam.
You're quitting again.

664
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,834
So I guess you haven't
changed that much.

665
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,195
Good work today.

666
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,135
Don't even think your
patient's gonna sue.

667
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,435
Looks like everybody's happy.

668
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,638
I've been an idiot.

669
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,044
I got this argument
stuck in my head.

670
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:32,420
If everybody lies, then trust is
not only unfounded and pointless,

671
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,425
it's fictional.

672
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,759
But trust is not an argument
that can be won or lost.

673
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:44,330
Maybe I just have to suspend
my cynicism and believe.

674
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,463
Maybe it's time I
took a leap of faith.

675
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,143
I'm sorry.

676
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,110
I won't lie to you again.

677
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,983
Thank you.

678
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,126
Sam left me.

679
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,131
What a moron.

680
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,975
Too soon. I'm still
in love with her.

681
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,441
I meant you.

682
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,440
Do you have a drink? Or drinks?

683
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,347
Cuddy's coming over.

684
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,217
Does she know you're here?

685
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,557
I apologized to her.

686
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,467
Good for you.

687
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:56,368
