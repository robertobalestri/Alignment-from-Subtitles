1
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,268
House?

2
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,679
House?

3
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,779
Oh, my God!

4
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,249
What the hell?

5
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,619
Gotcha. Did you
actually wake up early

6
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,926
and hide under the bed just
to scare the crap out of me?

7
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,898
Set an alarm and everything.

8
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,626
It's like dating a 10-year-old.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,262
God, I hope not.

10
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,881
Now that we're down here...

11
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,385
Hold that thought.

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,420
Seriously?

13
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:55,547
I have to pee.

14
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:01,060
I'll wait. I brought a book.

15
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,062
Didn't know what time
your alarm was set for.

16
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,226
House?

17
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,327
You know, you could rent
this space out down here.

18
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,098
In Japan, that would
be like a deluxe...

19
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,231
House, shut up.

20
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,745
There's blood in my urine.

21
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,246
You really don't
have to be here.

22
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,088
You're my girlfriend.
I'm being supportive.

23
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,788
I'm mainly talking about them.

24
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,031
Well, given that there's almost

25
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,431
certainly nothing
wrong with you,

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,478
and my patient definitely has
something wrong with him...

27
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,970
That can't wait an hour?

28
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,869
Afraid not. He's...

29
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,640
Chase?

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,303
Sixteen-year-old
male spit up blood

31
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,937
during a pick-up
basketball game.

32
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,983
ER couldn't find the source
in his lungs or GI tract.

33
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,608
See? Serious.

34
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,950
Could be vasculitis,
bronchiectasis, inhaled particles.

35
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,148
What about angiodysplasia?

36
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,384
Ready when you are.

37
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,652
Get them out of here.

38
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,389
My urethra is not for
public entertainment.

39
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,894
But it is good-time adjacent.

40
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,965
Feed the kid a camera, check
his gut for angiodysplasia.

41
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,400
All right, scoot up here.

42
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,674
I'm missing a watch. If you
could keep your eyes open while...

43
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,903
Okay. You, too.

44
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,838
This little camera

45
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,384
transmits images
to the data recorder

46
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,216
so we can see if you've got any

47
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,052
vascular malformations
in your GI tract.

48
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,254
Your records show you've lost
some weight over the past year.

49
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,993
Was that
intentional? Not really.

50
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,875
Well, he's been eating less
since he quit the swim team.

51
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,664
You have to get
up early for swim.

52
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,365
It wasn't fun anymore.

53
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,536
I need to talk to your
son about sexual activity.

54
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,218
Generally, it's less
embarrassing for everyone...

55
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,767
We're leaving.

56
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,842
Actually, I've only ever...

57
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,750
How long have you
been cutting yourself?

58
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,718
Those are from a layback
grind that went wrong.

59
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,421
Came off my skateboard,
straight into a fence.

60
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,465
So, no to cutting but yes to
appetite and sleep changes,

61
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,002
and you quit something
you used to enjoy.

62
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,094
How long have you
been depressed?

63
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,309
Imaging showed no
sign of upper GI issues,

64
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,435
but the kid did admit
to being depressed

65
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,742
and to smoking pot
to take the edge off.

66
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,680
You are very pleased
with yourself, aren't you?

67
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,942
His marijuana could be laced
with formaldehyde or lead,

68
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,395
which could cause a
pulmonary hemorrhage,

69
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,081
which could make
him spit up blood.

70
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,491
Yes. Yes, I am. It
was a good catch.

71
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,527
Run a lead level and
push five liters IV fluid.

72
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,500
Feel free to tip
your other server.

73
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,637
Cystoscopy was clean,

74
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,233
cytopathology was normal...

75
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,040
Why do you have my lab results?

76
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,681
I don't. If I did, I'd
know you were fine.

77
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,683
Unless the blood
came from my kidneys.

78
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:11,877
Come on.

79
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:15,411
Your hypochondriac mom had
a brush with mortality last month.

80
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,789
It's understandable that
you're worrying more than usual.

81
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,624
Worrying that you
might turn into her.

82
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,496
You're right.

83
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,796
Odds are this is nothing.

84
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,232
Meet me in the cafeteria in 10.

85
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,005
There'll be a corn dog
with your name on it.

86
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,847
I mean an actual corn dog.
They fixed the deep fryer.

87
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,351
I need to schedule
an ultrasound.

88
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,033
My dad's head is
still in one piece,

89
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,966
so I'm guessing you
didn't mention the pot.

90
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,503
What'd you tell them? The truth.

91
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,235
You had a minor
chemical exposure

92
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,502
and we can't be 100%
sure how it happened.

93
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,875
Thanks for covering.

94
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,276
I know what it's like to be 16.

95
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,280
You also know what
it's like to be depressed.

96
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,378
You figured out my deal
after only a few minutes.

97
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,885
I've been fooling my friends
and parents for months.

98
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,252
It's my job to notice things.

99
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:26,083
Maybe talking to your parents
would make things better.

100
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,217
I've tried.

101
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,388
They take it personally
that I'm not happy,

102
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,432
and then I end up having
to make them feel better.

103
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,192
They don't get me.

104
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,303
No one does.

105
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:46,946
In med school, it seemed like
everybody else could handle the pressure.

106
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,106
I couldn't.

107
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,615
I ended up hurting myself.

108
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,988
Stupidest thing I've ever done.

109
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:07,757
You've got red spots in your
eyes. They weren't there before.

110
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,642
You have nice skin.

111
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,144
Thank you. Shut up.

112
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:21,340
Sorry, just thought it would
be rude not to comment.

113
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,383
Just treat me like
any other patient.

114
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,577
Right.

115
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,951
Are you sucking in your stomach?

116
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,081
No.

117
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,925
Now hurry up before I pass out.

118
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,424
Wilson?

119
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,301
Ultrasound isn't definitive. We
should run other tests before...

120
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,841
Stop talking like a doctor
and tell me what you see.

121
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,610
There's a mass in your kidney.

122
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,515
We still don't know why
Ryan coughed blood,

123
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,319
and now he's got small
hemorrhages in his eyes.

124
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,020
Sounds like an
acquired coagulopathy,

125
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,638
which gives us a
pretty wide differential.

126
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,893
Gets a lot narrower if we
factor in his depression.

127
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,158
Oh, don't do that.

128
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,534
Mood swings can be a
symptom of physiological illness.

129
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,659
Not talking to you.

130
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,781
Mood swings are also a
symptom of adolescence,

131
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,070
along with emo music
and masturbation.

132
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,942
More importantly,
his weight loss

133
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,520
and sleeping issues
started a year ago.

134
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,784
Infection makes the most sense.

135
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,007
He shoots hoops at school,
showers in the locker room.

136
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,743
I'm thinking staph or... - Damn.

137
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,349
You don't think...
Not talking to you.

138
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,156
Everything okay with Cuddy?
- She's fine.

139
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,816
She's just too
stupid to accept it.

140
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,486
Start him on
nafcillin for staph.

141
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,760
All that's in the First
Mutual safety deposit box.

142
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,232
The retirement accounts...

143
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,572
You're freaking out
because of one ultrasound

144
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,904
performed by an
incompetent bonobo monkey.

145
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,070
As demonstrated by my sitting
here calmly, going about my business.

146
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,841
Calling in a lawyer,
drafting a will.

147
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,082
Okay. I hacked into
your on-line schedule.

148
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,116
Look, tests always
show something.

149
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,765
Mass in your kidney could be a
complex cyst, it could be benign...

150
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,018
I'm a single mom.

151
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,026
I need to set up a
trust, appoint a guardian.

152
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,853
It's silly that I haven't
done it before now.

153
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,772
But you're doing it now
because you think you're sick.

154
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,230
The freaking out
can at least wait

155
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,775
until after the
biopsy this afternoon.

156
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,131
The biopsy's not till tomorrow.

157
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,721
It's the first opening
in the schedule.

158
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:26,434
For the Dean of Medicine, the
first opening in the schedule is...

159
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,632
Oh, look. Now!

160
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,267
My worry isn't any more
important than anyone else's.

161
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,377
Actually, it is.

162
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,140
But I'm not sick, right?

163
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,816
Good point.

164
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,150
I want my stuff, asshat.

165
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,751
I told you, man, I
don't have it here.

166
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,730
Hey, guys. Everything okay?

167
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,796
On my way out.
I'll see you later.

168
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,078
You want to tell
me what's going on?

169
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,913
My friend gave me some
leftover Klonopin he had

170
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,183
when he switched
to seizure meds.

171
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,053
I sold them to Roid
Rage for 80 bucks,

172
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,320
but I landed in here
before I could deliver,

173
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,419
and now he's gonna
rip my arms off.

174
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,088
How often do you sell drugs?

175
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,532
It was a one-time thing.

176
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,168
I needed the cash, I had the
pills, so I thought, "Why not?"

177
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,202
It was a bad idea.

178
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,938
The pills are at my house. I
could have a friend go get them.

179
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,111
Give the thug his money back.

180
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,556
One time only.

181
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,696
I mean, if you're
okay with this.

182
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,612
You have three kids of your own.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,493
It's not even a question. Of
course, I'll be Rachel's guardian.

184
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,971
And House is cool with this?

185
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,098
I mean, you guys...

186
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,005
We've only been
together a few months.

187
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,373
It seems like a lot longer.

188
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,988
Probably because you've been
talking about him for 10 years.

189
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,674
And by "talking," I
mean ranting about

190
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:19,014
wanting to smash his teeth in
with a stapler for being such a jerk.

191
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,146
People change.

192
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,389
WILSON: I'll get it.

193
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,690
That better be her.

194
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,170
Rachel Cuddy, you were supposed
to be home half an hour ago.

195
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,403
Don't blame me.

196
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,231
He's the one who
wouldn't run any red lights.

197
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:48,404
Mouth on that kid makes Mel
Gibson sound like Nelson Mandela.

198
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,941
Where'd she learn that?

199
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,016
I don't know why you're
here, but I didn't do it.

200
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,859
What's the problem, Officer?

201
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,622
She was shoplifting
down at the mall.

202
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,836
Are either of you
this girl's father?

203
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:08,926
Nope. But since her mom died,
she's my favorite tax write-off.

204
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:12,096
Officer, you have my
word, it won't happen again.

205
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,970
Because next time
she won't get caught!

206
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,593
It's no big deal.

207
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,060
Good for you.

208
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,969
You could have just
assumed he was a drug dealer,

209
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,766
but instead you
took his word for it.

210
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,736
It's nice to finally
see someone have

211
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,833
a little faith in
humanity around here.

212
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,944
Why would you do that?

213
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,206
Ryan, you okay in there?

214
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,443
I'm not sure.

215
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,816
I think I just peed blood.

216
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,957
Looks like peeing
blood is the new black.

217
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,931
Peeing blood after
a night on antibiotics

218
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,592
means we can move
on from infections.

219
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,345
Scoping showed no sign
of a bleed in his bladder,

220
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,413
which points to
a kidney problem.

221
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,962
Probably some kind of mass.

222
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,182
A kidney mass wouldn't explain

223
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,765
the coughing blood
or the hemorrhages.

224
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,867
Antiphospholipid syndrome,
on the other hand...

225
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,173
Makes sense. But
doesn't rule out a mass.

226
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,546
You think it's cancer?

227
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,344
Mass doesn't have to be cancer.
It could be a renal hematoma.

228
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,942
But the patient doesn't have
any other abdominal trauma.

229
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,488
He's not talking
about the patient.

230
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,619
Cuddy has a mass on her kidney?

231
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,655
It's probably just a complex
cyst or angiomyolipoma.

232
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,028
It's a mass, not a mystery.

233
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,172
They'll do the biopsy, then
you'll have your answer.

234
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,827
Just have to wait.

235
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,833
Patient admitted to using pot.

236
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,146
Who knows what else he's doing.

237
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,302
This could be
heroin-induced nephropathy.

238
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,554
I thought you trusted this kid.

239
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,740
And then you pointed
out how sweet that was.

240
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,992
If it were heroin, he'd be
going through withdrawal.

241
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,882
Antiphospholipid
syndrome's a better fit.

242
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,215
Start the patient
on plasmapheresis.

243
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,754
While he's doing that, can I at
least search his house for drugs?

244
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,691
Have I ever said
no to that question?

245
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,525
What are you doing here?

246
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,058
Pie-eating contest.

247
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,394
Cuddy's biopsy is in an hour. You
should be keeping her company.

248
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,941
Okay, you've been worried

249
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,568
that your relationship is getting
in the way of your diagnoses,

250
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,237
you're protecting your patient.

251
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,038
Either that, or you're an ass.

252
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,516
Three, I hate the
smell of death.

253
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,421
The chances of Cuddy
having renal cell carcinoma...

254
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,423
I'm talking about
our relationship.

255
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,887
She needs support and comfort,

256
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,792
both things that I
famously suck at.

257
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,227
Which will inevitably lead to...

258
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,629
You know what's
good for that? Practice.

259
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,725
Doing it, I don't know, once.

260
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,949
I'm not gonna act like there's a
crisis before we know there is one.

261
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,683
There's no proof that there's
anything wrong with her.

262
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,438
There's no proof she's being
stalked by ninja squirrels either,

263
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,444
but if she's scared of them,

264
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,309
as her boyfriend, it's your job

265
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,373
to figure out how to
help her feel better.

266
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,412
You're right.

267
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,292
House told me to
keep you company.

268
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,664
Nurse told me to
give you antibiotics.

269
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,670
Tell House I'm fine.

270
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,442
Hmm.

271
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,904
Tom Cruise got married.

272
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,726
Do you want me to quote from <i>First
Corinthians?</i> Because I can do that.

273
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,296
As a Jew, I'm gonna
have to decline that offer.

274
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,440
Don't know what you're missing.

275
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,366
Saint Paul was
really on his game.

276
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,365
He'll show up eventually.

277
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,122
You don't actually believe that.

278
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,977
But I do.

279
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,482
All these years,
he's never stopped

280
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,644
trying to annoy me for
more than 15 minutes.

281
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,484
Now he can't even
walk into the room.

282
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,021
"Love hopes all things."

283
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,758
What is it with
you and this kid?

284
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,659
He's doggie-paddling in a sea of
misery. I remember what it's like.

285
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,832
How far do you have to reach
back for that memory? Last night?

286
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:43,570
Sometimes I hear you in the
living room watching TV at 3:00 a.m.

287
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,169
That's when classic <i>Doctor
Who</i> comes on the BBC.

288
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,044
Yeah, if only they
had some device

289
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,710
that allowed you to record
them, watch them another time.

290
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,419
I'm just saying, don't think
fixing this kid is gonna fix you.

291
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,152
Yeah.

292
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,357
We're on our way back.

293
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,261
Our patient lost all
feeling in his right arm.

294
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,888
Look at this.

295
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,622
Chase?

296
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,555
How'd it go with Cuddy?

297
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,731
Chase?

298
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,277
Good thing I brought my ax cane.

299
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,713
House, help me!

300
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,411
I'm coming.

301
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,881
House, please!

302
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,827
Looks like we've got company.

303
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,379
House!

304
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,093
No!

305
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,396
Are you okay?

306
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,274
I was sleeping.

307
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,376
What could go wrong?

308
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,596
Patient lost feeling in his arm

309
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,748
while on steroids,
rules out autoimmune.

310
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,916
So what causes bleeding, kidney
problems and unilateral numbness?

311
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:50,326
And a complete absence of any
record of Cuddy's kidney biopsy.

312
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,365
She must've put it
under a false name

313
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,366
so I couldn't rush the results.

314
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,645
What if we had it backwards,

315
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,647
and it's not a bleeding
problem, it's a clotting problem?

316
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,106
And there's no patient file
created in the last two days

317
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,005
for anyone having
that procedure.

318
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,068
She backdated the
file? That's very clever.

319
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,908
Hands off. She's mine.

320
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,176
Clots could explain everything,
including the numbness.

321
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,689
We should do an angiogram
of his brain, see if we can find it.

322
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,622
House. We're worried, too.

323
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,294
How sweet.

324
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,875
I'm not worried. I just want to get
the results so she can stop worrying.

325
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,959
Okay. But in the
meantime... Do an angiogram.

326
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,367
And you two go to pathology
and look at Cuddy's slides.

327
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,736
You just said you didn't
know which sample was hers.

328
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,606
I guess you're gonna
have to look at them all.

329
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,039
Bigger question, what's
the deal with Taub?

330
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,146
Just because House is too
distracted to notice your distraction,

331
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,651
doesn't mean we didn't.

332
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,221
Clots, angiograms, I'm focused.

333
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,382
The kid scratched out
the faces of half his class.

334
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,468
You don't think that's a
problem? It's not our problem.

335
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,960
Why is it anyone's problem?

336
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,587
I violently executed my
10th grade geometry teacher

337
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,291
about five different
ways in my mind.

338
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,661
I didn't want to kill anybody.

339
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,792
I just wanted to
torture them slowly

340
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,167
in my basement,
preferably with acid.

341
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,398
You guys ever think about
what you might do to House?

342
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,614
Maybe it's no big deal.

343
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,449
Unless it is.

344
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,887
Somebody shot House.

345
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,957
What are you doing?

346
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,502
Pie-eating contest.

347
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:40,063
I was going to send
Chase to tell you

348
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,005
what the obvious
right thing to do here is.

349
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,406
But then I realized

350
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,069
if you were too stupid to
know how stupid that was,

351
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,703
you might miss the irony.

352
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,311
You have to be with her.

353
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,680
Yeah, I get it.

354
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,680
She needs artificial support
for an artificial problem.

355
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,582
She's fine.

356
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,555
Chase did an excellent job.

357
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,057
She doesn't sleep with Chase.

358
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,639
We don't know that.

359
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,693
Hey, eating pie in here.

360
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,758
House. I'm not gonna
tell you a third time.

361
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,359
Do not screw this up.

362
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,838
Because I really don't
want to clean up the mess.

363
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,541
He was referring to the pie.

364
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,545
Fourteen patients
with kidney biopsies.

365
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,605
I tabulated them against
their urinalysis results.

366
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:26,683
Six men, three diabetics, one
LCDD, one kid, two seniors.

367
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,381
And, by default, one Cuddy.

368
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,552
The biopsy was inconclusive.

369
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,592
The mass is near the
center of her kidney.

370
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,893
They couldn't get
a readable sample.

371
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,777
Means they'll have
to remove the mass

372
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,429
to know if it's cancer or not.

373
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,869
File says they're doing
some imaging now.

374
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,178
Give the surgeon a better
idea of what he's dealing with.

375
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,307
Can we order pizza?

376
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,251
There's nothing in the fridge.

377
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,654
At least, not anymore.

378
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,075
What's happening
with the patient?

379
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,620
Angio showed a clot in a branch
of his middle-cerebral artery.

380
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,925
We started him on
streptokinase to break it up.

381
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,225
Although maybe we should've
just played a few rounds

382
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,769
of <i>Savagescape 2: The Revenge,</i>

383
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,806
because that's obviously the best
way to make someone feel better.

384
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,433
You keep talking like Wilson,
your face will freeze like that.

385
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,774
However bad you think
you're gonna be in that room,

386
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,280
not being in the room is worse.

387
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,953
When she breaks up with
you, you're playing by yourself.

388
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:43,762
Honey, I'm home.

389
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,863
Just in time. The
pot roast is ready.

390
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,867
It smells wonderful.

391
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:53,265
I cured all my patients, so I came
home to spend time with Rachel.

392
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,705
And how was your day today?

393
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:58,209
It was great, Ma. I got
100% on my spelling test.

394
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,438
And 170 on my LSATs.

395
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,448
Your LSATs? You're
eight years old.

396
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,211
We've been studying together.

397
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,650
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

398
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,717
Well, that's wonderful.

399
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,519
I think Rachel deserves a treat.

400
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,061
No, thanks, Daddy. It
might spoil my appetite.

401
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,123
Well, who could that be?

402
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,535
Delivery for you, Mrs. House.

403
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,334
Happy 29th birthday.

404
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,136
I'm not 29.

405
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,739
You're not limping.

406
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,007
This isn't possible.

407
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,587
None of this is possible.

408
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,181
A girl can dream.

409
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,267
You run out of sugar?

410
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,165
I got your scans
back from today.

411
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,283
Yeah.

412
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,425
Okay.

413
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,635
What's going on?

414
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,410
Imaging shows enhancing masses

415
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,039
across multiple lobes
of Cuddy's lungs.

416
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,985
That's what kidney cancer
looks like when it metastasizes.

417
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,592
She's dead.

418
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:04,568
<i>What's up, losers? I hope
you're enjoying being alive.</i>

419
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,105
<i>Today's lesson,
natural selection.</i>

420
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,164
<i>Excellent system, made
us who we are today.</i>

421
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,766
<i>But then we invented seat
belts and grocery stores.</i>

422
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,245
<i>Things that keep idiots
and weaklings alive.</i>

423
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,108
<i>And let's be honest, most
of you don't really deserve it.</i>

424
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,686
<i>Here's to the natural order.</i>

425
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,289
<i>Yes!</i>

426
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:33,591
<i>Whoo!</i>

427
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,934
Copied from his flash
drive. Do I go to the cops?

428
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,730
Yes. "Officer, I'd like
to report an assault.

429
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,140
"The victim was
a pile of leaves."

430
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,508
It goes on. He talks
about bombing his school.

431
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,080
Which you know because you stole

432
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:50,116
his flash drive and
broke into his house.

433
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,946
How's that gonna play?

434
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,009
Ryan's not responding
to streptokinase.

435
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,214
We don't have very long before
the damage becomes irreversible.

436
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,781
So we either up his dosage, or go
into his head and get the clot out.

437
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,619
Where's House? FOREMAN:
Hopefully with Cuddy.

438
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,661
She did just get some
pretty awful news.

439
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,029
I called her. She doesn't
know where he is, either.

440
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:14,996
Have you seen House?

441
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,074
No.

442
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:22,879
He left my place last night after
you called. No one's seen him today.

443
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,950
Any idea where he'd be?

444
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,017
No.

445
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,588
And you're not
worried about that?

446
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,022
He's not good with bad news.

447
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,087
Yes, I'm worried.

448
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:37,186
But this isn't about
House, it's about Cuddy.

449
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,473
She's the one who could be dying

450
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,227
and he's trying to
make this about himself.

451
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,062
I'm not playing.

452
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,362
Okay.

453
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:49,100
She still believes
he'll show up.

454
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:54,941
He'll either get over himself
and be who she needs him to be,

455
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,709
or he won't.

456
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,596
<i>We'd like to do an embolectomy.</i>

457
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,521
We'll run a
corkscrew-shaped instrument

458
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,684
into Ryan's brain
and pull the clot out.

459
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,757
Okay. Have you
talked to him about it?

460
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:14,027
Yes. But I wanted
to see you alone.

461
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,433
I saw some videos that
Ryan made a few weeks ago.

462
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,706
He's blowing up pipe bombs and
threatening people in his school.

463
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:22,797
Oh, God!

464
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:23,918
He was probably
just messing around.

465
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,142
Our son wouldn't hurt anybody.

466
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,475
I'm not so sure.

467
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:30,276
I know this looks bad,
but Ryan's a good kid.

468
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,627
He's had a rough couple of
years since he started high school,

469
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,279
but I really think
he'll come out of it.

470
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,445
He needs help.

471
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,954
Maybe he does.
But this gets out,

472
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,888
he'll be suspended,
maybe expelled.

473
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,557
How about you focus
on keeping him alive.

474
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,786
What are you gonna do?

475
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,195
What do you think I should do?

476
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,700
So you can do the opposite?

477
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,764
There are kids all
over the country

478
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,863
doing dumb,
potentially violent things,

479
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,339
but the percentage
of them who would

480
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,774
actually kill anybody
is minuscule.

481
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,401
So I shouldn't do anything?

482
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:03,973
Hmm, while the odds are
low, the fallout could be huge,

483
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,582
tens or even hundreds of lives.

484
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:07,915
So I should call the cops.

485
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,946
Of course, over-identification with
the subject could skew the calculation

486
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,892
towards being extra
protective or alternatively...

487
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,759
You suck at this.

488
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:25,560
Hate the statistics,
not the statistician.

489
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:32,135
Give me a little more dye.

490
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,441
There's the clot.

491
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,855
It just disintegrated
when you touched it.

492
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,289
What was that thing?

493
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,297
I got a great idea
where we should go.

494
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,398
I don't want to hear it.

495
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,671
You're gonna love it.

496
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,712
Australia's Finest. It's a
great karaoke bar in Newark.

497
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:12,341
I hate karaoke.

498
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:17,049
They've got every song
by every Aussie artist,

499
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:21,593
Midnight Oil, Men at
Work, Olivia Newton John.

500
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,787
I do a mean version of <i>Physical.</i>

501
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,195
And the barbecued
shrimp is amazing.

502
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,694
What about the fries?

503
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,068
Hot, salty and delicious.

504
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,943
Talking about food
made me hungry.

505
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:48,578
You had candy in
my other dreams.

506
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,583
Means you're stressed at work.

507
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,057
All dream symbols mean
you're stressed at work.

508
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,118
Or castration anxiety.

509
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,253
No.

510
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:03,130
I was hoping you'd figure
out a way to handle all this.

511
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,935
Maybe you can't
because you're still a child.

512
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,943
I can do better.

513
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:20,481
Might be too late.

514
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,619
House?

515
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:59,917
I should have been here.

516
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,126
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,499
I knew you'd come.

518
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,106
What was that thing?

519
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,308
And why did it just dissolve
in the middle of surgery?

520
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,103
And why is his
liver shutting down?

521
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,429
That thing in his brain goes
away, the kid slips into a coma.

522
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,964
We've started him on lactulose,

523
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,014
but at the rate his liver
function is declining,

524
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,422
he'll be dead in a day.

525
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,617
<i>Should we page House?</i>

526
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,128
<i>He's busy.</i>

527
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,035
<i>House can't do
anything for her now.</i>

528
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,695
<i>We need him. By his own logic...</i>

529
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,181
<i>Patient's blood
tests were negative</i>

530
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,174
<i>for barbiturates
or acetaminophen.</i>

531
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,300
<i>He's not on a high-protein diet.</i>

532
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,936
<i>House couldn't concentrate on
the case before she was dying.</i>

533
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,208
<i>You think he's gonna
get in the game now?</i>

534
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,310
If you don't make it,

535
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,162
I won't sleep with anyone
for at least a month.

536
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,654
Make it two.

537
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:03,882
Bitch.

538
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,495
<i>AIP can cause
uraemia, tank the liver.</i>

539
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,895
<i>It causes abdominal cramping
not abdominal bleeding.</i>

540
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,118
<i>Because fucosidosis
was such a brilliant idea.</i>

541
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,396
<i>Guys.</i>

542
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,138
<i>Type 2 citrullinemia fits.</i>

543
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:24,506
<i>There are no signs of
hyperlipidemia or pancreatitis.</i>

544
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,016
<i>Those can take years to emerge.</i>

545
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,306
<i>Closest we've gotten.</i>

546
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,109
<i>Start him on IV sodium benzoate</i>

547
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,343
<i>to reduce the ammonia
levels in his blood.</i>

548
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,147
<i>Run a genetic test
for citrullinemia.</i>

549
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,574
Hi. Hi.

550
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,249
Guess who doesn't have cancer?

551
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,953
Me.

552
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,183
Also, you.

553
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,451
Actually, you for sure. Me...

554
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,755
House...

555
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,124
The tumor was benign.

556
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:07,790
It was an oncocytoma.

557
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,698
They got it out, you'll be fine.

558
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,863
Then what was in my lungs?

559
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,464
Well, once they
ruled out cancer,

560
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,567
I remembered that your
mom was allergic to antibiotics,

561
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,976
so I had them test your blood.

562
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:23,242
Your IgE levels
were through the roof.

563
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,545
Because the lung masses
were an allergic reaction.

564
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,916
So, now that you're
off the antibiotics,

565
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,955
your lungs should
clear right up.

566
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:37,091
And I brought you something.

567
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:40,223
Say hello to your tumor. Oh!

568
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,461
Wait.

569
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,389
There are so many things
that I could be afraid of,

570
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:59,851
and most of the time I manage
to lock them up behind doors.

571
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,118
Then this happens.

572
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,116
All those doors just burst open.

573
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:17,745
You just figured something out

574
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,329
about your patient, didn't you?

575
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,372
Go. Do what you do.

576
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,174
Take him off the meds.
He's got a staph infection.

577
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,878
You treated him for staph
three days ago. It didn't work.

578
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,546
Bacteria already in
his system responded.

579
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,454
But once a door's been busted
open, more just keep coming.

580
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,684
Oh, he's talking
about an abscess.

581
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,728
I got that.

582
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,910
For the cheap seats,

583
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,958
an abscess is a gooey
little cream puff of infection

584
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,970
that probably burst
when your little pride

585
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,903
and homicidal joy
took a hard foul.

586
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,607
It's good news.

587
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,166
If we can find the door.

588
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,407
I think I know where it is.

589
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:10,053
What if these aren't
from skateboarding?

590
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,985
<i>The kid has been blowing
up PVC pipe bombs.</i>

591
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:17,495
<i>If he got hit by shrapnel, the
body walls off the foreign object,</i>

592
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:20,031
<i>which, because it's plastic,
doesn't show up on imaging,</i>

593
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,192
<i>and provides a perfect
home for bacteria.</i>

594
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:25,760
<i>Antibiotics attacked the infection,
causing pieces to break off.</i>

595
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,430
<i>Some hit the liver,
one lodged in his brain</i>

596
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,065
<i>and dissolved when
Foreman touched it.</i>

597
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,606
<i>Once we drain the abscess,
and remove the shrapnel,</i>

598
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,702
<i>the antibiotics
can do their job.</i>

599
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,407
<i>He'll be fine.</i>

600
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,915
Which just leaves, what
are you gonna do now?

601
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:49,084
All right. I put the rest
of the soup in the freezer

602
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:51,686
so you'll have some for later.

603
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:53,592
Thanks for everything.

604
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,099
Yeah.

605
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,924
Here you go. I got it.

606
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,094
Okay.

607
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,069
Are you gonna tell Mom?

608
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:03,699
So she can show up
here to take care of you

609
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,573
by harassing the housekeeper

610
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,942
and criticizing your bathrobe?

611
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,039
Yeah. I think I'm
gonna wait a few years.

612
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,575
Okay.

613
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:17,783
Oh, and I moved your sleeping
pills back in the medicine cabinet,

614
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:21,257
because I just worry. Rachel
always calls them candy.

615
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:34,469
You took Vicodin.

616
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,601
When you came to my
hospital room that night,

617
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,512
you were stoned.

618
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:54,584
How did you know?

619
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,498
How did I not know?

620
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,804
How did I make myself forget
for months that you're an addict?

621
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,364
My subconscious
was trying to tell me

622
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,706
you could never get
through this without drugs.

623
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,214
It was a one-time thing.

624
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,115
It's not about the pills, House.

625
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,119
It's about what they mean.

626
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:26,280
I was scared because I
thought my girlfriend might die.

627
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,484
No.

628
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,726
You don't take Vicodin
because you're scared.

629
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,524
You take it so
you won't feel pain.

630
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:35,026
Everything you've ever
done is to avoid pain.

631
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,466
Drugs, sarcasm,

632
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,834
keeping everybody at arm's
length so no one can hurt you.

633
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,382
As opposed to
everyone else in the world

634
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:44,103
who goes looking for pain
like it's buried treasure?

635
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,173
Pain happens when you care.

636
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,744
You can't love someone

637
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:58,812
without making yourself open
to their problems, their fears.

638
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,016
And you're not
willing to do that.

639
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,221
I came to be with you.

640
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,026
But you weren't
with me, not really.

641
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:10,926
I wanted to be.

642
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,930
Well, that's not enough.

643
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,176
I can do better.

644
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,678
I don't think you can.

645
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,759
You'll choose yourself over
everybody else, over and over again,

646
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,526
because that's just who you are.

647
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:51,141
I'm sorry.

648
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,371
No. No, no, no. Don't. Don't.

649
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,912
I thought I could
do this. Don't.

650
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,607
Please don't.

651
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,410
Goodbye, House.
