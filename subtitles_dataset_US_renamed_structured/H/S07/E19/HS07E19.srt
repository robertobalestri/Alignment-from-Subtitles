1
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,003
Cranial nerves.

2
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:47,781
On old Olympus' towering tops, a
friendly Viking grew vines and hops.

3
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,248
Olfactory, optic, oculomotor...

4
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,376
vagus, accessory.

5
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,786
Causes of edema.
Alive. Allergic...

6
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,552
Differential for
swollen scrotum.

7
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,221
Theaters, English
spelling. Torsion,

8
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,289
hernia...

9
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,294
Epididymal cyst. S... Syphilis.

10
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,099
Enough with the drilling.

11
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,139
We're third year, no more exams.

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,106
You don't have to
face House every day.

13
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,699
And after today, neither do you.

14
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,436
Here's to no more
coming home in tears.

15
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,410
It's kind of like coming to the
end of an extreme roller coaster,

16
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,449
even with the terror,
nausea and whiplash,

17
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,421
I'm a little sad that it's over.

18
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,616
Let's go.

19
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,471
You got your procedure log?

20
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,724
Oh, I'm not quite done, I still
have one more lumbar puncture.

21
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:36,889
It's due today.

22
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,900
Unless you wanna blow off
becoming a doctor and get another PhD.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,591
I know. I'm gonna get it done.

24
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,280
I thought you'd have that thing
finished, like, six months ago.

25
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,897
I've been busy.

26
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,846
Oh, come on, Cruz. Let me
do this. I need it for my log.

27
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,291
Wait, you aren't done yet?

28
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:05,951
I've been busy.

29
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,754
What's in it for me?

30
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,326
The satisfaction that comes
from helping out a classmate?

31
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,165
How about cash?

32
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,360
Have you talked to House?

33
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,469
It's 6:00 a.m. He won't
be in for a few hours.

34
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,270
I keep a roll of
quarters in the car.

35
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,307
I just turned in my log,
and guess what I saw?

36
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,971
There's an opening in
the diagnostics department.

37
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:27,708
House wants an intern?

38
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,340
He's never had one before.

39
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,049
You got to figure. He
doesn't want an intern,

40
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,877
he wants you.

41
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,831
Uh, you must be Dr. Thirteen.

42
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,264
Remy Hadley. Nice to meet you.

43
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,428
You're back!

44
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,835
Hi. Hi.

45
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,838
What the hell happened to you?

46
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,222
Why did you lie
about going to Rome?

47
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:38,685
You'd lie too if you bottomed
out and ended up in drug rehab.

48
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,913
Thank you, House, for
respecting my privacy.

49
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,918
What a perfect
reminder that I'm back.

50
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,653
I didn't even know
you had a problem.

51
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,163
Loved ones are
always the last to know.

52
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,330
Loved ones and robotic,
estranged ex-boyfriends.

53
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,868
Our patient is Kendall Pearson,
16-year-old aspiring pirate.

54
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,482
She's that Canadian
kid who's trying to be

55
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,983
the youngest person
to sail around the world.

56
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,408
She collapsed yesterday
during a practice run.

57
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,240
Luckily for us,
cameras were there.

58
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,415
Her corporate sponsors want
us to check that she's seaworthy

59
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:12,782
before the clock strikes,
"You're too old to set a record."

60
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,711
Gives us three days.

61
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,617
You've still only
got one, right?

62
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,117
Uh, last day as a student.

63
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,855
Could be simple dehydration.

64
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,023
She told the Coast
Guard she had felt dizzy.

65
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,432
Pulse and BP were normal
at the time of the rescue.

66
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,299
It's not dehydration.

67
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:34,204
What about your internship,
did you sign up this morning?

68
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,907
Actually, I'm still deciding.

69
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:42,280
Maybe she had a seizure and
that's what caused her collapse.

70
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,408
Coast Guard reports there's
no sign of head trauma.

71
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,047
What about her back?

72
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,248
Look, right before the collapse,

73
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,133
she hit the small of
her back on the railing.

74
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,386
Damage to the adrenal glands

75
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,121
caused adrenal insufficiencies,
which caused the collapse.

76
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,389
Nice.

77
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:00,658
Blood draws every 15 minutes
for four hours, to track her cortisol.

78
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,229
Masters, there's no hurry.

79
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,070
There's no wrong choices.

80
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,498
At least, that's what they tell
people who make crappy choices.

81
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,408
What's with the sudden
interest in her future?

82
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,409
You know, a blacksmith
who spends this much time

83
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,177
hammering out a new
blade from raw Jell-O,

84
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,650
he gets curious about
who ends up wielding it.

85
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,632
No reason to be curious unless
you're interested in wielding it yourself.

86
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,649
You want her to intern here.

87
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,988
And you're considering this?

88
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,756
Before I make my decision,

89
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,130
I still have one more
LP I need to get,

90
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,526
so, I'd like to go to the ER.

91
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,773
Thirteen, why don't you take
Masters to do the blood draws.

92
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,471
You can remind her about
all the perks of working for me.

93
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,478
Behind the deck, port side.

94
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,354
If her adrenal hormone levels are
consistently low, we'll replace them.

95
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,817
You'll be ready to
launch Thursday.

96
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,654
Great.

97
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,223
Inside cabin, facing the bow.

98
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,559
Sorry, K, I need to borrow Mom.

99
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,724
The sponsors?

100
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,144
No, Couric's people
kicking up a fuss

101
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,500
about rescheduling
the interview.

102
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,166
Uh, I can take over.

103
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,572
Ceiling of the galley.

104
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,807
Right.

105
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,246
The last time I was on a boat
was my freshman mixer in college.

106
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,685
I didn't so much mix as hurl.

107
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,150
Too much to drink?

108
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,713
No, I was 13.

109
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,485
And in college?

110
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,857
Yeah, I know. Weird.

111
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,760
I was thinking cool.

112
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,927
We'll be back for the next
blood draw in 15 minutes.

113
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,524
Unless, of course,
you'd like to stay

114
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,508
and continue bonding
over your lost childhoods.

115
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,568
Listen, I have a ton of prep
work to do to be ready to launch.

116
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,354
Is there any way we
can speed the tests up?

117
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,670
Mmm, I'm afraid not.

118
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,538
Unless you're up for
getting on a treadmill.

119
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,379
We could stress her body,
see if her adrenals respond.

120
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,350
It would only take half an hour.

121
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,477
Hmm.

122
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,215
It's about an LP.

123
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,122
Go. I'll handle this.

124
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,859
Um, Dr. Cuddy, can I come by your
office later? I'd love to get some advice.

125
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,471
Uh, I'm in meetings
all afternoon.

126
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,631
Try me tomorrow.

127
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,867
Tomorrow...

128
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,543
This is my last day
as a medical student,

129
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,308
so I've got this
decision to make,

130
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,747
probably the biggest
decision of my career,

131
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:33,583
which means maybe the
biggest decision of my life.

132
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,885
Although, I guess,
if I get married...

133
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,817
House has opened
up an internship.

134
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,520
You do realize, if you take it,

135
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,290
he'll probably end
up firing you again.

136
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:45,626
He's always hired me back.

137
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:50,761
And he'll continue mocking and
insulting you whatever chance he gets.

138
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,139
It's certainly toughened me up.

139
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,787
You're trying to get me to
say good things about him.

140
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,245
No.

141
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,976
I'm trying to make you make your
own decision and leave me alone.

142
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:09,185
Working with House is great
and it sucks, often simultaneously.

143
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,436
Most people can't work
in that environment.

144
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,391
Question is, can you?

145
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,526
Thanks, Dr. Cuddy.

146
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,014
You paged me down here
and now you're doing my LP?

147
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,578
Got bored waiting.

148
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,779
It's been two minutes.

149
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,483
This is your 11th. Fourteenth.

150
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,626
Listen, your roommate, is she
hooking up with that resident?

151
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,654
I gotta find House.

152
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,051
Rehab? It's a great cover story.

153
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,183
Now, I can't ever drink
around those guys again,

154
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,887
thus eliminating my
main bond with Chase.

155
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,772
Save the attitude for
someone who didn't

156
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,389
just get you your
medical license back.

157
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,590
Price you pay.

158
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,547
There's a chicken
in your office.

159
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,329
No, there isn't.

160
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,929
You lied about rehab?

161
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,674
Oh, great. Relax.

162
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,075
She's completely honest but
also completely boring. Watch this.

163
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,339
Don't tell anyone.

164
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:40,939
Of course not.

165
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,745
You did an LP? Why
didn't you page me?

166
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,049
Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,362
Did you want to do one of
those? You should've spoken up.

168
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,883
You want the job or not?

169
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,687
Um... I... After
careful consideration,

170
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:01,064
I have decided to accept
your offer for an internship.

171
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,097
Great.

172
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,697
My department has a
slightly different procedure log.

173
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,806
Uh, you forged the last
one. I only did nine LPs.

174
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,955
Do you know how to do an LP?

175
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:13,979
Of course.

176
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,175
Do you know how to do
nine LPs and say it was 10?

177
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,219
It's time to grow up.

178
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,953
Turn that in, the job is yours.

179
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,220
Stop staring blankly and go.

180
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:32,123
No doubt something horrible
has just happened to our patient.

181
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,587
Her hand turned completely
blue during the treadmill test.

182
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,874
We put her on vasodilators,

183
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,210
restored enough blood flow
so she won't lose any fingers.

184
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,840
Rules out adrenal insufficiency.

185
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,543
Where's House? He
said to meet him here.

186
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,311
His chicken's gone.

187
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,285
Probably on the balcony.

188
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,481
You knew he had a chicken?

189
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,218
How come... HOUSE: Down here!

190
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:04,929
Loss of consciousness
plus she's slowly turning blue.

191
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,327
Have we ruled out magical gum?

192
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,493
Low cardiac output
can cause both.

193
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,833
Patient possibly
has cardiomyopathy,

194
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,967
possibly caused by
mercury poisoning

195
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,803
from all the tuna
fish she eats at sea.

196
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,572
Uh, why are you putting
chicken footprints on the floor?

197
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,172
That clever bastard Wilson
got hold of an Australorp.

198
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,678
Hello.

199
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,914
The quietest and
calmest of all the chickens.

200
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,180
Damn him!

201
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,420
Mercury poisoning is out. Red
blood cells have normal morphology.

202
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,326
Raynaud's. Vasospasm in the
ulnar artery would explain the hand.

203
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,161
But not the loss
of consciousness.

204
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,030
Cerebral vasospasm
explains both.

205
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,263
Cerebral vasospasm makes sense.

206
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,669
Take Thirteen, give the patient

207
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,172
a calcium channel
blocker infusion

208
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,332
in the basilar artery.

209
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,641
Masters.

210
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,545
Thought you were
gonna turn that in.

211
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,750
I'm a bit busy with my patient.

212
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,352
You're not busy now.

213
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:24,902
Masters.

214
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,125
Still haven't
turned in your log?

215
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,740
Still haven't gotten my 10th LP.

216
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,514
I was thinking. Maybe you
should take House's internship.

217
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,067
First you act like
it's the equivalent

218
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,680
of volunteering to
be water-boarded,

219
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,090
and now you're supporting it?

220
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,519
You're weird.

221
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,977
You make paper airplanes for fun

222
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,397
and hang them from the ceiling.

223
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,062
You have a membership
to the Einstein Museum

224
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,604
and an overbearing
obsession with facial symmetry.

225
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,298
It indicates freedom
from disease.

226
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,033
We're biologically
programmed to...

227
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,544
Point is, you rub
people the wrong way.

228
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,709
But House is okay with
your lack of bedside manner,

229
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,113
he's okay with your willingness

230
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,616
to argue any point, with anyone,

231
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,447
even if they outrank you,

232
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,384
he's okay with your
peculiar fashion sense.

233
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,082
It's peculiar?

234
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,124
House doesn't think
you're weird, which is weird.

235
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,552
But good weird.

236
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,354
Is that a chicken?

237
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,898
I think it's an Australorp.

238
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,272
I'm gonna go
check on my patient.

239
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,196
Can someone please explain to me

240
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,553
what House and Wilson are
doing with those chickens?

241
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:44,967
They have a bet to
see who can keep

242
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,302
a chicken in the
hospital the longest

243
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,686
without getting
busted by security.

244
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,093
Advancing past
the vertebral artery.

245
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,258
And why are they doing this?

246
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,053
The place they bought
them only had one pig.

247
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,268
I'm glad you're gonna be
sticking around after today.

248
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,103
Really? You want me to stay?

249
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,734
It's good to add a different
perspective to the department.

250
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,247
Someone who still remembers
there are rules other than House's.

251
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,183
If I don't play by House's
rules, he won't let me in.

252
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,817
Find a way around them.

253
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,189
I'd have to lie to him,
which is still lying.

254
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,992
Lying about a lie, that's
practically telling the truth.

255
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,124
Catheter is in. Start the
calcium channel blocker drip.

256
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,860
Means I need another LP.

257
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,664
Luckily, I know where you
can get one. You good here?

258
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,102
Let's go.

259
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,311
Decent stick, very smooth.

260
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,177
Sounds like you've
had a few of these.

261
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,475
Suppose that comes
with the territory.

262
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,516
I have Huntington's. No need to
get hushed and solemn about it.

263
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,623
Why are you lying about rehab?

264
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,057
Because the real
reason I was gone

265
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,959
is not something
I want to share.

266
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,791
Couldn't you just say that?

267
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,734
Should be enough for
Foreman and the others.

268
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,035
How long have you worked here?

269
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,538
House's people have
personalities that range from nosy

270
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,804
to "Pardon me while I
do this cavity search."

271
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,678
Do you think there's room for
someone who does things differently?

272
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,376
No.

273
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,249
Not unless House decides
that's what he wants.

274
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:31,062
During catheter removal, I got a
good look at her cerebral midline.

275
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,530
Her pineal gland is calcified.

276
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,032
Case closed.

277
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,695
We'll start her on hormone
therapy and ship her out.

278
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,567
I handed in my log.

279
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,535
On your way to do that,

280
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,772
did you happen to stop
and give Thirteen an LP?

281
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,110
Thirteen's stiff
gait, small pupils,

282
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,908
and the raging headache
she's hiding gave you away.

283
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,946
Yes, and I still broke a rule.

284
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,587
My rule.

285
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,086
I told you to defy the
Man, not this man.

286
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,126
Why is it so wrong
that I don't like to cheat?

287
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,623
Can we go? No.

288
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,397
Not liking it is fine,

289
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,733
not doing what you don't like
makes you an eight-year-old

290
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,135
and wastes your potential.

291
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,082
You want me to be like
you, it's not gonna happen.

292
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,438
That's the last thing I want,

293
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,443
'cause then neither one
of us would be exceptional.

294
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,307
You think I'm exceptional?

295
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,608
Not anymore.

296
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,779
I can do my job
without compromising.

297
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,113
No, you can't. 'Cause
I'm not gonna let you.

298
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,715
Internship's gone.

299
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,728
It's time for Masters
to say goodbye.

300
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,724
Enjoy being a
surgeon. You'll be fine.

301
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:02,752
Surgery.

302
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,482
Anatomy.

303
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,424
The branches off
the subclavian artery.

304
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,992
VITamin C and D. VIT.

305
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:14,864
VITamin. V, vertebral,
I, internal carotid.

306
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,333
Internal thoracic.

307
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:21,436
Internal thoracic.

308
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:26,707
T, thyrocervical,
C, costocervical...

309
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,484
Martha M. Masters.

310
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,616
That's me!

311
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,983
I'm gonna be a surgeon.

312
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,460
Next!

313
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,868
Welcome to your surgical
internship at PPTH.

314
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,364
The senior residents
stand behind you.

315
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,631
We'll all get to know
each other soon enough.

316
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,498
Grab a donut and get to work.

317
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,801
We're out of donuts.

318
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,807
Then get to work.

319
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,477
Little oozing.

320
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,390
- Isolated the left subclavian.
- Suction.

321
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,971
You gotta do better than
that. Can't see a thing.

322
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,829
Push calcium chloride.

323
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:23,703
It will supercharge the platelets
and increase the clotting.

324
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,204
Two amps of calcium chloride.

325
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,103
Tell the blood bank to send up
three units of packed red cells.

326
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,111
The field is clear.

327
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,112
Nice.

328
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,862
Generally speaking,

329
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,458
pledges aren't supposed to
talk unless asked a question.

330
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,263
That's because,
generally speaking,

331
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,132
pledges don't have
anything to say.

332
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,901
Um... "KP."

333
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,970
Is that patient Kendall Pearson?
I thought she was discharged.

334
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,307
Mmm. It's a House case.

335
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,707
I never know what
that guy is up to.

336
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,480
I want you to scrub
in on my lung harvest.

337
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,047
But it's my first day.

338
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,551
Yes, I know. I was there. Be
scrubbed and ready in 15 minutes.

339
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,248
What happened? Last I
heard, you were going home.

340
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,416
Kendall collapsed
in the parking lot.

341
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,655
They're doing something
called a sympathectomy.

342
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,432
She must have had
a hypertensive crisis

343
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,093
caused by neural
overstimulation of her kidneys,

344
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,966
so they're cutting the nerves.

345
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,097
It's like cutting the
gas line to an engine.

346
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,236
Yeah. Sounds like
what Dr. Taub said.

347
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,675
Said it's basic surgery but...

348
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,076
It is.

349
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,013
You should still be on pace
for a launch in 36 hours.

350
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,045
Her mom's packing the boat now.

351
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,416
I'm supposed to
pick up some dry ice.

352
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,616
But...

353
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,617
Nothing you can do for her here.

354
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,700
Um...

355
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,363
We're just trying to help our
daughter reach her dream.

356
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,037
She's different.

357
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,178
So, you have to be different.

358
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,812
I'll make sure she's okay.

359
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,883
Thanks.

360
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:07,491
You can see the full lobular
structure of the left lung.

361
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,446
Bifurcate innominate artery. I've
never seen one of those before.

362
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,766
Hold this, Masters.

363
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,066
Rib spreaders.

364
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,707
You guys okay if I pull a circulating
nurse? We got a train wreck in OR 10.

365
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,004
You got it.

366
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,357
Proximal end attached.

367
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,158
Can someone take
the retractors for me?

368
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,514
Not really.

369
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,943
I have to use the bathroom.

370
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,578
I know you're a rookie,
but you gotta be kidding.

371
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,167
- I'm not.
- It can wait.

372
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,072
I'm gonna have an accident.

373
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,254
Next one in line, grab it.

374
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,796
What's wrong?

375
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,349
Hypotension. Low cardiac output.

376
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:48,500
Float the Swan.

377
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,099
<i>Don't you have your own surgery?</i>

378
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,505
I took a break. I told
them I had to pee.

379
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:55,771
<i>You lied.</i>

380
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,877
<i>Small one but
it's a gateway lie.</i>

381
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,798
I care about the patient.

382
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,046
<i>Another lie.</i>

383
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,919
<i>You care about
being exceptional.</i>

384
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,958
I told her dad I was
gonna take care of her.

385
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,290
<i>A third lie. Welcome
to the slippery slope.</i>

386
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,390
RA is 8. Equalization
of pressures.

387
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,456
I think she has
restrictive pericarditis.

388
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,367
Add that to a
calcified pineal gland...

389
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:21,631
<i>When is a calcified pineal
gland not a calcified pineal gland?</i>

390
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,351
<i>I realize technically
it's never, but...</i>

391
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,655
When it's a granuloma.

392
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,421
It's Wegener's. We
should start her on steroids.

393
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,005
But she had a high CK.
Wegener's wouldn't explain that...

394
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,141
Dehydration does.

395
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,318
Yes. But the calcified
pineal could be sarcoidosis.

396
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,753
<i>You had me at, "I had to pee."</i>

397
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:42,117
<i>But Thirteen's right. Start her on
three-fold immunosuppressants.</i>

398
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,821
<i>Masters, you want
to fight me on this,</i>

399
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,899
<i>fill out a consult form
so you can stick around.</i>

400
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:47,990
<i>Welcome back.</i>

401
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,124
I'm not back!

402
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,928
I'll just be staying
for this case.

403
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,410
<i>You got really good
at this lying thing.</i>

404
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:13,057
Hope it was one hell of a whiz.

405
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,593
I ran into Dr. House.

406
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:19,223
He requested a surgical
consult for his patient.

407
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,665
House never asks for a consult.

408
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,832
Something about this case,
he needed a little more help.

409
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,907
First day of your
surgical internship,

410
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,442
you want to be loaned
out to another department.

411
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,671
Interesting career move.

412
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,576
Drop the form by my office.

413
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:39,142
Don't stay away too long. I'm already
well on my way to forgetting you.

414
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,488
How about I take both you
lovely ladies out for a drink?

415
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,423
I'd love to except I
think you're a cretin.

416
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,528
And the last time she was
at a bar was ballet class.

417
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,692
I didn't take...

418
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,428
Oh.

419
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:58,596
That's funny.

420
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,998
I'm gonna stay and run a few
extra tests on House's patient.

421
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,542
This one lab value
doesn't make sense to me.

422
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,635
You're back with House? Mmm.

423
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,977
Just this one case.
I'm not staying.

424
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,176
I would kill for a
chance to work with him,

425
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,720
like, literally skin you and
wear you as a disguise.

426
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,712
You want yours extra
crispy or original recipe?

427
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,637
Chickens!

428
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,878
You ever get sick from poultry?

429
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,238
Um...

430
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,406
A few months ago,

431
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,282
from this pheasant-in-a-can
my dad got me as a joke.

432
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,529
You think that's why I'm sick?

433
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:31,388
I think that can was chock-full of a
bacteria called salmonella enteritis.

434
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,065
Likes to hang out in the bones.

435
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,589
Let me know if any of
this is tender or painful.

436
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,900
This bacteria thing, is
this good news or bad?

437
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:45,233
Well, if I'm right, that means
all you'll need are antibiotics

438
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,297
and you'll be, well, shipshape.

439
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,769
Sorry, couldn't resist.

440
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,774
Did you always know
that sailing was it for you,

441
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,970
that it was the right thing?

442
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,320
Didn't even start till I was 10.

443
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:05,323
And at first, I was not a fan.

444
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,586
Certainly there's plenty
not to like about sailing.

445
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,890
But now that
you're so into it...

446
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,863
Oh, no, there's still plenty
of things I hate about it.

447
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,560
I hate being wet,
I hate being cold,

448
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,387
I hate eating nothing
but freeze-dried food.

449
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,203
That's quite the endorsement.

450
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,274
Sailing is amazing
but it doesn't mean

451
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,376
I love every second on the boat.

452
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,641
Doing what you love means
dealing with things you don't.

453
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,680
If there were nothing to
overcome, it might not be that...

454
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,284
Ow!

455
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,821
Salmonella enteritis
is a nice catch.

456
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,988
Thanks. Starting on
the soft tissue windows.

457
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,733
Once this case is over,
you going back to surgery?

458
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,495
That's the plan.

459
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,563
I think that's a mistake.

460
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,152
I think you should
go back to surgery.

461
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,571
I just said I was.

462
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,044
No, you said it was your plan.

463
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,240
Which means House might be right

464
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,476
and you might be
lying to yourself.

465
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,979
Would it be so terrible?

466
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,989
You chose House over surgery.

467
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,752
And my time here
changed me in ways

468
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,090
that not everyone in my life
thought was for the better.

469
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,494
No masses. Moving
on to bone windows.

470
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,530
Are those people right?

471
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:32,208
I think when you do change,
it's not so simple to go back.

472
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,103
There.

473
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,007
In the humerus.

474
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:42,177
Doesn't look like an infection.

475
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,849
That's because it
looks like cancer.

476
00:28:56,268 --> 00:29:00,262
You have a lymphoid sarcoma.
A cancer in the bone in your arm.

477
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:05,536
Am I going to be okay?

478
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:07,902
It's a treatable cancer.

479
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,744
But part of that treatment
involves amputating your arm.

480
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:13,642
I'm sorry.

481
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:15,814
There's nothing else?

482
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,350
Um...

483
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,882
We can do chemo and
radiation, after the amputation.

484
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,896
I don't mean after,
I mean, instead of.

485
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,296
If I leave soon, I still have
time to break the record.

486
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,732
Honey, you can't be serious.

487
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,099
I feel fine.

488
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,747
Last night, they thought
it was an infection.

489
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,071
We know it's cancer. We
ran the biopsy three times.

490
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,076
You don't know how fast...
Postponing the surgery

491
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,424
could increase the likelihood
that the cancer will spread.

492
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,108
Kendall, you need to think
about what the doctor's saying.

493
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,241
I'm thinking about this sail,

494
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,515
like I have since I was 10.
Don't take this away from me.

495
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,454
It's just a month, I can
take extra precautions.

496
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,492
I'll Skype you every day. And I
can fly back if something goes wrong.

497
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,489
She'll be risking her life.

498
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,924
I think we need to
discuss this as a family.

499
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,496
You're considering this?

500
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:09,335
Your daughter's condition...

501
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,170
Thank you, Dr. Masters.

502
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,637
She's not budging. She
wants to launch tomorrow.

503
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:48,138
She's a minor. You sign the
consent form, we can do the surgery.

504
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,979
Amputation can
be an emotional...

505
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,575
She's talked my wife
into agreeing with her.

506
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,379
One parent's
signature is enough.

507
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,360
She needs you to be a parent.

508
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,356
You're asking me
to blow up my family.

509
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,332
I'm asking you to
save your family.

510
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,434
On her first solo
Atlantic crossing,

511
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,374
she scheduled a court date to
become an emancipated minor.

512
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,942
She'll do it again.

513
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,914
And she'll win.

514
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,947
She's gonna do what she's
gonna do with or without me.

515
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,919
I'd rather have it be with.

516
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:53,968
I'm stuck.

517
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,877
No, you're not. Case is over.

518
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:57,972
You're back to surgery.

519
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:02,477
Fetch!

520
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:06,621
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

521
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,825
Good boy.

522
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,632
No one will stop Kendall's
sail. You need to step in.

523
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,234
Sign on the door says
I'm a diagnostician.

524
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,667
Cool diagnosis
means I'm finished.

525
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:19,761
She could die.

526
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,040
Pretty sure the law
of the land states

527
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,143
that everyone has
the right to be an idiot.

528
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,753
I think it's the
second amendment.

529
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,904
Fetch!

530
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,240
Bring it here. Good boy.

531
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,144
Who's a good boy?

532
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,015
You are constantly
railing against hypocrisy,

533
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,418
forcing people
to face the truth.

534
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:39,452
This time, nothing?

535
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,424
Yeah, because
they've faced the truth.

536
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:46,261
And made a decision that will
in all likelihood kill their daughter.

537
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,262
I'm fine with that.

538
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,997
I wanted a diagnosis, I got it.

539
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,497
What do you want?

540
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,898
I don't want her to die.

541
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,671
Break the rules.

542
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,309
I can't.

543
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,252
So coloring inside the
lines is more important to you

544
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,084
than saving this girl's life.

545
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,455
I was wrong about one thing.

546
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,252
You are not exceptional.

547
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,454
And fetch!

548
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,623
Oh, ho, ho!

549
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,031
Who's the good boy?

550
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,965
Good boy. Good boy.

551
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,466
Dr. Wilson?

552
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,808
I'd like to get your advice
about a cancer patient.

553
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,609
Kendall Pearson?

554
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,616
Oncology rounds.
Everyone's talking about it.

555
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,707
Ow!

556
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,184
Are you okay?

557
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,719
Yeah. My back's acting up.

558
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,015
Oh.

559
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,585
Um...

560
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:46,885
So...

561
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,351
What would you do?

562
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,795
I would keep trying to
convince her to have the surgery.

563
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,491
And if she kept saying no?

564
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:58,133
I would just keep...
Mmm... Keep... Keep trying.

565
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,446
I know there's a
chicken under there.

566
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,866
Oh, thank God.

567
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,176
He already pecked through
one pair of my loafers.

568
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:15,780
So, that's all you'd do?

569
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,284
That's all you can do.

570
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,548
Is it?

571
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,361
Isn't that House's chicken?

572
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,078
Disgusting beasts. I don't know
why I ever agreed to this bet.

573
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,300
So call it off.

574
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,639
And lose $20?

575
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,906
Listen.

576
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,915
House was in the exact
same situation Kendall's in.

577
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,076
He needed surgery
but he didn't want it.

578
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,177
Once he was in a
medically-induced coma,

579
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,723
his girlfriend signed the
consent form as his proxy.

580
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,783
They went ahead with
the surgery against his will.

581
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,488
Probably saved his life.

582
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,196
So, she did the right thing?

583
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,200
Depends on who you ask.

584
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,895
Fetch!

585
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,204
No! No!

586
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,111
Excuse me!

587
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,776
Who's responsible
for this chicken?

588
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,215
Does anyone know
who owns the chicken?

589
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:30,092
That bird belongs to
Dr. Gregory House.

590
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,702
You need to do the surgery.

591
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,104
I will. Now.

592
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,565
We've been through
this. I'm leaving today.

593
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,109
It's a stupid record.

594
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,942
It's not about the record.

595
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,043
I used to race
against other people.

596
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,312
I could have the slowest
boat in the fleet and I'd win.

597
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,752
So it's about being
better than everyone else?

598
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:32,753
It has nothing to do
with anybody, except me.

599
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,161
The other racers
would think I was crazy.

600
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,832
I'd set off on some tacking
angle that made no sense to them

601
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,800
because they couldn't
see what I saw.

602
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,801
I could sense the changes in the
wind before they even happened.

603
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,802
At the top of the game,
you play by different rules.

604
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,814
Medicine's gonna
burn a little bit.

605
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,123
Bradycardic arrest.
Third-degree heart block.

606
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:30,809
Likely a paraneoplastic
syndrome.

607
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:34,216
Need to get her to the OR for a
pacemaker and plasmapheresis.

608
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,988
What's going on?

609
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,959
The cancer is causing
her heart to slow down.

610
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,393
We have to get her to
the OR and treat her.

611
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:45,987
This is what I
was worried about.

612
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,033
If this had happened at
sea, she would be dead.

613
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,528
Oh, my God!

614
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,633
We need you to
sign the consent form,

615
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,697
authorize us to
amputate her arm.

616
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,528
Subclavian access established.

617
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,355
- Temporary pacer ready.
- Don't need it.

618
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,517
Push calcium chloride.
It'll fix the heart block.

619
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,199
Bradycardia was me.

620
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,064
You did this?

621
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:32,170
Her parents signed
the consent form.

622
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,241
Amputate her arm.

623
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:56,760
What happened?

624
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,642
You had a cardiac episode that
required us to bring you into the OR.

625
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,006
That crisis resolved, but...

626
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,443
What did you do?

627
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,640
What did you do?

628
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:13,082
During the surgery, we found
cancer in a lymph node in your neck.

629
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,585
So you cut off my arm?

630
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,692
The cancer was already
spreading. It had to be done.

631
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,654
I told you I didn't want this.

632
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,157
If we had waited until after the
sail was over, you would have died.

633
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:27,156
That record, that
was everything.

634
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:30,997
It wasn't everything.
You have a life, a future...

635
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,737
You weren't supposed
to do this! How could you?

636
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,637
Because we love you.

637
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:37,833
I hate you.

638
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,006
I hate both of you.

639
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,440
Okay.

640
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,121
My arm...

641
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,072
My arm!

642
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:12,676
Dr. Masters.

643
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,145
Thank you.

644
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,873
Someone has got
their pouty face on.

645
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,484
I did things no doctor in
their right mind would do.

646
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,045
Good.

647
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,214
I manipulated,
lied, forged, stole.

648
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:01,083
I don't want to know the
specifics. I might be called to testify.

649
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:10,059
I broke the rules because
I believed I was right.

650
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,295
You were right.

651
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,395
Then why don't I
feel good or satisfied?

652
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,405
Instead I just feel
like throwing up.

653
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,031
And you're following me to ask

654
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,373
how I break the rules and
maintain my rosy demeanor?

655
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,381
I didn't do it to be happy.
I just thought I would be.

656
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,820
Well, you can't always
get what you want.

657
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,549
To the victor, the spoils.

658
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,985
Your bird recover okay?

659
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,352
Physically, yes.

660
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,918
Emotionally, it
was a long night.

661
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,161
Next week, ferrets?

662
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,362
House.

663
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,831
I can't do it.

664
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,077
I'm leaving.

665
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,740
Surgery?

666
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:06,054
I don't know what I'm gonna do
but I do know I don't want to be here.

667
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,101
Nothing will ever
be simple again.

668
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,637
I'm fine with that.

669
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,289
Oh!
