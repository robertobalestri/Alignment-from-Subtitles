1
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,581
<i>Okay, you're doing
good. You're doing good.</i>

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,803
<i>You still got the thing...
The stupid thing is still on!</i>

3
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,252
You don't have
to yell at me, Mom.

4
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,644
I've been in labor for over a
dozen hours, Justine, I have to yell.

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,738
I thought you were gonna
miss the whole thing.

6
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,182
Mom, it's a three-hour drive.

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:20,015
That's why I called you
yesterday after my water broke.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,282
I'm sorry, a partner just
dropped a brief on my desk.

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,449
You're doing good.

10
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,288
Yeah. Right.

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,794
I remember what it's
like, but family comes first.

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,262
I need you to keep
pushing, I can see her head.

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,908
All right, come on,
we're doing good here.

14
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,230
Get this, this is what I wanted.

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,359
Gross.

16
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,699
Crowning. Are you getting this?

17
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:40,171
Kind of. Well, not
the actual vagina.

18
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,435
It's your baby sister!

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,171
It's my mother's vagina.

20
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:45,405
Freeing the shoulders.

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,047
There she is! Oh,
my God! There she is!

22
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,175
Get the NICU team in here.

23
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:52,445
Baby's hypoxic.

24
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,714
Is something wrong?

25
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,717
What's going on?
I don't know, Mom.

26
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,155
My baby! How's my baby?

27
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,052
- What are you doing?
- O2 sats are low 80.

28
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,220
Respiratory rate...

29
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,662
What are they saying?

30
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,063
I can't tell.

31
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,228
Find out what's going on!

32
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,170
You need to back
up. Turn that off.

33
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,365
She's not responding.

34
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,565
What's happening?

35
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,951
She's not responding.
She's not...

36
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,001
What's wrong with my baby?

37
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,636
Why doesn't someone talk to me?

38
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,708
Cancel your dinner plans.

39
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,343
Short on medical history,
she's only eight hours old.

40
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,184
What she's not
short on is doctors.

41
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,588
Unfortunately, none of them have
been able to solve her breathing problems.

42
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,852
Immature lungs?

43
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,225
Full term. And they gave her surfactant.
Looks like they're fully developed.

44
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,060
Need you a minute.

45
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,429
Silent reading
time till I get back.

46
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,039
My nanny called.

47
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:23,271
Her daughter has a dance
recital tonight. She can't work late.

48
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,745
And I have a board
meeting tonight.

49
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,973
That's a problem.

50
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,074
My mother can't come.
She has a cooking class.

51
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,104
You've really got a problem.

52
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,986
If only there were some
mature adult in my life

53
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,989
who could pinch hit in
emergencies like this.

54
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,558
Would love to.
But I'm catching up

55
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,821
on my back issues
of <i>Nudist Circus.</i>

56
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,206
You should see what the fat
lady's got under her big top.

57
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,291
All I need is a warm body. And
she'll be asleep the entire time.

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,520
I got a sick baby here who
needs me. Yours is healthy.

59
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,332
You can deal with
your team by phone.

60
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,482
How about a little something
extra when you get home?

61
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,566
I'm not bargaining
sex for babysitting.

62
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,939
Besides, you owe me.

63
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,500
For what? Sex.

64
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,277
I still don't see a female
doctor in that room.

65
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,680
It's making me very unhappy.

66
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,316
Fine. Out of the
goodness of my heart.

67
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,648
Which will make you happy,

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,086
which will make
you desire me more,

69
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,919
which will turn into more sex.

70
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,786
Be at my place at 7:00.

71
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:23,032
The sperm donor card from the
father did note a history of asthma.

72
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,663
What if her lung problems
are not coming from her lungs?

73
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,332
Her heart looks fine.

74
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,206
Her liver enzymes are elevated.

75
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,177
When the liver fails, it
stops producing proteins.

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,808
Specifically the ones that keep
your plasma inside your blood vessels

77
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,943
and outside your lungs.

78
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,721
Fix the liver, she'll have enough breath
to keep the entire ward up all night.

79
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:48,485
Foreman, you need
to stay after school.

80
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,863
I apparently need to apologize.

81
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,401
Last week, I should not
have gone over your head

82
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,341
and allowed Chase to
hire a new team member.

83
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,403
So go hire someone who liked
<i>The Bridges of Madison County.</i>

84
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,373
You want me to
hire a white girl?

85
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,551
Go find a woman.

86
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,950
And wipe that self-satisfied
grin off your face.

87
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,421
This'll be quick. I've been
interviewing people all week.

88
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,934
Have it narrowed
down to two candidates.

89
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,187
Narrow it down to one,

90
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,626
before Cuddy starts
withholding sex.

91
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,963
She hasn't said
anything to me about that.

92
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,931
I said wipe the grin.

93
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,141
Yeah, she's fine. I can hear
her breathing in the monitor.

94
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,243
I just checked. I'm
checking every 10 minutes.

95
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,810
Fine, I'll check again.

96
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,923
Aw, she's so cute
when she's asleep.

97
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:00,127
You should see this. She's
got one hand over her head.

98
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,162
Okay. Well, you take
as long as you need.

99
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,836
I'm thirsty.

100
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,482
Your mommy says
no, 'cause she's mean.

101
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,949
If it was up to me...

102
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,618
Juice!

103
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,655
No. Go back to bed.

104
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,192
I said bed.

105
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,408
Wilson, hey! You up
for a boys' night in?

106
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:22,073
Believe it or not, breathing problems
can be caused by a liver problem.

107
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,582
Then what's wrong
with her liver?

108
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,050
Probably an abscess.

109
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,052
If we find it with
the ultrasound,

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,748
we can drain it,
make her better.

111
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,518
You'd be able to take her
home by the end of the week.

112
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,421
Is she bleeding?

113
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,019
She's oozing from her IV site.

114
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,696
It's a symptom of liver failure.
It's what we would expect to see.

115
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,064
Dr. Cheng, we might need
a unit of blood over here.

116
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,602
Echogenic area in the
liver. Can you make it out?

117
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,434
Doesn't seem to have the thick
walls you'd expect from an abscess.

118
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,251
Lift her left shoulder so
we can get a better look.

119
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:51,211
Can I do it? I haven't
been able to hold her yet.

120
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,110
She's hooked up to
too many tubes and IVs.

121
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,943
Can I at least donate blood?

122
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,993
Of course. We'll draw your
blood and see if you're a match

123
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,349
as soon as we're done here.

124
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,013
That's definitely
not an abscess.

125
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,613
It looks like
dilated bile ducts.

126
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,894
What does that mean? Can
I still take her home soon?

127
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,290
You were right about the liver.

128
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,960
On ultrasound, we found
intrahepatic dilated bile ducts.

129
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,537
Extrahepatic ducts were normal.

130
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,574
<i>Are there any masses
causing an obstruction?</i>

131
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,204
No.

132
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,568
Are you okay?

133
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,539
Just talking in
a soothing voice.

134
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,782
Not for your benefit.

135
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,046
<i>Why, is it turning you on?</i>

136
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,064
House, there's someone
here I need you to meet.

137
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,080
I just hired
Dr. Christina Fraser.

138
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,887
She's a board-certified...
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

139
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,219
<i>You're fired.</i>

140
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,789
What? FOREMAN:
House, you're kidding, right?

141
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,061
I've done my due diligence.
She's the best there is.

142
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,158
What did I do?

143
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,331
<i>You had the misfortune to be
the lesson that Foreman is learning.</i>

144
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,774
That whooshing sound is
the air being let out of his ego.

145
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,162
You are such an ass, House. You
could've made the same point without

146
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,829
crushing the hopes of
a young doctor who was

147
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,446
actually excited
to have this job.

148
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,753
<i>I'm not sure I could have. You
keep giving me far too much credit.</i>

149
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:17,864
Taub, it's your turn to find a young doctor
who's actually excited to have this job.

150
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,057
<i>For you to fire?</i>

151
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,124
Not until you, or she, earns it.

152
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,193
<i>Dilated bile ducts
could be congenital.</i>

153
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,171
It means that it's a stricture in the
ducts themselves. Caroli syndrome.

154
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,763
So open her up.

155
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,467
Surgery?

156
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,974
This is a newborn
with liver failure.

157
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,514
She's oozing blood
from every puncture site.

158
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,207
It's insanely risky
to open her up.

159
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,150
<i>Yes, it's unfortunately
also the only way to fix her.</i>

160
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,122
So make teeny tiny incisions
with a really small scalpel.

161
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,689
<i>Gotta go.</i>

162
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,673
You told me you gave
them your credit card.

163
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,666
And you were dumb
enough to believe me.

164
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,679
Cuddy will be back in
an hour and 10 minutes.

165
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,399
I'll be back in
an hour and five.

166
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,338
Oh, no, you don't.

167
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,498
Oh, yes, I do.

168
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,153
You're not gonna
leave the kid. Yes, I am.

169
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,078
Because unlike you, I
don't have a conscience.

170
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,708
Unlike you, I'm not having sex
with Cuddy, so I actually can leave.

171
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,843
You're bluffing. I'm leaving.

172
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,980
You're not gonna leave a
two-year-old unattended.

173
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,254
True. I'm leaving her with
you. A responsible adult.

174
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,962
You better get back in
there. The kid's all alone.

175
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,232
It's kind of bugging you,
isn't it? Not my problem.

176
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,273
Since objectively,
you care more about

177
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,206
leaving a child alone
than I do, it kind of is.

178
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,144
Objectively, since I never accepted
this responsibility, it kind of isn't.

179
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:44,078
True. And yet it is.
Because you're you.

180
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,977
I'm leaving.

181
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,814
I'm leaving.

182
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,263
You're not gonna
leave. You can't.

183
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,772
Fine. You're right.

184
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,601
You know what I can do?

185
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,576
I can go in there and call a
babysitting service for 15 bucks an hour,

186
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,773
then call Cuddy and tell her
who's watching her kid and why.

187
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,944
I'll stay if you stay.

188
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,189
We were gone two minutes.

189
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,433
What you got there, sweetie?

190
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,900
Come on now, spit it out.

191
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:44,043
Come on, sweetie. Open.

192
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,447
Open.

193
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,254
Ow!

194
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,997
Rachel.

195
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,826
How many coins did you eat?

196
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,715
Isolating the common bile duct.

197
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,952
And mobilizing the
distal end for cannulation.

198
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,503
BP's down to 50 systolic.
You've gotta stop the cannulation.

199
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,688
I haven't started yet.

200
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:36,939
Hit her with a bolus
of phenylephrine.

201
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,762
That should buy us enough time
to get in and dilate those bile ducts.

202
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,602
BP's rising, 70 systolic.

203
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,234
Nice.

204
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,137
I'm in the common bile duct.

205
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,673
Advancing past the cystic duct.

206
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,538
No strictures or
blockages so far.

207
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,687
BP's dropping again.
Another bolus of phenylephrine.

208
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,689
She can't take more, the
first bolus is still in effect.

209
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,376
BP's still dropping. You
gotta pull out. We're done.

210
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,781
I was barely in.

211
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,587
This doesn't make sense.

212
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,813
A liver problem alone is not
gonna mess with the baby's BP.

213
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,768
Whatever this is, it's
gotta be affecting her heart.

214
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,125
Heart plus liver, could
be tuberous sclerosis.

215
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,063
Or it could be a vascular malformation
in the liver causing both problems.

216
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,685
So what do you guys
think of Dr. Cheng?

217
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,828
Best treatment for a vascular
malformation is surgery.

218
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,715
And I think your wife thinks you
shouldn't think anything of Dr. Cheng.

219
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,732
No surgery. Newborn baby
can't handle another trip to the OR.

220
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:27,144
I didn't mean think think. I
meant think as a potential hire.

221
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,680
What if we start
the baby on steroids,

222
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,743
an anti-angiogenesis
agent and dopamine?

223
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,757
Could work just as well as surgery,
snap those bad blood vessels shut.

224
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,315
I'll call House to get approval.

225
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,294
So, what was that shrug? A
"Dr. Cheng could work" shrug?

226
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:47,459
Or a "House is gonna crush you
for even considering her" shrug?

227
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,191
You suck.

228
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,636
House is gonna hate anyone we hire,
because he doesn't want to hire anyone.

229
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,539
So you think I should abstain,
just give the decision back to him?

230
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,703
Then he'll just mock you for
being a wuss. You're screwed.

231
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,437
Unless

232
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:05,110
House feels like
hiring her is his idea.

233
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,504
He's still not answering.

234
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,384
We should just
start the treatment.

235
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,917
She opened up a Chinese
food bag to eat money.

236
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,088
What an idiot.

237
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,059
Okay, you ordered
the moo shu pork

238
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,828
and the orange
cashew chicken, right?

239
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,198
Like I always order.

240
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,615
Have you cleaned up in
there? Yeah, it's good enough.

241
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:29,540
Okay, so with tax, the change
should have been 68 cents.

242
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:33,376
There's only 58 cents out
there. There's a dime missing.

243
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,745
Well, they could have
short-changed you.

244
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,160
Fridge magnet is
not getting anything.

245
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,743
That's because
it's a fridge magnet.

246
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,412
And unless she swallowed a
Canadian dime, it's not magnetic.

247
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,854
Really?

248
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,755
I mean, kids swallow
things all the time, right?

249
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,004
She swallowed a dime, she
poops it out, she'll be fine.

250
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,021
Absolutely. Unless it gets stuck in
her intestines, causes a blockage.

251
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,896
Which could kill her.

252
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:57,902
Then she won't be fine.
You have to tell Cuddy.

253
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,570
Well, then, I won't be fine.

254
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,973
If you don't tell Cuddy, I will
go out there and tell her myself.

255
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,601
Yeah? What are
you gonna tell her?

256
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:09,046
You're gonna tell her that you left coins
out and you left her child unsupervised?

257
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,313
Hey, hey, hey! You are
not gonna pin this on me.

258
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,224
Rachel needs to be monitored for
24 hours to see that the dime passes.

259
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,988
You know, just to make
sure she doesn't die.

260
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,961
You're telling me to do the right
thing while climbing out a window?

261
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,797
Tell her!

262
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,777
She wake up at all?

263
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:43,841
One time.

264
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,416
That's not like
her. Is she all right?

265
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,078
She's fine.

266
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,985
How about I stay the night?
And you can really thank me.

267
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,292
I have to get up early. You
won't be able to sleep in.

268
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,360
I'm a deep sleeper.

269
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,349
Round two. Did Justine go home?

270
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,350
She said she was going
downstairs for a few minutes.

271
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,544
A few hours ago.

272
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,686
So you two are close.

273
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,321
It's been getting
better, actually.

274
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,358
At least she's
here in the building.

275
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,293
That's pretty
supportive for her.

276
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,554
What is it?

277
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,557
She's pinker.

278
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,861
Is that bad?

279
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,368
That's good.

280
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,173
That's very good.

281
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,910
Is that her?

282
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,614
Can I hold her?

283
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,947
I think it's long overdue.

284
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,029
Oh!

285
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,759
My first time.

286
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,461
Finally.

287
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,231
Technically, it's
your second time.

288
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,472
I didn't mean... I know, Mom.

289
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,150
Looks like it was a vascular
malformation. The Grogan baby is better.

290
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,819
Nice job.

291
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,990
Okay, ready, honey.
So stay very, very still.

292
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,899
And hold your
breath. Don't move.

293
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,501
She moved. They always move.

294
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,399
It is a good job.

295
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,438
Diagnostics. Solve
a mystery, save a life.

296
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,008
But I suppose you're
pretty attached to pediatrics.

297
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,661
<i>I'm sorry, Mrs. Young, but
I'm going to have to ask you</i>

298
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,914
<i>to restrain your daughter.</i>

299
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,564
And now the mom's
not gonna want to do it,

300
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,349
because she'd rather I just keep
blasting her daughter with radiation.

301
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,486
You're telling me there's an
opening in House's department?

302
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,689
Would you be interested?

303
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,926
No more kids? No more parents?

304
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:18,438
One case at a time instead
of 17? Set up the interview.

305
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,266
It's possible you
won't need to interview.

306
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,982
Relax, I got this.

307
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,354
Thanks.

308
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,079
Is everything okay?

309
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,343
Yeah. Sorry. Just
new to all this.

310
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,300
You want me to reset the alarm?

311
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,742
God, no.

312
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,514
Case is under
control. I'm sleeping in.

313
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,911
Your boss must really like you.

314
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,182
Hey, Marina.

315
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,123
There's pasta in
the fridge for lunch.

316
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,529
I assume, since
you're calling so early,

317
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,160
that the surgery was
a rousing success.

318
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,433
And I assume since you still
think we actually did the surgery,

319
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,651
you haven't checked your messages
in eight hours. Where are you?

320
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,702
I believe this is what your
people term a "poopy call."

321
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,313
Uh, the word's "booty."

322
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,858
I don't know what you're
doing, but this is a poopy call.

323
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,148
<i>It's not Caroli Syndrome.
Dr. Cheng spotted...</i>

324
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:14,585
What?

325
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,816
<i>I knew about the Jew, the
black and the croc hunter.</i>

326
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,790
<i>But when did we get
our Asian persuasion on?</i>

327
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:23,353
Dr. Cheng is the NICU attending
on the case. And she's not here.

328
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,365
Well, I just wasted a
perfectly good racial epithet.

329
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:30,330
She spotted a vascular
malformation in the baby's liver.

330
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,804
<i>Good call. Except for
everything you just said.</i>

331
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,569
There's no way that our patient
has a vascular malformation.

332
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,973
<i>And you can tell that</i>

333
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,911
from the vast amount of information
you've gleaned from not being here?

334
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,574
<i>Don't need to be there to remember that
the patient's ALTs were three times normal.</i>

335
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,085
The baby's liver damage is far
too extensive. Dr. Cheng's an idiot.

336
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,049
In fairness, it wasn't
completely her idea.

337
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,091
More of a Foreman kind of thing.

338
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,922
<i>Well, then you're an even bigger
idiot for trying to cover for her.</i>

339
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,963
House, we treated for
a vascular malformation.

340
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,259
And she got better.

341
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,692
No, she didn't. Call me
when she crashes again.

342
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,599
That went well.

343
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,145
Everything okay?

344
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,150
Come on. I know that look.

345
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,780
I'm just not used to seeing
such emotion coming from you.

346
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,622
Well, I just gave birth. I'm like
one big vat of hormones right now.

347
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,060
It's not just the hormones, Mom.

348
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,223
You're different with her.

349
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,564
It's okay, it's
good. It's just...

350
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:42,438
I can't help thinking, "Where was
this mom when I was growing up?"

351
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,642
Well, I never realized you considered
me such a failure as a mother.

352
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,740
I don't consider
you a failure. I just...

353
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,113
I never knew that
there was an alternative.

354
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,754
Mmm.

355
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,523
I think she feels wet.

356
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,098
Can you hold her a sec?
I'm gonna grab a diaper.

357
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,099
Okay.

358
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,566
Mom, something's wrong.

359
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,662
Oh! Nurse!

360
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,136
She's bleeding again!

361
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,346
All right, she's in
her office. Move fast.

362
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,716
You see a double-wide tuchus
coming this way, you scream like a girl.

363
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,346
If Rachel wakes up, she's
gonna tell Cuddy everything.

364
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,856
She's two.

365
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:35,036
Last night she was whining about the
giant moose that lives outside her window.

366
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,519
Medusa at six o'clock.
Don't look back. Move, move.

367
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,111
Hello.

368
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,749
Hello.

369
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:06,722
I'm the friendly moose who
lives outside your bedroom.

370
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,252
She hates that moose.

371
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,552
Hand me the gel.

372
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,531
Okay.

373
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,764
Make it short. And
do not pardon the pun.

374
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,306
<i>She's crashing
again. Where are you?</i>

375
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,573
Is it actually important that
I understand what you say?

376
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,040
<i>What?</i>

377
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,048
Yeah.

378
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,715
<i>The baby's bleeding again.</i>

379
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,625
I'm shocked. Oh, no,
wait a minute. That's you.

380
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,252
Yes, you're a genius.

381
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,727
The bleeding
means her liver is still

382
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:46,441
failing. It's not a
vascular malformation...

383
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,457
House, come take a look at this.

384
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,059
Hold that thought.
<i>House, no. I need to...</i>

385
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,900
Just past the ileocecal valve.

386
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,499
It's nothing.

387
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,407
Just an irregularity.

388
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,671
It's a dime.

389
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,845
Or a pocket of air.

390
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,609
Yeah, with FDR's face on it.

391
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,343
That's not a face.
It's a shadow.

392
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,282
House, the thing
is perfectly round.

393
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,116
Move the wand to the side.

394
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,314
Tickles!

395
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,120
That's because I'm
the tickle monster.

396
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,322
Look at that.

397
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,326
We need an X-ray
to be sure. Great.

398
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:24,130
Just give her an unnecessary
dose of radiation? It's a dime.

399
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,338
House? I know you're
in there. Open the door.

400
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,645
I saw your
extension on the call.

401
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,946
What are you doing down here?

402
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,080
Uh, Wilson's got a
two-year-old with cancer.

403
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,447
She's in a lot of
pain. It's very sad.

404
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,330
He also has an
outstanding bedside manner.

405
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,059
Her liver failure
is getting worse.

406
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,724
You were right. Now what?

407
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,997
The interesting question
is not why she's worse now,

408
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,835
but why she got
better in the first place.

409
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,532
Could've been something we
did that temporarily relieved the...

410
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,762
What'd you put her on again?

411
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:08,507
After the transfusion, we gave her
steroids, dopamine, and the anti...

412
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,981
Steroids can treat
idiopathic hepatic fibrosis.

413
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,794
Would explain why she
got better, then worse.

414
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,719
But not the multiple
dilated ducts.

415
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,550
House, I need you back in here.

416
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,553
Cancer kid trumps liver kid.

417
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,490
Sorry, confidentiality.
There are rules, you know.

418
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,264
That is a dime.

419
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:31,026
Looks mobile, it's right
in the middle of the colon.

420
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,834
Prime location for pooping out.

421
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,000
We'll give her some
laxatives to help it on its way.

422
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:40,877
Sounds to me like someone's
going to get some yummy chocolate.

423
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,608
Chocolate. Yum, yum, yum.

424
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,614
You're gonna make a
great mommy one day.

425
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,719
Thanks for waiting.

426
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,727
Hook the mom up to the
baby. Direct blood transfusion.

427
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,060
And what else?

428
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,225
Nothing else.

429
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:13,404
It's amazing. She's
pink and healthy again.

430
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,382
Mother's touch.

431
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,748
It's a miracle. Thank you.

432
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,713
A blood transfusion
isn't a cure.

433
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,115
Or a miracle.

434
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,420
Then why does the baby
seem like she's cured?

435
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,096
I have no idea.

436
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:47,475
Our patient can either go through life
with the world's longest umbilical cord,

437
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,311
or we can discuss the
differential for magic blood.

438
00:25:58,157 --> 00:25:59,716
Baby's O2 sats are holding.

439
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:03,284
Either you're Dr. Cheng, or
you're early for my mani-pedi.

440
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,354
I thought her expertise could...

441
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,332
Tell us the O2 sats?

442
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,129
I hope you come with
some original ideas.

443
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,794
Either the mom's
blood is special,

444
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,031
which would mean it's
treating something specific,

445
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,663
which means the
baby has a disease.

446
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,508
Or Mom's blood is just blood, and it's
replacing something the baby is missing,

447
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,979
which means the baby
has a simple deficiency.

448
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,383
Given the liver failure,

449
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:29,318
deficiency of clotting
factors, enzymes,

450
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:30,913
or vitamins are the most likely.

451
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,047
So let's find out.

452
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,502
Hook the baby up to someone
else's blood and see if she gets better.

453
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,223
Find a donor. I'm O
negative. Universal donor.

454
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,922
Hook yourself up.

455
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,728
Dr. Cheng, hook
me up. Walk with me.

456
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,705
My team seems to have
taken a shine to you.

457
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,240
I like them, too.

458
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,673
I assume you're hanging
around, because you want a job.

459
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,040
That would be a fair assumption.

460
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,909
Well, I'm gonna
have to test you.

461
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,504
Let's say, two-year-old.

462
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:01,047
Swallowed a coin 20 hours
ago. She's gonna be fine, right?

463
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,748
Any signs of obstruction?

464
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:06,883
For the purposes of
this quiz, let's say not yet.

465
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,728
I'd give laxatives, although
I wouldn't wait too long.

466
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:14,028
Her bowel could become ischemic,
or worse, an intussusception.

467
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,465
Define "too long."

468
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,230
Another six hours, max.

469
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,033
By then, her system's clear. If
it's not out, it's not coming out.

470
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,097
And then what do I do?

471
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,267
I mean, what do
you do? It's your test.

472
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,971
I'd go in with a
scope and get it.

473
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,903
Did I pass?

474
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,573
It's not up to me. Talk to Taub.

475
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,715
Men's room?

476
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,952
Turns out toilets are
handy in this situation.

477
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,460
And I felt relatively sure
that Cuddy wouldn't come in.

478
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,296
Oh, Cuddy's been in here.

479
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,234
Seriously? This must be
a terrible place to have...

480
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,471
Is there such a place?

481
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,899
We have six more hours, then we're
going in with a scope and pulling it out.

482
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,273
Scope a two-year-old?
It's dangerous.

483
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,609
And as you keep pointing out, so is
a dime ripping through her intestines.

484
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,581
Cuddy will be home
from work in six hours.

485
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,777
But no big deal. I'll just
scream, "Look over there"

486
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,320
while you quickly shove a
scope up her daughter's rectum.

487
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,598
I could offer to babysit again.
Let her have the night out.

488
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,682
Sure, that won't
raise any suspicions.

489
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,526
I wish I was nicer.

490
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,691
Give me your
radiation dosimeter.

491
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:22,962
Why?

492
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,162
Because it matches my eyes.

493
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,701
I think we can say
this isn't working.

494
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:00,204
We'll get her back on your
blood. That'll help for now.

495
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,069
But this means
there's an infection.

496
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,741
First we need to identify it.

497
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,812
We know it's in her liver,
so we'll get a sample.

498
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,347
Then we can figure out
how to help her get better.

499
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:15,587
I had this baby because I wanted
a chance to be a special mom,

500
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,490
but not this way.

501
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,372
Problems in radiology.

502
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:37,741
A radiation dosimeter
badge turned positive.

503
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:43,077
I could have a CT scanner that's leaking,
or a spilled vial of thallium somewhere.

504
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,592
I don't even know
whose badge it was.

505
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,050
The code was scratched off.

506
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,878
That had to be intentional, I
mean, why would anyone...

507
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:53,585
I don't know. All I know is that
I'm gonna need to work late.

508
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,417
I was actually hoping
that you could babysit.

509
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,398
No. Not two nights
in a row. Please.

510
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,558
Please?

511
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,794
I have a life, you know?

512
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,930
I will make it worth your while.

513
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:13,539
I am not going to
bargain babysitting for sex.

514
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:17,807
Who the hell said that?

515
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,283
Of course I will. Thank you.

516
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,496
That thing's nearly
as big as she is.

517
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,999
Don't worry. I've done
this at least once before.

518
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,548
Advance another
centimeter, and you're in.

519
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,347
God, that looks awful.
Is that from the infection?

520
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,811
No.

521
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:55,351
Means we were wrong.

522
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,585
It's a melanoma.

523
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,351
You mean like skin cancer?

524
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,986
How did she get that?
She's never been outside.

525
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,422
But you have.

526
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,298
You're saying I gave
my baby cancer?

527
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:29,512
<i>I found a mole under the
nail on her left index finger.</i>

528
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,817
<i>The biopsy revealed
it's melanoma.</i>

529
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,326
That's it?

530
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,325
And how come no one got me food?

531
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:38,673
What do you mean, "That's it?"

532
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,375
The woman has melanoma,
she could die if we don't...

533
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,560
Boring.

534
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,266
Since the baby has a melanoma,
we kind of already knew Mom had it.

535
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,827
Yes, but now we
know where it is,

536
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,840
so we can treat it much
more effectively, so...

537
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,068
Great. So treat her.

538
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:51,700
Also boring.

539
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:56,373
What's interesting is that Mom's
melanoma spread to the baby <i>in utero,</i>

540
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,542
which means it's metastatic,
which means it's late stage.

541
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:04,718
How many people with late-stage
melanoma are as healthy as she is?

542
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,222
Clearly something's
going on in Mom's blood

543
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,237
that's treating her melanoma
as well as her baby's.

544
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,354
Antibodies.

545
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,269
If her immune system
was fighting the melanoma,

546
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,410
it never would have spread.

547
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,243
Exactly, which means
it's fighting something else.

548
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,600
And the melanoma cells are
getting caught in the crossfire.

549
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,933
So what's Mom's immune
system really shooting at?

550
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,007
Scleroderma can cause
cancer-fighting antibodies.

551
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,599
So can Churg-Strauss, pretty
much any auto-immune disease.

552
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:28,077
Or infections that cause
granulomas, TB, mycobacteria.

553
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,843
See, Dr. Cheng?
This is not boring.

554
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,950
Start with auto-immune.
Go test her blood.

555
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,078
And leave your food.

556
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,759
Just a little pinch.

557
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:52,268
So I'm not actually making
her better, I'm making her sick.

558
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,098
You can't blame yourself.

559
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:58,400
I ate all the right foods, I read
all the books and the studies.

560
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:02,878
And I even hired a private detective
to research each sperm donor.

561
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,949
I just missed one big
thing, my own cancer.

562
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:13,654
I'm all done here. We'll
have the results soon.

563
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,887
And if that's what this is?
An auto-immune disease?

564
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:18,487
The treatment's fairly simple.

565
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,461
And if it's something else?

566
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,261
Let's just take this
one step at a time.

567
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,236
And stop beating yourself up.

568
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,646
I'm sorry, Mom.

569
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:45,086
Not just for this. But
for what I said earlier.

570
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:50,491
I was jealous and
angry and I lashed out.

571
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,733
You were a great mom.

572
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,334
You are a great mom.

573
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,572
I don't deserve such
a good daughter.

574
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,486
Negative for scleroderma.

575
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:19,956
So, what did House want earlier?

576
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,355
He just gave me a little quiz.

577
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,867
Then said he was
okay with hiring me.

578
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,624
But that it was your decision.

579
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:27,431
Negative for dermatomyositis.

580
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,991
He's just saying
that to set me up.

581
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,470
So, you're not
offering me the job?

582
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,507
If he wants me to offer you
the job, something's going on.

583
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,868
That was my thinking, too.

584
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,309
It's not lupus.

585
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,356
Things with House are
never as simple as they seem.

586
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,871
Trust me, he's got
an ulterior motive,

587
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,350
and I gotta figure it
out before I do anything.

588
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,475
Okay.

589
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,122
Mom's negative for Churg-Strauss.
This isn't auto-immune.

590
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,226
Time to scan her for infections
that could cause granulomas.

591
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,694
Third poop in
the last half-hour,

592
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,363
still nothing.

593
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,589
<i>All right, that's it.</i>

594
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:10,565
Time's up. Operation
Valkyrie is now in effect.

595
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:24,018
Either it's a trap or
it's not. Just hire her.

596
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,422
Lungs clear for granulomas.

597
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,152
Yeah, who cares?

598
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,094
Did you enjoy that bear trap
snapping on your leg yesterday?

599
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:33,597
You realize it's just
a metaphorical trap.

600
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,156
You'll still have
all your limbs.

601
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,837
Fourth rib, about the
mid-clavicular line.

602
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,930
You're over-thinking this.

603
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,735
House fired my
pick sight unseen.

604
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,833
He was never even
interested in Chase's pick,

605
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,378
he was only obsessed with
how she reflected on Chase.

606
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,847
Dr. Cheng is the only candidate
he's actually responded to.

607
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:54,181
You wanted House
invested. He is. Hire her.

608
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,517
And you think I'm
over-thinking this?

609
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,582
Shut up and hire her.

610
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,420
Look.

611
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,223
Oat cell lung cancer.

612
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,827
She has two cancers?

613
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,769
Cancer treating cancer.

614
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,773
You have lung cancer.

615
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,315
I thought I had skin cancer.

616
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:33,586
As unlikely as it
sounds, you have both.

617
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:38,160
Actually, the lung cancer is
basically treating the skin cancer.

618
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,787
It's why you're
not feeling sick.

619
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,833
And why your blood's
helping your baby.

620
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,959
We found it early, so
it should be treatable.

621
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,869
In a way, your
daughter saved your life.

622
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:49,440
We'll get you set up for the
surgery and start you on chemo.

623
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,136
What about Kayla?

624
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,510
She'll only need the chemo.

625
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,713
Can't you just keep
giving her my blood?

626
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:00,047
Not once we cut out the tumor.

627
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,815
Your body will stop making the antibodies
that are keeping your baby healthy.

628
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,383
Can you hold off on my surgery?

629
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:10,394
Over the last day, your baby's
liver tumors have shrunk 15%.

630
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,327
Projecting forward, it
would take eight or nine days

631
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:14,998
to completely eradicate
her cancer cells.

632
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,226
So let's take the
eight or nine days...

633
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:22,272
The cancer probably won't spread in the
next nine days, but there are other risks.

634
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,460
Cancer thickens your blood,
which could cause clots...

635
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,671
And what are the risks to
putting my baby on chemo?

636
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,844
It could damage her brain,
or affect her development.

637
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,045
But these risks are small compared
to the risks that you would be taking

638
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,213
by leaving your
cancers untreated.

639
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,390
I want to wait. Mom,
are you listening?

640
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,691
This is way too dangerous.

641
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,866
I'll take the risks. I want
what's best for my daughter.

642
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,459
I'm your daughter, too.

643
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,339
She's a baby. You're an adult.

644
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,533
So, what? I don't need
my mom anymore?

645
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:01,338
No. You never did. Because
I wasn't there for you.

646
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,209
But look at you.
You turned out great.

647
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,478
You don't know if I'm great.
You don't know me at all.

648
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,815
And I'm not gonna let you martyr
yourself for a two-day-old infant

649
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:13,187
just because you feel guilty,
because you weren't around for me.

650
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:18,429
I'm not martyring
myself. It's nine days.

651
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,600
Let's hold off on the surgery.

652
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,337
You brought food?

653
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,072
This is a medical
procedure, not a dinner date.

654
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,671
I'm aware that this is
a delicate procedure.

655
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,343
I'm also aware that my hands
are shaking from low blood sugar

656
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,443
because I haven't eaten all day.

657
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:45,547
So while this may seem insensitive,
this crucial lifesaving moo shu...

658
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,359
Where are my extra pancakes?

659
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:54,058
Damn it. They forgot the extra
pancakes in my moo shu pork.

660
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:58,365
Every time that new girl with the blue
streaks in her hair answers the phone,

661
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,529
they screw up.

662
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:04,718
Was she there when
you picked up the food?

663
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,438
You ordered extra pancakes?

664
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,214
How much do they cost?

665
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,719
55 cents. I ordered two.

666
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,892
So that means the
total on the last bill was...

667
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,291
Was...

668
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,925
$18.42. $18.42.

669
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:31,268
Rachel couldn't have eaten a dime,
because there was no extra dime.

670
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,337
Yeah.

671
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:43,413
So, the image that we
saw on the ultrasound...

672
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,349
Was obviously just a pocket
of air like I said all along.

673
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,114
But you saw the
worst-case scenario,

674
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:51,622
like every irrational,
worried parent.

675
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,924
You'd make a terrible mommy.

676
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,993
Throw me some dumplings.

677
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,340
Mom, I brought you some...

678
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,674
Mom?

679
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,778
Mom!

680
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,014
Mom?

681
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,017
We need help in here!
Somebody help us!

682
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:37,497
<i>Massive pulmonary
embolism. She died in seconds.</i>

683
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,180
Wouldn't have happened if
she'd let us remove the tumor.

684
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,797
Probably not.

685
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,608
Post-mortem, we were able
to harvest all of her blood.

686
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:48,112
It's enough to treat the baby.

687
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,445
That's something.

688
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,015
Pretty amazing case.

689
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:54,812
Thanks for your help.

690
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,151
I was glad for the
chance to work it with you.

691
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,486
I've thought about it,

692
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:04,028
and I'd like to formally
offer you the job.

693
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,659
It's funny. I wanted to
work on House's team

694
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,566
until I started
working with his team.

695
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,514
Yeah, I know. Chase and
Foreman can get a little...

696
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:14,870
Actually, it's you.

697
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,743
I get that House is an
ass, but at least he owns it.

698
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:22,803
You don't understand. This whole
thing was just a game to House.

699
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,371
I didn't have a choice, but...

700
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,576
You're a grown man, Dr. Taub.

701
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,182
You can make whatever
choices you want.

702
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,154
And instead of hiring me
when he said you could,

703
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,852
you chose to act like a
paranoid, scared little kid.

704
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,355
I hate kids.

705
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:41,229
Goodbye, Dr. Taub.

706
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,841
I'll make sure you
never forget her.

707
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,510
And what she did for you.

708
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:05,581
She was just trying to be
the best mom in the world.

709
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:11,529
She was.

710
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,878
This one's all yours.

711
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,622
What happened to helping out?

712
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,359
I did.

713
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,139
<i>Did someone go poopy?</i>
RACHEL: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

714
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:09,983
<i>What... How did you eat a dime?</i>

715
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,121
<i>House.</i>
