1
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,512
Hey.

2
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:50,943
Hey.

3
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,579
So, uh... What did you want?

4
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,855
It's too late now.

5
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,324
Too late for what?

6
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,759
I'll tell you later. Come
on, the bell just rang.

7
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,023
We've still got time.

8
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,290
I'm ready.

9
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:09,693
Oh.

10
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,794
You sure?

11
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,034
Yeah.

12
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,772
Why now all of a sudden?

13
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,141
What, you don't want to anymore?

14
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,440
Yeah, I do.

15
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,046
I'm just wondering
what changed your mind.

16
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,147
You did.

17
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:30,650
Now?

18
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,126
If you want.

19
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,664
Excuse me.

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,699
You two need to come with me.

21
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,745
Take a seat. But we didn't...

22
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,489
You know you're not
supposed to be back there.

23
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,657
We weren't doing anything.

24
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,048
That's not what it
looked like to me.

25
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,813
Principal Fields will be back
as soon as the assembly's over.

26
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,084
Ms. Washburn, please. If I
get one more referral, my mom...

27
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:04,681
Bench.

28
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,927
Who put sand in her vagina?

29
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,285
Hey, kids. How you boys doing?

30
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,314
Uh, can we help you?

31
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:12,586
I certainly hope so.

32
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,153
You know what this is?

33
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,895
A laptop?

34
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,669
A password-protected laptop
that I need you nerds to hack into.

35
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,762
No insecticides
or toxic cleaners.

36
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,603
Check the bathroom.

37
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,733
Who are you?

38
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,471
Your roommate's doctor.

39
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,954
You remember your
roommate, don't you?

40
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,470
I thought he just
had bronchitis.

41
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,315
That's what the morons at the
Rutgers student medical center thought,

42
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,951
which may be part of the
reason he just coughed up a lung.

43
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,991
What do you mean,
"He coughed up a lung"?

44
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,151
He coughed,

45
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,991
after which the respiratory
organ which resided in his chest

46
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,293
resided in his mouth.

47
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,961
Actually, his hand. Well,
his mouth, then his hand.

48
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,766
Bathroom's clean.

49
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,930
What's in this?

50
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,032
Just soda. Mind if I have some?

51
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,940
You want my drink?

52
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,774
You got a problem with that?

53
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,609
Uh, yeah. Actually, I do.

54
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,048
You barge into our room,

55
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,037
start looking through
our personal private stuff,

56
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,678
demand I hack into a computer,

57
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,514
I think I can safely
assume doesn't belong...

58
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,795
I'm sorry. Did I break your
concentration? Please, continue.

59
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,331
You were talking
about personal privacy.

60
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,894
What, you're finished?

61
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,199
Well, allow me to retort.

62
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,731
Wait a second. You're
saying this actually happened?

63
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,539
Absolutely.

64
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,102
You're lying.

65
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,583
Interesting theory.
Can you prove it?

66
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,214
Doctors don't carry guns,
they don't shoot people,

67
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,189
and they definitely don't
search patients' homes.

68
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,249
Plus I've seen <i>Pulp Fiction,</i>

69
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,850
the movie you're
totally ripping off.

70
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,492
Huh.

71
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,692
Wait, uh, was it Timmy Morgan?

72
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,761
I have no idea.

73
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:05,100
It had to be him. He's, like,
totally obsessed with old movies.

74
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,641
<i>Pulp Fiction</i> is not
an old movie. What...

75
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,713
So you're here to talk to the
principal about something Timmy did?

76
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,111
I got no problem with Timmy,

77
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,946
and even if I did,
I ain't no snitch.

78
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,378
Then why are you here?

79
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,479
To dig myself out of a hole.
Instead I dug a bigger one.

80
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,221
What did you do?

81
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,584
What did you do?

82
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,890
What did you do?

83
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,232
What happened to your eye?

84
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,560
It's none of your business.

85
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,604
Actually, it's none
of yours. I'm a doctor.

86
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,942
It's a few days old, so
it's not why you're here.

87
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,172
Unless you two got busted
for some sort of revenge plot,

88
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,806
but then you'd look
angry instead of ashamed.

89
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,645
I'm not ashamed. Interesting.

90
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,584
You defensively insist
that you're not ashamed,

91
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,817
which, of course, means you are
ashamed, and yet you're the victim.

92
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,755
You want to know how
she got the black eye?

93
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,420
Tell us why you're here first.

94
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,239
Anyone ever tell
you you're annoying?

95
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,461
No. Yes. All the time.

96
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,026
But he's right. You
wanna know, you first.

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,331
I didn't kill anybody.

98
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,104
I have to be here, so I figured

99
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,272
I'd punch up the
stakes in the first act.

100
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:24,284
But we did and almost always
do search the patient's home.

101
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,785
And if we tell them first,

102
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,378
then they could hide
something that we need to know

103
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,288
in order to figure out
what's wrong with them.

104
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,501
Why would they hide something
that could be killing them?

105
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,721
Because they are morons.

106
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,297
They're all morons
and everybody lies.

107
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,823
Wait. If everybody lies, then
that means you're lying right now.

108
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,733
I didn't say everybody
always lies, Aristotle.

109
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,907
And on that note, unless
there are any questions...

110
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,137
Good.

111
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:52,869
Oh, Dr. Hourani.

112
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:58,141
Before you finish, maybe you
could describe what you actually do.

113
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:02,019
You know, like if someone
comes in for a routine physical.

114
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,654
You want routine?

115
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,753
Please.

116
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,763
It just feels kind of numb.

117
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,532
You do a lot of bicycle riding?

118
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,698
No.

119
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,509
How long have you been married?

120
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,601
Twelve years next month.

121
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,681
And you have six kids.

122
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,527
You don't think it could have
anything to do with that, do you?

123
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,883
Probably.

124
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,448
How often do you
use your vibrator?

125
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,022
Excuse me?

126
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,424
Your battery-operated Brad Pitt.

127
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,459
After giving the
gift of life to six

128
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,226
8-pound 4-ounce wrecking balls,

129
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,493
I think I can safely assume

130
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,843
it's an industrial
strength model.

131
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,426
Dr. Hourani!

132
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,765
Please.

133
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,570
You wanted routine. Am I done?

134
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,605
Maybe we should just move on.

135
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,771
No problem.

136
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,780
I meant with your typical day.

137
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,368
I assume you see
more than one patient.

138
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,944
Nope.

139
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,610
Okay.

140
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,218
Then I guess we move
on to our next guest...

141
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,954
Wait, if you only
see one patient,

142
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,387
what do you do
the rest of the day?

143
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,805
Dr. Hourani?

144
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,916
Just in time for lunch.

145
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,095
If by "lunch" you mean a
"conference call with the board,"

146
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,884
and by "just in time" you
mean "20 minutes late."

147
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,482
I meant sex.

148
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,884
Fine, lunch.

149
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,624
How about we start with
a small tossed salad?

150
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,900
As of this morning,
I'm on a diet.

151
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,104
Meaning?

152
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,511
I told you, I'm busy.

153
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,174
No, you told me you were
supposed to be busy 20 minutes ago.

154
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,927
But you were obviously
able to put them off then,

155
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,629
there's no reason you
can't put them off now.

156
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,919
How about I wanted
to then and now I don't?

157
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,591
Get your finger off my phone.

158
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,993
We obviously have
something we need to discuss.

159
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,689
Now is not a good
time. If you're mad

160
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,042
because you don't
feel you're getting

161
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,035
the necessary
amount of affection,

162
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,261
all you have to do is ask.

163
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,667
Seriously, not now.

164
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,999
If memory serves,

165
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,473
I enjoyed a healthy Sunday
brunch, so your insinuation...

166
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,211
Ow! What is your problem?

167
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,974
You! You are my problem.

168
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,347
You are the most selfish,
self-centered son of a bitch

169
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:45,714
on the face of the planet.

170
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,118
And I'm sick of it.

171
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,282
I'm just done.

172
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,527
I can't deal with you anymore.

173
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,730
So that's what a typical
doctor does on a typical day.

174
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,571
Any questions?

175
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,340
What's a vibrator?

176
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,853
Why was your girlfriend so mad?

177
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,822
It doesn't matter.

178
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,388
Well, obviously it matters.

179
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,043
I mean, if she's
your girlfriend,

180
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,002
you should care how she feels.

181
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,598
I mean it doesn't
matter to the story.

182
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,070
It's the most important
part of the story.

183
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,234
It's the only thing
that does matter.

184
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,713
You don't kiss her
enough. Is that the problem?

185
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,042
Absolutely not.

186
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,413
Which, by your
definition, means it is.

187
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,449
We kiss plenty.

188
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,787
Your turn.

189
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,950
Then what's the
problem? Your turn.

190
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,050
What's the problem?

191
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:06,232
Excuse me, when exactly
will the Commandant be back?

192
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,734
Shouldn't be much longer, sir.

193
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:14,931
Well...

194
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,445
So now you're not gonna
talk. That's real mature.

195
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,888
All right, fine. We got busted
for kissing behind the school.

196
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,554
Now you know why we're here,

197
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,149
so tell us why you're here.

198
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,126
The deal was
about the black eye.

199
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:36,992
And we didn't kiss.

200
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,556
So you're just
making him beg, huh?

201
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,258
I didn't have you
pegged as a tease.

202
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,462
I'm not a tease.

203
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,562
The available evidence
suggests otherwise.

204
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,936
I'm not a tease.

205
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,269
Prove it.

206
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:54,109
By telling me your story.

207
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,085
You're a pathetic loser jerk,

208
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:06,092
and I wouldn't kiss you if I had brain
cancer and your lips were the cure.

209
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,528
Whoa.

210
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,559
She actually said that?

211
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:13,842
Well, yeah, that was,
like, two days ago...

212
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,425
It doesn't matter.

213
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,164
I clearly didn't lead him
along or anything like that,

214
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,706
which proves I'm
not a tease, so...

215
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,833
Why is your
girlfriend mad at you?

216
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,170
I'm getting a kind of bossy
vibe. I take it you're into that.

217
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,839
Don't answer.

218
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,448
Your turn.

219
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,445
What seems to be
the problem, sir?

220
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,188
I'm having more difficulty
breathing, and some pain in my chest.

221
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,025
You're new, aren't you?

222
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,161
Yeah. I just moved from Chicago.

223
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,871
Chicago's awesome.
What part are you from?

224
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,367
We need to get a chest CT.

225
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,947
Excuse me, I'm the
senior team member,

226
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,291
which means we don't need
anything unless I say we need it.

227
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,151
Do you want to have an affair?

228
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,666
You want to have a threesome?

229
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:01,647
You can't talk to her like
that. I'm telling Cuddy.

230
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,982
We need a chest CT.

231
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,809
Get it yourself.
Get it yourself.

232
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,147
Isn't that like
sexual harassment?

233
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,822
Not if you're good-looking.

234
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,183
Excuse me?

235
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,690
You said the one guy
was short with a big nose.

236
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,441
I guess it's not the
only thing that's big.

237
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,690
What does that mean?

238
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,256
It means he's lying. Again.

239
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,495
'Cause you can't
handle the truth!

240
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,363
That's so easy.

241
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,409
<i>A Few Good Men.</i>

242
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:36,179
Okay, I give up. I think we
should move on to our next guest.

243
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,208
Mr. Dryden

244
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,352
works for one of the largest

245
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,220
advertising agencies
in New York City.

246
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,383
Boring.

247
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,189
Can we at least hear what
happened to the patient?

248
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,921
Yeah, please.

249
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,395
If Dr. Hourani promises to...

250
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,767
Patient's dead.

251
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,606
The floor's yours, Don.

252
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:05,735
Dave.

253
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,372
He's not dead. You said
earlier he was still in the hospital.

254
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,008
What's wrong with
him? He's got a cough.

255
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,483
You said he coughed up a lung.

256
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,584
What about the laptop?

257
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:13,984
Who cares about the laptop?

258
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,487
Yeah, and he already said he
was lying about that, you moron.

259
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,285
Gabe, we do not use
that word here. He did.

260
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,170
Yeah, and I was talking
about people like you.

261
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,457
Ooh.

262
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,457
Dr. Hourani, please.

263
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:30,059
Could you just finish,
quickly, so we can move on?

264
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:39,703
I don't know what's wrong.

265
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,339
He was stable for a while
and then all of a sudden...

266
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,517
Bronchial infection must be
from a drug resistant strain.

267
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,348
O2 sats are plummeting.

268
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,765
We need to get him
on a bronchodilator

269
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:50,899
before he goes into
respiratory arrest.

270
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:51,947
Need suction. Sit him up.

271
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,652
Start blow-by oxygen.

272
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,030
What is that?

273
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,535
I think this is...

274
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,141
It's his lung.

275
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,041
That actually happened?

276
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,212
Yes, it really happened.

277
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:25,356
I take cases that other
doctors fail to diagnose,

278
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,654
which is why I only
take one at a time.

279
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,719
My current patient
is a college student.

280
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,389
He's actually in the
hospital right now.

281
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,129
And, yes, he really did cough up

282
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,897
a large portion of
dead lung tissue.

283
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,899
How's that even possible?

284
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,872
That's what she said.

285
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,043
No, she did literally say that.

286
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,738
How's that even possible?

287
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,748
Primary squamous carcinoma could

288
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,580
cause lung tissue to
basically disintegrate.

289
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,243
It's not cancer. FOB was normal.

290
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,530
It's not infection either.

291
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,514
Broad spectrum antibiotics
haven't had any effect.

292
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,718
Who password-protects
a computer they keep

293
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,692
in a locked desk
in a locked office?

294
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,704
Someone who works with
someone who thinks it's okay

295
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,088
to break into other
people's homes.

296
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,689
An amoebic liver
abscess could rupture

297
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,928
through the diaphragm
into the thorax.

298
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,595
Not when his liver
function tests are all normal.

299
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,003
His dorm mates are
computer science majors.

300
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,440
If they're fabricating chips
they could be working with

301
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,272
all kinds of different
toxic solvents.

302
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,943
We need to search the dorm.

303
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,107
We?

304
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:30,088
While we're out, do a thorascopic
lung biopsy and c-ANCA

305
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,116
because it's sarcoidosis.

306
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,286
But if you think it's
sarcoidosis, why are you...

307
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,532
So you really did force his
roommate to hack into the laptop?

308
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,423
Why would I lie?

309
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,435
But whose laptop is it?

310
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,402
It's your
girlfriend's, isn't it?

311
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,700
She's not my girlfriend.

312
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,798
I'm just interested in
her because she's a client

313
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,867
and she sleeps
above her covers...

314
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,707
Four feet above her covers.

315
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,306
What? <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

316
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,407
So that's why she's so mad?

317
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,918
You looked through her computer?

318
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,446
No, that part happened
after she got mad.

319
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:07,391
First she got mad. Then I
stole her computer to fix things.

320
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,726
And then we got the case.

321
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,926
Wait, so you tried to fix your
relationship by stealing her computer?

322
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,126
Well, when you
say it like that...

323
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,897
Yes.

324
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,235
Looks like you're the moron.

325
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,602
Ooh.

326
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,334
Can also get three
sets of golf clubs in here.

327
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,488
<i>No way.</i>

328
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,550
You didn't get her laptop by
blowing down the door of her office.

329
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,492
That's from <i>Thunderbolt
and Lightfoot.</i>

330
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,757
Just seeing if you're
still paying attention.

331
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,993
It was actually more subtle.

332
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,402
<i>The Thomas Crown Affair.</i>

333
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,638
The Steve McQueen version.

334
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,537
Just tell us the truth already.

335
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,445
Excuse me, but
there are others here

336
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,983
who would like a
chance to speak.

337
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,711
Go right ahead.

338
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:40,843
No!

339
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,555
The audience is always right.

340
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:52,755
It wasn't me.

341
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,899
Ma'am, are you okay?
Can you hear me?

342
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,366
Ooh.

343
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,874
What's that smell?

344
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,606
Smells like a gas leak.

345
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,274
Call Dr. Cuddy!

346
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,756
You poisoned a
room full of patients

347
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,421
so you could steal
your girlfriend's laptop?

348
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,559
I didn't poison anybody.

349
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,897
I spilled some hydrogen
sulphide and ammonia on the floor,

350
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:32,405
thinking the stench
would clear the place out.

351
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,372
But instead of breathing
through his nose,

352
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,103
some idiot decided
to hold his breath.

353
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,734
He passes out

354
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,677
and before I know
it, the place is

355
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,908
a perfect storm
of mass hysteria.

356
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,250
Although it worked
out just as well.

357
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,685
<i>They're morons.</i>

358
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,052
Agreed.

359
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,455
No, not the patients, the kids.

360
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,926
It doesn't matter how you
stole it, what matters is why.

361
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,488
You know, you're starting
to remind me of someone.

362
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,466
I didn't ask how you
stole it, I asked why.

363
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,297
Isn't it obvious?

364
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,339
You think you can tell
why she's mad by reading

365
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,466
budget spreadsheets
and per diem schedules?

366
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,476
I know why she's mad,

367
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,288
what I need to know is
how to make her un-mad.

368
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,077
Step one is gaining access
to the journal on her laptop

369
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,312
where she records
her inner most thoughts,

370
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,410
instead of just
watching porn with me.

371
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,756
Oh, grow up.

372
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:28,356
If porn was bad, why would
there be so many nuns in it?

373
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,697
Why is she mad? I was myself,

374
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,130
which, by the way, she's
supposed to love unconditionally.

375
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,863
I didn't do anything.

376
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,404
We had a great weekend.

377
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:43,375
Went to a blues club, we
watched <i>Cinderfella</i> on DVD.

378
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,202
And?

379
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:49,180
It doesn't matter. She's being
unreasonable and I have to fix it.

380
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,183
I need to know what's really
important to her. I need something big.

381
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,276
Because? We're past that.

382
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:01,218
Have you tried
childhood pet names?

383
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,022
I don't know her pets.

384
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,489
She's never mentioned a pet?

385
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,123
Yeah, but I wasn't listening.

386
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,561
She's not mad because I don't
remember a dead dog's name.

387
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,966
Her first dog was Ronaldo.

388
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,339
R-O or R-E-Y?

389
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,139
I didn't ask, try both.

390
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,243
Just got a case from the ER.

391
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,908
Rutgers student came in with
what looked like acute bronchitis.

392
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,728
But there's nothing in his
blood or sputum cultures.

393
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,829
Don't you think
it's time you people

394
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,151
stop looking to the white man

395
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,301
to solve all your problems?

396
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,847
His O2 sats are in the toilet.

397
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,235
If we don't figure out
what's attacking his...

398
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,887
So figure it out!

399
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,087
I'm busy.

400
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,026
<i>That can't be true.</i>

401
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:44,161
Why not?

402
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:48,339
'Cause if he was dying...
I mean, you're a doctor.

403
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:56,543
Patients die every day. Not
all of them are interesting.

404
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,428
You still haven't
answered either question.

405
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,165
She was mad because
she's genetically programmed

406
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,602
to make a big deal
out of every little thing.

407
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,604
So she's mad
'cause she's a girl?

408
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,135
And now she's mad
because she's programmed

409
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,407
to make a big deal
out of every little thing.

410
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,949
Actually, she's not like that.

411
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,294
Why are you sticking up for her?

412
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,651
She said you were a pathetic
jerk and she hates you.

413
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,312
That was a long time ago.

414
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:37,856
It was two days ago.

415
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,755
And it wasn't even true then.

416
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:40,986
How do you know?

417
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,356
Because I know how you think.

418
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,429
Really?

419
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:45,824
Really.

420
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,262
Really?

421
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:09,616
And no peck on the cheek.
It has to be on the lips.

422
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,985
<i>Winning a bet to
force her to kiss you</i>

423
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,721
actually cuts
against your theory

424
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,954
that you know how she thinks.

425
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,476
I wasn't forcing her to do
anything that she didn't want to do.

426
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,195
You hoping for a career
in the NBA or the NFL?

427
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,998
The bet let her do
what she wanted to do,

428
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,870
while still being able
to act like she didn't,

429
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,483
so her friends
wouldn't get all, like,

430
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,203
calling her a slut or something.

431
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,146
Not that it's slutty or
anything, it's just a kiss.

432
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,473
Not even close to true.

433
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,386
I just couldn't
believe I'd lose.

434
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,990
Ah, now we're getting somewhere.

435
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,552
No, we're not.

436
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,490
Oh, I thought we were.

437
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,294
No, you thought we weren't
and that's exactly what you want

438
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,894
because you don't want to
tell us why was she mad at you!

439
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,217
You tell us you don't
want to do your job

440
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,786
because you're too busy trying
to break into your girlfriend's laptop

441
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,972
to figure out a way to
make her not mad at you

442
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:10,244
but you don't tell us
why she was mad at you.

443
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,351
It's stupid.

444
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,649
Talk.

445
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,993
I'm out of here.

446
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,100
Unless...

447
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,668
Rachel's gonna be up soon.

448
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,103
You never know.

449
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,277
Yes, I do.

450
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,344
Could you take the
garbage out before you go?

451
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,443
I would, but...

452
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,056
Oh, come on. It's not a lot.

453
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,959
The pain's always worst
first thing in the morning.

454
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,632
Mommy!

455
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,196
<i>You used her toothbrush.</i>

456
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,792
<i>That's so gross.</i>

457
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,734
What's the big deal?

458
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,915
It's not like she had a problem

459
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,373
with swapping spit
the night before.

460
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,275
Maybe it's not the swapping
spit that bothers her,

461
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,471
but the fact that you
don't listen to her.

462
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,923
Had she warned you not to do it?

463
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,074
Oh, I listen to her.

464
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,777
But you just said
before that you didn't.

465
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,228
No, I said I didn't
remember what she said...

466
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,948
No, you said you
don't listen to her.

467
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,647
I listen to her.

468
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,920
Okay? Believe me, I listen.

469
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:07,833
It's my toothbrush
and it's not just once,

470
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,824
and it's not like I'd even care,

471
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,430
but you totally destroy it.

472
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,734
You're supposed
to brush with it,

473
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,800
not gnaw on it like
a rawhide bone.

474
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,972
I think Ms. Four-Cavities'
time would be better spent

475
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,745
copying Mr. No-Cavities
instead of complaining about him.

476
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,353
And given what
I'd just been doing,

477
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,065
I thought you wouldn't
want me going out to dinner

478
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,649
without a good
brush and a floss.

479
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,819
Would you please just use
the toothbrush I bought you?

480
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:39,023
Would you please just shut
up and watch the movie?

481
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,094
I said, please.

482
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,838
Why would you have to brush
your teeth before you go to dinner?

483
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,969
You don't wanna know. Yet.

484
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,640
You're gross and dumb.

485
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,148
You listen to what she says

486
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,276
just so you can tell
her how wrong she is.

487
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,183
You are clueless and naive.

488
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,448
I have to tell her that she's
wrong because no one else will.

489
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,724
She's the boss,

490
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,556
which means she's
surrounded by morons

491
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,460
who are either afraid of her,

492
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,692
or they want to kiss up
to her, or they want to

493
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,698
kiss her.

494
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:18,827
But not you.

495
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:19,961
I already kissed her,

496
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,683
and I respect her
enough not to treat her like

497
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:24,768
some tender blossom
who needs to be coddled.

498
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,977
Makes sense to me.

499
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,540
That's what you think you did?

500
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,785
Yeah, totally.

501
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,023
You?

502
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,328
No, I didn't punch her.

503
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:09,919
Oh, my God.

504
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,014
<i>You're a moron.</i>
I didn't mean to.

505
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,718
The stick had a
wicked heel curve.

506
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,259
Did I mention, you're a moron?

507
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,760
Hey, you just
said that it's wrong

508
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,195
to treat your girlfriend
like she's weaker than you.

509
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,542
I'm not talking
about trying to score,

510
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,898
I'm talking about shooting high.

511
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,367
Tennis shoes on a wooden floor?

512
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,837
She obviously can't butterfly
and cover the low corners.

513
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,673
Your turn. The laptop.

514
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,586
I must be in the midst of
a complex partial seizure

515
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,749
'cause I know you are
not sitting at my desk.

516
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,258
Sorry, I ran out
of lotion in mine.

517
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,604
Get the hell out of here. Can't.

518
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:52,291
This is the only place left that
Cuddy will never look for me,

519
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,775
and I still haven't found
what I'm looking for.

520
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,065
I can tell you what you're about
to find. It's my foot in your ass.

521
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,434
I don't think you got
enough lotion for that.

522
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,418
How'd you even get in
here? The door was locked.

523
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:05,443
Well, either I can
walk through walls, or...

524
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,570
We have lift off.

525
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,773
Is that Cuddy's journal?

526
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,079
No, it's a freelance piece
I'm writing for <i>Teen Vogue.</i>

527
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,448
Let me see that.

528
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,919
Sorry, gotta go.

529
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,052
Key.

530
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,621
Oh.

531
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,894
I gotta give you
one thing, Hourani.

532
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:31,769
Your wife, she's
beautiful. I mean, wow.

533
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,738
Thank you.

534
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,374
House!

535
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:48,712
<i>Wait.</i>

536
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,055
I thought you were Dr. Hourani.

537
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,039
Yeah.

538
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,740
So that's why you're
here? Well, that was stupid.

539
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,639
I know.

540
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,473
Mr. Stupid Head at your service.

541
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,822
<i>Where are you now?</i>

542
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,109
In the principal's office.

543
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,843
<i>House, we don't
have time for games.</i>

544
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,494
The PET scan was
negative for sarcoidosis.

545
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,510
Great. Means the
treatment's already working.

546
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,317
It would if we'd actually started
the treatment, but we didn't.

547
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,584
<i>Why the hell not?</i>

548
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,455
Because it's not sarcoidosis.

549
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,221
<i>If you were here,
you would know that.</i>

550
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,922
He's dying. What's
left of his lung

551
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,607
has collapsed and
FNA of the mediastinal...

552
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,997
<i>I don't care about the FNA.</i>

553
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:36,227
What I care about is how
he responds to the treatment.

554
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,792
House... <i>Just do it.</i>

555
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:45,342
Sarcoidosis is a
diagnosis of exclusion,

556
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,144
which means that the cowards who
spend their time excluding what it isn't

557
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,342
usually cause their
patients to die from what it is.

558
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,613
I don't get it. Why would
you lie about your name?

559
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,019
Who cares?

560
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:58,442
What did she
write in her journal?

561
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,256
Thank you!

562
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,489
That is exactly my point. Why
does no one ever believe me?

563
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,024
What?

564
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,994
Just because he's dying
doesn't make it interesting.

565
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,103
You cheated on her, didn't you?

566
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,832
No, I didn't cheat on her.

567
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:16,017
It's obviously more than
just you used her toothbrush

568
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,942
and wouldn't take
the garbage out.

569
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,137
No, actually, it
was exactly that.

570
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,039
I just need some time alone.

571
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,677
Because I used your toothbrush?

572
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,386
And you wouldn't
take out the garbage.

573
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,689
That's insane. You
know that, right?

574
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,022
You do whatever
you want. Always.

575
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,289
I said I was sorry.

576
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,273
I was still half asleep. I
wasn't paying attention.

577
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:40,356
And you're always right.

578
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,976
And I don't mean you
always think you're right.

579
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,560
But you are
actually always right.

580
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,831
Because that's all that matters.

581
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,203
That doesn't even make sense.

582
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:50,374
What? You want me to be wrong?

583
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,468
I want you to care about

584
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,741
more than just what
you want, what you think.

585
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,310
You need me, House.
And you may even love me,

586
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,719
but you don't care about me.

587
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,220
And I deserve someone who does.

588
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,841
That's what I said!
You don't listen to her.

589
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,274
You didn't say that.

590
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,211
Yes, I did.

591
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,644
Well, I wasn't listening then.

592
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,343
But you found a way
to fix things, right?

593
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,452
That's why you were happy
when you read her laptop.

594
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,950
I did.

595
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,055
At least I thought I did.

596
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,725
She recently got
the thin envelope

597
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,059
from her first choice preschool.

598
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:48,725
But it turns out, it was
her fake first choice

599
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,011
because she was
convinced she couldn't

600
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,697
get her kid into her
actual first choice

601
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:56,673
without a substantial donation
or an inside connection.

602
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,142
If it's Brye Park,
I'm afraid she's right.

603
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,576
Wait, that's our school.

604
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,240
What other school
would he be talking about?

605
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,250
Just finish the story.

606
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,420
You know, I gotta tell you,

607
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,423
there's bossy,
which can be sexy,

608
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,817
and then there's bitchy...

609
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,655
Finish the story.

610
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,756
You obviously know this
because you're on the school board,

611
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,096
which puts you on the inside

612
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:26,569
and being the CEO here
obviously connects you to Cuddy.

613
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,903
Well, if we're so connected,
why isn't she the one asking?

614
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,341
Because she thinks it's wrong

615
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,403
to use connections
to cut in line. I don't.

616
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,713
I might be able to help.

617
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,013
Fantastic.

618
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,521
But I could use a favor as well.

619
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,315
<i>Where are you?</i>

620
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,434
I needed to take
care of something.

621
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,517
<i>It's not a foreign body.</i>

622
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:48,703
<i>You must've missed it.</i>

623
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:49,922
If we do any more imaging,

624
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:52,106
we're gonna have to add
radiation poisoning to the DDX.

625
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,894
I meant the sarcoidosis.

626
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,457
The biopsy and c-ANCA
were both negative.

627
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:57,745
We're gonna have to
do a pneumonectomy.

628
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,397
<i>No sign of drug
or alcohol abuse.</i>

629
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:03,374
He's not a smoker, coal miner
or a potter. It's sarcoidosis.

630
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,410
<i>Start him on corticosteroids
and methotrexate.</i>

631
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,912
If it's a drug resistant bug
and we give him steroids...

632
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,972
He'll die, which from the sound of
it, wouldn't be much worse than...

633
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,817
You moron.

634
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,095
But you have to show him
your ID and your insurance stuff.

635
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,765
You can't just give
him a fake name.

636
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,002
You don't have to do anything.

637
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,601
Last time I checked,
this was still America.

638
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,843
'Course that was 10 years ago.

639
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,648
But you're gonna pay him, right?

640
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:45,945
I mean, it was your fault.

641
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,851
A yellow light
does not mean stop.

642
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,924
At the most, 20% my fault.

643
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,422
Since the insurance
companies automatically

644
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:58,020
put 100% of the fault
on the rear-ender,

645
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,758
my little lie was
actually an effort

646
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,097
to achieve an outcome
closer to the truth.

647
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:07,263
And it would've worked, too,

648
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:10,138
if it weren't for
those meddling kids.

649
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,470
I am Dr. Hourani.

650
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,104
Then why did you say the
other doctor was Hourani?

651
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,312
It's a common name.

652
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,979
It's like Smith in Lebanon.

653
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,487
Let me see your ID.

654
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:24,966
I told you. I left it
in my other pants.

655
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,500
Really? 'Cause it looks
like it's still in this pair.

656
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,651
Get your hands off me.

657
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:28,853
Give me your ID. Hey!

658
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,204
Will you stop...
Give me your ID.

659
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,868
Gentlemen, please.

660
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:33,964
- Kids, stay calm.
- Give me your ID!

661
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,860
Stop! Stop this right
now! Stay in your seats.

662
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,971
Stay calm, you guys.
Stay in your seats.

663
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,205
Gentlemen, please, this
is not the time or place.

664
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:48,110
Is there a problem
in here, Ms. Corwin?

665
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,088
Why don't you just take off?

666
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,761
It's not like the principal
can call your parents.

667
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:07,890
No, but the principal
can call the police.

668
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,161
Or the guy he's
doing the favor for.

669
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,969
His girlfriend's
obviously gonna find out.

670
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,267
He's screwed.

671
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,931
I'd bolt. No, you wouldn't.

672
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,572
Yeah, I would.

673
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,039
No, you wouldn't.

674
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,909
How do you know?

675
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,718
What's wrong?

676
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,928
I guess... I don't
wanna do it like this.

677
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,529
Sorry for shooting
the puck so hard

678
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,969
and tricking you in the bet.

679
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,464
You didn't trick me.

680
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:49,597
Yeah, I did.

681
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,273
I gave Madison a Red
Dead Revolver cheat code

682
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,971
so she'd hit your
foot with the rope.

683
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,384
I knew you couldn't beat me.

684
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,750
You're right. It's just...

685
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:07,215
I really like you and I'm
pretty sure you like me, too,

686
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,994
but I don't want to
play any more games.

687
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:15,392
When you want... I
mean, if you ever want to,

688
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:20,162
just tell me you're
ready, and, you know...

689
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,096
Sorry.

690
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,343
Well done.

691
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,347
He's not always a jerk.

692
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,758
And neither are you.

693
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,187
She obviously likes you.

694
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,664
Just stop using her toothbrush
and stop playing games.

695
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,936
She'll still like you.

696
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:58,100
She's bossy, but
she's usually right.

697
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,355
Thank you. FIELDS: Dr. House,
can I ask you a question?

698
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,022
Are you insane or just stupid?

699
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,160
Is there a third option?

700
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,393
Actually, I don't
think there is.

701
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,971
I'm sorry, I just
wasn't thinking.

702
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,708
I mean, I was, but
only about myself.

703
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,345
That's apparently the way I am.

704
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,546
Usually. Not always.

705
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,516
I need to convince
someone of that.

706
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,986
And you think you can do
that by getting someone to

707
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,326
pull strings to get her
daughter into our preschool?

708
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,224
I spoke to Sanford Wells.

709
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:03,071
You can call the police, you can
turn me in for lying at the accident.

710
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,973
I'm sure Mr. Dryden has
already taken care of that.

711
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,210
Let her daughter in.

712
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,011
She's a great kid and
Dr. Cuddy's a great mom.

713
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,416
They'll fit in perfectly here.

714
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:20,488
And how exactly does admitting her
daughter prove how unselfish you are?

715
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,390
Seems like you're still
doing it to help yourself,

716
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,724
not anyone else.

717
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,494
I don't know.

718
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,227
I just know that I
need to do something.

719
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,068
I need her in my life.

720
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,240
You know what it's like
to actually need someone?

721
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,009
Yes.

722
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,684
I do.

723
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:55,420
But I also know what it's
like to have responsibilities.

724
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,022
Maybe it's time you grew up.

725
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:12,143
Dr. House? Is there
anything you'd like to say?

726
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,709
Can I be excused?

727
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,944
It's just food.

728
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,552
Something small enough
to go down the wrong pipe,

729
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,890
but too big to be washed
out by the bronchial lavage.

730
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,791
Wouldn't show up on a CT.

731
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:37,164
But would cause the COPD and wouldn't
respond to steroids or antibiotics.

732
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:41,072
Prep him for exploratory
surgery and start the betting.

733
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,334
Betting?

734
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,671
I got 100 bucks
that says it's a pea.

735
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,284
I'm busy.

736
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,412
I know.

737
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,920
I just want to
say that I'm sorry.

738
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,466
Shouldn't you be saying
that to Sanford Wells?

739
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:16,638
A fifth grade career day? You
really thought you could pull that off?

740
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,169
I figured, how hard could it be?

741
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,214
And I wanted to prove to you

742
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:29,618
that I do care about your needs.

743
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,215
And Rachel's.

744
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:34,882
I do.

745
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,321
Is that why you also
stole my computer?

746
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,192
Yes, it is.

747
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,666
And then threw it in the trash?

748
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:46,705
I did not throw it, I placed it,

749
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,315
knowing that the
janitor would find it,

750
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,639
and know it was yours, and
return it to you unharmed.

751
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,234
I'm a moron.

752
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,974
But that doesn't mean I don't care
about you, I don't think about you,

753
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,974
I don't want you to be happy.

754
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,652
I was wrong, you were
right. I can do better.

755
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,987
Just give me a chance.

756
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:16,027
What were you? An
astronaut or a bull fighter?

757
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,571
I was myself.

758
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,200
For the most part.

759
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,748
I know you're still upset,

760
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,649
so I'll leave you to deal
with it however you want.

761
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:41,487
House.

762
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,224
You want to come
over for dinner tonight?

763
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,435
I'd love to.
