1
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,270
Hey, sweetie.

2
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,373
Yeah. No, I'm sorry. The
meeting's running a little late.

3
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,811
Well, you know Matheson,
guy loves to hear himself talk.

4
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,713
Yeah, yeah, I'll meet
you at the restaurant.

5
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,504
Hey, we're going over the contracts
now. I got to get back in there.

6
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,656
I love you, too.

7
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,075
You're getting paid to clean,
not window shop, Vesky.

8
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,475
You calling me a thief?

9
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,810
Take it easy, I'm just
yanking your chain.

10
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,674
Damn, it's freezing in here.

11
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,184
Better the cold than the smell.

12
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,550
I used to think my job sucked.

13
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,722
How much you make an
hour anyway? Not enough.

14
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,815
The difference is, this job
is just a temporary setback.

15
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,054
You, on the other hand,
will always be a schmuck.

16
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,325
Yeah. A schmuck with a
guaranteed pension and benefits.

17
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,063
I'll take it.

18
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,843
Sorry I'm late.

19
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,622
No talking about
real estate tonight.

20
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,790
I really want you to
just enjoy yourself.

21
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,053
Seeing you in that dress,
I'd say mission accomplished.

22
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,757
It gets a little better. Wait till
you see what's on underneath.

23
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,389
Fresh tako with lemon. Enjoy.

24
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,295
I ordered the appetizer special.

25
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,403
Oh, I thought tako was a kind
of tuna. We're so not eating this.

26
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,269
Well, we should at least try it.

27
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,941
Please. It's moving, Bert.

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,273
That's so gross.

29
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,544
Actually, it's not that bad.

30
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,617
Really?

31
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,879
I'm not eating it.

32
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,661
To us, on our third anniversary.

33
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,594
The day I met you was...

34
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,625
Was...

35
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,430
Bert?

36
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,897
Bert? What is it? What...

37
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,776
Honey, what's wrong?

38
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,772
Oh, God. Someone,
please, call 911!

39
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,444
Can you breathe?

40
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,963
House!

41
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,919
I assume you're avoiding
me because of the charity gala.

42
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,931
This Friday? It must have
completely slipped my mind.

43
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,431
So you'll be there. No, I meant

44
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:28,878
it slipped my mind to
tell you I'm not going.

45
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,046
What do you
think it'll look like

46
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,670
if you don't show up
when I get an award?

47
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,766
Like I don't give a crap about
awards, charities, what it looks like.

48
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,069
If you ever want...

49
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,739
I RSVP'd two days ago.

50
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,247
What, you think
I'm a complete ass?

51
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,285
If you were already
going, why did you...

52
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,720
Foreplay.

53
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,625
What?

54
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,427
Are you wearing my tie?

55
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,297
I saw it in your closet, and it
happened to match my shirt.

56
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,598
Why were you in my closet?

57
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,469
Looking for a tie.
What's the big deal?

58
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,133
Obviously he wants you out
of the closet for some reason.

59
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,336
I suspect marriage,
but I'm liberal that way.

60
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,337
Now tell me how someone
can have an allergic reaction

61
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,315
when all of their tests were
negative for known allergens.

62
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,410
Environmental. File says
he's a real estate developer.

63
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,166
He could have been exposed to
something visiting a construction site.

64
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,624
He's lying.

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,456
He's not an executive.
I saw his hands.

66
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,963
They're covered with
calluses and little cuts.

67
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,590
He works with them, a lot.

68
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,158
Stand up.

69
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,605
Our little girl is
finally growing up.

70
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,342
I mean, you dream of this day,
but when it finally happens...

71
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,686
So, what did Mr. Meat Hooks
say when you called him a liar?

72
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,116
Uh...

73
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,951
I didn't.

74
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,693
Baby steps. Go
down there and do it.

75
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,699
Um...

76
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,459
But what if I'm wrong?

77
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:09,875
I'll just end up offending him.

78
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,895
Consider that part a bonus.

79
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,572
All right, I'll send along one
of your big brothers to help.

80
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,669
You want scary,
smarmy or shorty?

81
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,915
We need to ask
you a few questions.

82
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,353
Alone, if you don't mind.

83
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,259
Uh, they tend to be
personal in nature...

84
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,329
I'm his wife.

85
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,059
I can probably answer
them better than he can.

86
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,261
They're about his job.

87
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:48,533
Well, what does that matter?
He sits in an office all day.

88
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,236
Honey, take a break.

89
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,403
It's okay. No!

90
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,242
Seriously, if there's something
really wrong with him,

91
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,906
I want to know about it.

92
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,416
It's not...

93
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,918
Our questions are about
what he eats for lunch at work

94
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,221
and what comes out at the end.

95
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,883
Bowel movements mostly.

96
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,949
Color, texture, smell.

97
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,026
Okay...

98
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,393
Pretty sure you
can't help with that.

99
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,190
Maybe I could use a break.

100
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,646
Thank you for your honesty.

101
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,530
You're welcome.

102
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,470
I can't let my wife find out about
this. You have to promise me.

103
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,186
That depends on
if it's considered...

104
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,739
We promise.

105
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,643
I lost everything
because of the recession.

106
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,487
My entire real estate company.

107
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,423
And she has no idea.

108
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,304
So what do you
do for a living now?

109
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,627
I used to be a janitor
when I was in college,

110
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,200
and now I'm almost 40 and doing
it for the people I built homes for.

111
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,491
Why?

112
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,761
Why do you think?
Because I need the money.

113
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,272
No, I mean, why lie
to your wife about it?

114
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,106
None of our business, really.

115
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,370
What kind of cleaning?

116
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,779
Industrial jobs.
Crime-scene clean-up,

117
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,642
septic tank repair,
mold removal.

118
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,614
It's physically killing me.

119
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,686
It's the holy grail of
potential diseases.

120
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,952
Caustic cleaning
chemicals, raw sewage,

121
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,790
mold spores, fungal infections.

122
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,296
Not to mention cleaning up
blood and other body fluids

123
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,404
from a homicide yesterday.

124
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,265
We should check
out the crime scene.

125
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,979
He might have picked up a bacterial
infection from the victim's blood.

126
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,483
The place has been cleaned
and sanitized by our patient.

127
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,716
We sent for the autopsy report,

128
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,883
probably take a week to get it.

129
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,344
When he's not working, where
does he go all day to hide out?

130
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,674
His old real estate office?

131
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,214
Treat for bacterial infection.

132
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:37,978
Meantime, Bert, take Ernie and
check his office for environmentals.

133
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,714
I'll talk to Cuddy about getting
the autopsy results faster.

134
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,582
You're Bert.

135
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,092
He's Ernie.

136
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,691
And they're both roommates.
That was a good one.

137
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,785
Well, at least the Alzheimer's
patient in room 202

138
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,358
won't remember she only
got half a ham sandwich.

139
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,018
I'm doing her a favor.

140
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,930
You're really going
to the charity gala?

141
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,091
Why?

142
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,711
I wanna do something
nice for my girlfriend.

143
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,136
You never do anything
unless it stands to benefit you.

144
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,796
I realize that three
failed marriages

145
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,807
can leave a man
twisted and bitter inside.

146
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,935
But in a good relationship, people
sometimes do things for each other.

147
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,038
A hundred says
you don't show up.

148
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,118
You're giving me an
incentive to actually show up?

149
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,951
A personal, selfish incentive.

150
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,786
I'm just making easy money.

151
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,649
Two hundred.

152
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,322
How high did Cuddy
authorize you to go?

153
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,797
She... She...

154
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,764
Three.

155
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,307
She really wants you there.

156
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,900
Why do people believe that I'm
incapable of doing anything nice?

157
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,435
Experience.

158
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,809
It's a tie.

159
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,983
I'm not wearing your underwear.

160
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,023
I said I was sorry.
You want the tie back?

161
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,183
Can we get to work?

162
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,157
I can't tell if you're
being passive-aggressive

163
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,162
or if this is just your regular
fun-loving personality.

164
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,391
Both. And you can keep the tie.

165
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,956
It went out of style
five years ago.

166
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,091
Vicodin, and he doesn't
have a prescription.

167
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,829
We didn't test for an
allergic reaction to narcotics.

168
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:06,333
Or it's the obvious.
Take a look at this.

169
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,074
We think you're suffering
from boric acid exposure.

170
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,342
Which is causing the rash.

171
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,008
We need to
decontaminate your skin

172
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,883
and hope you didn't
inhale it into your lungs.

173
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,251
I feel like I'm...

174
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,418
Never seen a fever
spike this fast before.

175
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,391
Acid exposure burns, literally,
it shouldn't be causing this.

176
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,586
What's happening to him?

177
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,729
Bert? Honey, are you all right?

178
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,174
We have to get his
fever down right now.

179
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,598
If it gets any higher, it could
cause permanent brain damage.

180
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,949
We used cooling blankets
to get his temperature down.

181
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,441
He stabilized at 102.

182
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,205
Problem's not boric acid. We
found no traces of it on his skin.

183
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,214
Infection from the
murder victim's blood?

184
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,284
Autopsy report was negative
for communicable disease.

185
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,586
Cause of death was an
overly stabbey girlfriend.

186
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,214
We found Vicodin in his office.

187
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,553
Give it to me.

188
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,630
It might look like Vicodin,
but be something else.

189
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,782
It's real.

190
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,677
Unfortunately.

191
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,853
Because Vicodin doesn't
cause rash, fever and joint pain.

192
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,737
It does make Taub considerably
less annoying, though.

193
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,094
Maybe we're thinking too
far outside the box here.

194
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,307
Just because he
could have picked up

195
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,993
any one of a hundred
exotic diseases

196
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,410
from his job,
doesn't mean he did.

197
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,460
Taub's life partner has a point.

198
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,028
We started treatment with
antibiotics and he got worse.

199
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,439
The simple answer begins
with "M," ends with a "mia."

200
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,602
Meningococcemia?

201
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:58,937
That works, too.

202
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,708
Confirm with a lumbar puncture.

203
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,145
And on the off
chance we're wrong,

204
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,626
find out what else
he's been lying about,

205
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,710
besides his job
and his drug use.

206
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,253
You sure do hide
a lot from your wife.

207
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,396
Your job, your
drug use, what else?

208
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,331
What does it matter?

209
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,579
We can't help you unless
you're completely honest with us.

210
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,198
I was doing manual labor.

211
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,036
If I came home
barely able to move,

212
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,387
Diane would know something's up.

213
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,840
That's why I take the
Vicodin, to hide the pain.

214
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,573
I'm not an addict.

215
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,246
Is that all you're hiding?

216
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,412
I didn't just lose my job.

217
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,516
I mean, that's how it started,

218
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,454
but I figured it'd just
last a couple of months.

219
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,357
I maxed out our credit cards,

220
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,022
took a double
mortgage on the house

221
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,191
and I sold all of
our investments.

222
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,613
Who'd have thought the
recession would last this long?

223
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,573
So it's Obama's fault
you're lying to your wife?

224
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,439
Look, I screwed up,

225
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,936
but it's too late now.

226
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,949
I need you to roll over on
your left side for the procedure.

227
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,733
Haven't you ever done
something in a relationship

228
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:18,917
you wish you could take back?

229
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,796
Maybe. How'd you handle it?

230
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:27,131
I told the truth, eventually.

231
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,998
How'd that work out?

232
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,335
Not well.

233
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,448
I need some intel on this
charity event on Friday night.

234
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,419
If I go, do I have to actually
give money to charity?

235
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,456
I'm going.

236
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,623
I just don't want it to suck.

237
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,788
There has to be a
way to make this fun.

238
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,762
Show up and behave.
Problem solved.

239
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,593
Your problem solved.

240
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,001
Don't you think she
deserves more than a plaque

241
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,505
and a round of applause for
15 years of running this dump?

242
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,132
It's a watch, not a plaque.

243
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,676
It's a cliché.

244
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,543
I want to make
things more exciting.

245
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,910
Something she'll remember
for more than 10 minutes.

246
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,508
Okay. By fun and exciting, you
mean screwing this up for Cuddy

247
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,054
so she won't even dream of
asking you to go to one again.

248
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,588
You really can't stand
seeing me happy, can you?

249
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,232
Gram stains are negative
in the first CSF samples.

250
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,234
One down, three to go.

251
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,257
I'm starving. You
want to get a bite...

252
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,534
Already have plans.

253
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,699
A date?

254
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,918
What difference does it make?

255
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,422
We're roommates,
not a married couple.

256
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,150
We don't have to eat
every night together.

257
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,910
So you're saying it's a date?

258
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,348
Yeah, it's a date.

259
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,943
I don't have plans.

260
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,852
Ooh. Shocking.

261
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,579
Are you mad
because I picked you?

262
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,555
You're stuck actually
doing your job?

263
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,225
A little hazing never
hurt a med student.

264
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,024
I doubt it ever helped either.

265
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,756
I'm sorry that I
think our patient

266
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,009
shouldn't be lying to his wife.

267
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:10,094
I'm a woman, I guess I just
have a different perspective.

268
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,935
You're sharing this unique
insight that women don't like lying?

269
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,272
No, I'm sharing my unique insight
that you don't respect women.

270
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,711
You sleep with a different
one every few days.

271
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:25,215
Or maybe you find meaning
in meaningless relationships?

272
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,618
At least I have relationships.

273
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,212
I'm seeing a high lymphocyte
count in the CSF sample.

274
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,728
And that couldn't wait until they
finished mocking each other?

275
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,960
Means it's not meningococcemia.

276
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,759
He's getting worse. He
can barely move his legs.

277
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,326
I can't feel them. I
can't feel my feet!

278
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,469
What is it?

279
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,007
What is happening to him?

280
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,320
Luckily, he didn't
lose his feet.

281
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,908
We were able to
restore his circulation

282
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,748
before any serious
damage set in.

283
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,812
It's not meningococcemia.
CSF was negative for bacteria.

284
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,756
But high on lymphocytes.
It's some kind of viral infection.

285
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,349
Serum sickness fits everything.

286
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,259
There'd have to be a cause,
some drug he's been exposed to.

287
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,924
In rare cases, a tick or
spider bite could set it off.

288
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,262
Show of hands.

289
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,173
Who's going to this
charity thing Friday night?

290
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,262
Already got a date.

291
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,429
Cuddy's getting an award.

292
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,939
I think we should all be
there, show our support.

293
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,739
I assume you're
planning on screwing it up,

294
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,335
so you want to
maximize the witnesses.

295
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,908
Why does everyone go to that?

296
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,038
Experience.

297
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,642
Shut up. How about go or
work the clinic all weekend?

298
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,881
I hear it's Genital
Herpes Awareness Month.

299
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,516
Serum sickness fits.

300
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:42,323
Take him off the antibiotics,
start him on corticosteroids.

301
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,589
If we're right, he'll
be better by morning.

302
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,030
Canceled date, huh?

303
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,935
You're bugging my cell phone?

304
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,407
No, I just noticed
you're not wearing it.

305
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,770
What?

306
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,009
Your first-date shirt.

307
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,643
You're tracking my wardrobe?

308
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:03,715
I'm just observant.

309
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,384
It's why I'm good at my job.

310
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,011
It's also the reason you're
starting to annoy the crap out of me.

311
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,291
Forgive me for trying to
connect a little with my roommate.

312
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:23,560
I just found out that Rachel is now
officially more than just emotional

313
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,105
with her online friend.

314
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,908
You're getting divorced,
what'd you expect?

315
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,042
I know. You're right.

316
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,709
Just thinking about it kind of
makes me want to throw up.

317
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,317
You still want to get
something to eat?

318
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,324
I could cook.

319
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,240
That had to hurt. - You suck.

320
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,132
Not as bad as you, and you
just missed a free upgrade.

321
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,260
You just did it again.
You ran past a power up.

322
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,804
Double damn.

323
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,307
Are you just letting me win?

324
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,312
Of course I'm not letting you...

325
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,748
Okay, maybe a little.

326
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,647
You're having fun,
right? Not anymore.

327
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,929
I used to think the
whole brooding thing

328
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,444
was just part of
your work persona,

329
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,580
but now I live with you.

330
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,817
You need to lighten up, Bert.

331
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,792
And you think I need you to show
me what? How to have fun? Relax?

332
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:24,023
It was working
until you flipped out.

333
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,643
If I was going to take
advice on how to live my life,

334
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,363
it would not be from you.

335
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,300
You're broke, you
ruined your marriage,

336
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,430
and yet you act like
you're the victim here.

337
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,873
Like somehow we're all
supposed to feel sorry for you.

338
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,238
You screwed up your life,

339
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,313
not some emotional
friend your wife met on the...

340
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,511
What's wrong? My stomach.

341
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,517
You poisoned me!

342
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,584
I ate the same thing you did.

343
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,383
How come I'm not...

344
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,318
Oh! Oh.

345
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,418
Oh, dear God.

346
00:19:56,796 --> 00:20:00,392
Open the door, Bert.
Please. Baby, talk to me!

347
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:04,767
He locked himself inside.
He went crazy. He hit me.

348
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,062
Bert.

349
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,632
Open the door, Bert.

350
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,438
Bert, talk to us.

351
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,572
Bert? DIANE:
Open the door, Bert.

352
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,797
I can't get out!
Why? I can't get out.

353
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,594
No, no!

354
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,797
God! No!

355
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,737
Why can't I get out?

356
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,875
The skin rash is gone.

357
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:48,107
But whatever it is, it
obviously moved into his brain.

358
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,978
Or not. MARTHA: He
had a psychotic break.

359
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,482
I'd say that usually indicates
neurological involvement.

360
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,380
Usually, not always.

361
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,217
The hallucinations
stopped once the steroids

362
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,984
we gave him cleared his system.

363
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,891
I think... I think
we caused this.

364
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,154
What happened to you?

365
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,555
Taub tried to
kill me last night.

366
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,726
The steroids probably
did clear up the rash,

367
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,066
but the rest of his
symptoms are the same.

368
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,470
And now bilateral
conjunctivitis.

369
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,598
Excuse me, I'll be back.

370
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,039
I better go check on him.

371
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:36,288
Swollen joints, high white
count, fever, conjunctivitis.

372
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:37,857
Anyone?

373
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,122
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

374
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,167
What, you two can't think
and poop at the same time?

375
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,965
There's a life at stake here.

376
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,668
Could be Familial
Mediterranean fever.

377
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,370
Not likely, that almost always

378
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,312
presents with abdominal
pain or diarrhea.

379
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,584
Given his job, the skin
and eye involvement,

380
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,211
it's more likely a
systemic fungal infection.

381
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,552
We would have seen
it in his blood work.

382
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:09,894
Unless the saline used to recover
and store the tissue samples

383
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,106
has been shown
in recent studies...

384
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,792
Get new blood and CSF samples

385
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,697
using formaldehyde
instead of saline.

386
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,728
And start him and his wife
on triple antifungal therapy.

387
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,862
His wife?

388
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,998
Well, if he's really
trying to keep her happy,

389
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,669
I assume they've
shared bodily fluids.

390
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,748
I hate you.

391
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,649
You could have picked
it up from your job.

392
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,554
The real one, not the fake one.

393
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,068
If you would've been
more honest about...

394
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,151
How is that relevant?

395
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,591
If his wife knew about his job,

396
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,689
they both might have been
more alert to the early symptoms.

397
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,233
We could have caught it earlier.

398
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,728
That's ridiculous.

399
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh, my God,
sweetheart. I'm so sorry.

400
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,441
Whatever you're doing,
it's obviously not working.

401
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,013
We think he has a
systemic fungal infection.

402
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,515
We're starting him on a
parenteral antifungal regimen.

403
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,302
It can be transferred
through bodily fluids,

404
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,304
so we have to start you
on the treatment as well.

405
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,217
A fungus? Where would he...

406
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,448
Could be from anywhere. The
spores can become airborne.

407
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,116
But why would he
be the only one?

408
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,694
No one in our neighborhood,
no one in his office building.

409
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:20,563
Sometimes it just happens
that way. It's hard to explain.

410
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,096
No, it's not.

411
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,966
I need to talk to my wife
in private for a moment.

412
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,685
Your numbers
indicate the medication

413
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,236
isn't helping with
your cholesterol...

414
00:23:58,804 --> 00:23:59,828
Hey!

415
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,099
Huh?

416
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,136
What are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing?

417
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,738
I'm auditioning a
band for Friday night.

418
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,045
So you're trying to ruin
Cuddy's moment in the spotlight.

419
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,947
Ruin? These guys
recorded with Juan Gabriel.

420
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,300
They're gonna cost me two grand.

421
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,512
This is not a prank.

422
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,616
These guys are the beginning
of Cuddy's evening to remember,

423
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,327
which in turn will
make my evening...

424
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,625
I think if you do this,

425
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,188
your evening will end with you

426
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,700
in your apartment
alone with a sock.

427
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,814
This is all for the best.

428
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,857
Yeah. Either that
or the opposite.

429
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,257
If it means anything,

430
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,124
I think he's
honestly just trying

431
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,029
to protect you and
keep you happy.

432
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,933
Oh, God! Of course.

433
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,321
He would tell a bunch of
strangers before he would tell me.

434
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:07,862
I mean, why not? I'm just
a stupid housewife, right?

435
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,243
You know, I have something
you can share with him. It's over.

436
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,539
He's a liar, and I never
want to hear from him again.

437
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,924
You may want to go check
on him, his fever's back.

438
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,383
But I'm done worrying about him.

439
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,349
She was right, he's at 101.

440
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:23,616
Diane?

441
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,602
We're gonna have to
get your fever down.

442
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,011
What's wrong?
What are you saying?

443
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,960
I can't hear you! I
can't hear anything.

444
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,962
Why can't I hear anything?

445
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,970
His hearing's almost
completely gone.

446
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:44,142
The new blood and CSF tests
were negative for spores and fungus.

447
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,235
Tumor necrosis factor syndrome?

448
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,940
Fits the conjunctivitis and
painful swelling in his joints.

449
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:53,075
Except it's never been documented
to cause hearing loss. Ever.

450
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,178
Oh, no, she didn't.

451
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,313
This isn't the classroom.

452
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,084
In the real world,
real doctors know

453
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:00,468
that patients can have more
than one thing wrong with them.

454
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,926
Zing. CHASE: He
was taking Vicodin.

455
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,826
Extreme abusers can
experience hearing loss.

456
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,127
Except his drug levels never
got into the ototoxic zone.

457
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,461
You have a better idea?

458
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:09,891
Ugh!

459
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,061
I do.

460
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:12,847
Only in the sense that you're

461
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,149
wasting my time with a bad idea,

462
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,937
and she's wasting
my time with no idea.

463
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,775
Maybe we should hear
from silent and silenter.

464
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,107
It's probably neurological.

465
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,179
Brain tumor?

466
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,991
Or a viral infection
that's reached his brain.

467
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:26,315
I say we go with Ernie on
this one. Get an MRI. Find it.

468
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,312
I'm gonna move out next week.

469
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,483
I'd rather stay friends
than be roommates.

470
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,328
Just make sure I
get my keys back.

471
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,057
It's not my fault.

472
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,690
I cooked it thoroughly!

473
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,164
Looking forward to Friday night?

474
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,339
Yes and no.

475
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,166
Yes, because it's a great honor.

476
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,542
And, no, because... Well,
you know the because.

477
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,134
You think House is
gonna embarrass you?

478
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,673
Well, not intentionally.

479
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,620
Maybe intentionally. I
know what you mean.

480
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,348
I picture him doing
something stupid,

481
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:08,360
like hiring a mariachi
band or something.

482
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,157
Actually, I could
get behind that.

483
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,477
I tried to hire one last year,
but the board wouldn't let me

484
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,697
because they thought
it was too expensive.

485
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,665
I'm freezing.

486
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,250
Is Diane coming back?

487
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,821
Mmm-mmm.

488
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,309
Bedside 101.

489
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,012
When a patient is near
death, try to be nice.

490
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,121
She's not coming back.
I'm not gonna lie to him.

491
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,690
Stop. What? You
heard what she said.

492
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,056
He's seizing. We got
to get him out of there.

493
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,465
Both his kidneys are fried.

494
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:28,541
He's in a coma. He has
maybe a few days left.

495
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:31,975
We could try and get him on the
transplant list, but in his condition

496
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:36,208
and without a diagnosis, I
don't see him getting selected.

497
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,583
He wouldn't survive the surgery.

498
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,778
Hence my previous comment.

499
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,045
What do you want
us to do, House?

500
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,462
If it's a tumor, we start chemo,

501
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,726
bombard his head with radiation.

502
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,166
Which will probably
kill him in this state.

503
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,727
And without an MRI, we
don't even know if he has one.

504
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,775
He's definitely dead
if we do nothing.

505
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,108
If I'm wrong, all we do
is shave a few hours off.

506
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,807
We'll need his wife's consent.

507
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:10,810
Masters will get it.

508
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,944
Probably not a good idea.

509
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,714
- Uh, he's right.
- No, he's not.

510
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:18,450
Consider this me officially
booting you out of the nest.

511
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,463
Just wanted to watch.

512
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:36,801
Do you even like me?

513
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,471
Why?

514
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,810
I put making friends and
having relationships on hold

515
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,611
so I could concentrate
on studying.

516
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,316
I always thought there'll be
plenty of time for that in the future.

517
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:53,519
But now, when I do want them...

518
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:00,131
I can't even get a date
to this charity event.

519
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,495
If I can't establish
relationships in my personal life,

520
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,663
how will I ever do
it with a patient?

521
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,813
Be honest with her.

522
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,160
But if it comes down to a choice

523
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,176
between the brutal
truth and hope,

524
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,816
side with hope.

525
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:34,930
He's in a coma.

526
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,196
We think it's a brain tumor. We need
your permission to start treatment.

527
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,551
Due to his current
condition, the risk factor...

528
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,837
You mean it could kill him?

529
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,402
It's possible,

530
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,248
but there is still hope.

531
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,786
Can he hear me?

532
00:30:57,723 --> 00:31:00,955
They say that people in
comas can still do that.

533
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,927
Sometimes, but your
husband's hearing

534
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,533
is fine.

535
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,649
I didn't mean any of
those awful things I said.

536
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,617
I'm so sorry.

537
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,896
I love you, Bert.

538
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,471
I've always loved you.

539
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:58,447
I also kept a secret from you.

540
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,647
I was going to tell
you at the restaurant,

541
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,284
but you got sick.

542
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:11,622
Then I wanted to wait
until you felt better.

543
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:23,300
I'm pregnant, sweetheart.

544
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,451
You're going to be a daddy.

545
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,034
Why rash again?

546
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,333
It went away, it needs
a reason to come back.

547
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,769
We know it's not
an allergic reaction

548
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:00,005
so we must have done
something to set it off again.

549
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,739
What? We put him on dialysis?

550
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,940
Moved him to the ICU?

551
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,006
We also did a partial MRI.

552
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,436
Two hours before the rash
came back. They're not connected.

553
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,978
What was he doing two hours
before he broke out the first time?

554
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,283
Cleaning a crime scene.

555
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,154
A crime scene and an MRI.

556
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,335
Still not seeing the connection.

557
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,419
We've been missing
connections this entire case.

558
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:20,456
Did he say anything? Did he show
any signs of stress in the MRI room?

559
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:24,162
He said he was cold, but
it's always freezing in there.

560
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,771
Cold then rash.

561
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,568
Cold urticaria causes rash,

562
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,939
but it's almost instantaneous,
not time delayed.

563
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,501
And it wouldn't explain
his other symptoms.

564
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,008
That's what we did.

565
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,781
We made him cold.

566
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,417
CAPS.

567
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,620
A genetic disorder
caused by a mutation

568
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:52,027
in the cold-induced
auto-inflammatory syndrome 1 gene.

569
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,190
Muckle-Wells syndrome?

570
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:57,236
There's only been a couple of
thousand documented cases in the US.

571
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,372
Well, now there's a
couple thousand and one.

572
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,633
Fits every symptom there.

573
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,105
We're idiots for
not seeing it before.

574
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,707
Treat with rilonacept.

575
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,715
He'll live a long
and healthy life

576
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,877
filled with lies to his
wife and future child.

577
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,635
You okay?

578
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,331
Why wouldn't I be?

579
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,135
I solved my case.

580
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,138
But your patient died.

581
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,878
I didn't say in time.

582
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:28,616
It happens, we
can't save everyone.

583
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,448
I just came to apologize.

584
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,459
You're right, I am turning
bitter and cynical inside.

585
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,996
You're finally
putting the cat down.

586
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,297
She loves mariachi, I told you.

587
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:47,465
Go home and change,
the party's in a few hours.

588
00:36:58,283 --> 00:36:59,444
You don't have to move out,

589
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,817
if you don't want to.

590
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,227
I realize you might
have had a point.

591
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,663
I've been alone a long time,

592
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,901
and I don't want to
end up like House.

593
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,167
What you said about
me and my marriage...

594
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,105
I was being an ass. True.

595
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,736
But you were right.
I needed to hear it.

596
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,911
So we're good?

597
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,834
You know, I have
a couple tickets to...

598
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,121
Don't push it.

599
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,024
Taub and Foreman done?
I'm hitching a ride with them.

600
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,364
Me, too.

601
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,235
You're not picking up your date?

602
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,103
No, going solo.

603
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,975
All those meaningless relationships
tend to wear a guy out after a while.

604
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,259
We've got 15
minutes to get there

605
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,393
if we want to see
the board freak

606
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,409
when House's mariachi
band marches in.

607
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,058
All of them are gone, Wilson.

608
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,864
They're all dead,
because I'm screwed up.

609
00:38:57,402 --> 00:39:00,736
You lost one patient,
and it wasn't your fault.

610
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:04,000
What about that mom
who gave her baby cancer?

611
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:11,014
If I'd figured that one out
quicker, she'd still be a mom, alive.

612
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,642
She refused treatment
when it was offered.

613
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,882
How is that your fault?

614
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:20,483
Then there was that guy I spent
a day trapped in isolation with.

615
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,688
I was five feet
away the whole time.

616
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:26,889
Just watched him
die, like an idiot.

617
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,463
Yeah.

618
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,059
You've lost patients before,

619
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,501
and you'll lose patients again.

620
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,306
Exactly. Why?

621
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,643
Because love and happiness are

622
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,709
nothing but distractions.

623
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,550
The only thing my
relationship with Cuddy

624
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:54,024
has done for me is
make me a worse doctor.

625
00:39:56,794 --> 00:40:00,856
Right, the great Dr. House
doesn't deserve to be happy.

626
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,331
You know it's not true.

627
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,767
My happiness is being paid
for with other people's lives.

628
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,344
How is she?

629
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,014
She's worried. She's upset
that you didn't show up tonight.

630
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,422
I got to tell her
the truth, Wilson.

631
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:37,099
First... First, you're
not driving anywhere.

632
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,397
And second,

633
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,337
you're definitely not
talking to Cuddy like this.

634
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:44,900
Okay.

635
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,842
Then I'm gonna walk.

636
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,464
We really, really need to talk.

637
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,439
You're drunk and you
screwed up big time.

638
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,941
Go home!

639
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,506
You completely
disappeared on me.

640
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,243
You wouldn't even
answer your cell phone.

641
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,616
You're gonna want
to sit down for this.

642
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,246
Go ahead. Sit,
sit, sit, sit, sit.

643
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,067
I've made a decision.

644
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,434
Being happy and
being in love with you

645
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,868
makes me a crappy doctor.

646
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,607
Shut up!

647
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,038
You're too drunk to
end this relationship.

648
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,877
I am drunk, but I'm also right.

649
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,014
You have made me a worse doctor,

650
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,115
and people are going
to die because of that.

651
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,425
And

652
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,223
you

653
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,897
are totally worth it.

654
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,745
If I had to choose between

655
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,447
saving everyone

656
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,810
or loving you, being happy,

657
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,214
I choose you.

658
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,257
I choose being happy with you.

659
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,653
I will always choose you.

660
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,827
My head's on your vagina.

661
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,537
Go to sleep, House.

662
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,169
Yeah, I am kind of tired.
