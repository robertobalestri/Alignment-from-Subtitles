1
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,550
Darrien?

2
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,436
What the hell happened?
We got to get you to a hospital.

3
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,395
No, no, you're a
doctor, just stitch me up.

4
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,872
It's more complicated
than that. We need to...

5
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,831
The cops will be waiting
for me at the hospital.

6
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,444
They're gonna bust me back
inside just for being with felons.

7
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,630
You stay here, they bust me.

8
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,265
I can't go back,
Remy. Neither can I.

9
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,331
God forbid, you die,
I'm up for manslaughter.

10
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,435
I'll find someone else.

11
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,105
You leave, you bleed out.

12
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,081
You're gonna die. Stop!

13
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:38,919
Promise me you won't
take me to the hospital.

14
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,695
I promise.

15
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,075
Look at how much
fun she's having.

16
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,591
That's because he
has two functioning legs

17
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,535
capable of supporting
her body weight.

18
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,265
So do I.

19
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,672
You told me most of
your muscle was cut out.

20
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,255
I was going for the
sympathy discount.

21
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,536
Been taking some
experimental medicine.

22
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,548
Yeah, I got a lot of clients
on experimental medicine.

23
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,276
You want proof?

24
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,450
Okay, this amp stack
weighs way more than you do.

25
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,227
See?

26
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,303
Now, even if those implants
were made of adamantium,

27
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,838
I'd still be able to...

28
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,241
Sorry. Cramp.

29
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,972
I'm sure.

30
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,920
I'm not gonna be needing
your services tonight after all.

31
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,176
Bowel's intact. Inferior
vena cava is fine.

32
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,843
Your liver got nicked,

33
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,106
but it feels clotted off.

34
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,619
I don't see any other
signs of internal bleeding.

35
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,855
So I'm okay? Define "okay".

36
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,291
Just because I don't see
bleeding doesn't mean it's not there.

37
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,430
105 over palp. I'm gonna check
your pressure every two minutes.

38
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,436
If you dip below 90, it means it
is there and we have a problem.

39
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,076
Oh, sorry.

40
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,078
I should get to work. Wait.

41
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,946
Ruby... We'll talk
more in the morning.

42
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,214
Goodnight, Eric.

43
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,117
You two breaking up?

44
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,260
She's pregnant.

45
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,104
I need a drink.

46
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,170
There was a raid.

47
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:13,179
Andre needed to do something
to slow the cops down.

48
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,647
He stabbed you as a distraction?

49
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,240
It didn't work.

50
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,280
Cops called an ambulance,
left me lying there.

51
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,584
Come on, give me crap.

52
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,204
I know what I told
you about him,

53
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:31,164
but it's not his fault I
started using again.

54
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:32,892
It's mine.

55
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,596
What? According
to this, you're dead.

56
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,901
You have no blood pressure.

57
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,506
You barely have a pulse.

58
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,669
Am I dying? You're
talking and alert,

59
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,577
so your brain is getting blood.

60
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:56,116
Pulse in your right arm
is fine, so is your BP.

61
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,964
Hello. THIRTEEN ON
PHONE: <i>Are you busy?</i>

62
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,767
Yeah, I'm about
to go out. <i>Great.</i>

63
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,772
Can you do me a huge favor?

64
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:16,986
I need you to go to the hospital

65
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,010
and check out a portable
ultrasound machine for me.

66
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,209
Who's the father? <i>I have
a leak in my bathroom,</i>

67
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,807
and my guy won't come take a
look at it till tomorrow morning,

68
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,014
and an emergency plumber
is 200 bucks an hour.

69
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,188
Dr. House.

70
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,460
Dr. Riggin.

71
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,560
Figured you'd be
wrapping up the trial by now.

72
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,638
I just wanted to give
you a hearty <i>mazel tov.</i>

73
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,204
And don't forget the Nobel Prize

74
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,798
for developing an incredibly
expensive rat poison.

75
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,672
What do you mean? What happened?

76
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,804
Tumors.

77
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,141
Just look at these things.

78
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,492
Any indication the
rats were getting sick?

79
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,653
Just some cramping.

80
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,772
Their legs would stiffen up.

81
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,140
They were having
trouble moving around.

82
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,910
We just thought their bodies were
adjusting to the increase in muscle mass,

83
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,837
but in a day or so,
they just started dying.

84
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,668
Oh, well, get a new compound
to play with next week.

85
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,512
One portable ultrasound,
extra pepperoni.

86
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,915
Thank you so much. I
might be late tomorrow.

87
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,179
Your socks are dry. And
unfortunately, so is your shirt,

88
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,100
which means you either
just changed to greet me,

89
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,644
or you need this for
something medical.

90
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,387
I am a doctor.

91
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,872
She's my friend.

92
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,370
I was in prison.

93
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,869
You killed your own brother?

94
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,245
Yes, it was awful and
devastating, but it wasn't murder.

95
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,841
He was sick and
he wanted to die,

96
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,112
and I promised I would help.

97
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,916
Now please stop pacing
and help me find this thing.

98
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,915
Have you talked to anybody
about it? I mean, are you okay?

99
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,927
No, I may have an
aortic arch aneurysm.

100
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,087
Oh, wait, that's her.

101
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,287
Either help me or leave.

102
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,230
I'm having trouble
getting a clear look.

103
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,253
Try a long axis view from
the suprasternal notch.

104
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,102
Wait! Put on some
gloves, she's got Hep-C.

105
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,006
Wonderful.

106
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,609
I take it you two
were cellmates.

107
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,238
Just friends.

108
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,470
She saved me.

109
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,140
There's a culture in prison.

110
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,928
If you don't have someone to show
you how to get the stuff you need,

111
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,444
or stay away from the stuff
you don't, you're screwed.

112
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,855
Her fingers are turning
blue. Can you move those?

113
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,589
My arm's starting to go numb.

114
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,356
Arch of the aorta's clear,
this can't be an aneurysm.

115
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,758
Maybe the wound threw a clot.

116
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,043
Check in axillary arteries.

117
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,162
Stop. Right there.

118
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,433
Five centimeter gooey mass.

119
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,872
Not a clot, maybe a lipoma?

120
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,169
What the hell is that?

121
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,802
A fat filled sack, probably
aggravated by the stab wound.

122
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,558
You got any syringes
in here? Give me that.

123
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,875
I was stabbed in my
gut, not in my arm.

124
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,508
You lost a lot of blood, gave
the lipoma room to swell.

125
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,679
It's compressing the arteries in
your arm, blocking your blood flow.

126
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,120
Maybe we can
suck some of it out.

127
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,453
You'll be fine.

128
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,187
Little pinch.

129
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,334
That's not a lipoma.

130
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,638
I don't know why she's even
considering having my kid.

131
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,174
She barely knows me.

132
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,275
All she knows is I'm
a short, balding guy.

133
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,047
That doesn't even
make evolutionary sense.

134
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,246
You want her to keep it? No.

135
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,551
'Cause you'd make a crappy dad.

136
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,092
I said, "No."
You're too selfish,

137
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,538
that's why you cheated on your
wife, why your marriage fell apart...

138
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,588
Dude, I said... I know you.

139
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,998
The only reason you're sitting in
a strip club, ignoring the strip club,

140
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,748
is because you actually
are considering it.

141
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:47,937
Although, without
crappy dads in the world...

142
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,294
Try moving your fingers again.

143
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,055
Good, means it's almost drained.

144
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,393
Not good enough.

145
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,645
We don't know if it's
gonna come back,

146
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,898
we don't even know what it is.

147
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,905
Drugs, viruses, toxins
from that crack house,

148
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,372
and God knows
where else she's been.

149
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,751
If this were caused
by the drugs,

150
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,142
she'd have kidney failure,
cardiac involvement.

151
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,643
What about her Hep-C?

152
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,943
Could have fried her liver,
loses its synthetic function.

153
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,322
Then her entire body would
be swelling, not just her arm.

154
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,317
Leaves us with toxins.

155
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,231
Where exactly were you
when you were attacked?

156
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,655
You're not doing a home search
in a crack den. That's insane.

157
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,002
Apparently we don't
have much of a choice.

158
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,255
It's a crime scene.

159
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,920
And it's not toxins or viruses,

160
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,555
or anything else you mentioned
because it's not a coincidence.

161
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,623
Her symptoms have to
be related to the stabbing.

162
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,082
What if her body used
up all the clotting factors

163
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,233
dealing with the stab wound?

164
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,334
Explains the bloody mass.

165
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,788
But if you're right, she could
start bleeding anywhere.

166
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,123
Like, in her brain
or in her heart.

167
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,616
Wait, one of those things
could start growing in my brain?

168
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,556
It's time to get
you to the hospital.

169
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,920
No. Remy, you promised.

170
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,803
All we'll do at the hospital
is stick her in a patient bed

171
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,004
and give her IV clotting factor.

172
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,068
We can do that right here.

173
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,825
We could also
embalm her right here.

174
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,051
I'll call the drugs and
you go pick them up.

175
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,658
If I'm right, she'll be fine.

176
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,702
Look, I know you don't know her

177
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,831
and you don't care
about her, but I do.

178
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,007
Please.

179
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,985
Lie down, elevate your shoulder.

180
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,189
You said Andre wasn't
responsible for the drugs. What is?

181
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,832
I don't know.

182
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,836
Yes, you do. What
happened to you?

183
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,716
If you don't deal with
the real problem...

184
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,141
I came here because
you were a doctor,

185
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,643
not a shrink.

186
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,586
Your lap is
vibrating. Oh, sorry.

187
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,960
Ah, it's my boss.

188
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,658
Probably drunk, wants a
ride home. Let him take a cab.

189
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,961
Do you have any kids?

190
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,096
Why? You like moms?
I could be your mommy.

191
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,701
Spank your little ass.

192
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,337
Uh, no, I...

193
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,491
What would you do
if you got pregnant?

194
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,543
Not by me, at all, but by
some hypothetical guy,

195
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,281
who didn't wanna keep
the hypothetical kid,

196
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,366
what would be the least awful
way for him to tell you that?

197
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,484
Don't talk. Just let
mama dance for you.

198
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,057
Should I send flowers?

199
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,793
Maybe write the clinic
appointment on the little card?

200
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,304
"Surprise."

201
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,637
I hate myself!

202
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:58,075
There's just no good way to...

203
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,845
How long have you had
this mole? It's asymmetrical.

204
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,543
No touching.

205
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,416
Sorry.

206
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,150
Have you been to
see a dermatologist?

207
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,552
Bobby.

208
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,026
Oh. I wasn't touching
her. I was just...

209
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,391
Oh, God.

210
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,008
No.

211
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,620
No, please don't. Please...
Please put the gun down.

212
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:52,759
Put it down on the
ground and get away.

213
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,565
D? I'm sorry.

214
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,066
I'm sorry.

215
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,306
I'm sorry.

216
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,614
D, what is it?

217
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,212
I'm so sorry.

218
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,586
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,882
Why aren't you in your bed?

220
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,458
<i>I'll give ye splinters in yer
arse, ye mangy bilge rat.</i>

221
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,024
What are you watching?

222
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,632
TV, you bloody scallywag.

223
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,294
Mom...

224
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,998
Someone better be dying.

225
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,948
She hallucinated. I
need you to go back out.

226
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,394
I just called in
more clotting factor.

227
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,182
So, she's bleeding
in her brain now?

228
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,085
We double up the
dose, she'll be fine. No.

229
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,525
We bring her to the hospital, we
do a CT scan to locate the bleed,

230
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,992
drill a burr hole in her skull,

231
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,528
and maybe she'll be fine.

232
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,253
We can drill a burr hole here.

233
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,659
You're not just risking
our careers here.

234
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,664
You could go back to prison.

235
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,966
I made a promise.

236
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,062
You made a promise?

237
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,665
I will not take her
to the hospital.

238
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:43,869
Great.

239
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,310
Then I will.

240
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,436
No.

241
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,805
I'm gonna move you, then
I'm gonna pick your friend up,

242
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,975
carry her down to my
car, take her to the hospital,

243
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,609
and try to save her life.

244
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,517
She's staying here.

245
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,647
Move.

246
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,482
Move!

247
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,344
She's going to the hospital.

248
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,624
Sweetie, go wait for Mommy
by the couch, okay? Go on.

249
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,803
I tried calling everyone else.

250
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,190
You were the
last one on the list.

251
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,873
Any reason why
911 wasn't on the list?

252
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,307
It's not an emergency.

253
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:52,436
Right.

254
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,372
Are you suicidal?

255
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,478
I'm not attempting
bypass surgery.

256
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,612
The tumors are small and
they're close to the surface.

257
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,884
I thought it'd be
like removing a wart.

258
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,065
You couldn't wait till morning,

259
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,661
bring your CT scans
to an actual surgeon?

260
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,697
Surgeons are idiots.

261
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,129
They just hack away at the
muscle till they get worn out.

262
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,201
Or you're just ashamed
you've been injecting a drug

263
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,704
that hasn't even gone
through safety trials.

264
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,116
It's never even been
in the human body.

265
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,632
I got one of the tumors.
The second one is close.

266
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,338
You can use the CT to
help you find the third.

267
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,989
I'm taking you to the hospital.

268
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,142
Just excise the
tumor. Absolutely not!

269
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,758
Elevate her head more.

270
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,833
Don't bother.

271
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,493
The cops are gonna be
waiting at the front door.

272
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,571
I'll go in first.

273
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,507
I'll find a patient on life
support who's just waiting to die.

274
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,056
We'll use that name
on all your tests.

275
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,843
No one will ever
know you're there.

276
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,576
Thanks.

277
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,283
What happened to your leg?

278
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:17,935
I was trying to make it better.

279
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,960
He was being reckless.

280
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,465
Sit back, honey.

281
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,112
This isn't about
making your leg better.

282
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,604
It's about making
your life better.

283
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,899
Oh, here we go.

284
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,208
Wish I had called 911.

285
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:32,143
Why else would you risk your
life doing something so stupid?

286
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,476
Well, you know, I've had
a lot of setbacks lately.

287
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,440
Don't blame our
break-up for this.

288
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,217
You're not unhappy because
of me. You're just unhappy.

289
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,314
Unhappy people
do reckless things.

290
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,020
Darrien!

291
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,654
Stop screaming, my head hurts.

292
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,255
I need you to stay
awake, talk to me.

293
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,925
About what?

294
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,460
When you were screaming in my
room, what did you think you saw?

295
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,441
You said, "Put it down on
the ground and get away."

296
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,672
Sounds like a cop.

297
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:07,908
Old habits, I guess.

298
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,580
You were a cop?

299
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,747
Back when I was a decent person.

300
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,843
How do I not know this?
You knew everything...

301
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,685
Not a good resume when
you're trying to survive in prison.

302
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,660
So who were you
talking to in my bedroom?

303
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,260
Why did you keep apologizing?

304
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,865
Because I'm sorry.

305
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,127
For what?

306
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,535
I killed a kid.

307
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,706
He was 19.

308
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,373
I went in first,

309
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,174
saw him going for his gun.

310
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,619
I tried to talk him down, but...

311
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,220
They told me I was a hero.

312
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,527
So that's when you
started using drugs.

313
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,470
I'm sorry.

314
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,065
Darrien.

315
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:14,140
Darrien!

316
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,675
She lost consciousness.

317
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,685
There are no cars
coming, just go.

318
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,821
The light is red, you
bloody scallywag.

319
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,725
Stop with the pirate talk.

320
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,927
If you don't want Brownbeard
to end up with two wooden legs,

321
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:42,031
you should get your ma to
move this ship, ye mangy bilge rat.

322
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,538
Of course.

323
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,545
You showed her
that filthy cartoon.

324
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,382
What kind of idiot lets a
three-year-old watch that?

325
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,251
If you wanna lecture
me on my poor judgment,

326
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:56,117
there would seem to be
more relevant examples.

327
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,953
There you are.

328
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,587
You were in the VIP room so long

329
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,816
I thought you were gonna
pay off that girl's mortgage.

330
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,697
I got tossed out by
Bobby the Bouncer.

331
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,436
You touched her?

332
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,103
I was looking at her mole.

333
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,438
Genius! Let's go home.

334
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,539
I wanna wait for the girl,
make sure that mole's okay.

335
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,560
Bobby the Bouncer sees you
standing out here like a stalker,

336
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,109
he's gonna break
open your skull.

337
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,619
It was asymmetrical,
it could be cancerous.

338
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,589
You want to get your
skull cracked open.

339
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:34,736
You're trying to
punish yourself.

340
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,888
I want to fulfill my
oath as a doctor.

341
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,282
You think you're a screw-up
because you got a girl pregnant

342
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,232
and you deserve
to suffer. You don't.

343
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,498
You just need some sleep
and you'll handle this mess.

344
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,730
Let's get in the car.

345
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,901
She's probably off work soon.

346
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,842
Give me the keys, I'll drive.

347
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,514
I'll get a cab.

348
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,153
Good luck with everything.

349
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,067
You were defending your
friend beyond all rationality,

350
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,424
granting her the right
to die in your bedroom.

351
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,486
Was it really all
because of a promise?

352
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,031
That word means
something to some people.

353
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,156
Not that much.

354
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,432
I don't see the bleed, I'm
moving down to the brain stem.

355
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,440
You promised your
brother you'd euthanize him,

356
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,137
and you think you
won't feel bad about it

357
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,821
as long as you can
blame it on the promise.

358
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:31,180
That's why you have this twisted
obligation to keep all promises.

359
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,151
Or your carefully constructed defense
mechanism could crumble down.

360
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,455
I saved my brother
from a lot of pain.

361
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,658
Reconstructed image is clear.

362
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,665
There's no bleed
in Darrien's brain.

363
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,225
Image just blurred.
Did she wake up?

364
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,629
She's shivering.

365
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:54,639
She must have a fever.

366
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,467
Infection? It couldn't
be from the stabbing.

367
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:58,586
It has to be from the stabbing.

368
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,704
Wait, no, it couldn't
be acting that quickly.

369
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,092
Well then, what's
wrong with her?

370
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,729
Your heart rate's over
120. You're clammy.

371
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,390
I think you're going into shock.

372
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,528
Are you lightheaded?

373
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:23,694
I'm fine.

374
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,890
Did you see the new
<i>Brownbeard</i> episode?

375
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,504
It was so funny.

376
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,002
No, it was so lame.

377
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:34,836
A boat full of guy pirates and they
make the girl pirate walk the plank.

378
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,040
She floated.

379
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,980
That's 'cause she
had big boobies.

380
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,160
That's why he
should've kept her.

381
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,184
We gotta get you into
surgery. Where is that nurse?

382
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,087
Rachel, let's go find the nurse.

383
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,968
2:00 a.m. Nice of
you to call me back.

384
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,886
Chase and I are in the
hospital with a patient.

385
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,538
You've completely
run out of ideas

386
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,137
and you're calling
me to bail you out.

387
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,443
I'm touched. Hit me.

388
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,492
<i>Command, please.</i>

389
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,721
Call Ruby.

390
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:26,925
<i>Would you like to
call Ruby on mobile?</i>

391
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,963
No.

392
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,932
She on any medication
besides crack?

393
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,808
She was taking
interferon in prison,

394
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,176
so I'm guessing she's had
Hep-C for at least 10 years.

395
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,646
Can I guess stuff, too?

396
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,593
'Cause that's gonna make
the diagnosis really easy.

397
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,629
Prison infirmary isn't known
for stellar record keeping.

398
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,485
And we can't exactly
ask the patient.

399
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,284
<i>Yeah, that would've
been pre-coma.</i>

400
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,083
But how could you have known
that it would affect her that way?

401
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,424
We didn't think we had
anything mysterious until...

402
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,589
What about renal
cancer throwing clots?

403
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,496
Urinalysis was
negative. <i>That's too bad.</i>

404
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,492
'Cause that was my
one big idea. Really?

405
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,933
<i>House?</i>

406
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,337
<i>House, you there?</i>

407
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,006
Tell me more about the patient.

408
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,676
What was she
doing before prison?

409
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,277
She was a cop, shot
a kid in self-defense,

410
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,846
never got over the guilt, started
taking drugs and got busted.

411
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,557
Way to bury the lead.

412
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,192
<i>How long ago was this shooting?</i>

413
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,352
I'm not sure. Why?

414
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:32,625
<i>Again, you assumed she's
had Hep-C for 10 years.</i>

415
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,142
But if you find out
when she shot the kid,

416
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,843
you'll find out when
she started taking drugs,

417
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,961
and when she actually
contracted the Hep-C.

418
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,334
And you think this is relevant?

419
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,669
It's more relevant than what
you got now, which is squat.

420
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,803
Three chicks just
came into my bedroom.

421
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,342
I gotta go.

422
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,463
<i>Command, please.</i>

423
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:56,546
Call Rachel.

424
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,682
<i>Would you like to
call Rachel on mobile?</i>

425
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,853
No.

426
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:09,927
What the hell?

427
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,995
I really am a doctor.

428
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,015
I just wanted... Cop another
feel? Get away from me.

429
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,338
No, that mole. I just wanted...

430
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,874
Please don't call Bobby.

431
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,613
Just calm down. Shut up!

432
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,035
Sick perv. Get
down on your knees.

433
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,324
You think I'm kidding? Turn
around and get down on your knees.

434
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,391
Please don't.

435
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,926
I said shut up!

436
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,724
You think you're the first guy
who thought he was special?

437
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,765
You think you can do
whatever you want?

438
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,098
I am not going
through that again!

439
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,444
Find anything?

440
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:06,149
Shockingly, a punk kid getting
shot pulling a gun on a cop

441
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,419
did not make national news.

442
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:11,688
Is your neck okay?

443
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,763
Yeah, it's fine.

444
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,529
I'll get you some ice.

445
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,331
I said it was fine.

446
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,698
I shouldn't have
grabbed you so hard.

447
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,772
You had to.

448
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,155
You were right about everything.

449
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,804
I got something.

450
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,704
Darrien must've had a
different last name then.

451
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,836
She must have been married.

452
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,312
2008? Is that possible?

453
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,143
We never actually talked
about how long she'd been in.

454
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,813
House was right. She could've
only had Hep-C for a few years.

455
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,254
There's no way the prison
would've prescribed interferon,

456
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,757
unless the lab showed
her Hep-C to be chronic.

457
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,555
So, what makes new
Hep-C look like old Hep-C?

458
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,725
What if she got a parasite?

459
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,522
The Hep-C made her susceptible,

460
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,330
and the parasite sped
up the liver damage.

461
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,096
Entamoeba.

462
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,332
Throw in a parasitoma, the stab
wound could have freed them,

463
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,070
sent them coursing through
her bloodstream, wreaking havoc.

464
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,339
A single bag of metronidazole.

465
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,610
If we're right, she could wake
up from the coma in a few hours.

466
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,086
They're ready for you.

467
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,865
Wait.

468
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:08,375
I want you in there.

469
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,642
I'm not a surgeon.

470
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,607
There's nothing I can do.

471
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,653
Well, you can make
sure that idiot butcher

472
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,416
doesn't cut more
than he needs to.

473
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,656
You already signed a release.

474
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:24,448
He's gonna do
what he needs to do.

475
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:25,555
Yeah,

476
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,429
and if that involves
chopping off my leg,

477
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:34,237
I want to be sure that
that's damn well necessary.

478
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,134
House...

479
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,879
I don't trust him.

480
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,210
I trust you.

481
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:21,978
Can you hear me?

482
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:24,481
Yeah.

483
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,023
You had parasites in your liver.

484
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,255
Probably from a dirty needle,
or prison, or who knows what.

485
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:37,665
The stabbing made it worse,
but you're gonna be okay.

486
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:52,043
I'm sorry. We had to.

487
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,719
I told you I couldn't go back.

488
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,428
I shouldn't have trusted you.

489
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,534
I never liked you.

490
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:14,530
I killed time with you 'cause
I was locked in a cage.

491
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:17,242
You were a distraction.

492
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:21,103
Someone to talk to so I
didn't have to think about

493
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,107
everything else.

494
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,445
You're lashing out, I get it.

495
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,211
But in a month, you'll thank me.

496
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,722
Or maybe you
won't, I don't know,

497
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:39,128
but I know I saved your life.

498
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:03,119
Is he going to be okay?

499
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,591
He'll be fine.

500
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,622
Close your eyes.

501
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:15,033
I wish House still
came over to play.

502
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:18,528
Well,

503
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,037
maybe you should
write him a letter.

504
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,643
Wanna do that?
Okay, let's do it.

505
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:37,955
Ruby?

506
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,021
You look like hell
and you smell like...

507
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,169
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

508
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,217
Is that glitter on you?

509
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,523
Just hear me out.

510
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,195
Back when I still
had my practice,

511
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,132
this patient came in, 50-year-old
guy wanting a tummy tuck,

512
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,378
but when we do some prelim work,

513
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,402
we discover that his
stomach is filled with cancer.

514
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,305
So instead of telling him that
he's gonna look great at the beach,

515
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,654
I gotta tell him
that he's dying.

516
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,743
Were you at a
strip club? Please.

517
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,207
The weird part was
I was more upset

518
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,646
about the whole
thing than he was.

519
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,685
He actually had to calm me down.

520
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:11,086
He said he had great
kids, raised them right,

521
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:15,524
knew that, because of them, he
was leaving the world a better place.

522
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:20,165
I thought I might
die last night...

523
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:21,958
At a strip club?

524
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,831
Yes, I was at a strip club.

525
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,038
And while it was happening,

526
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:30,342
I kept thinking
about that patient,

527
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,671
and how I wish I was like him.

528
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,185
I wanna have this baby.

529
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,264
Darrien had to shoot that kid.

530
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,465
It was the right thing,
completely justified.

531
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:03,636
But it didn't matter.

532
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,102
She destroyed her
life trying to forget.

533
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,908
I'm afraid that's what's
gonna happen to me.

534
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,984
You really should
talk to someone.

535
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,082
I've talked to a
therapist. It didn't help.

536
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:26,096
Maybe you should talk to
someone who isn't a therapist.

537
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,095
Do you really think
you have any idea

538
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:34,162
what it's like to live
with something like this?

539
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:40,168
Let's grab a coffee.

540
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,458
Late night? No.

541
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,797
Just haven't had my coffee yet.

542
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:42,971
Sympathetic yawn.

543
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:50,174
Ooh, Amish kid collapsed
while picking up a hooker.

544
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,477
Top that.

545
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:56,184
I missed a call from
House last night. He in?

546
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15,697
You're lucky.

547
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,740
What are you doing here?

548
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,043
You hoping for someone else?

549
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,115
Hot nurse, candy striper,

550
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,579
someone who
doesn't speak English,

551
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:34,888
someone who doesn't
speak judgmental.

552
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,427
You've got mail.

553
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,061
"I hope your leg feels better,

554
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,468
"and I hope we can be friends
again soon, you bloody scallywag."

555
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,477
I have to pee.

556
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,076
That's a good sign.

557
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,408
I'm a big boy.

558
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,384
Course you are.

559
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:24,669
You're an ass.

560
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:30,807
What? For trying to walk
on a freshly mangled leg?

561
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,643
Or for performing
surgery on myself?

562
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,515
For thinking I can solve my
emotional problems with rat medicine?

563
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:40,916
If you're gonna nag, at least
have the decency to be specific.

564
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,654
Come on.

565
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,194
Listen to me.

566
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:51,433
You can't keep going like
this. Something has to change.

567
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,602
Can I pee first?

568
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:01,845
I know.
