1
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,282
<i>One. Don't tense
up now, go with him.</i>

2
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,457
<i>Two. That's it, stay in rhythm.</i>

3
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,525
<i>Three. What are you doing,
Lane? You're tipping in.</i>

4
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,338
<i>Four. What's your problem? Get
your ass down. Get back in the middle.</i>

5
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,971
<i>Five. You're weak, you've got
all kinds of daylight under you.</i>

6
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,513
<i>Six. Damn, Lane, you
should be schooling this bull.</i>

7
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:05,156
<i>Seven. Get up, set your hips
before the kick comes down.</i>

8
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,155
<i>Nice recovery.</i>

9
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,756
<i>Now, just wait till he turns
back away from your hand.</i>

10
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,448
Whoo!

11
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,062
Lane! Lane!

12
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,500
What the hell just happened?

13
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,044
I was about to ask
you the same thing.

14
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,082
I'm fine.

15
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,645
Okay.

16
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,658
I assume Cuddy told
you that she dumped me?

17
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:19,849
She did.

18
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,292
And that I'm back on Vicodin.

19
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,496
She told me you
had taken a Vicodin.

20
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,657
And then I took a lot more.

21
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,259
And so on.

22
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,229
But you're fine.

23
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,533
Well, I'm not fine as in fine,

24
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,131
but I'm fine as in you don't
have to worry about me.

25
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,652
Because you cleared
out your bank account,

26
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,305
checked into a hotel and
started back on Vicodin.

27
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,043
Because I'm going to be
fine, as in fine, very soon.

28
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,552
Until that happens,
are you sure Vicodin is...

29
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,677
My leg hurts.

30
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,056
You've been able
to handle the pain.

31
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,181
It's gotten worse.

32
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,451
Not physically worse.

33
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,859
Worse is worse. Pain
doesn't discriminate.

34
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,953
Neither do the pills.

35
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,625
The Vicodin and the
five-star pampering

36
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,344
that I'm going to get
over the next few days

37
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,893
should be enough
to get me through it.

38
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,683
So, you don't want
to just avoid the issue.

39
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,468
You want to avoid
avoiding the issue.

40
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,633
Sorry.

41
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,336
Nothing is either as bad or as
good as we think it is at the time.

42
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,539
It's why T.O. mocks his
opponents immediately after scoring.

43
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,207
He doesn't wait till
his friend shows up

44
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,882
the next day to tell
him to deal with it.

45
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,714
Two weeks from now,

46
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,219
maybe a little more,
maybe a little less,

47
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,190
my life will be back to its
usual level of crappiness.

48
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,458
Till then, the only real issue

49
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,257
is how much I'm going
to spend on hotel charges.

50
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,364
Good morning, sir. I've got
your deluxe breakfast for two.

51
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,197
Do I have to count
the strawberries?

52
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,863
Don't worry, you can
trust me with anything.

53
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,406
Including your food.

54
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,738
After he and I have sex,

55
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,940
I'm going to slit his throat and
then disembowel him in the bathtub.

56
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,173
No problem, I'll cancel
the morning maid service.

57
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,825
Would you like me to
have them clean up later

58
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,442
when they come to
turn down your bed?

59
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,179
Why didn't I meet
you six months ago?

60
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,597
Thank you very much.

61
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,061
And if there's
anything else I can do

62
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,500
to make your stay
here more enjoyable,

63
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,892
just ring the concierge
and ask for Carnell.

64
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,395
Eat fast.

65
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,092
We're expecting company.

66
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,695
Okay, this might not
be such a bad idea.

67
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,277
What do you think he
meant by "anything"?

68
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,447
Take some time
for yourself, relax.

69
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,109
I know it's a figure of speech,

70
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,052
but he really did seem to
underline the "anything".

71
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,386
Maybe, talk to someone?

72
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,948
Already scheduled.

73
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,450
Really?

74
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,427
I'm not an idiot. I
know I need help.

75
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,893
Okay, that's great.

76
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,432
I meant like a counselor.

77
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:48,965
I know.

78
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,339
But you meant a hooker.

79
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,468
Yeah.

80
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,746
Baby steps.

81
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,578
<i>House screwed us.</i>

82
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,988
Ten years of doctors
cobbling him back together.

83
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,682
Metal rods in every limb,

84
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,588
pin stabilizing his
spine, five screws,

85
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,755
and a titanium
plate in his skull.

86
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,197
Can't do MRIs, X-rays are
probably going to be useless as well.

87
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300
Every piece of metal is
going to obscure something.

88
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,769
And House isn't sick.

89
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,929
Why would you say that?

90
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,441
Cuddy dumped House. He's out
somewhere expecting us to indulge him

91
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,602
while he ignores his
job and licks his wounds.

92
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,769
Cuddy dumped him?

93
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,176
Don't do that,
don't get sucked in.

94
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,373
He loves her!

95
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,326
What, you can't feel bad
for him for five minutes?

96
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,374
I can feel bad for him

97
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,352
while still expecting him to act
like an adult, show up for work

98
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,720
and not go on a booze,
Vicodin, and hooker-filled bender.

99
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,202
Which is why for now, we're going
to handle the case without him.

100
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,660
Oh! Is that the reason?

101
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,340
I thought it was because you can't
pass up any chance to seize control.

102
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,992
I said "we", you want
pretty please, too?

103
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,730
Wait, I understand the booze
and the hookers, but why Vicodin?

104
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,564
Wow, you really don't have
any friends in here, do you?

105
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,900
House is a Vicodin addict.

106
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,577
He's been clean for two years.

107
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,544
He's used here at work?

108
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,546
Yes, that is very troubling.

109
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,226
Almost as much as
the fact that our patient

110
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,719
has a ruptured diaphragm,
cracked sternum, broken nose,

111
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,879
and partial hearing loss,

112
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,832
which can be explained
by a bull jumping on him.

113
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,325
And a neurological
disorder, low-grade fever,

114
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,384
nausea, and peripheral
muscle weakness that can't.

115
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,725
What if the hearing loss
wasn't caused by the bull?

116
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,070
That's just when he noticed it.

117
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,790
Inner ear pathology
can affect the equilibrium

118
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,028
and cause disorientation.

119
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,468
Making it appear to be
a neurological disorder.

120
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,971
So how do we confirm?

121
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,974
CT is just going to show
us the plate and screws

122
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,134
holding his skull together.

123
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,178
We can do calorics and an ENG.

124
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,746
If he has inner ear damage,
it'll affect his balance.

125
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,672
Sounds good, go ahead.

126
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,742
Go ahead? Really?

127
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,676
What if one of us disagrees?

128
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:47,326
I happen to agree
with Foreman. Go do it.

129
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,755
You knew he was an addict
before you got involved.

130
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,195
Didn't end the relationship...

131
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,376
You knew he was an ass before...

132
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,424
I didn't end it...

133
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,163
You told him you did
not want him to change.

134
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,729
And I was wrong.
You don't know that!

135
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,567
You thought you
were going to die.

136
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,203
Do you really think that was the
right time to make this kind of decision?

137
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,603
No.

138
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,940
But I thought about it.

139
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,606
A lot.

140
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,750
I haven't changed my mind.

141
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,384
He thought you
were going to die.

142
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,192
Nobody knows the right
way to react in that situation.

143
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,459
Just give him another chance.

144
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,290
He deserves it.

145
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,960
I know.

146
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,797
But this isn't about
what he deserves.

147
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:40,372
When things go wrong, I don't
want to hope that I'm not alone,

148
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,109
I want to know it.

149
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,977
With House,

150
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,452
every time I needed
him to step up...

151
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,292
It's just never
going to be that!

152
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:56,092
It's not his fault, it's who
he is. I should've known it.

153
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,225
This is my fault.

154
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,941
Well, he's back on Vicodin.

155
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:09,802
So you might want

156
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,640
to keep an eye
on his new patient.

157
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,084
ENG was normal,
means his inner ear is...

158
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,178
<i>Morons.</i>

159
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,950
It wasn't... <i>Whoa, wait a sec.</i>

160
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,015
<i>The acoustics in
here are beautiful.</i>

161
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,254
<i>Morons!</i>

162
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,862
You say it.

163
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,330
Morons.

164
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,858
Who was that?

165
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,265
<i>Something Carnell got me.</i>

166
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,997
It wasn't that
ridiculous of a theory.

167
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,127
<i>Great theory.</i>

168
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,762
It's a ridiculous test.

169
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,674
You can't give a standard
balance test to a champion bull rider.

170
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:47,008
<i>If you're going to test Superman's
strength, you need a bigger barbell.</i>

171
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,843
<i>Find one, make him
lift it, then call me,</i>

172
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,213
and tell me how high it got.

173
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,887
And tell Cuddy that
spying is for cowards.

174
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,320
Just keep me posted.

175
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,952
I will. I will.

176
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,332
You said my inner ear was fine.

177
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,231
Previous test was
for regular people.

178
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,045
You were banged up
pretty bad in the accident,

179
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,503
but given your
athletic ability...

180
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,405
Wasn't no accident. That bull
had malice and forethought.

181
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:15,932
Ah...

182
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,307
You mean afterthought.

183
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,375
Whatever, he was pissed.

184
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,503
Can you blame him?

185
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,809
Not at all.

186
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,321
If he don't do what
he gets paid for,

187
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,793
I don't get to do
what I get paid for.

188
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,877
Ever think of getting paid
for doing something else?

189
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,397
You're running out
of bones to break.

190
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,890
You ever think of doing
something you don't love?

191
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,824
It has its downside,
but everything does.

192
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,561
There ain't nothing
like those eight seconds.

193
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,141
And traveling around
getting to meet the fans,

194
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,760
that ain't so bad either,
if you know what I mean.

195
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,097
All right, now what?

196
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,648
We're going to start
rocking the platform

197
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,641
and changing your visual field

198
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,505
while you balance
on just your right leg.

199
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,036
Here you go, Lane.

200
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,338
I'm going to start slow.

201
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,182
If you start to experience
any nausea, disorientation,

202
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,850
just let us know and
we'll stop the test.

203
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,011
You got it.

204
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,184
Whoa.

205
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,291
That is amazing.

206
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:22,599
We can stop. There's obviously
nothing wrong with his inner ear.

207
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,370
Now what?

208
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,908
And I direct that
question not to my boss,

209
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,645
but to anyone who has an answer.

210
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,947
If it's not in his ear,
it's got to be his brain.

211
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,365
But if we can't get any
images, then how do we...

212
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,984
You guys got some rusty pipes.

213
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,091
This water's brown.

214
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,254
That's not from the pipes.

215
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,498
It's from your mouth.

216
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,107
Can you pass me the...

217
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,749
What took you so long?

218
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,268
<i>There's nothing
wrong with his ears,</i>

219
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,624
<i>but he's got blood
in his sputum.</i>

220
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,320
Doesn't answer the question.

221
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:16,452
<i>We weren't avoiding you.</i>

222
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,574
It took us a little time to
think up a diagnostic test

223
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,226
no one's ever thought up before.

224
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,359
<i>Apology accepted.</i>

225
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,129
It could be a tumor
in a salivary gland.

226
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,795
We should get a parotid biopsy.

227
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,601
Aww! That's so cute.

228
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,665
You're fighting over
who's in charge.

229
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,472
GI bleed's more likely to
explain the nausea and weakness.

230
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,668
Who's in charge?

231
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,922
House, as long
as you're not here,

232
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,090
someone has to have the final...

233
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,138
<i>Let me rephrase.</i>

234
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,285
- Who's your daddy?
<i>- Let me rephrase.</i>

235
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,596
<i>You have to decide if you're
going to buck up, get out of bed</i>

236
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,055
and do your job, or if you're
going to wallow in self-pity.

237
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,518
Those my only two choices?

238
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,628
Or can I also point out the
self-pity coming from you?

239
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,140
<i>You're just annoyed because
when your relationship ended,</i>

240
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,099
<i>no one gave a
crap, including you.</i>

241
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,168
That is not true
in so many ways.

242
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,567
<i>And Chase? Stop
screwing with Foreman.</i>

243
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,969
<i>And Foreman? No.</i>

244
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,904
<i>Until the telephone
gets un-invented,</i>

245
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,951
<i>no one in that room needs
more authority than I give them.</i>

246
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,910
And right now, I
give you the authority

247
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,378
to scope his GI tract
and biopsy his parotid,

248
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,549
<i>then you can pick
up the phone...</i>

249
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,380
House, should we be
more worried about you?

250
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:13,976
Are you on Vicodin?

251
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,818
Because if you are, you probably
shouldn't be ordering procedures.

252
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,727
I am not on Vicodin.

253
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,754
<i>Do the tests.</i>

254
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,461
I have to see a man
about a hurdy gurdy.

255
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,899
You really think House
isn't using Vicodin?

256
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,738
Does it actually worry you?

257
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,710
If he's self-prescribing meds,

258
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,076
that could affect his judgment.

259
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,578
And does that worry you?

260
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,277
Are you being sarcastic?

261
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,912
If his rule-breaking is
affecting his judgment,

262
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,647
then you can step
in, then you can worry.

263
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,916
But if he's just
coming up with ideas

264
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,117
that we haven't thought
of but we should have,

265
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,592
then our job is to
shut up and do it.

266
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,925
And what do you see in this guy?

267
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,926
Hmm? What? Who?

268
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,099
Oh. You think I'm
attracted to our patient.

269
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,607
Right. It's against the
rules. So, you wouldn't do it.

270
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,637
He's a macho half-wit.

271
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,589
You have every reason
to not be attracted to him,

272
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,206
which is why I ask the question,

273
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,306
why are you attracted to him?

274
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,542
Stop it. I'm just...

275
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,611
No, no, no, take out the
scope. I don't see any...

276
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,133
No, not the monitor,
look at his eyes.

277
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,204
<i>Sclerae turned
yellow. Did x-rays,</i>

278
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,606
<i>looks like there's
a mass in his liver,</i>

279
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,156
<i>but the conductive metal
rod in his ribs is blocking it.</i>

280
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,394
Making it, as they say,

281
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,870
as tough to find as a hooker
who can play the hurdy gurdy.

282
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,349
If you have a point,
can you please...

283
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,397
<i>It's an expression.</i>

284
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,032
Means it's tough,

285
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,974
but apparently it can be done.

286
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,321
<i>We don't have any equipment.</i>

287
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,369
You have eyes.

288
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,073
Not that see through stuff.

289
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,206
<i>Obviously.</i>

290
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,317
You want us to cut him open?

291
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,886
Only if you want to see
what's wrong with him.

292
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,622
Do you know <i>Free Bird?</i>

293
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,445
Do you see what I see?

294
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,528
No.

295
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,561
Exactly.

296
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,441
More suction.

297
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,267
That's impossible.

298
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,274
I definitely saw a
mass in the x-rays.

299
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,906
It's gone now.

300
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,121
It's a mass,

301
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,587
and then it's not.

302
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,321
You, uh, going to introduce us?

303
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,394
Team, meet Duke.

304
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:40,990
Anke.

305
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,060
Anke?

306
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,426
How'd I get Duke?

307
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,163
House, how many
prostitutes have you had?

308
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,571
As in, eaten?

309
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,737
Ever? This year?

310
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,339
Slept with since
you've been here.

311
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:54,846
All but one.

312
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:55,971
She did my taxes.

313
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,517
On the other hand,

314
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,429
tape worm that burrowed
outside his intestinal...

315
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:04,322
We would've seen eggs on a
faecal smear or systemic eosinophilia.

316
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,383
Detached cysts?

317
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,257
Couldn't migrate
that far in one hour.

318
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,727
We haven't been
sitting on our hands

319
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,730
just waiting for your
brilliance to kick in.

320
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,232
Okay, so how did you shoot down

321
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,667
intermittently
swollen lymph node?

322
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,684
That would mean it's
some kind of infection,

323
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,609
which would mean we'd
have to do a spinal tap.

324
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,875
But with his recent skull
fractures, it could be increased ICP.

325
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,448
His brain could herniate.

326
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,140
What about a
ventricular puncture?

327
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,311
Sounds good.

328
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,550
You think sticking a
needle directly into his brain

329
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,921
would be less dangerous
than sticking it in his spine?

330
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,354
It's probably a push.

331
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,837
I'm just trying to
get you out of here

332
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,729
because underneath this
sheet, stuff is going on.

333
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,539
Just pick a spot and
stick a needle in it.

334
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,836
You want to drill
through my skull

335
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,398
because of a mass
that's not there?

336
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,738
It was there, which
means something is wrong.

337
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,210
We need to find it.

338
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,373
Is there anybody
you'd like us to call?

339
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,818
Someone that you'd like to be here
with you, maybe a wife or girlfriend?

340
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,820
No, my family's all
back in Oklahoma.

341
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,389
And the guys in the circuit
are in Calgary at the next rodeo.

342
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,220
Ah! That's too bad.

343
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,291
It's nice to have somebody
nearby you can talk to who cares.

344
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,561
You okay? Hmm?

345
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,769
I'm just saying,
it's good to have

346
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,934
somebody nearby
to talk to, who cares.

347
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,978
Okay, fine, I like him. So what?

348
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,240
No kidding. I just
can't figure out why.

349
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,006
Neither can I.

350
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,413
Looks clear, nothing
to suggest inflammation.

351
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,518
Something's wrong.

352
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,618
O2 sats are plummeting. We
need to intubate. Drop the table.

353
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,458
I can't get it in!

354
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,095
The airway's blocked.
Get the trach kit.

355
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,954
O2 are going back up.

356
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,819
What's that smell?

357
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,719
Did he defecate?

358
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:27,958
Doesn't look like it.

359
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,169
I think it's his feet.

360
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,905
Oh.

361
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,736
Oh, man.

362
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,841
Oh.

363
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,503
Oh, it's definitely his feet.

364
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,740
Please, don't.

365
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,919
That is a nice bow.

366
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,385
That was a nice door.

367
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,717
Put it on my tab.

368
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,519
What say we take it up a notch?

369
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,430
Yeah, right. Very funny.

370
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,022
You don't trust me?

371
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,260
No!

372
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,092
I'll do it!

373
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,768
And we have a gamer.

374
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,602
Oh, come on, man.
You can't be serious.

375
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:10,733
Why not?

376
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,177
Anything goes wrong, we
just take her to the doctor.

377
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,009
And I'm only eight paces away.

378
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,743
House... I like you, Carnell.

379
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,384
Don't ruin it.

380
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:24,856
Stinky feet, could point to
diabetes, athlete's foot or gangrene.

381
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,256
<i>Pick one.</i> CARNELL: <i>No!</i>

382
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,087
None.

383
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,959
None of those cause bloody
sputum or disappearing masses.

384
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,123
No, no, no! No!

385
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,700
<i>You're going to kill her.</i>

386
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,434
<i>Don't do that, Carnell.</i>

387
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,970
<i>They might get the idea
that I'm shooting at a hooker.</i>

388
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,271
Fungal infection cause
ulceration between the toes.

389
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,409
<i>Bleeding can be from
recurring abscesses</i>

390
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,144
<i>that appear to be
recurring masses.</i>

391
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,549
Symptoms in the head
or feet mean the infection

392
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,747
<i>would have to be in
the heart or the brain.</i>

393
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,541
<i>I say we start by
looking in the heart</i>

394
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,492
because looking at his brain
with a metal plate is problematic.

395
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,993
So is MRI-ing his heart.

396
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,292
He's got a seven centimeter conductive
metal rod holding his rib together.

397
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,888
It'll rip him in two. HOUSE: <i>No,</i>

398
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:10,960
it'll just feel like it's ripping
him in two, which is much better.

399
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,501
We could minimize the damage by injecting
ice-water into his abdominal cavity.

400
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,076
<i>No! Please, no!</i>

401
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,052
Oh, God!

402
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,445
Oops.

403
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,812
<i>Got to go.</i>

404
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,048
Call an ambulance!

405
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,325
Why?

406
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,725
What do you mean, why!

407
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,525
She's hurt! She
doesn't look hurt.

408
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:44,863
No, you didn't.

409
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,132
Yes, we did.

410
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,742
You're an ass.

411
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:57,348
Okay, go get me
General Patton's Colt .45.

412
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,950
The one with the two notches.

413
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,576
He's not getting you a gun.

414
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:05,286
Your friend knows how
to have a good time.

415
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,856
The MRI magnets are
going to heat the metal.

416
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:14,366
It could get to over 300
degrees in 15 seconds.

417
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:18,768
Which is why we're injecting
ice-water into your abdominal cavity.

418
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,372
You'll feel colder
than you've ever felt.

419
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,069
And then you'll be hotter...

420
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,539
You'll feel hotter
than you've ever felt.

421
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,718
We'll try to be as
quick as possible.

422
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,453
Why... Shut up.

423
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,256
It's interesting.

424
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,333
No, it's not.

425
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,562
It's mundane and simple.

426
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:51,968
He's obviously

427
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:56,264
a very blessed specimen, so
from an evolutionary point of view,

428
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,004
he'd produce healthy off-spring.

429
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,275
So my pre-frontal cortex is telling
me I should have sex with him.

430
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,577
Oh. Is that all?

431
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:06,778
Yes. My rational brain knows
he's a hillbilly and an idiot.

432
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:10,016
And yet somehow your rational
brain is losing the argument.

433
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,522
Which is interesting.

434
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,757
You were bored.

435
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:18,491
You must have spent about
two days setting up a fake murder,

436
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:19,963
and you were bored.

437
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,193
I'm fine.

438
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,325
You're not.

439
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,970
And I'm worried you might
do something even stupider.

440
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,406
Why don't you move
back in with me?

441
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,603
At least until you
get back on track.

442
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,202
What an ego.

443
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,641
You think you're some sort of
emotional paragon, you're my rock.

444
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,207
I'm trying to be a friend.

445
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:43,688
At least I had the good sense not to
marry every woman I fall into bed with.

446
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,653
Maybe you should
move in with me.

447
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,317
Either way, if you prefer...

448
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,157
I prefer you to stop
talking about this.

449
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,197
House, we haven't even
started talking about this,

450
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,908
except to establish
the fact that you're fine,

451
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,127
which clearly you aren't.

452
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,963
Leave me alone!

453
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,637
No.

454
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,699
We are going to talk about this,

455
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,143
and we're going
to deal with this.

456
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,010
So I have no choice.

457
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,507
Fine.

458
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,177
Unless...

459
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,314
Unless...

460
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,648
Yes!

461
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,192
I do! I do have legs!

462
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,591
I see you didn't factor
those into your brilliant plan.

463
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,271
Lane, can you try to hold still?

464
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:39,709
I'm trying.

465
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:41,574
Real hard.

466
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,414
Guy is tough,
I'll give him that.

467
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,747
My pre-frontal cortex
is a little aroused.

468
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,187
Just get the damn picture.

469
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,724
Rib temp is at 158.

470
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,671
I don't have a clear
view of his aorta yet.

471
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,335
This isn't going to
work, we have to stop.

472
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:00,959
No, you're trying to protect
him instead of trying to save him.

473
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,759
He's smoking!

474
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,269
Literally. You ass!

475
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:06,864
Five more seconds. No!

476
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,817
Getting a good image
isn't going to mean anything

477
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,469
if he doesn't have a rib cage.

478
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,235
Got it!

479
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,151
The images,

480
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,127
they're normal.

481
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,178
You're going to have
to talk to him eventually.

482
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,580
He needs you.

483
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,483
I love him.

484
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:04,296
And I know he loves me.

485
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,425
But I just can't...

486
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,626
He needs you in his life.

487
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:12,430
Even if you're not sleeping
with him, he needs you.

488
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,163
Without you...

489
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,436
You can't go backwards.

490
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,880
I can't fix his problem.

491
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,476
I am his problem.

492
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:46,402
If the infection is not in
his heart, it's in his brain.

493
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,396
You're in my sun.

494
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,531
Do a CT.

495
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,373
We can't. He has a titanium
plate and a bunch of metal screws.

496
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,503
Get rid of them.

497
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,513
His skull has multiple
hair-line fractures.

498
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:57,345
Removing the metal
plate will be like

499
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,716
removing half an eggshell
without cracking the rest of the shell.

500
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,722
And not removing the plate will
be like leaving the egg out to rot.

501
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:06,358
We can't cut off the top of his
head based on a few symptoms

502
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,862
that disappear whenever
we try to test for them.

503
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:15,531
What if the one symptom
that hasn't disappeared,

504
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,903
was never actually there.

505
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,301
Any delays when he
answers questions?

506
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,466
He doesn't have
partial hearing loss,

507
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,072
he's missing moments.

508
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,008
He reported having
something like

509
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,243
a complex partial
seizure during the bull ride.

510
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,556
He said it hadn't happened
since, but what if he's wrong?

511
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,896
What if the
infection in the brain

512
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,197
is causing it to
happen all the time?

513
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,816
His EEG didn't show
any sign of seizure activity.

514
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,402
I didn't say it was a seizure, I
said it was something like a seizure.

515
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,404
I'm guessing you're about
to tell us we need to find

516
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,896
something like
an EEG to prove...

517
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,398
Nope. Because I already got one.

518
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:51,467
You want me to sing?

519
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,062
How's singing <i>My Bonnie</i> going
to help you see inside my brain?

520
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,163
It won't.

521
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:58,971
This is going to prove that
we need to cut into your skull.

522
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,636
Which is going to
be kind of dangerous,

523
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:03,079
so you've got a real
incentive to sing like an angel.

524
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,788
We think you're having mini
black-outs, but your brain compensates.

525
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,244
It can't compensate if
there's a pre-set rhythm.

526
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,991
One, two, three.

527
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,592
<i>My Bonnie lies over the ocean</i>

528
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,322
<i>My Bonnie lies</i>

529
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,025
<i>over the sea</i>

530
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:24,868
<i>My Bonnie</i>

531
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,799
<i>lies over the ocean</i>

532
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,636
<i>Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me</i>

533
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,344
See? Told you.

534
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,511
Lane, that wasn't even close.

535
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:42,477
That was brilliant.

536
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,282
Yeah.

537
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,969
It's understandable.

538
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,539
I hate when you do that.

539
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,074
You respond to what
you think I'm thinking

540
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,914
because you think
that I think like you do.

541
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,488
It's insulting and annoying.

542
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:21,058
You're scared because
nothing excites you.

543
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:23,328
Fun doesn't excite you.

544
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,193
Puzzles don't excite you.

545
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,055
What's left?

546
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,735
And I was saying, you're right.

547
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:33,834
You're upset, you're depressed.

548
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:37,205
Everything's going to
taste a little worse right now,

549
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,202
but it'll pass.

550
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,908
It's understandable.

551
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,910
You're scared because
you think I'm falling apart,

552
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,051
and you're trying to convince
yourself that you're overreacting.

553
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,022
Keeps ringing.

554
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,519
Yeah.

555
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,564
House, there's no
infection in this guy's brain.

556
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,063
CT's clean.

557
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,063
Well, that sucks.

558
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:06,361
Now we're going to
have to blow up his heart.

559
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,838
We're not blowing up his heart
because we've ruled out his heart.

560
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,243
MRI and transesophageal echo
reveal no swelling, no masses,

561
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,338
no vegetation, no
sign of anything.

562
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,243
Because we're
looking the wrong way.

563
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,546
There's an imperfection.

564
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:26,191
How do you find where?

565
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,556
I don't know, I'd get
a magnifying glass...

566
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:29,890
You suck.

567
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,793
Feel free to interpret
that both ways.

568
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,294
You suck on the straw,
see where the drink leaks.

569
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,212
So you're saying we
put pressure on his aorta

570
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,932
until it rips open?

571
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,631
You do realize the
downside of that?

572
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,233
If we don't rip it, the
damage from the infection will.

573
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,370
Probably not when he's
got his chest open in an OR

574
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,415
where it can be repaired
inside the 60 seconds

575
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:51,211
it'll take him to
bleed to death.

576
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,114
It's a ridiculous
idea, it won't work.

577
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,413
If you don't mind,

578
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:57,422
I have to go get this guy's
approval to rip his heart open.

579
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:11,793
Hey.

580
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,570
We think you have
a Bartonella infection,

581
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:20,142
which caused a mycotic
aneurysm in your aortic wall.

582
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:23,749
We need to find it, which means
we need to blow up your heart.

583
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,476
And yes, I'm as
serious as a heart attack.

584
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,644
We're going to increase
your blood pressure

585
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:33,123
until the weak spot in
your aortic wall explodes.

586
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,854
Hopefully we'll be able to fix
it before you bleed to death.

587
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:37,657
Any questions?

588
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,189
No.

589
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:43,958
Really?

590
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:48,105
You don't even want to know if
you'll be able to go back to bull riding?

591
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,539
I assume no.

592
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,606
I mean, you've already
cracked open my skull,

593
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,474
and now you're going
to blow up my heart.

594
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,449
I thought you loved
those eight seconds.

595
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,181
I do.

596
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,822
And now you're telling me

597
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,887
that I got to give them up.

598
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:18,499
I can always find
something else to love.

599
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:24,499
House.

600
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,640
We need to talk.

601
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,454
You didn't expect me to say yes

602
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,154
to rupturing his aorta, did you?

603
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,830
Since I didn't ask, I wasn't
expecting you to say anything at all.

604
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,925
You have no reason to
believe this will save his life.

605
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,092
Really?

606
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,198
No reason. None at all.

607
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,934
I'm just planning on cracking
open his chest, blowing up his heart,

608
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,135
what, to pad his bill?

609
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,112
Or you think that since you
broke my heart I want to break his?

610
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,405
I don't know.

611
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:10,182
I think maybe you're looking
for something that can excite you,

612
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,847
fill a void.

613
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,222
And it's affecting
your judgment.

614
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,128
You're right, I am.

615
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:22,527
But my damaged, depressed,
drug-addled judgment

616
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:25,537
is still better than yours or
any other doctor in this hospital.

617
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:28,369
And my team is going to do
this procedure and save his life.

618
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,035
So, you can either have
security arrest me and my team,

619
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,078
or you can get the
hell out of my way.

620
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,478
And she caves.

621
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,655
Rib spreader in place.

622
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:51,957
Heart looks good.

623
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,791
Aorta is exposed.

624
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,633
I take it you ratted
me out to Cuddy?

625
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,408
I think your judgment
is compromised.

626
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:11,641
No, you don't.

627
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,150
<i>Come on, I got a
squash game at 2:00.</i>

628
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,711
Let's give this cowboy a ride.

629
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,633
If I inject more, there
won't be any room

630
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,577
for the blood to go
through the rest of his body.

631
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,584
You're right.

632
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:25,994
<i>Just make damn sure we don't damage
his toes while we blow up his heart.</i>

633
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,402
No bubbles, no
bruising, no gaps.

634
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:41,736
It's not working.

635
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,349
Yes, it is.

636
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:50,847
I was wrong.

637
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,551
Not yet.

638
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:55,436
<i>Let's switch him over to
bypass for debridement.</i>

639
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,758
Come on, we don't
have much time.

640
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,124
Slow the heart down.

641
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,253
Damn.

642
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,785
You can't clamp the
aorta at this pressure,

643
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,078
even if we can see
through all the blood.

644
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,222
Do it anyway. We need
suction and more sponges.

645
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,807
The leak is too fast.

646
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,433
No, it's not, we can fix this.

647
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,400
It worked.

648
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,240
<i>House, it worked!</i>

649
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,248
<i>I heard you.</i>

650
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,979
Hey!

651
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,748
I'm awake, so I guess it worked.

652
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,820
As long as you don't get
your heart rate too high.

653
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,957
You probably shouldn't
have sex for a while.

654
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,756
I'll keep that in mind.

655
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,833
Want to hang out, see
your ranch some time?

656
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,766
Uh.

657
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,078
That'd probably be inappropriate

658
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,449
because I'm your
doctor, and everything.

659
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,057
Good luck with everything.

660
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,569
It...

661
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,039
Double Scotch,

662
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,403
doubled.

663
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,846
Blended, single
malt, any preference?

664
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,407
No.

665
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:42,021
Yeah, sorry about the
noise. I guess their team won.

666
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:45,496
Although, I got to tell you,

667
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:49,022
sometimes I wish I could still act
like that, you know? Just let loose?

668
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,842
I guess it's a little easier,
though, when you got no troubles.

669
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,935
Parents still paying your bills.

670
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,774
You got your whole
life ahead of you.

671
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,792
No!

672
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,106
Cannonball!

673
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,318
What the hell are you doing?

674
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,683
What do you do when you win?

675
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,551
Party!

676
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,816
What do you do when you lose?

677
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,859
Party harder!
