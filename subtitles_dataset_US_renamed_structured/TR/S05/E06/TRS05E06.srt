Conrad Hawkins?

5
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:10,205
There's been an accident.

6
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:12,745
Brought your favorite person.

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,941
- Yes, Bubble?
- You got me

13
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:28,710
- the best costume ever.
- Oh, mm...

I like all of them.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,149
You only have two feet,
Bubble.

18
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:49,016
These socks are sparkly.
For tonight.

19
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:51,594
Okay. That's a good call
on the sparkles.

20
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,267
This restaurant we're going to
is pretty fancy, huh?

21
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:55,157
- I know what I'm gonna have.
- Oh, yeah?

22
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:57,329
I'm gonna have spaghetti
and ice cream.

23
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:58,899
Mr. Giraffe will, too.

24
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:01,437
Oh, well,
I don't know about that.

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,648
What's that on your finger?

26
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,055
This? Just a scratch.

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,985
I'm okay.

28
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,890

35
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:28,117
Are you going to the hospital
where Mommy used to work?

36
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:30,140
Ah, you remember, sweetie.

37
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,742
I don't work at the hospital
anymore.

38
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:33,617
I have a private practice now,

39
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:35,460
because I want to spend
more time with you

40
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:36,544

- There she is!

- Maggie!
- Hi!

Hey. How are you?

44
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,731
Her bag for the park
is ready to go.

45
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,531

46

Thank you.

47
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,901
I will see you tonight
for our dinner date.

48
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:55,588
Mwah!

49
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:57,843
Have a great day at work.

50
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:59,515
- Let's go to the park.
- Thank you.

51
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,539
I think you might be
the first cover boy I ever slept with.

52
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:10,453
Oh.
Well, congratulations.

53
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:18,365
You know, if you liked that,
I'll be on CNN tonight.

54
00:02:18,464 --> 00:02:20,324
- Hmm.
- 8:05 hit time.

55
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:23,117
Sorry,
I don't really watch TV.

56
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:25,552
My Lyft is here.

57
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:30,664

62
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,187
- Mwah.
- Another night at Dr. Austin's?

63
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:55,359
One text led
to another.

64
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,335
So, you both, uh,
working late again today?

65
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,420
- Yes.
- Yeah.

66
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:02,393
Have a good day.

67
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:03,625
You, too.

68
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:19,570
Dr. Bell?
Sorry to interrupt.

69
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:21,242
I can see
you're meditating.

70
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:24,351
Sorry.
I'm Rachel Plec's daughter.

71
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:27,296
I just, I wanted to thank you
for helping her.

72
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:29,882
You are a miracle worker, truly.

73
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:31,790
Yeah, well, your mother was
a very strong woman.

74
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,608
She...
she never gave up.

75
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:35,109
And neither did we.

76
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:40,109
Well, so, Dr. Austin works here,
too, right?

77
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:42,468
Could you maybe get him
to sign this?

78

00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:51,023

83

How's the elbow feeling?

84
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:04,046
Still tender
when I make a fist.

85
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,629
Remember to do
your forearm stretches tonight

86
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:07,781
for better blood flow.

87
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:08,820
- I will.
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,581

89
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:13,531

creeping onto your side
of the closet again,

93
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:21,783
I'm not going to apologize.

94
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:25,359
No, I've made a complete and
total surrender on that front,

95
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:26,343
believe me.

96
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:28,890
Wise. But that's
not why you're calling me.

97
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:30,765
<i>I hope you're having fun
at the weigh-in.</i>

98
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,883
Well, with Hayes retiring,
I would like to be considered

99
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,210
for chief of surgery.

100
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:37,362
Looking to pull
a Grover Cleveland.

101
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:39,531
I know I've done
the job before,

102
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:42,132
<i>but it just hit me
I still have a lot to offer,</i>

103
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:43,460
and...

104
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,188
I think I need to show some of
these other doctors what's what.

105
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:50,460
Oh, I'll consider you,
but there are other candidates.

106
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:54,085
And remember, this is me as CEO
and not your partner.

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,765
Of course.

108
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:58,828
We'll talk later.
Bye, honey.

109
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:03,984
Dr. Sutton.

110
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:05,687
How many times

111
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,873
do I have to call you
because these ICU doctors

112
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,478
won't give my patients
enough pain meds?

113
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:10,951
Look, I know
it's not your fault, Kit,

114
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:12,047
but this is your hospital,

115
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,297
and if my patients
can't get relief...

116
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,835
- It complicates their recovery.
- You want to go right now?

117
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,049
- Let's go.
- That's all you know how to do.

118
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,007
- Come on. Come on, let's go.
- Talk, talk, talk...

119
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:19,360
How do you expect me
to do my job

120
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,906
when not everyone
is doing theirs?

121
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:27,554

I don't know, like, headache,
heart was racing, stomach hurts.

129

I'm talking to my doctor.

Yeah, doctor.
No, it's not serious.

131
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,683
Is it serious?

132
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,871
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

133
00:06:12,902 --> 00:06:15,044
Trust me, that's not
gonna be a long-term trend.

134
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:17,676
We'll just see how things
play out in after-hours trading.

135
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,621
Blood
pressure's elevated.

136
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:22,387
My 11:15 just got moved up.

137
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:24,317
I got a gut feeling about
this pitch, man... who knows,

138
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,707
this time next year,
we could be riding a unicorn.

139
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:27,519
Mr. Nye...

140
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:28,981
Hey, they can waste

so long as it's not mine, right?

142
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,580
He'll call you back.

143
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,605
Your symptoms are likely being
caused by elevated tyramine.

144
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,292
An interaction
between what you ate

145
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:38,762
and your antidepression patch.

146
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,584
If you want to avoid a stroke,
steer clear of the cheeseboards.

147
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,032
Okay.

148
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:46,277
So... we're done?

149
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:55,465
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,004
You feeling okay?

151
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:07,527
I'm a doctor, so...

152
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,512
You don't look like a doctor.

153
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,576
Yeah, well,
I did struggle on the MCATs,

154
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:13,728
but I am a doctor.

155
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:14,821
You work here?

156
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:16,019
In the kitchen, yeah.

157
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:17,676
Let me guess,
vegetable did you in.

158
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:20,863
You should see
the turnip, right?

159
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:23,926
I can take a look if you want.

160
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,152
Don't bother.

161
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,580
I, uh...

162
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:29,262
I got diagnosed with cancer
a few months ago.

163
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:31,894
It's in my chest
and my lungs.

164
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:33,746
Sorry to hear that.

165
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,894
Doctor says
I have a year, tops.

166
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:39,707
So, this cut isn't
my biggest problem.

167
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,762
Diagnosis sucks,
but I don't want you

168
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:48,765
to lose your finger
on top of that, so...

169
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:50,754
That wound is more
than I can treat here,

170
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,757
but... let me take you
to a hospital nearby.

171
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:54,691
No, no. I...

172
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,856
I'm still paying the doctor
who told me I'm a dead man.

173
00:07:57,941 --> 00:07:59,529
I got a kid to think about.

174
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:00,582
It's a public hospital.

175
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:02,691
They won't leave you in debt,
I promise.

176
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:04,471
How can you be sure?

177
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,684
Used to work there.

178
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,559
<i>About me and your sister,</i>

179
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:12,238
I hope it's not too weird
for you.

180
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:14,700
You mean the fact that
you've basically seen me naked?

181
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,925
Great. Thanks.
I didn't think about that.

182
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:18,990
Don't worry,
I could not care less.

183
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:21,169
You know, you and your sister
are very different.

184
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:23,184
Padma said
before she came to Atlanta,

185
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,160
she was a guide
on the Appalachian Trail.

186
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:26,224
Yep.
And before that,

187
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:27,600
she was leading
a wellness retreat

188
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:29,785
for rich people to de-stress
in beautiful places.

189
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,937
Oh, well, I could use that
right about now.

190
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,810
30-year-old female.

191
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,458
130/90.

192
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:36,497
Blunt trauma to the back.

193
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,418
Man, she sucker-punched me.
That's what's up.

194
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:40,494
But y'all gonna see on TV
when I crush that lollipop

195
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:41,122
in the ring.

196
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:42,922
She's been like
that all the way here.

197
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,770
All right, on my count.

198
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:46,786
One, two, three.

199
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:50,002
Oh, I've seen you before.

200
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:51,414
- You're a fighter.
- Nah.

201
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,083
I'm just your average three-time
bantamweight MMA champ,

202
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,059
ESPY winner,
Strikeforce, Iron Fist.

203
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:57,083
You wanted a consult?

204
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:59,053
Ms. Rodriguez felt paresthesias

205
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,770
in her bilateral
lower extremities.

206
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:02,715
Man, do you know how many times
I've been hit?

207
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,612
- I'm still here, aren't I?
- Ms. Rodriguez,

208
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:06,375
I'm Dr. Sutton.
We train just as hard

209
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,928
for these moments as you do
for yours, so be quiet.

210
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,283
I like her.

211
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,439
Airway intact. Pulse is strong.

212
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,134
Can you feel me
touching you here?

213
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:17,530
Not really.

214
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:19,686
Hang on. I got something.

215
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,900
Yeah, we have a palpable mass
in the mid-epigastrium.

216
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:25,556
It shows up on the FAST as well.

217
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:28,322
CT now.
I'll meet you there.

218
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:37,791
Congrats on the book.

219
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,658
Oh, thank you.
You read it?

220
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:41,719
No, no.
Too busy operating,

221
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,557
just gearing up
to be chief again.

222
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,894
Oh. Well, I hear Kit
is still considering candidates.

223
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:49,509
- Mm.
- I would know. I am one.

224
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,323
I'm surprised
you can find the time,

225
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:52,733
given all the books
you're signing.

226
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:54,995
Yeah, well, no one can be
too busy to give Chastain the...

227
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:57,673
the visionary leader
it so desperately needs.

228
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,502
You know, someone
who's still got that... fire.

229
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:02,064
Couldn't agree more.

230
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,870
Look who
decided to show his face.

231
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,908
As if anyone could get enough

232
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,661
- of that face.
- Eh...

233
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,541
How long has it been
this time?

234
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:25,128
Uh, since that asthma patient,
I think.

235
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:27,063
Aw. That was a month ago.

236
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:28,297
We miss you.

237
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:29,438
I miss you guys, too.

238
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:31,034
Oh, enough to come back?

239
00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:32,423
You never know,
I might sneak

240
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,638
back and torture
you guys again.

241
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:36,931
Conrad knows as long as I'm CEO,
he always has a place here.

242
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:38,020
Thank you.

243
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:41,204
I'm just dropping off a patient,
last name Tellenbaum.

244
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:41,923
He's in the waiting room.

245
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,251
Jackson Tellenbaum.
Hand injury, huh?

246
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:46,118
And diagnosed
with metastatic lung cancer

247
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:47,383
at Atlanta General.

248
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:49,063
He's been avoiding doctors
since

249
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,133
because he has
no insurance, so...

250
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,508
We'll take care of him.

251
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:53,798
Who's the new attending?

252
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:55,399
He looks familiar,
like this intern

253
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:57,630
- I tried to train.
- Same bit, huh?

254
00:10:57,715 --> 00:10:59,079
I recognize the shoes.

255
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:01,486
Yeah, well, you know,
unlike you, the rest of us,

256
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,149
you know, we don't have all day,
so bring it in, baby.

257
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:07,813
- Did you get the office with the shower?
- I did.

258
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:10,728
It's a necessity
with these hours.

259
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:11,883
But I will admit,

260
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:14,353
it is way more fun giving
the orders than getting them,

261
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:17,008
- especially from you.
- I bet.

262
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:18,209
I bet.

263
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:23,938
Good to see everyone.

264
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,644
Whoa, whoa, not so fast,
Mr. Concierge Doctor.

265
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:29,347
Let's go take a walk.

266
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:32,392
<i>Here we see champ
Tamiko Rodriguez</i>

267
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:33,532
<i>getting knocked to the floor
during</i>

268
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:34,861
- a weigh-in brawl.
- At least I got the shot.

269
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,273
<i>Coming up, we'll show you
what led to it.</i>

270
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,547
<i>Do you have
advanced non-small cell lung cancer?</i>

271
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,759
<i>What if you
didn't have to give up?</i>

272
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,532
<i>What if you could live longer?</i>

273
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:53,590
<i>Halcipride could give you
good days.</i>

274
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:57,020
<i>Happy days.</i>

275
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,840
<i>More days.</i>

276
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:05,114
<i>Ask your doctor
if Halcipride is right for you.</i>

277
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:10,380
Chemo drugs need to be
prescribed by an oncologist.

278
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:12,782
I can get you a referral
to someone at Chastain.

279
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,207
Gonna wrap your hand now.

280
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,246
- How long for a referral?
- Usually three or four weeks.

281
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,396
Weeks?

282
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,223
Come on, guys.

283
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:23,387
The ad said Halcipride
can really help me.

284
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:25,215
- Hmm?
- And it's here, right?

285
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:26,903
Can I get a sample?

286
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:28,879
No, but I can get you
that referral.

287
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,724
Dr. Feldman.

288
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:32,301
Just sit tight, okay?

289
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,418
Uh...

290
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,988
I need to get
you a tetanus booster.

291
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:37,098
Be right back.

292
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,200
I only have a minute.

293
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,193
Oh. Good news.

294
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,359
I found
this guerilla taco truck

295
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:48,218
<i>parked right by Chastain today.</i>

296
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,422
<i>- Want to grab lunch?</i>
- I wish I could.

297
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:52,469
I have to take notes
for my attending, and then round

298
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:55,493
<i>- on my post-op patients, so...</i>
- What happened to your cardamom?

299
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:56,648
You always leave it

300
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,133
<i>by the butter.</i>

301
00:12:58,335 --> 00:12:59,937
I do.

302
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:03,164
So, you and Dr. Austin,
is that, like...

303
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:04,632
is that, like, a thing now?

304
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,360
<i>What?! No, definitely not.</i>

305
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:08,428
I'm just curious.

306
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:10,597
It is, like,
third time in two weeks, so...

307
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:14,437
<i>Leel, I came here to see you
and meet Devon two months ago,</i>

308
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:17,528
and I have basically had
this entire apartment to myself.

309
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:21,328
So... no, I am not looking
to get serious with a doctor.

310
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,960
Not in this lifetime.

311
00:13:23,044 --> 00:13:25,593
Dr. Devi, DVT waiting on you
in Bay 9.

312
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:27,703
I'll be with them next.
Hey, I got to go. Bye.

313
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:40,357
Dr. Voss asked me
to tag in.

314
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:41,953
Oh, did she?

315
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,969
Yeah, I've reviewed
our MMA champ's records,

316
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:47,226
and Ms. Rodriguez has
a family history of cancer.

317
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,352
And that abdominal mass
may indicate a lymphoma

318
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:51,774
or hepatobiliary tumor.

319
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:53,836
So we'll need our best hands
on hand.

320
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:57,051
So you joining has nothing to do
with the tweet-storm of love

321
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,313
coming for any of us
who save this superstar?

322
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:02,774
No, you know, unlike some,
I'm not the kind of surgeon

323
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,750
that needs validation
outside the hospital.

324
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:07,896
Oh, says the man who had
his own surgical tool,

325
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,008
supplement line and TV show.

326
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:12,133
- Am I missing anything?
- Gentlemen.

327
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:19,758
All right, she has
an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

328
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:21,812
Six centimeters.

329
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:24,211
And it's likely to rupture,
given her hypertension.

330
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,711
That's odd,
considering we see triple A's

331
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,360
in mostly older men
and smokers.

332
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:31,086
That's why.
She has bamboo spine.

333
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,617
Ankylosing spondylitis
can often be associated

334
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:34,773
with triple A.

335
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:37,571
T3 through L4 is
almost entirely fused together,

336
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:39,594
with a column 3
unstable fracture at L1.

337
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,860
- It's a miracle she got out of bed.
- Her pain tolerance

338
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:44,336
- must be off the charts.
- We do a staged repair.

339
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:45,859
Once you complete
the triple A,

340
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:48,664
I'll perform a posterior
stabilization and fusion.

341
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,838
I'll join you, Dr. Austin.

342
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:52,734
Both of us for a triple A?

343
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:54,640
Is that necessary?

344
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,609
Better safe than sorry.

345
00:14:57,806 --> 00:14:59,312
Fine.

346
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,199
Let's all go break the news.

347
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,508
Pain I can handle,
but ten months of me in bed

348
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:07,016
while everybody replays
the video

349
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:08,189
of me getting knocked
on my ass?

350
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:09,398
You won't last one round.

351
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,236
Your aneurysm is
on the cusp of rupturing.

352
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,775
And your spine is too brittle.

353
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:15,212
One punch at the wrong angle,
it could snap your back in half.

354
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,390
So to fix my spine,
you want to break it yourself

355
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,486
and then put it back together
like some LEGO set?

356
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:21,581
Yeah, find some other toy
to play with.

357
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:24,064
Leave now,
and the only question

358
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:25,991
you'll be asking yourself
the next time you hit the floor

359
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,541
is why you didn't listen to us.

360
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:29,238
Want to replay this moment
in your head

361
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:30,670
for the rest of your life?

362
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,650
Ms. Rodriguez?

363
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:36,306
Can I get a photo?

364
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,994
What's your name?

365
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:43,266
Ella. I want to fight,
like you do.

366
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:46,252
She seem a little young
for MMA?

367
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,330
And can you come
to my birthday party?

368
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,322
Photo, yes.

369
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,899
Birthday, no.

370
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:01,947
Say hi to my docs.

371
00:16:02,555 --> 00:16:03,694
They're gonna fix me up

372
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:05,623
so I can get back in the ring
for you.

373
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,373
Isn't that right?

374
00:16:27,547 --> 00:16:28,697
Sir?

375
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:30,197
You're not allowed
back here.

376
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,737
Where's the Halcipride?

377
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,916
- H-A-L-C-I...
- You need to leave now.

378
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,993
Nobody's leaving
until I get it.

379
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,245
So, how many Saudi princes
have you treated this week?

380
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,409
That was one patient one time.

381
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:47,651
- Any Real Housewives?
- Why?

382
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:49,542
- You want me to get you an autograph?
- Hell yeah.

383
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:52,448
Look, I just want to be sure

384
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:56,081
that your talents
aren't being wasted on giving

385
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:58,081
B12 shots and laxatives
to the rich and famous.

386
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,448
Yeah, most are neither.

387
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,684
Actually, a lot need to pay
on a sliding scale,

388
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:03,780
or they can't make it
to the hospital

389
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:06,809
because they have family,
so they just need more flexibility.

390
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,427
Oh.

391
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:09,895
How's the little lady?

392
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:11,973
Perfect.

393
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:15,277
GiGi and I have
a dinner reservation tonight.

394
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:16,990
Mm. That's nice.

395
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:18,756
Ah, I can't even remember
the last time

396
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:20,731
I got off
when the sun was up.

397
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,664
And I bet
you wouldn't change a thing.

398
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,567
There is one thing.

399
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:29,606
Well, we had
some good times here.

400
00:17:29,864 --> 00:17:31,052
Yeah.

401
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,255
Yeah, we did.

402
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:34,271
I think about you guys
all the time.

403
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:35,436
It's actually annoying how much

404
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,939
I think about you guys.

405
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,912
Well, you're
a big concierge now.

406
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:41,895
So I want some dinner
reservations, concert tickets.

407
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:44,622
- Hey, everything all right?
- Got a code silver.

408
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,067
Time to shake off a little rust.

409
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,756
- What's going on?
- It's the patient you brought in.

410
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:53,780
He was asking about
some cancer drug he saw on TV.

411
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,567
I told him
I couldn't just give it to him.

412
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:59,123
It's out of stock anyway.

413
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,609
And now he's blockaded himself
in there with the pharmacists.

414
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:03,818
He won't let anyone out
until he gets the drug.

415
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,115
And he has a weapon.

416
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,521
Atlanta PD are on the way.

417
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:07,552
Conrad, who is this guy?

418
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:09,628
I just met him today.
He needed help.

419
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,027
I brought him in.
What-what drug?

420
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:13,814
Halcipride. New targeted therapy
for stage IV lung cancer.

421
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:14,954
I read the outcomes.

422
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,126
It costs, like,
five grand a week

423
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,290
and only gives patients
a couple of extra weeks at best.

424
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:20,302
I've seen the ads. They make it
seem like a cure when it isn't.

425
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:22,953
For a desperate man, who knows
what he'll do for more time?

426
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:24,647
I'm not sure
what Jackson's gonna do

427
00:18:24,732 --> 00:18:26,547
when the police show up,
but my instinct says

428
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:28,234
he's not dangerous to anyone.

429
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:30,928
I think I can keep things
from going from bad to worse.

430
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:32,637
Hold on.
You're not going in there alone.

431
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:34,563
Jackson's my patient.
I brought him in.

432
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:36,172
So just...
just let me handle it.

433
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:38,681
Someone has got to be with you
in there to have your back.

434
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,332
Even if I agree to this,

435
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,040
he won't let anyone in
without the drug,

436
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,508
and it's still on its way
from Atlanta General.

437
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:46,047
But he doesn't know that.

438
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:57,914
Jackson, it's Dr. Hawkins.

439
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:01,768
We got Halcipride.
Three-month supply, okay?

440
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,070
Jackson?

441
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,277
Slide it through the door.

442
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:25,817
You gotta let them go.

443
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:30,502
Bring it in, then they go.

444
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:32,764
Okay.

445
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,398
Are you all right?

446
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:46,467
Okay, toss me the bag.

447
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:48,668
Them first.

448
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:52,212
Fine. Go.

449
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:57,184
- You back up!
- Whoa. All right.

450
00:19:58,178 --> 00:19:59,747
Give me the bag.

451
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:07,062
What the...

452
00:20:07,412 --> 00:20:10,106
No. What the hell is<i> this?!</i>

453
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,098
- No, you stop.
- Hold on.

454
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:14,473
Hand me the blade
and we can talk.

455
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,881
We just want
to try to help.

456
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:22,093
Jackson, easy, easy.
The drug is coming.

457
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:24,440
Let's just talk.
Let's find a way out of this

458
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,075
before the police get here.
Okay?

459
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:29,747
You said
you got a kid, right?

460
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,169
Boy or girl?

461
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:37,755
I've got a son.

462
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:39,763
He's almost eight.

463
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,247
He lives in Iowa
with his mom now.

464
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:46,474
I've just been trying
to sock away money

465
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,200
since the split, just...

466
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:50,067
give him the things
that I never had.

467
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:54,856
But I can't make things right

468
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:56,989
unless I get more time.

469
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,747
Jackson, getting cancer was
out of your control.

470
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:04,128
But what you do now,

471
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:06,220
that is up to you.

472
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:09,348
I said I'd make
sure you left here whole.

473
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,313
Help me
keep that promise.

474
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,563
Mr. Tellenbaum,
this is Atlanta PD.

475
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,298
Is everything okay in there?

476
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:22,661
Thank you
for trying to help me.

477
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:26,255
I didn't have much time
anyway.

478
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:28,760
No.

479
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:33,264
Hey, can we get
some help in here?

480
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:34,504
Over here in Trauma Bay One.

481
00:21:34,588 --> 00:21:36,160
He took out part
of his internal jugular,

482
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,629
but he missed the carotid.

483
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,121
I'll get access.
Get me an 18-gauge.

484
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:42,773
All right, and type and cross
four units right away.

485
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:47,081
Jackson? Jackson?
Jackson, you with us?

486
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,567
He's in hemorrhagic shock.

487
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:50,355
Can't tamponade the bleeding
without impeding

488
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,628
the venous return;
he needs an OR.

489
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:59,245
- Heart rate 130.
- We don't have time to stabilize him.

490
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,863
Xavier, page Vascular
and Anesthesia.

491
00:22:00,948 --> 00:22:02,004
- He's coming to the OR now.
- Let's go.

492
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,065
- I got it.
- Take it.

493
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:04,807
Let's go. Transport!

494
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:09,254
I'll maintain pressure.
Get the elevator.

495
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:10,968
This way, Officers.

496
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:15,047
- I got fresh clothes in my office.
- Thank you.

497
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:16,974
All right, we got, what,

498
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:20,168
four hours before he's out
of surgery and under arrest?

499
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:21,237
Let's come up with
a treatment plan,

500
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:23,301
try and buy this guy some
more time to see his family.

501
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,058
And I'll get his medical
record from Atlanta General.

502
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:26,142
Good.

503
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:33,156
On your way to
an emergency surgery, I hear.

504
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:34,417
Indeed I am.

505
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:35,847
Neck versus box cutter.

506
00:22:35,932 --> 00:22:37,457
Yeah, vascular repair
like that's gonna take

507
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,175
maybe three, four hours.

508
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,590
Well, don't you worry about it,
Randolph,

509
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:41,982
I will make our triple A.

510
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:43,794
Oh, there's no need to rush.
I can take good care

511
00:22:43,878 --> 00:22:46,776
- of our prizefighter myself.
- I'm sure you can.

512
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:53,151
Are you okay?

513
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:56,324
I'm pretty sure there's still
blood in places I can't see,

514
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:57,410
but yeah.

515
00:22:57,495 --> 00:22:58,948
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

516
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,037
I am now.

517
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:05,520
Oh! You guys
should probably close the door

518
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:07,802
- if you're gonna, you know...
- What are you doing here?

519
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,878
I brought lunch. Also...

520
00:23:10,537 --> 00:23:13,496
I got scolded by a Dr. Nolan
on the way in here.

521
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:16,666
And can I just say, I don't like
the way he talks to you.

522
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,426
I don't see how anyone
can mix you two up.

523
00:23:20,511 --> 00:23:22,011
I mean, you're spontaneous

524
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:24,768
- and-and carefree, and you're...
- Oh.

525
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:27,432
...the love of my life.

526
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:30,847
What did Dr. Nolan say
to you, exactly?

527
00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:33,551
Something about neph.
Nephews?

528
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:37,296
Necrophilia, maybe.
I don't know. Sorry.

529
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,472
But I remember his tone,

530
00:23:38,557 --> 00:23:41,651
and he reminded me
of Uncle Ojasvat. He was mean.

531
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:44,803
This is why I don't like when
you just show up randomly.

532
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:48,573
Because somehow it always
makes more work for me.

533
00:23:48,658 --> 00:23:51,104
- Leela...
- Thank you for lunch.

534
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:53,912
It's been a day.
She'll be all right.

535
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,813
Hey. You can keep it.

536
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:00,307
Thanks.

537
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:01,847
Jackson's medical records.

538
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:04,167
- Oh, nice.
- If he's EGFR positive,

539
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:05,341
we can consider afatinib.

540
00:24:05,425 --> 00:24:07,082
Unless he has
an additional mutation.

541
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,746
Yeah, T790M.
Then we add...

542
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:10,300
- Osimertinib.
- Osimertinib.

543
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,568
I forgot how much fun you two
are when you get together.

544
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:16,199
I'll start by reconfirming
the pathology report

545
00:24:16,284 --> 00:24:17,534
and the genetics of the cancer

546
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:19,528
and see whether he's a candidate
for targeted therapy.

547
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:21,357
Sounds like a plan.
Keep me posted.

548
00:24:21,463 --> 00:24:23,046
Oh, wait. Hold on a second.

549
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,003
Look at this lung biopsy report.

550
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:30,573
Necrosis compatible with
necrotic tumor tissue.

551
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,594
Compatible with,
not diagnostic of.

552
00:24:33,678 --> 00:24:36,519
So, because he had
a lesion in his spine,

553
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:38,098
enlarged lymph nodes
and a lung nodule...

554
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:39,916
They concluded
it was cancer.

555
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:43,287
Have you seen
his fingernails?

556
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,772
Yeah.

557
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:46,941
When was the last time
you saw a stage IV

558
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:48,880
metastatic lung cancer patient
without clubbing?

559
00:24:48,964 --> 00:24:50,667
It happens, but rarely.

560
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:53,347
I think it's possible that
Jackson doesn't have cancer.

561
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:55,426
It's possible.
It's also a leap.

562
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:57,370
I'm just saying
it's worth digging deeper.

563
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:00,341
Maybe
he was misdiagnosed.

564
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,004
- I got the page.
- Her aneurysm ruptured.

565
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,220
She's struggling
to move her legs.

566
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:09,534
Cauda equina syndrome.

567
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:10,958
- Is your schedule clear?
- I'll clear it.

568
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,659
Let's do this.

569
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:19,581
So if it's not cancer,
Jackson's issue could be autoimmune.

570
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,325
Inflammatory. Vasculitis.

571
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:23,941
- We're missing an infection.
- Histoplasmosis.

572
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:25,621
Could explain his lung nodules,

573
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:27,138
but he has no history of travel
the past few years.

574
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:30,637
Okay, then that would also
eliminate blastomycosis,

575
00:25:30,722 --> 00:25:31,871
coccidiomycosis.

576
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:33,426
Yep, but doesn't rule out
abscesses.

577
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:34,511
Right.

578
00:25:37,426 --> 00:25:40,792
Okay, so, we have
three possibilities,

579
00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:41,980
all treatable.

580
00:25:42,065 --> 00:25:44,566
Yep. We add tests
to his pre-op labs,

581
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:45,910
get the rest drawn in the OR.

582
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:48,832
How much time do you have before
your dinner date with Queen Gi?

583
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:51,918
Uh, hour and a half.
Two, tops.

584
00:25:52,003 --> 00:25:53,940
All right, I'll rush
these tests.

585
00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:00,487
Dr. Bell.

586
00:26:02,116 --> 00:26:03,762
Finished already?

587
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:06,245
Fast and flawless, as always.

588
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:09,354
Shall we?
Bovie to me.

589
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:11,827
I have the better angle.

590
00:26:21,776 --> 00:26:24,480
Chu, angle the
head down 15 degrees.

591
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:26,909
I prefer we keep it at ten.

592
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,323
Uh, 13 it is.

593
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:36,073
Resecting the aneurysm.

594
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:43,402
Dr. Chu, would you wake me up
when Dr. Austin is finished

595
00:26:43,487 --> 00:26:45,072
so I can insert the graft?

596
00:26:57,886 --> 00:26:59,486
You boys done?

597
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:04,309
Just finished.

598
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,081
Randolph.

599
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:07,707
AJ.

600
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:09,380
She's all yours, Dr. Sutton.

601
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:12,528
I have a break in my schedule.

602
00:27:12,612 --> 00:27:14,605
You mind if I stick around
and watch you do your thing?

603
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:17,591
Plenty of seats.
Uckle up.

604
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:20,457
All right, pedicle screws
and rods on my left.

605
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:22,596
Osteotomes, burr, rongeurs
on my right.

606
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:24,503
Let's get the Wilson frame
and flip her.

607
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:30,304
Hey.

608
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:33,765
What's so important you needed
to see me right now?

609
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,812
Tell me what you think. Ha!

610
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,499
The guy who just sold it to me

611
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:41,465
drove it around the Badlands
for three months.

612
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:46,366
It already has a bed,
fridge, stove and...

613
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:48,764
...two solar panels.
Check it out.

614
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:50,578
You're gonna live in that?

615
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:52,711
Yeah. Lots of people are
living the van life now.

616
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,500
It gives you total freedom.
And this thing is so cozy.

617
00:27:56,585 --> 00:27:57,242
Padma...

618
00:27:57,327 --> 00:28:00,532
I'm thinking Charleston, maybe,
and then the Keys.

619
00:28:00,617 --> 00:28:01,774
I know you don't get
that much time...

620
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:03,359
How long can you keep
doing this?

621
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,476
Doing what?

622
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,601
Exactly.

623
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:10,054
What are you doing?

624
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:10,734
I...

625
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:13,428
Look, I know this seems
like it's fun and everything,

626
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:15,781
but don't you think it's time
you put down some roots?

627
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:18,912
Or maybe<i> a</i> root?

628
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:22,265
You know what,
forget it.

629
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,023
I'll check it out later.

630
00:28:26,693 --> 00:28:28,468
I threw your milk out last week.

631
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:31,813
It was five months old.

632
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:34,155
And I would have noticed sooner
if I wasn't lacto.

633
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,358
What's your point?

634
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:37,703
When was the last time
you even had a meal at home?

635
00:28:37,787 --> 00:28:39,598
- We order in.
- To the apartment you're never at?

636
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:40,856
With the boyfriend
you never see?

637
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,218
- I see Devon all the time.
- At work.

638
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:45,054
Where you always are.

639
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:47,349
When I first came to Atlanta,
I was only gonna crash

640
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,773
with you a few weeks.

641
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:51,960
I stayed because I love you.

642
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:55,163
And, Leel, you don't eat.
You barely sleep.

643
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,140
- All you talk about is medicine!
- That's the job.

644
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:00,874
I'm a<i> doctor.</i>

645
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,602
I'm literally saving lives.

646
00:29:02,687 --> 00:29:03,919
And what about your life?

647
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,476
Look, Leel,

648
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,359
I am so proud of you.

649
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:15,976
You do things every day
that I can't even pronounce.

650
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:20,534
But I remember a girl who did
a lot of other things, too.

651
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:23,195
She dreamed up crazy cartoons

652
00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:25,132
and went shopping for

653
00:29:25,217 --> 00:29:27,711
the ugliest antiques
we could find.

654
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:31,245
Do you have any idea
how hard it is for me

655
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,248
to do what I do in there
every single day?

656
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:35,281
But I'm doing it, Padma.

657
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,661
When was the last time you took
even five minutes for yourself?

658
00:29:46,415 --> 00:29:47,415
You gotta go.

659
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:57,502
Hey.

660
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,869
Aw... I remember that look.

661
00:30:01,953 --> 00:30:03,554
Lab results were negative.

662
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:05,632
For all three and the cultures?

663
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:07,593
I'll take that to him, thanks.

664
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:09,429
All right,
so we broaden our search.

665
00:30:09,514 --> 00:30:11,545
Check a glucan
and galactomannan.

666
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,062
Look for brucellosis,
actinomycosis.

667
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,581
I will keep searching.

668
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,515
You have a dinner date
with a very special lady.

669
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,407
Let me know.

670
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:25,868
I will. Come on,
I'll walk you out.

671
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:28,866
Hang on a sec.

672
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:39,080
Does he look
hyper-pigmented to you?

673
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,424
I remember that look.

674
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,538
Last pedicle screw.

675
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:53,691
Now we finish the fusion

676
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:55,070
and realign vertebrae.

677
00:31:03,546 --> 00:31:05,773
I heard you and Bell
are competing.

678
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,253
Well, I wouldn't call it
much of a competition.

679
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:12,090
My two cents?
The best chiefs command

680
00:31:12,226 --> 00:31:13,700
the most respect of their peers.

681
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:15,468
That's you.

682
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:17,063
Thanks for the two cents.

683
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:19,031
Besides, I've heard
a few stories.

684
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:20,054
Probably more skeletons

685
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:22,421
in his closet than yours,
if you ask me.

686
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:26,078
We're losing motor signals.

687
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:27,696
Her spinal
cord is getting impinged.

688
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,048
Pituitary rongeurs.

689
00:31:29,335 --> 00:31:31,800
- Everything okay?
- Just trying to find the source.

690
00:31:33,136 --> 00:31:35,015
Could be a bone fragment.

691
00:31:35,142 --> 00:31:37,093
Oh, this isn't working.

692
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:38,466
She'll be permanently
paralyzed soon

693
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,189
if we don't relieve
the pressure on her cord.

694
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,343
What's the move?

695
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:42,954
A Hail Mary.

696
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:45,991
But I'll need an extra
set of hands. Page Dr. Voss.

697
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,781
They told me motor signals
went out.

698
00:31:52,866 --> 00:31:53,986
Sensory signals, too.

699
00:31:54,232 --> 00:31:55,909
I need to bring her out
of anesthesia.

700
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:57,652
The wake-up test?

701
00:31:57,736 --> 00:31:58,819
She could move

702
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:00,593
and disrupt the instruments
in her back,

703
00:32:00,678 --> 00:32:01,702
causing even more damage.

704
00:32:01,788 --> 00:32:03,124
It's our only shot
at finding out

705
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:05,305
if her loss of signal is related
to a dislodged probe

706
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,661
or another issue.

707
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:08,382
We're running out of time.

708
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:12,393
Lighten anesthesia.

709
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,132
Pulling back on the propofol.

710
00:32:22,905 --> 00:32:24,513
Tamiko?

711
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:27,790
This is Dr. Sutton.

712
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,293
You're in surgery.

713
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,427
Don't worry,
everything will be okay.

714
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:34,821
We just need your help.
Blink if you understand.

715
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:37,758
Good.

716
00:32:38,898 --> 00:32:42,049
Now blink if you can feel
a touch on your right leg.

717
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:46,891
Hang tight, okay?

718
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:49,676
We can't keep her awake
for long, but I think

719
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:50,934
we should perform a distraction.

720
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:53,253
And improve the correction
of the spine.

721
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:54,957
Worth a shot.

722
00:32:59,973 --> 00:33:02,741
- Distractor's in place.
- I'll loosen the locking bolt.

723
00:33:08,097 --> 00:33:09,697
Let's push.

724
00:33:14,371 --> 00:33:16,090
Let's try that again.

725
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:19,433
Blink if you can feel
a touch on your leg.

726
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,813
Signal's coming back.

727
00:33:26,043 --> 00:33:27,667
Nerve pressure's relieved.

728
00:33:27,751 --> 00:33:28,965
You did great.

729
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,347
Now we're gonna put you
back to sleep and finish up.

730
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:38,933
That was quite the show,
Dr. Sutton.

731
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,862
Show's not over yet.

732
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:43,218
A full exam after surgery
will tell us more.

733
00:33:48,271 --> 00:33:50,824
<i>Ask your doctor if Halcipr...</i>

734
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,726
Guess I won't be running through
the fields anytime soon.

735
00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:57,997
These ads don't do our patients
any favors.

736
00:33:58,082 --> 00:34:00,357
There's a reason almost every
other country in the world

737
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:01,425
bans them.

738
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,591
But when the FDA eased
restrictions in the '90s,

739
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:06,911
drug companies jumped at
the chance to market their drugs

740
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:08,521
to as many people as they could.

741
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:10,192
So all too often, they present

742
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:13,121
biased or incomplete
information.

743
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:14,865
And mislead people
to ask their doctors

744
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,238
for drugs they don't even need.

745
00:34:16,395 --> 00:34:18,223
And no drug is
for everyone.

746
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,377
And Halcipride, hmm,
that drug...

747
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:23,223
that drug won't help you,
Jackson.

748
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:28,402
Because
you don't have cancer.

749
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:33,214
Your labs
confirmed our suspicion.

750
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:35,791
You were misdiagnosed.

751
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,314
What you really have
is tuberculosis.

752
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,463
H-How?

753
00:34:41,556 --> 00:34:43,033
TB can look a lot
like cancer,

754
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:45,377
and it can travel anywhere,
even your spine.

755
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:47,298
And it can travel
to your adrenal gland.

756
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:49,127
That's what caused your skin
to darken.

757
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,054
Which is what tipped us off.

758
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,270
The best news is
we can treat it.

759
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:56,162
Thank you.

760
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:59,573
So you're gonna need to be
on several medications, okay,

761
00:34:59,657 --> 00:35:00,845
for the next six months.

762
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,673
How much is that gonna cost?

763
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:04,314
We checked. It's affordable.

764
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:15,259
Once you're discharged,
you'll be put under arrest,

765
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:16,838
but until then,
you're still a patient,

766
00:35:16,922 --> 00:35:19,156
so let's focus on
you getting well, okay?

767
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:22,142
Thank you.

768
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:28,603
Look, I get why you left,
but I just feel like,

769
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:31,275
you know, this is what
you were meant to be doing.

770
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:34,952
Ah, I miss it, man. I do.

771
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,689
It wasn't my plan to leave,
but GiGi is my everything.

772
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:42,584
She's waiting for our dinner.
I can make it.

773
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:44,041
She comes first now.

774
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,642
I'm so sorry.
I mean, for all of it.

775
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:51,822
Just know that
you and Nic

776
00:35:51,907 --> 00:35:54,133
are... missed every day.

777
00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:07,949
Good work today,
Dr. Hawkins.

778
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:11,416
You, too, Dr. Pravesh.

779
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:15,798
You, too.

780
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:25,478
Night, Devi.

781
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,712
- Hey.
- Hey.

782
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:39,127
Do you have five minutes?

783
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:41,931
Sure. Why?

784
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:48,970

785

790
00:37:16,478 --> 00:37:18,331
All right.

791
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,063
- She's still got it.
- That's impressive.

792
00:37:20,148 --> 00:37:21,660
You won't be
back in the ring for a while,

793
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:23,883
- but you will be back.
- Good.

794
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:26,143
'Cause that lollipop
that put me here

795
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:27,354
needs a lickin'.

796
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:32,559
I know you're both eager
to find out

797
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:34,412
who our next chief of surgery
will be,

798
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:35,917
so I'll cut to the chase.

799
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:37,731
It won't be either of you.

800
00:37:37,815 --> 00:37:39,325
- Are you serious?
- Excuse me?

801
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:42,729
You've both made remarkable
contributions to Chastain.

802
00:37:42,814 --> 00:37:44,737
But for you, AJ,
chief would just be

803
00:37:44,822 --> 00:37:46,198
another feather in your cap.

804
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:48,609
And, frankly,
you don't have the time.

805
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,469
And, Randolph, you've already
done the job once.

806
00:37:51,554 --> 00:37:53,671
Yeah, which means
I have experience,

807
00:37:53,756 --> 00:37:54,910
which is hardly
a detriment to...

808
00:37:54,994 --> 00:37:57,089
And you quit because
you didn't like it.

809
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,697
It was too time-consuming
and bureaucratic.

810
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:02,218
- You want to cut.
- True that.

811
00:38:02,712 --> 00:38:05,280
You only wanted the job because
you didn't want me to have it.

812
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:07,760
No, I-I wanted it because...

813
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:09,736
I wanted it.

814
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:13,081
Gentlemen, I respect that
you're both competitive

815
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,455
and in it to win,
but I have made my decision.

816
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,625
An unfortunate one,
no doubt,

817
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:21,002
but one I will respect
nonetheless.

818
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:22,612
Thank you, AJ.

819
00:38:30,522 --> 00:38:32,502
Well, maybe it's for the best.

820
00:38:32,587 --> 00:38:33,746
How so?

821
00:38:33,831 --> 00:38:35,232
Because there's a woman

822
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:39,188
that I've been seeing
for a while now, and, uh,

823
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:41,643
we kind of have
a good thing going.

824
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,768
- I-I think she'd agree.
- Would she?

825
00:38:44,868 --> 00:38:48,376
A little less time spent at work
might mean more time with her,

826
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,244
if she can get away.

827
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:54,325
I'm afraid that safety report
on her desk

828
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:56,117
might keep her late tonight.

829
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:58,740
She's worth waiting up for.

830
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:06,671
If it's not me and it's not AJ,

831
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,229
who's the next chief of surgery?

832
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:11,169
Me?

833
00:39:11,254 --> 00:39:14,327
You're a tireless,
if sometimes bossy,

834
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:15,738
advocate for patients.

835
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,998
But I expect nothing less.

836
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:21,369
You're also a leader,
and you work well with others.

837
00:39:21,513 --> 00:39:24,190
You will build consensus,
not bully.

838
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,072
A style I like.

839
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:28,100
I'm certainly flattered...

840
00:39:28,184 --> 00:39:30,862
Of course, the admin burdens
are not insignificant.

841
00:39:30,947 --> 00:39:33,619
You'll have to adjust
your surgical schedule,

842
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:36,276
manage fragile egos
across the department...

843
00:39:36,361 --> 00:39:38,185
Not always an easy task...

844
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:42,080
But you would have a real hand
in shaping this place.

845
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:45,950
Of course, if you need
more time to...

846
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:47,500
I'm in.

847
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:50,875
Good.

848
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:17,156
So, exactly how cozy
is this thing?

849
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:21,016
Only one way to find out.

850
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:28,664
- All right.
- Be careful.

851
00:40:36,365 --> 00:40:38,336
It's really cool.

852
00:40:43,426 --> 00:40:46,414
Look, about earlier...

853
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:48,945
You're not wrong.

854
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:51,962
I know. But do you really
want to take advice

855
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:53,602
from a girl who lives in a van?

856
00:40:57,585 --> 00:41:00,820
Well, you'll be happy to know
I have tomorrow off.

857
00:41:01,234 --> 00:41:02,678
- All day?
- All day.

00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:45,807
See you next time.

872
00:41:45,892 --> 00:41:47,385
Mmm...

873
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:52,468
Welcome to Le Petit GiGi.

874
00:41:56,419 --> 00:41:59,874
Mademoiselle,
please take your seat.

875
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:06,231
- Here's to our new chief.
- Good for her.

876
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,622
- And good luck to her.
- It's a thankless job.

877
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:10,996
- I should know. I did it.
- All that paper pushing.

878
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,178
- Departmental complaints.
- Managing inferior surgeons.

879
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:14,911
- No, thank you.
- We are beyond that.

880
00:42:15,028 --> 00:42:17,067
- Yes, we are.
- To us.

881
00:42:18,682 --> 00:42:20,891
- Ah.
- Ah.

882
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:29,797
I thought, just this once...

883
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:31,250
Ice cream!

884
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:33,110
<i>Oui.</i>

885
00:42:35,371 --> 00:42:38,500
- Yes, please.
- Mmm.

886
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:44,445
So...

887
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:47,391
what did you do today?

888
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:50,047
Learned how to draw
a rhinoceros.

889
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:51,395
You did?

890
00:42:51,882 --> 00:42:53,622
Oh...

891
00:42:53,706 --> 00:42:57,140
Mm, yes. I see.

892
00:42:57,523 --> 00:42:59,250
Hmm, well done.

893
00:43:03,157 --> 00:43:05,242
How was your day, Daddy?

894
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:10,789
It's the best day I had
in a long time.
