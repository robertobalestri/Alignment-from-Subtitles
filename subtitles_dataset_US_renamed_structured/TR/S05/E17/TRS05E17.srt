<font color="#fffc00">"The Resident"...</font>

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,085
Good morning. These are the interns
I told you about.

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:05,492
I'm Zach, Primary Care.

4
00:00:05,577 --> 00:00:07,039
Let's get started,
shall we?

5
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:08,617
Listen, I'm not a man

6
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:10,297
that you'll find
in Child's Pose,

7
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:11,938
so I'm just gonna be
on my way to...

8
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,930
AJ, I happen to know
from personal experience

9
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,485
that you could really benefit
from a little extra flexibility.

10
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,867
All right, come lie down

11
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,727
and grab a mat.

12
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:20,266
I don't know if I want kids.

13
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:21,547
At least not right now.

14
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:23,664
What Padma wants
can help us both.

15
00:00:23,749 --> 00:00:26,063
I can give her the egg
she so desperately wants

16
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:28,445
so she can have a baby,
and at the same time

17
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,968
I can freeze some for us.

18
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,320
- What about him?
- This guy?

19
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:37,578
Yeah. He runs marathons,

20
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,078
plays the cello and,

21
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:43,710
Oh, Leela, look at that
chubby little face. Aww.

22
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:47,030
Well, I wish we could meet
"Tall & Talented" in person.

23
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:49,530
Or maybe see an adult photo,
not just a baby photo.

24
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:51,050
Well, then these anonymous
sperm donors

25
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,654
wouldn't be very anonymous,
would they?

26
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:54,125
I just want the father
of your child

27
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:55,209
to be as amazing as you.

28
00:00:55,294 --> 00:00:57,749
My sister deserves
Grade A sperm.

29
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,651
Thank you for
doing this for me.

30
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,891
- What, you think I'm doing this for you?
- No.

31
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:04,149
I'm only giving you my egg
so I can be an auntie.

32
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:06,827
Well, you're gonna be
the best one.

33
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,210
- We should get to Chastain.
- Wait.

34
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,617
What about him?

35
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,351
- "The Right Stuff"?
- Yeah.

36
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:17,616
He loves yoga, travel
and Basquiat.

37
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:20,585
No markers for genetic disease.
And he's South Asian.

38
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:23,143
I think it's a sign.

39
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:25,796
Okay, well, why don't we
email the sperm bank

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,843
- and try to get a voice sample?
- Leel, he is the one, I can feel it.

41
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:31,155
No, no, you don't need
to decide right now.

42
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:34,226
- Padma, are you sure?
- I am.

43
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,923
"The Right Stuff" it is.

44
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:51,586
Sorry, I know how busy
you are.

45
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,105
Not a problem.
Happy to help.

46
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,267
Usually I'm texting you to do
something a bit more fun, huh?

47
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:56,977
Yeah.

48
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,094
It's probably just
a stomachache,

49
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:01,603
- but Gigi insisted that you check.
- Oh, did she?

50
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,963
I told Peter you fix
hurt tummies.

51
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,320
Hey, Peter, remember me?

52
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:06,509
Your Gigi's dad.

53
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,327
I am.
What's going on, buddy?

54
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:11,437
We were playing
super space, Daddy.

55
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:13,366
Yeah, these two can go all day.

56
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:15,999
He is the astronaut,
she is the alien.

57
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:17,781
Peter said he didn't
want to play,

58
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:20,218
but he always wants to play.

59
00:02:20,303 --> 00:02:22,367
I'm gonna place my hands
on your stomach

60
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:24,109
for a second, okay?

61
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:25,726
All right.

62
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:29,282
Peter's dad is on the way.

63
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:32,202
Have him meet me in the ER.

64
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:34,665
Do you like piggyback rides?

65
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:37,320
Yeah, I thought so.
Hop on.

66
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:38,883
Can I go with you, Daddy?

67
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:41,359
You wait here,
my little alien.

68
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,822
I'll come back soon and let you
know how Peter's doing.

69
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,073
Kids, we're going on
a field trip.

70
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:47,316
A rite of passage.

71
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,735
When I was a first year,
like you,

72
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:51,238
Dr. Hawkins took me,
and now it's your turn.

73
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:52,727
Our turn for what?

74
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,656
Since the start of your
intern year,

75
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,281
you've learned to become doctors
inside these walls,

76
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,594
and today you are going
outside Chastain

77
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,305
to treat one of the most
challenging patient populations.

78
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,429
A place you'll tackle
complex medical cases

79
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:07,937
that make great doctors.

80
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:10,077
Dr. Voss and Dr. Bell
will be joining us,

81
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,305
so let's get moving.

82
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,515
Where are we going?

83
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,131
Dr. Pravesh didn't tell you?

84
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:16,609
Let's not spoil the surprise.

85
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,046
Okay.

86
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:38,132
All right, here we are.

87
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:41,448
Shall we?

88
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,350
We got played.

89
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,570
Oh, my God, old folks?

92
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,859
All right, Mr. Astronaut,

93
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:08,854
can you tell me when
it started to hurt?

94
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,948
Does the pain move around
at all?

95
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,413
I'm okay now.

96
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:13,756
Is my dad coming?

97
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:15,616
Yeah, he's coming.

98
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:19,040
To take me home?
I don't want to go home.

99
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,015
Oh, you're not going home, hon.

100
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,136
You're gonna stay here with us
until we can

101
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,327
figure out why you're not
feeling so great.

102
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:27,654
- Hey, bud.
- Hey, Daddy.

103
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:28,806
Are you okay?
What's going on?

104
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,109
Hey, Spencer.
This is Nurse Hundley.

105
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,859
Spencer works in our IT
department.

106
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,293
Nice to meet you.

107
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,140
Peter has a stomachache.

108
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:39,196
Normally, that's not
a reason to be worried.

109
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,664
His temp's a little low.

110
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:42,514
It could be a sign of infection.

111
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,190
- Oh.
- He seemed fine this morning.

112
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:46,110
Said that he and Gigi were
going to space.

113
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:47,922
Has he been sick at all
in the past few weeks?

114
00:04:48,006 --> 00:04:49,712
Had a cold a few days ago,

115
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:51,399
but nothing out of the ordinary.

116
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:53,408
Any dietary changes
this morning?

117
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:56,911
I made him a smoothie,
um, as a treat.

118
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,496
Bananas, yogurt,
protein powder, juice.

119
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:01,741
I mean, we shared it.
I feel all right.

120
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:03,625
He won't tell us more
about his pain.

121
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,077
He keeps saying he's fine.

122
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:06,939
Well, I think because
he doesn't want to go home.

123
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:09,210
- Right?
- I'll go home

124
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:11,128
if you stay with me, Daddy.

125
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:16,185
I'll stay right here,
no matter what.

126
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,620
Okay, bud?

127
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,133
No matter what.

128
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:20,982
I'll get us ready
to draw labs.

129
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,860
I'm gonna step aside
for a second, okay?

130
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:25,107
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, sure.

131
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,921
We're good here, right, hon?

132
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:30,726
Uh...

133
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,647
he's got separation anxiety.

134
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:37,648
His mom left us both
three months ago.

135
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,445
She hasn't been back,
or even called.

136
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:43,359
New boyfriend, drug problem.

137
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,116
It's a long story.

138
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:50,391
I'm sorry to hear that.

139
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,894
Now Peter's afraid
you might disappear, too?

140
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,052
Yes.

141
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,154
He feels safe at Chastain
because

142
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,464
he knows that I work
in the building.

143
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:01,793
Well, separation anxiety
may be behind this.

144
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:03,598
It can cause stomach trouble.

145
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:05,313
Do some blood work,
run some tests,

146
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,957
and then we'll go from there,
all right?

147
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,911
<i>Dr. Milner to Emergency.</i>

148
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,621
<i>Dr. Milner to Emergency.</i>

149
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:22,377
There he is.

150
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:24,269
The Brookhaven resident
who happens to be

151
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:26,314
- one of my health care heroes.
- Dr. Kravitz?

152
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,456
Yes.

153
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:31,557
Just be aware he has early mild
cognitive impairment.

154
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,988
He remembers people and events
from the past perfectly,

155
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:35,511
but his short-term memory's
going.

156
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,137
Okay, got it.

157
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:42,292
- Dr. Kravitz.
- Kit. Lovely to see you.

158
00:06:42,377 --> 00:06:44,059
I did a gerontology rotation

159
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:46,112
with Dr. Kravitz
when I was a resident.

160
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,030
He was one of my finest
teachers.

161
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:50,308
This is Dr. Randolph Bell.

162
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:51,347
It's an honor.

163
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,208
You're a legend in the field
of geriatrics.

164
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,293
You know, your book,

165
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:56,034
<i>Compassionate
Care of the Elderly,</i>

166
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:58,027
has been on my shelf
for decades.

167
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:01,058
I-I'm sorry, your name again?

168
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:02,277
Randolph Bell.

169
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:03,449
Randolph, Randolph,
Randolph...

170
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:06,373
So do all your friends here
wheedle you for free care?

171
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,620
Oh, absolutely not.
We won't allow it.

172
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:11,712
Arthur here is fully retired.

173
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,957
He's earned the right to have
others care for him.

174
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:17,302
Gloria, darling, this is Kit,
and this-this is...

175
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,723
Well, there's no introduction
necessary, sweetie.

176
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:22,199
Everybody knows the famous
Dr. Randolph Bell.

177
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:24,409
She not only has my heart,

178
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:25,683
she is now my head.

179
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:27,574
In every way,
she takes care of me.

180
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:30,252
Well, it's mutual.

181
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,969
Well, it was nice of you
to come today.

182
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:33,304
You know, it can be
kind of hard to get

183
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:35,630
some of us old coots to get
our regular check-ups.

184
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,590
Well, we have an ulterior motive

185
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:39,613
for bringing some of
our interns here today.

186
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:42,002
We're hoping to inspire them
to join your field.

187
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,379
This country needs
more gerontologists,

188
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,552
and even some of
the best doctors

189
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:48,222
don't understand the particular
needs of senior citizens.

190
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:51,403
Geriatricians have higher
career satisfaction

191
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:53,706
than other medical specialties.

192
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,355
But the pay...
not what you get in surgery.

193
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,019
Would you consider talking
to some of our interns

194
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,855
about your career?

195
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,856
Let me at 'em.

196
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,528
Do you think
we'll still be that in love

197
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:10,917
when we're their age?

198
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,519
Why wouldn't we be?

199
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:20,520
Padma, now that you picked
a sperm donor,

200
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:22,388
we'll start Leela's daily
injections of hormones

201
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:24,418
to encourage her body
to produce more eggs

202
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:27,129
- than it does in a usual cycle.
- We're excited.

203
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,683
Me, too. We'll be monitoring you
with blood tests

204
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:31,101
and ultrasounds.

205
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:33,112
I read about this thing
called, uh,

206
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:36,011
- ovarian hyper-something.
- Hyperstim.

207
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:37,895
Yeah. Do we need
to worry about that?

208
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,476
No, not with regular monitoring
of my estradiol levels.

209
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:43,355
If they get too high,
we back off, lower the dose.

210
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,556
That question wasn't for me.

211
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,902
But you're right.
This is quite a safe process.

212
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,468
Okay, what can I do to help?

213
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:51,905
For now, nothing.
Not until we start you

214
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,649
on meds in a few weeks to
prepare for the embryo transfer.

215
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,577
- Okay.
- Okay?

216
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,069
Leela, I will walk you through
your first injection.

217
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,877
Um, I was thinking...

218
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,509
maybe I can do it.

219
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:04,693
You want to stick
a needle in me?

220
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,752
I just want to be
part of this

221
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,663
in every way that I can.

222
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:11,656
- You know.
- Of course.

223
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,259
I would like that, too.

224
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,590
Does our patient have
a visitor?

225
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:22,936
He does indeed.

226
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,262
- Gigi!
- Hi, Peter.

227
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:28,517
Ah, good friends are
good medicine.

228
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:30,018
All right, you two, behave.

229
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,269
I'm gonna chat with
your dad real quick.

230
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,939
Thought a fun distraction
for Peter could be good.

231
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,650
So his labs came back.

232
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:40,612
White blood cell count was
normal, no sign of infection.

233
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:43,205
Appendicitis, uh...
seems unlikely.

234
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:45,197
Maybe it's psychological.

235
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:47,783
You know,
he's been through a lot.

236
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:50,595
My gut's telling me
it's more than anxiety,

237
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,486
and I want to run
a few more tests.

238
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:53,681
What's up?

239
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,551
Did you fix his tummy, Daddy?

240
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,877
It's always his tummy.

241
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,759
What do you mean, "always,"
sweetheart?

242
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:01,408
It happened before?

243
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:03,967
How often does your
tummy hurt, Pete?

244
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,845
A whole lot of times.

245
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:09,463
Why didn't you tell me
anything, Pete?

246
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:12,318
- I don't understand.
- I didn't want to stay at home.

247
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,521
I wanted to come here,
with you.

248
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:18,890
I'll never leave you, okay?

249
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,285
I'll never leave you.

250
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,822
Do you understand?

251
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,542
Daddy, there's something else.

252
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,911
It's weird, but maybe
I should tell you.

253
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:31,828
This morning,
Peter and I were playing

254
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,840
that we were on another planet.

255
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,084
He kept saying that
I had two heads.

256
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,168
Yeah, you told me that.
Pretending.

257
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,928
No, he meant it.

258
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:44,141
He said I really<i> was</i>
a space alien.

259
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,173
Peter, does anyone else
have two heads?

260
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:54,002
That nurse lady and you,

261
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,592
kind of.

262
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:59,189
Double vision. How many fingers
am I holding up?

263
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:03,786
- What's going on?
- This could be neurological.

264
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,497
We need to get him to CT.

265
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,103
So this woman, who is 83,
kept chickens.

266
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:14,204
And she loved her chickens.

267
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:15,957
She named each one of them.

268
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,543
The-the first day I spent
with her, she gave me eggs.

269
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,121
Anyway, she had a problem
with worsening anemia.

270
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,457
Fatigue, muscle weakness,
intestinal problems.

271
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:30,887
She started forgetting things
and... falling.

272
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,965
Now, any ideas what was
wrong with her?

273
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,560
Likely more than one thing.

274
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:39,981
Alzheimer's,
and possibly cancer?

275
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,639
Or a recent stroke.

276
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,066
I'll give you a hint.

277
00:11:43,218 --> 00:11:45,245
The key was the chickens.

278
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,071
People who name their chickens
don't eat them.

279
00:11:48,223 --> 00:11:50,557
Exactly. He's smart.

280
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,000
You-you could be
a gerontologist.

281
00:11:52,152 --> 00:11:53,502
I don't get it.

282
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:56,590
Okay, it's a B12 deficiency,
common with age.

283
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,092
Learned that from
Dr. Kravitz's book.

284
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:04,406
So I'm guessing that
the patient was a... vegan,

285
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:06,433
because she gave away the eggs.

286
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,925
Bingo.

287
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,344
The woman's vegan diet
was a good choice

288
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:14,582
because it reduced her risk
of heart disease,

289
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,313
Type 2 diabetes,
certain cancers.

290
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:18,890
But she forgot to supplement
with B12,

291
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:21,282
which was the source of
all of her symptoms.

292
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:24,925
This is why gerontology is
a great profession.

293
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,287
You spend time with patients.

294
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,789
You talk with them, you get
to know the whole person,

295
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,708
all the while keeping your eye
on the big picture.

296
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:35,043
Which is the key to diagnosis.

297
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:38,187
Oh! My lady awaits.

298
00:12:38,406 --> 00:12:42,031
And I see that they have put out
snacks, and I am peckish.

299
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,291
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, Dr. Kravitz.

300
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,050
Hi, sweetie.

301
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:51,735
Hey, maybe gerontology is
an aphrodisiac.

302
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,079
This old goat has
the prettiest lady in the place,

303
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,078
and I have not had a date
ince high school.

304
00:12:56,163 --> 00:12:58,602
- Oh...
- No, no, I'm kidding.

305
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,289
Gloria!

306
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:02,718
Her pulse is thready.

307
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:04,157
Call 911.
Let's get her to Chastain.

308
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,977
Somebody grab these pills.
To take with us.

309
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:07,942
We're gonna need to know
what she's been taking.

310
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:16,297
I don't understand.
Are you telling me I fainted?

311
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:17,365
Yes.

312
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,118
And they're going to
figure out why.

313
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:21,274
I was probably just
dehydrated.

314
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:23,243
I didn't ruin your event,
did I?

315
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:24,834
No, we were winding down
anyway.

316
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,411
You added the drama.

317
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:28,845
The good news is,
your wrist isn't broken.

318
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,867
You just need a splint.

319
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:32,220
And your EKG and your labs
look normal.

320
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:34,407
So how did you feel
right before you passed out?

321
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:36,867
I got dizzy.
A little lightheaded.

322
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:39,696
A-A drop in blood pressure.
It's not uncommon

323
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:41,443
among women on
blood pressure meds.

324
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:42,828
But she's-she's not on any.

325
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:45,288
Oh, well, yes, I am, dear.

326
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,459
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

327
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,537
Why didn't you tell me?

328
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,862
I did.

329
00:13:53,742 --> 00:13:55,699
Let's start here.

330
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:58,211
My thought exactly.

331
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:01,274
<i>Houston to Rocket Nine Niner,</i>

332
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:02,631
<i>do you read me?</i>

333
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:05,774
<i>Copy, Rocket Nine Niner.</i>

334
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,899
<i>Please keep your hands
and arms</i>

335
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:09,617
<i>inside the spacecraft.</i>

336
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:11,509
<i>We are go for liftoff.</i>

337
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:14,643
Over and out.

338
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:18,891
Was that for him
or for you?

339
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:21,057
A little bit of both.

340
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:23,301
I'm worried about him.

341
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,790
If Peter's abdominal issues
are caused by

342
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,320
a neurological one, we could be
looking at a bleed.

343
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:37,734
I don't see one.

344
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,687
No evidence of a stroke, either.

345
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:44,164
But his ventricles are
a little...

346
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:46,422
Too little.

347
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,220
His brain is swelling.

348
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:54,385
Now, if we don't figure out why
and the swelling worsens,

349
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:56,635
I'll have to perform
a craniectomy to relieve the pressure.

350
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,642
Cutting a six-year-old's head
open on an "if."

351
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:00,549
Of course not, but if things
move south quickly,

352
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,057
we have to be ready
to move to the OR.

353
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:04,002
Fine, but let's keep in mind
the risks aren't just

354
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:05,392
bleeding and infection.

355
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:06,830
There could be permanent
brain damage.

356
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:09,857
We need to figure out how
to avoid surgery altogether.

357
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:12,712
Let's start Peter on meds
to lower the pressure

358
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:14,009
on his brain immediately,

359
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:15,735
hope they work
and move him to ICU.

360
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,931
Yes, that sounds like a plan.

361
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,785
Well, why didn't you tell me
you were taking all of these?

362
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:23,587
Oh, I did, dear.

363
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,392
Every time I added
a medication.

364
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:28,032
But you can't be expected
to remember all these.

365
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:30,078
I-I forgot all of them.

366
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,477
Multiple medications,
called polypharmacy,

367
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:35,352
is associated with
adverse outcomes,

368
00:15:35,437 --> 00:15:37,665
particularly as we age.
They interact,

369
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,774
causing falls, drug reactions,

370
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:42,109
and can even lead
to increased mortality.

371
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:44,368
It all started with
the arthritis.

372
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:46,595
The ibuprofen wasn't
doing anything,

373
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,343
so a doctor put me on
prednisone.

374
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,570
Well, that gave me heartburn,

375
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:53,335
so he gave me omeprazole.

376
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,249
But then that
made me nauseous,

377
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:58,273
so they added ondansetron
for my stomach.

378
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,601
That made my heart flutter,
so they gave me metoprolol,

379
00:16:01,686 --> 00:16:03,312
and then my legs started
to swell,

380
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,116
so they gave me furosemide,
and that's when

381
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:06,773
I stopped walking very much,

382
00:16:06,858 --> 00:16:10,537
and, uh, my blood pressure
shot up, so they...

383
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:11,859
Should I keep going?

384
00:16:11,944 --> 00:16:12,904
<i>...practitioner
to the ER, please.</i>

385
00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:14,959
<i>Nurse practitioner to the ER.</i>

386
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,160
Double shift?

387
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:23,663
Actually, I'm just starting.

388
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:25,858
Been having
a hard time sleeping.

389
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:28,537
- Oh, that sucks.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

390
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:33,506
Oh, um, Leela told me
about your mother.

391
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:35,137
How is she?

392
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,124
Sorry, it's...
it's none of my business.

393
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,931
No, it isn't.

394
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:42,124
But it's nice of you to ask.

395
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:44,662
She just moved in with me
on Saturday.

396
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,202
It's been good
having her close.

397
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:48,607
And how are you?

398
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:51,272
Well, I'm trying
to resist the urge

399
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:53,405
to check my home security camera
every five minutes

400
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,733
to see how she's doing.

401
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:58,326
Okay, well, actually,
I'm not resisting.

402
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:01,810
Would you look at this woman?
She's out there gardening.

403
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:03,507
Are those rhododendrons?

404
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:07,154
A little pink for my taste,
but she loves them.

405
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:11,294
I'm leading a meditation
at 3:00.

406
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:14,614
- Join us.
- Maybe I will.

407
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,537
- So, how are you?
- Great.

408
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,422
I just injected my sister
with hormones

409
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:21,608
so she can donate her eggs to me

410
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,525
and I can be a mom.
Hmm!

411
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:26,956
Oh, wear something comfortable.

412
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:35,715
So they put her on
hydrochlorothiazide...

413
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:37,591
And that made Gloria
feel fatigued.

414
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:39,353
So they gave her
methylphenidate.

415
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:41,139
Which could have had
a negative interaction

416
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:43,530
with the linezolid that she
was taking for that cellulitis.

417
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:46,124
Or the zolpidem or quetiapine,

418
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:48,060
which Gloria was also on.

419
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:54,605
What are we even doing,
Dr. Pravesh?

420
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,114
We're looking into
all contraindications.

421
00:17:57,199 --> 00:18:00,272
But she is a sick older lady
who needs these drugs.

422
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:02,678
Like, which do you even stop?

423
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:04,243
We move carefully,

424
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:07,560
removing one by one.

425
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,448
No.

426
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:14,495
This is over my head
and, honestly, kind of boring.

427
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,138
I need to find a surgery
to observe.

428
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:19,584
I thought you were going into
primary care.

429
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:21,591
No. I want to be a surgeon.

430
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:23,389
It's exciting,
and you fix problems

431
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:26,173
that are actually fixable,
not buff up old people

432
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:27,091
until they die.

433
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:28,856
You don't think people die
on the OR table?

434
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:30,881
They do all the time.

435
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:32,496
Not everything is fixable
with a knife.

436
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:33,524
You get that, right?

437
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:35,332
You can fix things
with your brain.

438
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,076
Excuse me, have you met me?

439
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:38,789
I read that surgeons
don't actually have

440
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:42,351
the highest IQ, and I thought,
there, that's my specialty.

441
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:43,436
Hmm.

442
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:45,201
This woman needs us,

443
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:48,195
and Dr. Kravitz needs her.

444
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,717
So if you're not interested,
I say go hunt down Dr. Austin

445
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:53,700
and see if he'll let you
into his OR.

446
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,795
But be aware that
he will not consider it

447
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,855
for one nanosecond

448
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:01,175
when I tell him
you deserted this patient.

449
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:09,693
Okay, I will stay.

450
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:13,287
But don't tell him about
that IQ thing, either.

451
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:19,795
I want to go with him.

452
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,963
You can't, honey.
He needs special care

453
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:23,404
in a special part
of the hospital.

454
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:25,740
You mean he's really sick?

455
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,166
You fix people.

456
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:31,253
- You'll fix him, can't you, Daddy?
- Spencer.

457
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:33,749
I'll be right there.

458
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:38,889
What's happening?
His daddy is scared.

459
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:41,107
You have to save Peter.

460
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,123
I got him.

461
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,927
I got him, I promise.

462
00:19:54,718 --> 00:19:56,232
He seems much worse.

463
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:58,506
Please tell me
you have some news.

464
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:00,194
We gave him another round
of meds

465
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,869
to lower
the intracranial pressure,

466
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:05,622
but it'll take time...
if it works.

467
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:10,639
He was hurting,
and I totally missed it.

468
00:20:11,947 --> 00:20:14,999
I get guilt, believe me,
but it is not earned here.

469
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:22,074
Help him. Please.

470
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,434
We're doing everything we can.

471
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:26,719
Uh, just...

472
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:29,639
I don't want anybody
cutting his head open.

473
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:30,974
Not if we can avoid it.

474
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:32,725
Understood.

475
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,528
You all right?

476
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:43,310
Now<i> I</i> feel guilty,
about how lucky I am

477
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:44,837
not to be in Spencer's shoes.

478
00:20:44,936 --> 00:20:46,359
Peter has to make it
through this.

479
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:48,732
- I know.
- And Gigi, she lost her mother.

480
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:49,734
She can't lose her best friend.

481
00:20:49,818 --> 00:20:50,894
We have to make sure
they both come

482
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:52,145
out of this.

483
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,230
Uh, Dr. Hawkins!

484
00:20:57,067 --> 00:21:00,920
Vomiting means his intracranial
pressure must be rising.

485
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:04,656
I'm a little confused.

486
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,466
- I'm sorry.
- So the metoprolol

487
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:07,427
helped your heart,

488
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:08,929
but it also lowered
your blood pressure.

489
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:10,589
And with all the water pills
you were on,

490
00:21:10,673 --> 00:21:12,505
plus the stimulants,
your heart rate sped

491
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,989
and BP lowered, which caused you
to lose consciousness.

492
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,919
Other doctors have been
telling me

493
00:21:17,004 --> 00:21:19,357
that these meds are saving
my life, and you're telling me

494
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:21,778
- the opposite?
- No, just listen to them, hon.

495
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,707
They want to take you off
medications you may not need,

496
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:26,688
and-and keep you on
ones that are working.

497
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:28,411
But we'd like to keep you here

498
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,021
to monitor you
while we do it.

499
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:33,028
But it's just for a day,
and then, um, you'll go home.

500
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,942
- There's hope for him yet.
- Mm.

501
00:21:36,182 --> 00:21:37,708
Thank you both.

502
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:40,367
We've given Peter
the maximum doses,

503
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:42,877
but he's... he's not improving.

504
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,779
Well, time to book an OR.

505
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:47,669
No, let's just...

506
00:21:47,754 --> 00:21:49,215
...start with a drain

507
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,359
before you open his head.

508
00:21:54,017 --> 00:21:55,746
Okay, we can try it.

509
00:21:57,293 --> 00:21:58,887
I'll get an EVD monitor.

510
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,223
- Talk to me.
- We're putting in a drain.

511
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,809
It should help relieve
the pressure on his brain.

512
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,369
It's a first step.

513
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:16,676
I don't know how much longer
we can put off a craniectomy.

514
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:19,941
It's my son.

515
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:26,247
Let's take everything
one step at a time.

516
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:30,185
Right now, we need to sedate
and intubate,

517
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,170
and to protect his airway.

518
00:22:32,754 --> 00:22:36,121
I have to talk to him first,
before you, before you...

519
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,934
Of course.
Of course.

520
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:49,098
Hey, bud.

521
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:53,324
I just want you to know...

522
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:58,622
I want you to know that
every second that you're asleep,

523
00:22:59,114 --> 00:23:01,458
I'm gonna be
right here beside you.

524
00:23:02,184 --> 00:23:03,959
Deal?

525
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,532
Okay.

526
00:23:28,385 --> 00:23:30,235
Hey, there she is.

527
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:32,543
So, how'd it go this morning?

528
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:36,891
The hormone shot was fine,
but this is not. Look.

529
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,950
Padma picked a donor,
but I did a little bit

530
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:40,341
of digging
into this sperm bank.

531
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:42,583
It's facing three lawsuits
from families who claim

532
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:44,491
their donors misrepresented
themselves.

533
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:46,458
In one case,
the family alleged

534
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:48,232
that the donor had
an undisclosed history

535
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:50,224
of schizophrenia.
In another,

536
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:51,750
a donor covered up
a criminal record.

537
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,586
Some claim college degrees
when they're really dropouts.

538
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:56,645
These families were lied to.

539
00:23:56,754 --> 00:23:59,794
Yes. About the biggest decision
they'll ever make.

540
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:02,177
The genes their kids
will share with its father.

541
00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:04,246
Yeah, but, I mean,
this is just

542
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,271
a few cases
out of how many, right?

543
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:07,888
I mean, I had a lot of friends

544
00:24:07,973 --> 00:24:09,608
in med school who donated.
They were good guys,

545
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:11,497
they just needed cash;
They wanted to help.

546
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:12,911
Is this your way of saying

547
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:14,675
there are little Devons
out there?

548
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:18,294
If it helps, every single one
of these donors

549
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:19,927
had to undergo genetic testing.

550
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:22,654
There is no test to show whether
you're a pathological liar,

551
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,669
have a mental illness
or a criminal record.

552
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,444
- And you're missing the point.
- No, I get it.

553
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:27,958
Sperm banks are unregulated.

554
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:30,185
The FDA requires
that donors are tested

555
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,590
for infectious diseases,
but beyond that, nothing.

556
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:34,231
Their bios aren't even verified.

557
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:35,573
That may work for some people.

558
00:24:35,658 --> 00:24:37,569
There are amazing kids out there
from anonymous donors,

559
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:38,848
but that won't work for me.

560
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:40,248
- This is my egg.
- Hey, babe...

561
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,746
You have to accept
that this is Padma's choice.

562
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,886
Well, I need to make sure
she knows what she's choosing.

563
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,012
We'll talk later, okay?

564
00:24:59,692 --> 00:25:01,458
- Are you hot or cold?
- Both.

565
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:02,756
Okay, don't worry,
we're gonna help you.

566
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,356
She's in A-fib and hypotensive.

567
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:06,435
A-fib could be because we took
her off metoprolol.

568
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,513
Let me check
if her pressure dropped

569
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:08,653
before she slipped
into arrhythmia.

570
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:10,397
I-I was here. Her BP started
to fall first,

571
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:11,645
then her heart rate spiked.

572
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,778
Peritonitis?

573
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:15,299
Gloria, tell me where it hurts.

574
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:17,777
- Rebound tenderness.
- This has nothing to do with the meds.

575
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:19,974
She has an acute abdomen
and she may need surgery.

576
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,418
Let's get her
four of morphine.

577
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:23,012
Hang pressors and page Bell.

578
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:25,481
Hey, hang in there, okay?

579
00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:33,020
Where to begin?

580
00:25:33,174 --> 00:25:35,600
Gloria has three lumbar
compression fractures

581
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:36,701
from osteoporosis.

582
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:39,275
And a hiatal hernia.
All incidental findings.

583
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,943
Consequence of living
for eight decades.

584
00:25:41,028 --> 00:25:43,957
So here's today's problem.
Colonic perforation.

585
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,282
No wonder she was
in so much pain.

586
00:25:45,366 --> 00:25:46,966
And no idea what caused this?

587
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:48,387
It couldn't have been
the fall.

588
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:50,170
We thought she passed out
from too many meds,

589
00:25:50,254 --> 00:25:51,951
but something else was going on.
We just don't know what.

590
00:25:52,035 --> 00:25:54,614
Well, what we do know
is that without surgery,

591
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:55,715
Gloria won't make it.

592
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,744
You're talking about a surgery
that's dangerous at any age,

593
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,404
and with Gloria nearly 80...

594
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:03,193
Well, we'll be sure to be
very clear with her

595
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:04,574
about what we're facing here.

596
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:07,826
But I agree with you.
It's the only option.

597
00:26:08,497 --> 00:26:10,864
Okay. At least
she's in the best hands.

598
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:13,058
Well, I've had success
with patients older than her,

599
00:26:13,143 --> 00:26:14,244
much sicker.

600
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:16,612
I really hope she's one of them.

601
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:21,535
So you think "The Right Stuff"
is secretly

602
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,512
- some sort of axe murderer?
- No.

603
00:26:23,597 --> 00:26:24,582
I'm just saying we can't

604
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,731
- really be sure who he is.
- Okay, look,

605
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:29,233
I really appreciate
you being protective of me,

606
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:31,161
but there's no guarantees
with kids.

607
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:32,550
I mean, look at us.

608
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:33,981
What, there's
a one-in-a-million chance

609
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:35,080
of having twins?

610
00:26:35,232 --> 00:26:36,908
One in 250.

611
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:40,153
And we are proof that
a random genetic accident

612
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:42,168
can be the best gift ever.

613
00:26:42,402 --> 00:26:44,991
Look, I can't give up
on being a mother

614
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:45,999
just because there's risks.

615
00:26:46,093 --> 00:26:47,067
I don't want you to.

616
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:50,098
I just want you to be aware
of what those risks are.

617
00:26:50,668 --> 00:26:54,451
Which is why I asked
Dr. Nolan to join us.

618
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:55,620
What's up, ladies?

619
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:57,184
Show her what you showed me.

620
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:58,360
Oh.

621
00:27:01,364 --> 00:27:02,989
"Dream Doc"?

622
00:27:03,262 --> 00:27:04,716
I don't understand.

623
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:06,539
- It's him.
- It's me.

624
00:27:07,907 --> 00:27:09,342
You're six-foot five?

625
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:10,832
I do slouch some.

626
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,840
And fluent in French?

627
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:16,345
- Yeah.
<i>- Je suis</i> Rosetta Stone.

628
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:20,684
- Trombone prodigy?
- I got a standing ovation

629
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:22,193
at my ninth grade recital.

630
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,926
- Just think about it.
- Mm.

631
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:30,142
Think about what?

632
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:34,074
Surgery?
Sounds... dangerous.

633
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,318
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie to you.
It is.

634
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:40,062
But it is the only option.

635
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,692
And without it,
you may only have days.

636
00:27:44,691 --> 00:27:46,207
Maybe a week.

637
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:48,238
I'm sorry.

638
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,449
Y-You always say how

639
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:54,425
e-easy choices are
your favorite.

640
00:27:56,957 --> 00:27:59,423
I wish I could offer you
more time

641
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:01,160
to make this decision.

642
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,071
But the sooner you operate,

643
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:05,679
the better my chances are?

644
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:10,567
Well, then, I'm ready.

645
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,921
Arthur, I'm sure everybody
over at Brookhaven is worried.

646
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:16,942
You think maybe you could
go call them

647
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:20,239
- and fill them in?
- Oh, of course.

648
00:28:20,395 --> 00:28:21,833
Any-Anything, darling.

649
00:28:21,918 --> 00:28:24,192
Yes, Brookhaven.

650
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,779
Update, update Brookhaven.

651
00:28:25,864 --> 00:28:28,168
Update Brookhaven.

652
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,646
I can't leave him.

653
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:33,624
- He needs me.
- Oh, I...

654
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:35,393
I get it.

655
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:39,612
You have got to be better
than you have ever been.

656
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:43,025
Neither one of us
have children.

657
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:45,426
Not even siblings.

658
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:47,222
It's just the two of us.

659
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:49,466
He has no one else.

660
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:51,721
I have no one else.

661
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,606
Do you know what it's like
to find the love of your life

662
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:57,762
this late in the game?

663
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,379
Actually, I do.

664
00:29:01,395 --> 00:29:03,653
And when the day comes,

665
00:29:03,972 --> 00:29:05,934
and he forgets my name,

666
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:08,582
I won't even care.

667
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:12,997
I'll fill in that blank,
'cause he'll still love me.

668
00:29:13,922 --> 00:29:15,357
And I'll love him.

669
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:17,043
To the end.

670
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:20,809
Just don't let it be today.

671
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:24,635
Okay.

672
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:36,928
His intracranial pressure
is still rising,

673
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:38,930
and we're not sure
of the cause.

674
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:41,285
The MRI didn't show
any tumors

675
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,861
or blood clots in his brain.

676
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:45,195
So what does this mean?

677
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:47,013
That the drain wasn't enough.

678
00:29:47,107 --> 00:29:49,107
Mr. Shafer,
we have no choice but to

679
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,360
proceed with the craniectomy

680
00:29:50,444 --> 00:29:52,044
to relieve the pressure
in Peter's brain.

681
00:29:52,221 --> 00:29:53,855
My God.

682
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:57,616
I can't believe
this is happening.

683
00:29:57,768 --> 00:29:59,785
There must be something else
you can do.

684
00:29:59,937 --> 00:30:03,288
If we wait any longer,
he's at risk of brain damage.

685
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,074
Treat him like he's your child.

686
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:10,345
Would you agree to this
if it was Gigi?

687
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:16,560
Spencer, give us a minute
to review.

688
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:23,393
- Tell me there's another option.
- There isn't.

689
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:25,402
What he just said in there
won't help Peter.

690
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:28,231
Keeping your objectivity will.
You have to.

691
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:29,658
I'm sorry to interrupt,

692
00:30:29,742 --> 00:30:31,742
but the preschool's been trying
to get in touch.

693
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:33,994
Gigi needs you.

694
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,303
Do what you have to do
to reduce the swelling.

695
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:50,771
Hey. She's been like this

696
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:52,318
since Peter left
this morning.

697
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:54,681
She won't eat or talk.

698
00:30:55,818 --> 00:30:58,202
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

699
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:06,777
What is that?

700
00:31:06,928 --> 00:31:09,354
A space helmet for Peter.

701
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:13,283
If he goes into space,
he can't die.

702
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:18,288
Is he gonna die, like Mommy?

703
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:30,426
I'm fighting for Peter.

704
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:33,775
- I'm scared.
- I know. That's okay.

705
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:35,872
I knew he was sick when

706
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:38,161
he didn't want to eat
my sandwich.

707
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:41,454
We trade. He always
eats my sandwich.

708
00:31:41,538 --> 00:31:44,380
When his mommy left,
his daddy started

709
00:31:44,465 --> 00:31:47,569
making his lunch
with roast beef.

710
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,895
After he ate it all,
his tummy started hurting.

711
00:31:57,646 --> 00:31:59,496
Did he eat your sandwich
this morning?

712
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:01,498
No, Daddy.

713
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:10,966
Craniotome to me.

714
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:18,528
I've done this a hundred times,
but rarely on a child.

715
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:21,346
You're more than qualified.

716
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,081
Watch for bleeding,
be gentle.

717
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:29,092
When I pass through bone,
I stop.

718
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:32,596
Now, let's get started.

719
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:35,106
Wait!

720
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,137
I think Peter has
urea cycle disorder.

721
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:39,560
It's a genetic enzyme deficiency
that makes it hard

722
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:40,858
for people to break down
protein.

723
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:43,747
Whenever Spencer packs his son
roast beef, he trades it away

724
00:32:43,832 --> 00:32:45,380
because it makes
his stomach hurt.

725
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,445
I think sharing his dad's
protein shake this morning

726
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:48,982
gave him more protein
than he could process,

727
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:51,037
and his body was already under
stress from his recent cold.

728
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:53,482
Talk about a zebra.
Urea cycle is extremely rare.

729
00:32:53,567 --> 00:32:54,975
But it would explain
all the symptoms.

730
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:56,466
Let's get him back
to the ICU,

731
00:32:56,551 --> 00:32:58,693
start him on dialysis,
clear the ammonia.

732
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:00,209
Yeah, but do we have
that kind of time?

733
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:01,967
The odds you're right
are vanishingly small,

734
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:03,287
and if you're wrong,
this boy's brain

735
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:04,146
continues to swell,

736
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,059
which will cause him
permanent damage.

737
00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:08,935
We need to operate now.

738
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,724
A craniectomy is a gamble, too.

739
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:12,404
At the rate the swelling
is worsening,

740
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:15,083
best-case scenario, what,
it buys Peter days?

741
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:16,823
It doesn't fix the problem.

742
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:18,408
That is true.

743
00:33:20,942 --> 00:33:22,654
So let's do both.

744
00:33:23,145 --> 00:33:26,293
Dialysis right here.
We can watch his ICP.

745
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:28,088
If it doesn't drop,
I'm ready to

746
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,573
start a crani immediately.

747
00:33:40,415 --> 00:33:42,746
I'll be right here
when you wake up.

748
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,481
Okay, this is as far
as you can go.

749
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:56,672
I love you.

750
00:33:57,957 --> 00:33:59,950
I love you more.

751
00:34:05,106 --> 00:34:06,581
Okay.

752
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,418
Wire, please.

753
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:33,688
Dilator.

754
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:40,657
All right, we're almost there.

755
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:43,403
All right, catheter in.

756
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:45,862
If you're right,
the pressure should trend down

757
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:47,412
once the proteins are
filtered out.

758
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:49,564
Yeah, well, it's not gonna
happen immediately.

759
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,668
If that number doesn't
come down soon, I start.

760
00:34:57,676 --> 00:34:59,977
Whether I want to or not.

761
00:35:02,654 --> 00:35:05,215
We're working through
some unexpected adhesions.

762
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,726
Did Gloria mention anything
about prior surgeries?

763
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:10,099
<i>None. Any sign
of the perforation?</i>

764
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:11,427
Running the bowel now.

765
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:14,137
There's no sign of
widespread ischemia.

766
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:15,317
Oh, there it is.

767
00:35:15,402 --> 00:35:16,341
Can you repair it?

768
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:17,995
Well, the surrounding bowel
is thickened

769
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,559
with extensive lymphadenopathy.

770
00:35:21,777 --> 00:35:23,231
It sounds like
whatever's going on

771
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:24,652
caused significant inflammation.

772
00:35:25,078 --> 00:35:27,130
I should be able
to repair the perf,

773
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:29,067
but, you know,
this didn't happen overnight.

774
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,483
It's been going on for years.

775
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:33,002
Bowel inflammation is
extremely painful.

776
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:35,582
Her daily steroids
must have been masking it.

777
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,035
See the big picture.

778
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:41,442
Dr. Kravitz told me
in geriatrics

779
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:43,854
you always gotta keep your eye
on the big picture.

780
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:46,263
What if the arthritis
and the bowel inflammation

781
00:35:46,348 --> 00:35:47,834
are all part of the same
disease process?

782
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:50,152
It's possible.

783
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:53,104
If the side effects
of her medications

784
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:57,108
were actually symptoms of
the underlying issue.

785
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:00,445
We've been looking at this
all wrong.

786
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:02,852
Let's get back
to Gloria's prescriptions

787
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:04,283
and see if we can't
get her some answers

788
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,158
when she wakes up.

789
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:10,977
It just keeps rising.

790
00:36:11,157 --> 00:36:12,361
Can we dialyze faster?

791
00:36:12,446 --> 00:36:14,711
Any faster and his neurons
could shear from diffusion.

792
00:36:14,795 --> 00:36:15,618
Just give it a minute.

793
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:17,323
Conrad, this is the brain.
A minute can be

794
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:18,541
the difference between
life and death.

795
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:19,784
Just give me one more minute.

796
00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:21,017
We don't have
good choices here.

797
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:24,157
- Billie, we're on the same side.
- But this is my OR.

798
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:37,991
- It dropped.
- Wait, Dr. Sutton.

799
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:40,954
That number's still
dangerously high.

800
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,636
It worked.

801
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:03,266
You ready to close?

802
00:37:04,328 --> 00:37:06,500
Sure am.

803
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:15,226
Focus on that still space

804
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,742
between our inhale

805
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,180
and our exhale.

806
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:24,450
Please remember
to silence your devices

807
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,070
before we begin the class.

808
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,070
- I seem to have gotten turned around.
- Okay.

809
00:37:55,154 --> 00:37:56,586
My wife is in surgery.

810
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:58,429
Can you direct me
to the waiting room?

811
00:37:58,575 --> 00:38:01,042
Uh, here, let me show you.

812
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,175
The cavalry has arrived.

813
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,075
77-year-old woman
with a bowel perf.

814
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,083
Pressure started tanking.

815
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:09,341
At first I thought
it was peritonitis,

816
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:10,707
then I saw her neck.

817
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,519
I need ultrasound now.

818
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:14,373
Any idea why
she might be in tamponade?

819
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:15,924
No idea what the underlying
issue is.

820
00:38:16,008 --> 00:38:18,233
Right now, we just need
to get her off the table.

821
00:38:18,325 --> 00:38:20,260
Start another epi
and bolus a liter.

822
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:22,754
There's fluid around her heart.
We need to prep her

823
00:38:22,848 --> 00:38:24,088
for pericardiocentesis.

824
00:38:24,183 --> 00:38:25,849
Okay, I'll finish up
so I can assist.

825
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,506
All right, but if
she doesn't stabilize, Bell,

826
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,661
I'm gonna have
to crack her chest open.

827
00:38:28,745 --> 00:38:31,146
Oh, God, let's hope not.

828
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:46,981
Oh, man, I can't wait
to tell 'em.

829
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:48,520
Hey, we figured it out.

830
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:50,427
Gloria's medications
didn't cause her problems,

831
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:51,826
but they masked
an underlying one:

832
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,128
Whipple's disease.

833
00:38:53,212 --> 00:38:55,371
That's what caused her
arthritis, weight loss, fatigue.

834
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:57,697
And steroids that her doctors
first thought was arthritis

835
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,031
only made it worse.

836
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,792
She told us that
they increased her dose,

837
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:01,985
leading to the perf.

838
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,646
Now all Gloria needs
is an antibiotic.

839
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,730
We can take her off of

840
00:39:04,872 --> 00:39:06,716
- almost everything else.
- She didn't make it.

841
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:10,097
- I'm sorry.
- What? She...

842
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:12,878
She developed cardiac tamponade,

843
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:15,290
which was probably
the final complication

844
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:16,809
of her undiagnosed Whipple.

845
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,477
And Austin was working to place
a pericardial drain

846
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:21,395
when she coded.

847
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,906
We did five rounds of CPR.

848
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:26,552
More than I should have
on a woman her age.

849
00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:27,902
It was a tough one.

850
00:39:27,987 --> 00:39:30,145
Now, if she'd been
treated properly,

851
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,755
or if she'd gotten
to us sooner,

852
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,169
maybe we could have
done something

853
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:35,985
to turn it around.
But today...

854
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:38,321
it was just far too late.

855
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:42,207
Dr. Kravitz...

856
00:39:44,746 --> 00:39:46,355
Kit is his friend,

857
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:49,470
so I will call her
to tell him.

858
00:40:00,435 --> 00:40:03,114
Even if we had
diagnosed her sooner,

859
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,856
Gloria's disease began
years ago.

860
00:40:05,008 --> 00:40:06,668
There's nothing
we could have done.

861
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:10,004
Gloria wasn't just another
fragile old lady.

862
00:40:10,168 --> 00:40:13,403
She was strong, in love.

863
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:15,458
She deserved more time.

864
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,652
But every doctor looked at her
like just another lost cause.

865
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:22,441
No one cared enough to see

866
00:40:22,597 --> 00:40:24,144
that by just treating
her symptoms,

867
00:40:24,229 --> 00:40:26,505
they were actually
making her worse.

868
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:35,312
No one saw the bigger picture
until you did.

869
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,152
Reconsider going into
gerontology, Zach.

870
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:43,040
You may have a gift.

871
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:07,262
I am so sorry.

872
00:41:07,808 --> 00:41:09,414
I'm so sorry.

873
00:41:29,308 --> 00:41:31,259
Look what I made you.

874
00:41:31,352 --> 00:41:32,675
Wow!

875
00:41:32,902 --> 00:41:34,160
Hey.

876
00:41:34,245 --> 00:41:37,520
So we'll continue dialysis until
we lower his ammonia levels,

877
00:41:37,605 --> 00:41:40,268
but with some attention
and lifestyle modifications

878
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:41,378
we can manage this.

879
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:43,107
You will need to look out
for any signs that

880
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:44,348
his ammonia levels are up.

881
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:46,419
Sluggishness, nausea, vomiting.

882
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,911
Avoid extreme temps.

883
00:41:47,996 --> 00:41:50,053
Keep him hydrated and
on a low-protein diet.

884
00:41:50,138 --> 00:41:52,498
No more roast beef sandwiches.

885
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:55,002
He'll do great.

886
00:41:55,227 --> 00:41:57,376
I can't thank you enough.

887
00:41:57,706 --> 00:42:00,275
Well, we did have help.

888
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:01,789
How would you two
like a surprise?

889
00:42:02,074 --> 00:42:05,068
What is it, Daddy?
What is it?

890
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:15,419
Wow!

891
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,161
It's beautiful.

892
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,544
Nolan as a sperm donor?
Our Nolan?

893
00:42:35,668 --> 00:42:37,090
- Yep.
- Ooh.

894
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:40,114
- That put the fear of God in me.
- Yeah, I bet.

895
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,533
But the eggs are gonna be
retrieved in about two weeks,

896
00:42:42,618 --> 00:42:45,118
which means I need a volunteer,
fast.

897
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:47,918
Someone I trust,
someone I care about.

898
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:49,411
What are you gonna do?

899
00:42:49,496 --> 00:42:53,164
Actually, um,
I had a crazy idea.

900
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:54,465
You and I are good friends,

901
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,035
now that we aren't lovers,
and I wouldn't mind

902
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,504
a kid a lot like you.

903
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,036
You could do worse.

904
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:04,105
So what if I did...

905
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:07,730
have a kid
just like you?

906
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,682
You want me to be
your sperm donor?
