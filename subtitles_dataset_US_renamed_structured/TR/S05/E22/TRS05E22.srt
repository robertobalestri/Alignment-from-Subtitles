1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:03,810
Previously on The Resident...
Randolph Bell.

2
00:00:04,454 --> 00:00:06,668
Will you marry me? Thank God.

3
00:00:08,264 --> 00:00:09,951
Because I can't return this.

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,427
Are you in love with Cade?

5
00:00:11,452 --> 00:00:13,447
All I know is that
whatever I feel

6
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:16,291
only goes so far, and
then the walls come up.

7
00:00:16,492 --> 00:00:18,403
Maybe you just
need a little push.

8
00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:20,290
It's like
he wants to relive

9
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:22,434
what happened to Nic
and rewrite the ending.

10
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:24,383
I wish we could
rewrite our ending.

11
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:25,408
Your father's here.

12
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:27,244
Just flew in from Seattle.

13
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:37,802
Hey, Molly. Look at you,
getting out of here.

14
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:39,730
Yep. Thanks for all the
fun books, Doc Sullivan.

15
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:42,151
- How's your daughter?
- On the mend at last.

16
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:48,138
Morris, what's happening?

17
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:49,902
Just you, Doc.
Rocking that suit.

18
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:52,510
Laura, good morning.

19
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:54,342
- Morning, Doc.
- Has anyone ever told you

20
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:55,829
you look like Sophia Loren?

21
00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:59,611
- Only you. But that's okay.
- Ah.

22
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:01,513
I got this twinge
driving me crazy.

23
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:02,575
I think I pulled a muscle

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,783
playing a ferocious
pickleball game.

25
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:06,852
You think maybe you could
find me a muscle relaxer?

26
00:01:06,876 --> 00:01:08,354
Uh, you know I can't do that.

27
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:10,723
But I've got some ibuprofen in
my purse if you would like...

28
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:12,124
Gives me a stomachache.

29
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:14,558
I'll get a massage later,
tough it out till then.

30
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:21,688
Good morning, love.
How we feeling today?

31
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:25,671
Hi, Dad. Conrad's just
finishing up his examination.

32
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,483
- What's the good word, Dr. Hawkins?
- Hey.

33
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,809
CBC and 'lytes are stable,

34
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,277
one low-grade fever
controlled with meds

35
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,402
and you are getting
your color back.

36
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:36,276
She's doing really well.

37
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:38,717
Next step, get her out
of bed, up and moving.

38
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,648
She's just being
a little stubborn.

39
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:41,741
Hmm.

40
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,719
I think I know what
that problem is.

41
00:01:44,827 --> 00:01:47,172
There's no longer a
guard outside the door.

42
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,229
I know they caught the
men who tried to kill me.

43
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:52,031
I understand, intellectually,

44
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:55,367
but I just, I don't
want to leave this room.

45
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:57,503
Totally normal PTSD.

46
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,004
You'll beat it.

47
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:02,041
I miss that feisty girl with
the chip on her shoulder.

48
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:04,777
Yeah.

49
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,647
I'd love to see you do a
walk around the unit today.

50
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:11,350
With a walker, someone by your
side to make you feel safe.

51
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:12,985
Come on, Cade. You and me.

52
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,987
Once around the unit,
like when you were a kid.

53
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:16,069
Even better.

54
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:19,758
Don't get me wrong, I'm
loving the attention,

55
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:21,832
but who are you again?

56
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,990
I practically raised myself.

57
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:28,000
This guy was always
at the hospital.

58
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,135
- And now...
- You're his patient.

59
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,205
- Bingo.
- Who doesn't love being psychoanalyzed

60
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,841
by two totally
unqualified people?

61
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:38,853
A gift. To soothe your belly.

62
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:42,347
- Banana pudding?
- Mm.

63
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,173
Are you trying to kill me?

64
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:46,312
I'm allergic.

65
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:49,340
I almost died when I
was four. Remember?

66
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:52,648
I thought that was strawberries.

67
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,594
My apology. I'm gonna go

68
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:57,730
to the cafeteria right
now and I'll be back

69
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:59,979
with the best chocolate
pudding in the house.

70
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:01,811
Then we walk.

71
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:09,074
- Your father, he's...
- He's a mixed blessing.

72
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:13,135
He's a god to his
patients and himself.

73
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,419
You know who really
loves banana pudding?

74
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:18,827
Him.

75
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,215
Story of my life.

76
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:28,162
Marco Anza, 14-year-old
male, syncopal episode.

77
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,370
History of osteogenesis
imperfect a.

78
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:32,515
Hey, Marco, my
name is Dr. Feldman.

79
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,019
- Can you tell me what happened?
I fell off

80
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:36,222
my neighbor's bike.

81
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:37,735
My mom's gonna kill me.

82
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,787
She followed the ambulance.
She'll be here any minute.

83
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:42,538
All right, we got you,
buddy. On my count.

84
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:44,072
One, two, three.

85
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:49,529
I'm not supposed to bike.

86
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:54,308
I-I got dizzy and
everything went black

87
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:56,355
and that's when I fell...

88
00:03:57,647 --> 00:03:58,924
He's in V tach.

89
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,666
Go get a crash cart
and Dr. Austin.

90
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:01,631
Thready pulse.

91
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,634
Prepare to do chest
compressions if he codes.

92
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:06,427
I'm his mother. Uh, no
CPR. His-his bones break

93
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:09,392
with the slightest pressure, he
has osteogenesis imperfect a.

94
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:11,932
- Where's that crash cart?
Right here.

95
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,657
All right, I'll get
these pads on him

96
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,120
and you charge to 200.

97
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:20,312
Uh, Doctor, please
don't let my baby die.

98
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:22,248
Please, God, please, please.

99
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:23,909
All right, clear.

100
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:32,257
Sinus tach at 110.

101
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,859
All right.

102
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:36,470
He's okay, Mom. He's stable.

103
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:39,631
Thank you. Thank you.

104
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,834
That was terrifying.

105
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:44,449
I don't understand.
Why did his heart stop?

106
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:46,672
It didn't. It went into
a dangerous rhythm,

107
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,805
and now we have
to figure out why.

108
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:51,157
Marco.

109
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:53,579
Honey, it's Mom. Talk to me.

110
00:04:53,604 --> 00:04:55,282
Please, talk to me, honey.

111
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:57,485
My back really hurts.

112
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,798
What'd he say?
- His back hurts.

113
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,622
Another possible
injury from the fall?

114
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:04,185
He could have broken anything.

115
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,500
It's exactly why he's never
supposed to be on a bicycle.

116
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:08,026
Answer box.

117
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:10,426
Yeah. All right, people.

118
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:14,025
Let's get this young man
ready for X-ray and CT.

119
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,956
<font color="#ff6fec"><i>Improved By M_I_S
www.opensubtitles.org</i></font>

120
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,719
Are you back at work, Albert?

121
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:36,321
Yeah, just in time
for the midterms,

122
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,997
much to the chagrin
of my students.

123
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,908
I'm sure they are
thrilled to have you back.

124
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:44,144
Well, they did
make a TikTok video

125
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,765
reciting the periodic
table while twerking.

126
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:50,518
I suppose that's their version
of a "Get well soon" card.

127
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:52,311
That is something
that I'd like to see.

128
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:55,198
And there's something
that I want to show you.

129
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:01,714
- These are your lungs.
- Mm-hmm.

130
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:03,298
Do you notice
anything different?

131
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,011
This is what they
looked like before.

132
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:11,115
No tumors.
- That's right.

133
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,042
If I didn't know you
entered our clinical trial

134
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:17,043
with advanced lung cancer, I'd
say that these are the lungs

135
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:18,797
of a completely healthy man.

136
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:23,939
O-Okay, wait, wait.
Complete remission?

137
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:26,005
- Yeah, man.
- Oh, my gosh.

138
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,720
- Thank you.

139
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:29,842
Thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

140
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:34,991
I know this trial was
brutal, but it worked.

141
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:37,383
Yeah, yeah... And the science.

142
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,051
The science.

143
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:40,652
You found answers.

144
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,921
More people will benefit, right?

145
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,822
Now call Grace, and
give her the good news.

146
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:51,797
Okay, here's my idea.</i>

147
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:54,652
We got four
marriages between us.

148
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:57,036
Do we really need a ceremony?

149
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,071
I mean, we could elope.

150
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:00,946
Just you, me, a
justice of the peace,

151
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:03,441
followed by a wild honeymoon

152
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,401
at the destination
of your choice.

153
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,174
Um... Whoa, I'm-I'm sorry.

154
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,549
I was told that you
wanted to see me?

155
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:12,840
Yes, please.

156
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:14,172
We both do. Please, come in.

157
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:15,975
Yeah, and congratulations

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,590
on your incredibly
successful clinical trial.

159
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:21,060
And the rabies
protocol with Conrad.

160
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:22,505
We are so proud of you.

161
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:24,972
Especially since you
trained here at Chastain.

162
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:28,167
What she's really saying
is she's terrified.

163
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,269
And we don't want to lose you.

164
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:31,604
Dare I ask?

165
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,731
Are you being courted by
the great research hospitals

166
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:35,756
of the world?

167
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,878
Actually, yes.

168
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:44,156
Baltimore Hospital of Advanced
Sciences is flying me up today.

169
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:45,929
Wow.

170
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:48,687
We will match any offer.

171
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:51,635
Thank you. But there is no
official offer to match,

172
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,350
and money is not
the only factor.

173
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,976
There are... um, issues here.

174
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,365
Personal ones, I imagine.

175
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,133
Yes.

176
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:04,036
- We're rooting for you and Leela.
- Thank you.

177
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,671
I appreciate that.

178
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:08,907
Uh, I almost forgot.

179
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:11,677
Congratulations on your,
on your engagement.

180
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,367
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

181
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:19,818
Oh, the poor guy.

182
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:22,726
You know, his career is
accelerating like a Ferrari,

183
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:26,682
and, you know, all he can think
of is the empty passenger seat.

184
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:30,080
Thank you. Okay, I better go.

185
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:31,815
I got a crazy day.

186
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:37,822
Wow.

187
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:41,403
There have got to be over
200 healed fractures here.

188
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:44,349
Mm, it's no wonder his
mother's so protective.

189
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:47,273
Osteogenesis imperfect
a is a brutal disease.

190
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:50,054
Every time your kid
stumbles, a bone can break.

191
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,475
And bone pain is terrible.

192
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,862
- You ever broken any?
- Lucky for me, only one.

193
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:58,609
- Proximal humerus.
- Hmm. How?

194
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,752
Oh, that's a long story
involving a skateboard ramp

195
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:05,092
and a very dumb teenage AJ.

196
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:06,685
And a cat.

197
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:10,472
Don't ask.

198
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:14,802
Well, there's a new
spinal fracture, T11-T12,

199
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:17,190
likely from the fall,
but we can fix that.

200
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:21,547
But what concerns me the most
is the restrictive cardiomyopathy.

201
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:24,585
With the severity of
his pectus excavatum,

202
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,186
his rib cage is almost
strangling his heart.

203
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,759
- The Ravitch procedure?
- Yeah.

204
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:33,463
Break the bones of his sternum
and reset them to make room

205
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,227
for his heart to work properly.

206
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:38,031
It's an incredibly risky
operation for a kid with OI.

207
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:39,863
Yeah, but if we don't fix it,

208
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:43,926
Marco could go into lethal
rhythm again and die.

209
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,440
I understand the upside
of the operation,

210
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,156
and the danger for
Marco if we don't do it.

211
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,142
But what about the
surgery itself?

212
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,465
There is a risk of
damage to his heart

213
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,047
and aortic aneurysm once
we saw through the bone.

214
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,895
So, you could damage his heart

215
00:10:01,222 --> 00:10:04,147
while you're trying to repair
the bones that you are afraid

216
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,497
- might strangle the heart?
- And again,

217
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,639
these are bones that caused
him to black out on the bike

218
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:11,075
when his heart went
into a lethal rhythm.

219
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:13,011
If we don't do
the surgery, any stress

220
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:15,648
on his heart could worsen
the strain and kill him.

221
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:20,569
So there's risks with or without
the surgery... but far less

222
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:23,740
if I just make sure that-that
he's never alone again.

223
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:25,356
Never alone?

224
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:26,999
Mom, are you kidding?
That's crazy.

225
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:29,252
I-I don't want to
live like that.

226
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:31,836
I don't want to be
wrapped in Bubble Wrap

227
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:33,072
and put in a drawer.

228
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:34,486
I want to do stuff.

229
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,788
Honey, I know you do,

230
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,633
but you have to accept
there's limitations.

231
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:39,979
You can't do risky things
like go ride a bike.

232
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:42,761
I-I get that I can't,
like, play football,

233
00:10:42,786 --> 00:10:46,116
but I'm not gonna
stop riding bikes.

234
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:52,603
Did you know his first
fracture happened

235
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:54,206
when he was three months old?

236
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:56,076
I was putting a
onesie over his head

237
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,825
and his collarbone just cracked.

238
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,313
It's been 14 years of this.

239
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:02,781
But we've managed.

240
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,385
I've managed to
keep my boy safe.

241
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:09,077
Mom, I-I love you,

242
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,181
and I know that
you've protected me

243
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:15,794
ever since I was a baby,
but safe isn't enough.

244
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:19,203
I-I've done a bunch of research,

245
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,800
and I can get better.

246
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:25,073
I-I want to go to college.

247
00:11:25,254 --> 00:11:26,665
He's right.

248
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:31,197
In some forms of OI, fractures
decrease after puberty

249
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:33,010
when rapid bone growth
comes to an end.

250
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,296
This may already be
happening with Marco.

251
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,219
After a fall from a
bike, we'd expect to see

252
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:39,141
far more fractures
than he has today.

253
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:44,714
See, if they do the surgery,
I could totally be better.

254
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:53,190
I'm sorry. This is a
very, very big decision.

255
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,414
I... I have to think about it.

256
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:05,657
Brave young man.

257
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:08,533
- We both know we can fix him.
- Very brave.

258
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:10,428
You know, the mom's
protected him so long,

259
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:12,232
- she can't let go.
- Well, in medicine,

260
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:14,553
as in life, no risk, no reward.

261
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:16,220
Tell me about it.

262
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:19,913
So he has Behcet's
and he's sick enough

263
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,449
to be in the ICU?

264
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,277
I am thinking pulse
doses of steroids.

265
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:27,534
Ah, I thought maybe that was
the best course, but obviously,

266
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,634
I had to confirm
with my partner.

267
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,328
Somehow I don't think that's
why you came to find me.

268
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,854
Another spot-on diagnosis.

269
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:39,355
I heard you've got a job
interview up in Baltimore today.

270
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,905
They're flying me
business class.

271
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:44,027
Champagne before takeoff, baby.

272
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:46,060
- Oh, wow.

273
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:54,099
I remember when you were a
green, starry-eyed intern.

274
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,754
Your first day at Chastain,
I took one look at you

275
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,401
and I thought, "I got to
break this poor guy down

276
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:01,586
and rebuild him
from the ground up."

277
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:03,248
You were impossible.

278
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:05,838
I tried very hard to
find another resident.

279
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:10,683
And when the sun came up on
that first 37-hour shift...

280
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:14,196
I was convinced I'd
made so many mistakes

281
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:15,798
- that I'd never be a doctor.

282
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:17,950
And you said this
job isn't easy.

283
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:22,601
That if it were, everyone
would be a doctor

284
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:26,010
because it is the
best job in the world,

285
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:29,249
despite everything,
because of everything.

286
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:30,938
That's still the case.

287
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:33,053
All right.

288
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,479
Now I'm gonna say
something selfish.

289
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:41,968
Okay.

290
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:44,569
Don't break up the team.

291
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,081
I don't want to, trust me.

292
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,639
You can work things out.

293
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:54,636
She's worth it.

294
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:58,621
And all your friends and
colleagues are here, you know?

295
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:02,925
I don't know.

296
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:05,436
I really don't.

297
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:08,416
But I do know that I need to
see what else is out there.

298
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:10,500
I get it.

299
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:14,050
You've earned this.

300
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:41,008
- Uh, uh, uh...

301
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,731
Your pudding, darling.

302
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:15,380
Thanks. Where you been?

303
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:20,063
I went by the pharmacy to
get some medication for you.

304
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:22,413
- Medication?
- Yeah, to help

305
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:25,007
with this PTSD anxiety.

306
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:28,860
I don't do benzos.

307
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:30,893
And you're not my
prescribing doctor,

308
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:33,049
so that's, you know, illegal.

309
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:34,990
But thanks.

310
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:39,177
Probably wise.

311
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,818
Maybe an overreaction
on my part.

312
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:44,171
I just hate to see
you under duress.

313
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:46,434
I'll take them back.

314
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:49,439
Well, I promised
Conrad you and I

315
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,293
would do our forced
march an hour ago.

316
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,346
Let's do it. Oh, that's
Kit Voss, isn't it?

317
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,056
- Yeah.
- Just give me a few minutes.

318
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,599
I've been meaning
to introduce myself.

319
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,020
I'll be right back.

320
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:01,587
Dad.

321
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,911
Ms. Voss, good afternoon.

322
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:07,438
Oh, are you getting
in that elevator?

323
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:09,011
You
must be Cade's dad...

324
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:15,581
<i></i>

325
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:55,996
Help.

326
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,711
Dr. Sutton, Dr. Austin.

327
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,673
We've decided not
to do the surgery.

328
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,711
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

329
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:18,381
Especially since Marco
seemed to be all in.

330
00:17:18,853 --> 00:17:19,982
Well, Marco's 14.

331
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,098
He thinks potato chips
are a food group.

332
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:24,630
I am his mother and I-I
know what's best for him.

333
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,761
Well, for the
record, our medical opinion

334
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:28,404
is that surgery is
the best choice.

335
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:29,789
Because we
believe the risks

336
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:31,832
of not doing it far
outweigh the risks of...

337
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:34,158
Please, stop. Just stop.

338
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:41,821
If something goes
wrong, which may happen,

339
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,054
you two just leave the
outcome here at the hospital.

340
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,785
But my dear,

341
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,790
kind, clever, amazing little boy

342
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:53,982
will be gone.

343
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:56,800
I will not go home,

344
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:02,592
for the first time in 14 years,
to be alone, without my son.

345
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:11,068
It's about control.

346
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:14,460
She has controlled every waking
moment of that child's life.

347
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:16,507
For good reason,
to keep him safe.

348
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:18,702
But now that he has
a will of his own,

349
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:20,518
she can't seem to let him go.

350
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:23,693
Well, there's nothing
we can do, is there?

351
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:27,094
Unfortunately not. We both
know she's not 100% wrong.

352
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:31,219
The surgery is risky, Marco
is a minor and it is her call.

353
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,720
The resident is falling
asleep while he's retracting,

354
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,913
I'm about to call the
whole thing, and I find

355
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:40,793
the little nubbin hiding
behind the kidney.

356
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:44,165
Well, Seattle Children's must
feel so grateful to have you.

357
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,149
Ah. I like to tell
myself they do.

358
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:53,665
But I'm thinking of
relocating closer to Cade.

359
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,011
She's my only child.

360
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,626
This has... been a nightmare.

361
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:03,570
Rearranged all my priorities.

362
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:05,141
That's understandable.

363
00:19:05,674 --> 00:19:08,835
You know, we're in the market
for a pediatric surgeon.

364
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,516
I don't suppose
you'd consider...

365
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,542
Mm, I'm sorry.

366
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:12,999
It wasn't my
intention to turn this

367
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:14,958
- into a job interview.
- No, of course not,

368
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,282
but I'd love to give you

369
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:20,119
an exclusive CEO
tour of Chastain.

370
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:22,793
I can reschedule
my next appointment

371
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:23,973
if you can be available.

372
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,242
Do you have the time?

373
00:19:25,516 --> 00:19:26,852
I have all day.

374
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:28,215
Great.

375
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:31,180
Great, thanks for your help.

376
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,818
The patient in 423
needs a PCA pump.

377
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:36,146
I wrote the order.

378
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:38,013
How did Cade's first
outing on two feet go?

379
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:39,682
What outing?

380
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:41,195
With her father.

381
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,013
Helping her walk
around the hospital?

382
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:44,148
That didn't happen.

383
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,229
I saw him with Dr. Voss.

384
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:47,716
Okay.

385
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:55,690
- What happened?
- I fell.

386
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:57,987
-  It hurts.
- Laura?

387
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:00,033
I need a lac tray,

388
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:01,764
Lidocaine with epi and bandages.

389
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,971
Feels like
my incision opened.

390
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,982
All right, let's
get you back in bed.

391
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:19,039
Eh, it's a superficial
lac. You're good.

392
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:31,638
- Where's your dad?

393
00:20:34,221 --> 00:20:35,956
He got a better offer.

394
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:41,471
Obviously this is complicated.
You don't have to talk about it.

395
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:43,332
Hurts.

396
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:48,016
Talking helps take
my mind off of it.

397
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:51,149
No loss of consciousness?

398
00:20:51,174 --> 00:20:54,453
Nope, I've been painfully
awake this whole time.

399
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:56,432
- No head CT for me.

400
00:20:56,457 --> 00:20:57,857
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

401
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,654
You just focus on keeping
my guts from spilling out.

402
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,004
Ordering me around again?

403
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,586
It's nice to see
you're on the mend.

404
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:22,897
Your hands.

405
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:25,948
Gentle.

406
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:31,385
You can always tell how much
a doctor cares by their touch.

407
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:39,489
I'm so pissed your
dad left you here.

408
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:42,845
You can count on him to
make a big showy entrance

409
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,990
that gets him a
lot of attention,

410
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:47,508
but after that...

411
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,834
Look, he does the best he can.

412
00:21:55,503 --> 00:21:57,452
From grade school on,

413
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:00,885
when I got up in the morning,
he'd be gone to work.

414
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:03,377
So I made my own lunch.

415
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:07,390
Did what I had to do,
what I wanted to do.

416
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,875
Made me self-reliant.

417
00:22:11,826 --> 00:22:13,841
I'm grateful for that.

418
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,633
You're being too generous.

419
00:22:20,271 --> 00:22:23,371
Well, not everyone can be
the kind of father you are.

420
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:29,132
Gigi's a lucky girl.

421
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:37,271
My dad showed up this
week, he gave blood,

422
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,243
he saved my life.

423
00:22:39,478 --> 00:22:41,429
You got to give credit
where credit's due.

424
00:22:41,548 --> 00:22:42,850
Mm-hmm.

425
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:49,020
He'll stick around for a
couple days, he'll get bored,

426
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:52,558
go back home to inappropriate
wife number three,

427
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:55,581
and Seattle Children's,
where he can see

428
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:58,301
the hero worship in
his patients' eyes.

429
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:02,164
Not before I have
a word with him.

430
00:23:15,248 --> 00:23:16,455
I was gonna ask

431
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,239
if we could take him home.

432
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:19,479
- He was doing so much better.
- I can't breathe.

433
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:22,691
He's desatting fast,
his lungs are flooded.

434
00:23:22,716 --> 00:23:25,273
- He's working too hard.
- We need a crash cart now.

435
00:23:25,448 --> 00:23:27,645
Mrs. Anza, we're gonna
have to intubate.

436
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,707
- No. No, no, no.
- His lungs are drowning.

437
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:30,947
We have no choice.

438
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:41,252
Dr. Pravesh, here you will find

439
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:43,963
our very own
world-class geneticists.

440
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,691
They are making great strides

441
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,200
in the field of hereditary
cancer syndromes,

442
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:49,253
as well as sequencing

443
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:51,958
newly discovered
chromosomal disorders.

444
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:54,942
These are the very
experts in virology.

445
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:58,348
Is that our rabies protocol?

446
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,448
That's right.

447
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:00,836
Chastain Rabies Protocol.

448
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:02,822
Your groundbreaking work.
We're trying to determine

449
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:04,961
how to trial it in
endemic countries.

450
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,337
Well, you guys
certainly go all out.

451
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,430
We have to.

452
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:11,365
It's our very center
for rare diseases,

453
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,537
where research will
meet clinical excellence

454
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:16,304
to cure the most challenging
diseases in the world.

455
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,778
Well, it's a dream setup.

456
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,807
For the, uh, research
scientist, it is.

457
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:28,382
And we want you to
be a part of it.

458
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:36,585
Okay, uh, you've got me.

459
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,887
- I'm impressed.

460
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:39,275
We certainly hope so.

461
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,442
Because it's all yours.

462
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,493
We want to make you the
director of our program.

463
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:46,400
You're young for a job of
this stature, it's true.

464
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:47,425
But

465
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:49,750
we feel that you're
the perfect person

466
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,494
to lead us into a
brighter future.

467
00:24:54,677 --> 00:24:55,677
Wow.

468
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:58,341
I'm...

469
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:00,867
I'm honored.

470
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,844
Is that a yes?

471
00:25:06,456 --> 00:25:08,734
I need some time
to think about it,

472
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,952
process it all.

473
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,010
Of course.

474
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:13,678
But we need to
know by next week.

475
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:16,307
Next week?

476
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,705
You think this was
my fault, don't you?

477
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,612
'Cause I didn't say yes
to the surgery right away.

478
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:32,636
No.

479
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,516
We're not here to assign blame.

480
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:38,304
Marco is stable
on a vent for now.

481
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:41,991
First his heart, now his lungs?

482
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:44,093
The truth is, your
son is getting worse.

483
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:46,643
His chest
deformity almost stopped

484
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:47,932
his heart this morning.

485
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:51,614
Now fluid is backing up from
his heart into his lungs.

486
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:53,381
We might not be
able to extubate him

487
00:25:53,406 --> 00:25:55,936
ever again if we do not move
forward with the surgery.

488
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:58,437
- Are you sure?
Yes.

489
00:25:58,462 --> 00:25:59,544
We have to operate,

490
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:01,070
and we have to do it today.

491
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:02,538
There is no option.

492
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:07,210
Okay.

493
00:26:08,488 --> 00:26:10,426
It is a beautiful hospital.

494
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:12,373
How does it compare
to Seattle Children's?

495
00:26:13,164 --> 00:26:15,350
They're
very different.

496
00:26:15,903 --> 00:26:17,903
Seattle Children's
isn't a public hospital,

497
00:26:17,928 --> 00:26:20,253
with all the good
and bad that entails.

498
00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:23,168
The best thing about
Chastain is our staff.

499
00:26:23,193 --> 00:26:25,548
We have a roster of
extraordinary doctors.

500
00:26:25,573 --> 00:26:26,471
Mm.

501
00:26:26,496 --> 00:26:28,166
- Excuse me.

502
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:31,114
And looks like two
of my best surgeons

503
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:34,387
are about to perform a Ravitch
procedure on a teenager

504
00:26:34,412 --> 00:26:35,931
with a severe case of OI.

505
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:39,985
I could get you visitor
operating privileges

506
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,053
if you'd like to scrub in.

507
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:42,244
I'd be delighted.

508
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,084
Let me just go check
in with Cade first.

509
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:45,917
Meet me at OR 2.

510
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:47,025
Right.

511
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,251
Yeah. How's my girl?

512
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,296
Uh

513
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,830
Not great.

514
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,878
- She fell and hit her head.
- What?

515
00:26:55,903 --> 00:26:57,307
- And opened her sutures.
- How?

516
00:26:57,738 --> 00:26:59,780
Because she decided
to walk by herself.

517
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:01,035
Where were you?

518
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,332
I'll go check in on her now.

519
00:27:02,357 --> 00:27:03,574
Uh, you're a little late.

520
00:27:04,878 --> 00:27:05,889
She's asleep.

521
00:27:05,914 --> 00:27:07,641
She should've waited for me.

522
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:10,196
She's always done
things on her own,

523
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:11,763
without support.

524
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:13,602
Okay.

525
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:15,865
Look, I feel bad enough.

526
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:17,398
I don't need a lecture.

527
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:19,946
And for the record,
do you know where I was?

528
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,697
I don't care.

529
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,946
I was asked to scrub in on
a life-threatening surgery

530
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:24,100
on a teen, okay?

531
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,828
Chastain has no
pediatric surgeon.

532
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,297
I may be able to
help save a life.

533
00:27:27,322 --> 00:27:29,112
Oh, we have plenty
of great surgeons.

534
00:27:29,137 --> 00:27:31,055
Your daughter needed you.

535
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:33,013
Why don't you just say it?

536
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,648
I'm in your way.

537
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:37,097
You want to have
Cade all to yourself.

538
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:38,673
I'm her doctor.

539
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,006
So, yeah, right now,
you are in my way.

540
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,139
And I'm her father.

541
00:27:42,164 --> 00:27:44,633
Then start acting like it.

542
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:09,163
You okay?

543
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:12,778
Good. Good. Just doing
my little pre-op stretch.

544
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:15,125
- Time to get
changed and scrub in.

545
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,514
I'll show you to
the locker room.

546
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,614
Dr. Austin, Dr. Sutton,

547
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:24,162
this is Cade's
father, Dr. Sullivan.

548
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,334
He's visiting his
daughter and happens to be

549
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,834
a top pediatric surgeon,

550
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:29,825
something Chastain lacks.

551
00:28:30,311 --> 00:28:31,817
Just here to watch and learn.

552
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,757
Yeah, well, this is a big one.

553
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:35,547
It's high-stakes.

554
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:36,825
Got a life to save.

555
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:38,626
Happy to
have you scrub in.

556
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,025
Delighted.

557
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:50,347
All right.

558
00:28:50,372 --> 00:28:51,681
That should give
his heart and lungs

559
00:28:51,705 --> 00:28:53,242
room to breathe.

560
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:55,339
Very delicately done.

561
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:58,218
I-I do have one suggestion.

562
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:00,064
If you're open to it.

563
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:01,943
I'd recommend

564
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:04,411
overcorrecting the sternum
just a little bit more.

565
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:05,645
It may look silly now,

566
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:07,313
but when you go to secure

567
00:29:07,338 --> 00:29:08,833
the pectoralis muscles
back down, it'll

568
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:11,707
it'll make sure that the
sternum doesn't dip back

569
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:13,620
into dangerous territory.

570
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:19,909
That's actually an
excellent suggestion.

571
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:21,021
Huh.

572
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:23,112
I like that.

573
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,943
In fact, I will make that
adjustment right now.

574
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,703
Rongeurs to me.

575
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:30,879
Take it you've
done a few of these?

576
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,521
Just a few.

577
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:33,954
Dozen.

578
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,031
BP's plummeting.

579
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:39,316
He's tachycardic.

580
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,395
And has severe JVD.

581
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,295
Uh, high-output
cardiac failure.

582
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,779
Hang do but a mine.
Five mics per kilo.

583
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:47,023
He's in V tach.

584
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:49,404
And he's likely ruptured
the aortic aneurysm.

585
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:50,622
Laps to me.

586
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:52,295
We need to get a
bypass in here now.

587
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:54,305
Dr. Cade's father,

588
00:29:54,614 --> 00:29:56,382
step in. We need your hands.

589
00:29:56,571 --> 00:29:57,581
By all means.

590
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,768
So, the
aneurysm involved

591
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:01,914
the ascending
aorta and the arch.

592
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:04,054
And the descending aorta.

593
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:07,397
Time for the frozen
elephant trunk technique,

594
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:08,465
wouldn't you say?

595
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:10,740
I've only done that in adults.

596
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:12,099
Works in kids, too.

597
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:14,818
We good?

598
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:16,956
Hell yeah.

599
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:18,916
Ah, let's do it.

600
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:21,118
Wow, he's good.</i>

601
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:22,181
No kidding.</i>

602
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:23,808
We do need a peds surgeon.

603
00:30:24,505 --> 00:30:25,615
Yes, we do.

604
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,120
So have you broached the
subject with Sullivan?

605
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:30,682
I did.

606
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:33,053
But?

607
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,709
He's very charming,

608
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:37,399
and he turns it on effortlessly.

609
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,445
Maybe a little too effortlessly.

610
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:44,228
But those hands would
save a lot of young lives.

611
00:30:46,564 --> 00:30:47,945
I wouldn't worry about it.

612
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,348
Ian Sullivan will
be putty in yours.

613
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:53,210
Darling, are you all right?

614
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:55,027
I'm just pushing
myself a bit too hard.

615
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:58,015
I had a podcast interview
about unaccountable doctors,

616
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,086
then a deposition where I
testified about the cases

617
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:01,807
that were ignored by
the state medical board.

618
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:03,301
Then I came back here
and did a lap chole,

619
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:04,496
which I should have
delegated to Nolan

620
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,060
but I didn't because
I missed the OR

621
00:31:06,246 --> 00:31:07,319
- and...
- Can you go home

622
00:31:07,344 --> 00:31:09,352
- and rest now?
- Uh...

623
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:12,614
No, I would need somebody to
cover for a bowel resection.

624
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:13,509
Nolan can do it.

625
00:31:13,534 --> 00:31:16,228
Or Leela. Your health
is our priority.

626
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:17,253
Now go.

627
00:31:31,277 --> 00:31:32,468
How'd it go?

628
00:31:33,086 --> 00:31:34,762
How'd what go?

629
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:36,891
The job interview.

630
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:42,740
So you heard?

631
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,126
- Everyone heard.

632
00:31:46,025 --> 00:31:47,618
Everyone's talking about it.

633
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:49,746
Everyone's afraid you'll leave.

634
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:54,811
They offered me a job.

635
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:57,606
An entire department, actually.

636
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:01,667
I'd be running their new
center for rare diseases.

637
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:04,701
It's a dream.

638
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,078
Devon, that's-that's incredible.

639
00:32:09,937 --> 00:32:11,607
You must be really proud.

640
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:13,807
Thank you.

641
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:17,971
So are you gonna take it?

642
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:25,278
Do you think I should?

643
00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:30,274
I can't make that
decision for you.

644
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:36,636
Is there anything left of us?

645
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:38,907
That's on you.

646
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:42,037
You're the one who made it clear

647
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:43,833
that not having kids
was a deal-breaker.

648
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:46,484
I think the deal-breaker is
that you didn't even discuss

649
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:47,771
my feelings about it.

650
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:50,532
You just laid out your rules.

651
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:52,767
Your job,

652
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:54,726
your body, your
eggs, your future.

653
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:56,468
Mine didn't even factor in.

654
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:58,609
And that's not what our
relationship was supposed to be.

655
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:02,709
It was supposed to
be a partnership.

656
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,019
You've already
made up your mind.

657
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,511
And now you're just justifying
your decision by blaming me

658
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:10,561
for the fact that you're
leaving your friends

659
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:12,352
and the hospital that made you.

660
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:14,805
I can't believe you'd do that.

661
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,986
Kincaid, my darling.

662
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:38,247
I'm so sorry.

663
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:41,346
Heard you were the
hero of the day.

664
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,141
I guest-starred in
a roller-coaster.

665
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:46,822
Ravitch procedure with
Drs. Austin and Sutton,

666
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:48,264
but hardly a hero.

667
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:52,863
I left you waiting for me,
and you did what you always do

668
00:33:52,888 --> 00:33:55,693
the way you've always
done it: On your own.

669
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,147
There was a kid who needed you.

670
00:33:58,439 --> 00:34:01,340
Work to be done. There's
nothing new to see here.

671
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:02,612
Yes, there is.

672
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:04,747
You needed me.

673
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:07,400
Nothing should have taken
precedence over that.

674
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:11,935
Dad, we have a long history of
other kids taking precedence.

675
00:34:12,232 --> 00:34:13,716
But I'm over it.

676
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,654
I'm a doctor, too.

677
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:19,428
I've let hospital drama
suffocate my personal life

678
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:20,892
more times than I can count.

679
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:29,370
Remember when you were the
lead in the school play,

680
00:34:29,395 --> 00:34:32,993
and opening night,
I-I sent you roses

681
00:34:33,862 --> 00:34:36,770
- and then didn't show up.
- Yeah, sure.

682
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:38,882
There's no need to rehash that.

683
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:40,989
And today I brought
you banana pudding.

684
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,518
People don't change, do they?

685
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,013
I keep making the same
mistakes again and again.

686
00:34:49,105 --> 00:34:50,193
What's going on?

687
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:51,368
What do you mean?

688
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:53,596
I sense an agenda.

689
00:34:54,756 --> 00:34:56,417
Humble pie is not your dessert.

690
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:03,279
Kit Voss offered me a job.

691
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:06,972
Why would you leave
Seattle Children's?

692
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:09,864
- Were you fired?
- No.

693
00:35:10,411 --> 00:35:13,839
Look, I saw you
pocket the benzos.

694
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:16,178
You're not having an
issue with that again?

695
00:35:16,203 --> 00:35:18,475
No, I have this pain in my
back, it wraps around my side,

696
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,837
- keeps me up at night.
- Well, have you seen a doctor?

697
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:22,336
Of course not. It's
just a muscle pull.

698
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:23,689
It's nothing, it's fine.

699
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:27,508
Look, I won't... I won't
make a habit of the pills.

700
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:29,812
But at my age, you know,
I'm not getting any younger.

701
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,760
Aches and pains
are a common thing.

702
00:35:31,785 --> 00:35:33,294
Dad, you're barely 60.

703
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:35,403
Hey, hey, 59.

704
00:35:39,622 --> 00:35:41,900
I'm considering
coming to Chastain

705
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:43,730
so that I can be closer to you.

706
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:47,442
Oh, my God.

707
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:50,511
Louisa left you.

708
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:52,586
No.

709
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:55,034
Why do you always
think the worst of me?

710
00:35:58,372 --> 00:35:59,707
I left her.

711
00:36:03,514 --> 00:36:06,216
And now you need a whole
new crop of people to charm.

712
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:08,771
- Ouch.
- So you arrived to save me,

713
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:12,113
and then you managed to line it
up with an agenda of your own.

714
00:36:12,138 --> 00:36:15,467
: No, no. I
did come to save you.

715
00:36:15,727 --> 00:36:19,181
The "agenda" came
after I realized

716
00:36:19,206 --> 00:36:21,448
that I wanted to be
with you from now on.

717
00:36:25,264 --> 00:36:29,067
I really did drop everything
to come and save you.

718
00:36:29,816 --> 00:36:33,053
And in return, you rip
my heart out.

719
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,419
- I'll come back later.
No, no, it's fine.

720
00:36:41,885 --> 00:36:43,062
I'm leaving.

721
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:46,307
For good.

722
00:36:57,297 --> 00:36:58,303
You okay?

723
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,683
No.

724
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,794
Bye.

725
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:18,708
Well, not a bad day overall.

726
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:21,239
We saved a life,
and the young man

727
00:37:21,264 --> 00:37:22,938
actually has a chance
at a real future.

728
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,751
And he might be one
of the lucky ones

729
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,231
whose OI goes into remission.

730
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:28,239
That'd be icing on the cake.

731
00:37:28,264 --> 00:37:30,485
There's just one last
hurdle for Marco.

732
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,649
Oh, he'll have his work cut
out for him getting his mom

733
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:34,265
- to let him grow up.

734
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:40,287
Hey.

735
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:41,335
What's going on?

736
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:46,361
Oh, lately, I've been a
little disappointed in myself.

737
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,994
Really? You?

738
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:53,566
I'm afraid to do what that
kid was willing to do.

739
00:37:54,817 --> 00:37:57,304
You know, take a big
risk for a larger life.

740
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:00,039
Listen to me.

741
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:04,254
After everything you
have been through,

742
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:05,544
I can honestly say

743
00:38:05,837 --> 00:38:08,711
you are one of the most
courageous women I know.

744
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:11,612
And you've got nerves
of steel in the OR.

745
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:14,370
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

746
00:38:16,803 --> 00:38:18,087
But here's the thing.

747
00:38:21,046 --> 00:38:23,449
I haven't been in a
significant relationship in...

748
00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:26,491
I don't know, a long time.

749
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:29,388
For a lot of reasons.

750
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:32,207
You know, my past, obviously.

751
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:36,120
But now I've gone and
fallen for someone

752
00:38:37,635 --> 00:38:39,709
who I won't identify,

753
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:45,010
and there are huge
potential complications.

754
00:38:46,002 --> 00:38:48,685
Don't tell me you're afraid
the guy's gonna say no.

755
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:51,561
Because that seems
inconceivable.

756
00:38:52,848 --> 00:38:55,922
I'm as afraid he'll say
yes as I am he'll say no.

757
00:38:58,681 --> 00:39:01,326
Ugh, it's all terrifying.

758
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:05,274
Yeah. I get it.

759
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:09,236
You know, honestly?

760
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:12,626
I'm terrified of
becoming a father.

761
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:15,845
You know, just the way
it's all happening, right?

762
00:39:16,641 --> 00:39:18,962
And Padma is loosey-goosey

763
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:20,910
and I am not.

764
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:23,959
You know what I was thinking?

765
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:26,477
What if the kid doesn't love me?

766
00:39:27,517 --> 00:39:30,032
There's not a
chance of that, AJ.

767
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,590
Hey.

768
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:36,363
Conrad and Gigi would
be lucky to have you.

769
00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:43,634
Is it that obvious?

770
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:45,474
Maybe not to Conrad.

771
00:39:46,982 --> 00:39:47,982
Billie.

772
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:50,042
Go tell the man how you feel.

773
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:10,433
You know what? Slight
detour before home.

774
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:14,483
I have a top secret mission,
should you choose to accept it.

775
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:15,807
What is it?

776
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:20,183
Someone I know needs a hug,
and they're right over there.

777
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:24,251
I'm a really good hugger.

778
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,913
And so is Mr. Waffles.

779
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:28,910
Then you two are the
perfect people for the job.

780
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,203
All right, follow me.

781
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:41,758
Hey, there.

782
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:45,553
Reinforcements are
here to cheer you up.

783
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,107
Hey, cutie-pie.

784
00:40:48,132 --> 00:40:51,873
- Oh, who's your friend?
- This is Mr. Waffles.

785
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:53,830
What happened to your head?

786
00:40:54,522 --> 00:40:55,971
I got a boo-boo.

787
00:40:56,516 --> 00:40:59,406
Want Mr. Waffles to kiss
it and make it better?

788
00:40:59,883 --> 00:41:02,909
And I could also give you
a kiss if you wanted me to.

789
00:41:03,569 --> 00:41:05,791
Yes, please. Both
would be great.

790
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:12,114
Mr. Waffles is your
new best friend, huh?

791
00:41:14,035 --> 00:41:15,035
Thank you.

792
00:41:18,903 --> 00:41:20,718
Want to have a puppet chat?

793
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:24,910
Yeah, you're gonna talk for him?

794
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,650
What's the joke?

795
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:30,132
Why do the chickens
cross the road?

796
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:31,157
Why?

797
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,202
Because they want
ice cream pasta.

798
00:41:34,473 --> 00:41:36,586
Ice cream pasta
with chocolate on top.

799
00:41:36,611 --> 00:41:38,781
That sounds delicious.

800
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:40,854
You want
some of that, too?

801
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:43,975
How are you feeling?

802
00:41:45,014 --> 00:41:46,408
Would a martini help?

803
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:48,714
Uh, I'm not so
sure about a drink.

804
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:56,156
- I have an idea about the wedding.
- Mm-hmm?

805
00:41:57,045 --> 00:41:58,966
Let's put it aside for now.

806
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:01,932
We can still keep the
date we came up with

807
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:04,552
and have a big engagement
party for our friends.

808
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:06,539
Would that be okay?

809
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:12,501
Darling, what is it?

810
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,550
I-I can't, I can't really see.

811
00:42:15,974 --> 00:42:17,140
All right.

812
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,900
Let's just lie you down.

813
00:42:25,492 --> 00:42:26,681
There you go.

814
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:29,903
It's likely an MS flare-up

815
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:31,613
because you pushed
yourself too hard.

816
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:33,953
- I'll call your doctor.

817
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:40,743
