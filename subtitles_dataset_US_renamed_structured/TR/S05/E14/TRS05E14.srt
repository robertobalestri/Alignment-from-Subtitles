00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:03,859
Trevor, no one here
needs to know

3
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:06,375
that we're related,
that you're my biological son.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,023
I need to talk to the state
medical board.

5
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,516
Dr. Bell asked me to write him
a recommendation for it.

6
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:12,710
He told me Robert Porter...

7
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:14,462
is angling for a seat
on the board.

8
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,805
He has to be stopped.

9
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:18,192
He raped me
when I was 13 years old.

10
00:00:19,242 --> 00:00:20,586
Withdraw the complaint.

11
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:22,867
Say you lied for Dr. Bell, and
you'll never hear from me again.

12
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:24,062
You're scared.

13
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:26,494
Withdraw it
or I will destroy you.

14
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:28,237
I'm fully aware
of your mistakes.

15
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:29,830
I'll expose all of them,

16
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:32,500
and I will take away the
very thing you love the most,

17
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:34,167
your career.

No way.
You?

No, sir. I can do this all day.

Ooh!

00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:04,596
I've seen that smile before.

30
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,191
Getting in shape
for a lady friend,

31
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:08,785
- perhaps?
- Oh,

32
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,787
- is that a clinical diagnosis?
- 100%.

33
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:13,790
You know, I passed by Marion

34
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:15,601
headed to your house
this morning.

35
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:17,710
How's she doing?

36
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:19,370
Touché.

37
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,148
Oh, no.

38
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,282
What's wrong?

39
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:40,309
Breakfast potatoes,
turkey bacon, toast, eggs?

40
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,052
- What's the occasion?
- No occasion.

41
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:45,029
I just wanted to do
something nice for my sister.

42
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:46,922
Someone died, didn't they?

43
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,640
Was it Uncle Ishman?

44
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,652
Okay, Uncle Ishman
will outlive all of us.

45
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,054
But, um,
since today is the last day

46
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,164
before Devon comes home
from his conference,

47
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:58,225
uh, there's actually something
I wanted to talk to you about.

48
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:05,007
Padma, I got to go.

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,343
- Do you have to?
- It's kind of an emergency.

50
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,736
And we will talk later, okay?

51
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,514
And thank you. And I'm so sorry.

52
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:26,809
- What's up, Janice?
- Hey.

53
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,365
- What's all the commotion about?
- You haven't seen?

54
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,692
It's all over Twitter.

55
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,269
Apparently,
Dr. Sutton cut unsupervised

56
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,353
when she was a resident.

57
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,288
Ended up paralyzing a patient.

58
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,665
Why are we concerning ourselves
with a few inflammatory tweets?

59
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:30,096
If by "a few" you mean hundreds.

60
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:31,652
Are they wrong?

61
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,755
Did you not promote Dr. Sutton
knowing full well

62
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,580
she had been fired
for misconduct?

63
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:36,840
All doctors make mistakes.

64
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:39,751
Billie was promoted
because she deserved it.

65
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:40,929
Did she deserve it
over our surgeons

66
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,764
with more experience
and seniority?

67
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,666
What you should be asking
yourself is why these reports

68
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,443
are surfacing now, years later.

69
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,852
Dr. Voss is right.

70
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:52,032
There clearly is
an ulterior motive here.

71
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:56,428
Dr. Sutton filed a complaint
against a powerful doctor.

72
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:59,544
If I were to guess,
this is a smear campaign

73
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,146
designed to turn
the public against her.

74
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,879
Keeping Chastain under
this intense public scrutiny

75
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:06,854
is not something
we can risk right now.

76
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:08,965
Then what do you suggest?

77
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:12,035
You know how much this board
respects you, Dr. Voss.

78
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,007
But I think you should be
relieved of your CEO duties.

79
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:17,677
Just until we get
this situation handled.

80
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:20,618
- You want to fire me?
- No one's being fired.

81
00:04:20,703 --> 00:04:23,432
We can mute the outrage
by putting someone in your seat

82
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,001
that can take the heat
off the hospital.

83
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:29,356
Even if we were considering
this, which we are not,

84
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,606
who would that person be?

85
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,368
Dr. Bell
is the obvious candidate.

86
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,778
I think we should take a vote.

87
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,290
All in favor

88
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,293
of putting Dr. Voss
on a temporary leave of absence.

She needs to know
we're here for her.

98
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,040
This is wrong.

99
00:05:58,134 --> 00:05:59,616
Those pansy-ass
keyboard crusaders

100
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,517
only show courage
behind a computer screen.

101
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:05,673
Or not.

102
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:09,925
I don't think
they're here for Billie.

103
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,681
I'll call EMS.

104
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:13,463
Tell them to hurry.
We have no idea how long

105
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:16,416
- she's been up there.
- She's not moving.

106
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,087
No doubt the blood has already
started to pool into her legs.

107
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:21,923
If she passes out, she'll
develop suspension syndrome.

108
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,157
That could kill her.

109
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:25,752
We need emergency services
to Chastain hospital now.

110
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:27,752
Hold on! We're getting you help!

111
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:30,031
Try to keep your legs moving!

112
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,016
- Gather around, y'all.
- Incoming trauma.

113
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,028
We need all
available hands on deck.

114
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:36,289
- Is this everyone?
- Dr. Pravesh won't be back

115
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,291
from his critical care
conference until tomorrow.

116
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,708
- But where are all the nurses?
- Dallas, Newark, L.A.

117
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,546
- Take your pick.
- Ugh, these travel contracts are no joke.

118
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:48,716
Last week I was offered
$130 an hour in Key West.

119
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:50,626
Housing, meal stipends.

120
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,454
If it weren't for Riley's
school, I'd have taken it.

121
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,463
We are fielding offers
left and right.

122
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:56,874
It's a national problem
hospitals are desperate to fix.

123
00:06:56,968 --> 00:07:00,221
Same kind of nurse exodus
happened at Atlanta General.

124
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:01,555
Led to some pretty unsafe
working conditions.

125
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,097
Which is why Chastain

126
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:04,899
should cough up
the funds to keep us.

127
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,044
Instead, we get travel mugs
and back-to-back surgeries.

128
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:10,220
Speaking of which, I'm needed
in the OR five minutes ago.

129
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,915
Go. We'll make do.

130
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,034
- Bay 10.
- Window washer took a fall.

131
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:19,486
- Caught by her harness.
- Tachy to 130, BP 80/50.

132
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:21,974
Sats stable post-intubation.

133
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:24,977
One, two, three.

134
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,695
- Bolus a liter of LR. Let's get some norepi.
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,063
I'll get labs and EKG.

136
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,816
Let's get her
out of this harness.

137
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,141
Whoa, whoa.

138
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:33,665
That harness is
acting like a tourniquet.

139
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,268
- Restricting blood flow.
- And allowing toxins to accumulate.

140
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:39,057
- Remove the tourniquet and...
- Pop goes the weasel.

141
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,919
- Those toxins flood right into the body.
- Right.

142
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,930
We need to prepare
for the worst.

143
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:48,681
Say whatever you want,
there's a reason

144
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,933
Sutton was made
chief of surgery.

145
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:41,508
Hey.

146
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:43,983
We heard. I'm so sorry, Kit.

147
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:45,978
This won't stand.
It's a wrongful dismissal.

148
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:47,338
There's more to it than that.

149
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:49,330
This all leads back to Porter.

150
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:51,629
I'd put money he pushed
the board to suspend me.

151
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:54,389
But the real question is,
how are you doing, Billie?

152
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:57,485
Well, I feel awful.
This is all my fault.

153
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:58,603
No, none of this is on you.

154
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:00,388
Listen, Porter came
to see me last night.

155
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,673
He threatened to come after me

156
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,167
if I didn't withdraw
my complaint.

157
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,734
But I never expected this
to blow back on you.

158
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,713
He's trying to discredit you,
take away your allies.

159
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,571
- We can't let that happen.
- And Marshall called.

160
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:12,025
They want to install me
as interim CEO.

161
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,798
Do it.

162
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:15,403
We need you as a shield.

163
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:17,345
Well, better you
running the hospital

164
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,196
than some Porter ally.

165
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:21,497
Oh... Okay, I'll do it.

166
00:09:21,585 --> 00:09:23,102
Oh,

167
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:24,522
please say it's not about me.

168
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,607
Another OR nurse
just handed in their notice.

169
00:09:27,758 --> 00:09:29,532
Dealing with this
nursing shortage

170
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:31,885
was top of my priority list.

171
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:35,022
So this is your way of saying
it's my problem now?

172
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:37,492
Unfortunately for you,
but lucky for us.

173
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,454
Bicarb drip going up
and the calcium chloride's

174
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,432
- ready to push.
- Let's get some vasopressin in our back pocket.

175
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,875
- Just in case.
- Already ahead of you.

176
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,544
FAST is negative.

177
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,019
BP is stable.

178
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:49,121
We've done everything we can.

179
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,964
It still might not be enough.

180
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,388
Say the word.

181
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,404
Here we go.

182
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,879
BP is tanking, 60/20.

183
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:16,131
Her heart rate is skyrocketing.

184
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,806
Potassium is high,
which makes sense.

185
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,142
But her hemoglobin is 5.

186
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:21,820
She's profoundly anemic.

187
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:23,822
We need two units of blood.

188
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:25,307
Where's it all going?

189
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,741
Her FAST was negative,
but that doesn't rule out

190
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,393
a pelvic fracture.

191
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:32,089
Well, if she fell with enough
force to fracture her pelvis,

192
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,173
there's no telling
what other damage might be done.

193
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,511
This is as stable
as she's gonna get.

194
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,824
Let's get her to CT and figure
out what we're dealing with.

195
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,100
Uh, Hundley, page Kit.

196
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,935
- Tell her to meet us there.
- Okay.

197
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,170
The Sutton stuff is wild.

198
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,414
And beyond cruel. Poor Billie.

199
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:53,185
I read that she was banned from
practicing medicine in the U.S.

200
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:54,861
Come on, Janice.
That's not true.

201
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:55,946
How do you know?

202
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,607
I know, okay?

203
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:59,034
Can't you tell
these are all lies?

204
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:01,118
I didn't realize
you were such a fan.

205
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,443
I thought you didn't like her.

206
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,778
I don't like unwarranted
character assassinations.

207
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,032
- Preach, Trevor.
- You do realize people are trying

208
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:09,126
to destroy her reputation with
no proof and you're piling on.

209
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,187
When hundreds of people
are all saying the same thing,

210
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,297
you can't just discount it.

211
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,799
You can't blindly
believe it, either.

212
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,026
All I'm saying is that
where there's smoke

213
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,759
there's usually fire.

214
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:26,467
Hey, Hawkins.

215
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,336
Do you know what's up
with this Sutton thing?

216
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,647
- I assume it's getting worse.
- By the minute.

217
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,306
I know she's your friend.
Is there anything I can do?

218
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,734
Shut down any rumors
you hear around this place.

219
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:36,736
The gossip mill
is amplifying everything.

220
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,979
Yeah, that intern Trevor
was pretty upset.

221
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,298
Trevor?

222
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:43,068
- Why?
- I don't know.

223
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:46,245
But he was defending
the hell out of her.

224
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,480
- Hey.
- Hey.

225
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:58,925
You know I care about you,
right?

226
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:00,736
What is going on here?

227
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,755
Hmm, I wish I could
tell you, Conrad.

228
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,182
You can.

229
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,675
Uh, you won't understand.

230
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,598
Actually, the only person
who ever did

231
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:14,357
was Nic.

232
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:18,361
Times like this,
I really miss her.

233
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:23,491
Nic wouldn't want you
to carry this weight alone.

234
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:25,952
Talk to me.

235
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,445
I filed an ethics complaint

236
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:38,280
against a doctor
who's up for a seat

237
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:40,959
on the state medical board.

238
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:43,636
And now he's trying
to destroy you?

239
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,395
What kind of ethics complaint?

240
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:56,983
Uh, it was a...

241
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,735
"Me Too" kind of a thing.

242
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:03,280
I am so sorry.

243
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:06,243
When did this happen?

244
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,327
A long time ago.

245
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,330
- Too long ago.
- Doesn't matter.

246
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:13,417
We will fight back. Go public.

247
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,627
- Out him for the monster he is.
- I can't.

248
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,463
Why not?

249
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,299
It's complicated.

250
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:26,930
Please just keep this
between us.

251
00:13:27,897 --> 00:13:31,398
- Promise me.
- Of course.

252
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,521
But if you're going into battle,
I want to be your wingman.

253
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:55,207
So, our window washer, who took
an unexpected bungee jump,

254
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:58,452
she has a spinal compression
and a pelvic fracture.

255
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,379
The spinal compression
appears minor.

256
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,018
No reason to believe
it wouldn't heal on its own,

257
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:06,682
but that pelvic fracture,
that's a different story.

258
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:09,184
Marshall told me what happened
with the board.

259
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:13,673
We are all standing
by you and Billie.

260
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,475
What he said.

261
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:19,336
We got your back, Boss Voss.
Just let us know what you need.

262
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:21,855
This.

263
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:24,609
Tara needs an open reduction
internal fixation

264
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:26,359
on her pelvis immediately.

265
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,446
It will be a brutal operation.

266
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,290
Incredibly long.

267
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,775
And I can't wait.

268
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:37,537
This is the best medicine
for Tara and me today.

269
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,548
I'll take it from here,
gentlemen.

270
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,373
Well, all right.

271
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,892
- Is it true?
- Depends. Which part?

272
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:51,119
Are you really a card-carrying
member of the Illuminati?

273
00:14:51,203 --> 00:14:52,804
That's ridiculous.
We don't carry cards anymore.

274
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:55,065
I've had Internet mobs
come after me.

275
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:56,566
It can happen to anyone.

276
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,058
Oh, yeah? What did you do?

277
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,404
Uh, something to do with
Christmas being a pagan holiday.

278
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:01,813
You know, nothing to do
with baby Jesus.

279
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:03,573
I didn't realize
I'd be unleashing Armageddon.

280
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:05,565
Well, I could have
told you that.

281
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:08,218
But this...
this is a little different.

282
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:09,786
Wait, uh...

283
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:12,749
So, were you really cut
from your residency

284
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,833
for harming a patient?

285
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:17,410
Mostly true.

286
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:20,580
'Cause I opened and closed for
my attending on a regular basis.

287
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:22,834
I'd done that procedure for him
at least a dozen times.

288
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:26,160
So, when he was late,
I started without him.

289
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:28,347
And it was a terrible call.

290
00:15:28,498 --> 00:15:31,016
I'll live with it
for the rest of my life.

291
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:35,169
But I was young and arrogant.

292
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,356
Can't really dock you
for youthful arrogance.

293
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,417
It's kind of my signature move.

294
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,904
But are you okay? Seriously.

295
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:49,092
Like you said,
it can happen to anyone.

296
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:50,911
Don't worry about me.

297
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:01,539
Double shift's almost over.
How you holding up?

298
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:03,298
My feet are killing me.

299
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:05,790
And I'm too tired to rub them.

300
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,967
Message received. Scoot.

301
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,781
- Come here.
- Hmm.

302
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:13,300
Another recruiter reached out.

303
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:15,887
This time to talk about a travel
nurse gig in Sacramento.

304
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:17,896
Did this one take no
for an answer?

305
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,185
I, um...

306
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:24,562
I might not have told her no.

307
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:26,813
I thought we agreed
moving wasn't an option.

308
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,325
Chastain is our home.

309
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:31,553
It's starting to feel like
a shelter for battered nurses.

310
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,637
You know I love Chastain,

311
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,665
but I don't know how long
I can take pulling triple duty.

312
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:37,490
This nursing shortage
has been hard,

313
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:39,326
- but it's temporary.
- Which means

314
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,545
it could be two weeks
or two years.

315
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:43,431
So you're going to meet her?

316
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:45,498
I won't sign anything

317
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,317
without talking to you first.

318
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,053
I just want to see
if the grass is any greener.

319
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:53,082
Okay.

320
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:56,768
Hey, you're just
the person I wanted to see.

321
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,763
Kit brought me up to speed
on the nursing shortage.

322
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,098
I know you've been
stretched thin.

323
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,841
More like flattened
to a pancake.

324
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:03,101
Well, I think we found a way
to lighten the load.

325
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:04,586
There's a handful
of nursing students

326
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,754
who can start
as early as tomorrow.

327
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:07,279
I appreciate the effort,
Dr. Bell,

328
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,773
but nursing students
aren't nurses.

329
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,592
They're just more work for us to train.

330
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:12,692
But they're extra hands
that we desperately need.

331
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:14,371
Which reminds me, can you
scrub in on a pelvic fracture?

332
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:15,695
Uh, I wish I could.

333
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:17,432
My shift just ended
and I have an appointment.

334
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:18,875
- Can't you reschedule?
- No, actually,

335
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,085
and that's what I want
to talk to you about, Dr. Bell.

336
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,672
I'm meeting with a recruiter.

337
00:17:28,284 --> 00:17:30,210
- You're leaving us?
- No.

338
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:33,213
I mean, not yet.
I'm-I'm just testing the waters.

339
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:36,301
Jessica, you are a crucial
member of this team.

340
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:37,476
Especially to me.

341
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:40,128
Of course, but I...
I know I speak

342
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:44,941
for every other surgeon when
I say you hold tremendous value.

343
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:47,571
I know.

344
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:50,781
That's why I have
to explore my options.

345
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:57,812
Mrs. Wharthon? You can't leave.

346
00:17:57,906 --> 00:18:00,226
You're supposed to be getting
prepped for your laminectomy.

347
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,659
That's cancelled.

348
00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:04,152
- I don't understand.
- Look, I would have to be

349
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:06,487
a fool to allow myself
to be operated on

350
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:09,582
by a surgeon
who killed a patient.

351
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:12,344
At the very hospital
that turned a blind eye.

352
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:15,238
Hey, Irene, Irene...

353
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,589
I hear your concern.

354
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:18,435
But neither
of those things happened.

355
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,019
You expect me to believe that?

356
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:37,869
Pelvic reduction
forceps, please.

357
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:43,375
You know, this lack of
support is really killing my vibe.

358
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,043
With all the scrub nurses gone,

359
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,964
who's going to remember
to feed your ego?

360
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:51,134
Oh, I can tell you've
had a rough day today, Dr. Voss,

361
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:52,959
so I'm gonna let that one slide.

362
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:54,794
Randolph.

363
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:56,881
Did we call
for a general surgeon?

364
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:58,849
No, just filling in for Jessica.

365
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,478
Randolph Bell.

366
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:03,562
The man, the myth,
the scrub nurse.

367
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:06,139
Ever think you'd gain

368
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:07,733
two jobs in one day, darling?

369
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:10,402
Uh, let's hold off
on the pet names for a sec.

370
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:13,071
Looks like we got a problem.

371
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:17,160
Must have injured a vessel

372
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:18,477
pulling the anterior
pelvis together.

373
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:19,986
Yeah, the pulse is present.

374
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:22,481
But she must not be getting
any venous drainage to her legs.

375
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:25,083
And here I thought
my services were not needed.

376
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,245
Nurse Bell, scalpel.

377
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:29,254
Thank you.

378
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:31,256
Dissecting for proximal

379
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:34,259
and distal exposure.

380
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:36,870
Retractors.

381
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:38,764
Huh. Hmm.

382
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,327
New job looks good on you.

383
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:44,437
Don't get used to it.

384
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,015
All right.

385
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,170
All right, well,
there you have it.

386
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,599
All credit for the save

387
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:01,620
goes to our exceptional
new scrub nurse.

388
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,859
I'll be right back
to check on you, all right?

389
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,451
What now?

390
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:20,992
As hard as this is to say,
you were right.

391
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:23,597
I shouldn't have said
anything about Dr. Sutton.

392
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,315
Yeah, you think?

393
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,639
Everything okay?

394
00:20:28,723 --> 00:20:31,477
Dr. Sutton submitted
an ethics complaint

395
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:32,829
against a very powerful doctor
who's trying

396
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:34,491
to get on the state
medical board

397
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:36,477
and now he's retaliating.

398
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:38,250
Whoa, wait,
an ethics complaint? When?

399
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:39,585
Apparently it was
a long time ago,

400
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:41,261
but that's not the worst part.

401
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:46,859
The complaint was that
he is a sexual predator.

402
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:53,744
Give me your phone so I know
you're not recording this.

403
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:00,358
Now yours.

404
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:02,286
Okay.

405
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:05,512
Here's the offer.

406
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:06,748
You pull your name
out of the running

407
00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:08,107
for the state medical board,

408
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:09,999
I'll say it was a case
of mistaken identity

409
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:11,343
and withdraw my statement.

410
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:13,554
Why do you care so much
about the state medical board?

411
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:15,914
A predator like you has
no place passing judgment

412
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,759
on the ethics of other doctors.

413
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:21,371
We remember the past
very differently.

414
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:24,799
I was 13. The law is clear.

415
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,190
You're in no position
to give me ultimatums.

416
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,793
You have no proof,
not one shred of evidence

417
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:36,468
to back up your accusation.

418
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,970
What you do have

419
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:41,299
is a checkered past of your own
that includes malpractice.

420
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:43,308
I was a resident,
and my attending

421
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,453
was legally responsible.

422
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:47,888
But I already paid the price
for that. It's long over.

423
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:50,390
Clearly, that is not the case.

424
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:52,568
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

425
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:57,881
I am one of the most prominent,
revered doctors in Georgia.

426
00:22:57,974 --> 00:23:00,077
Your word against mine,
you lose every time.

427
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:04,738
- Then why are you here?
- I want my record cleared.

428
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:07,342
Withdraw the complaint.

429
00:23:07,426 --> 00:23:10,169
That is enough of a bargain.

430
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,083
You have an impressive résumé,
Jessica.

431
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:26,586
There are a dozen hospitals
that would kill

432
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,791
to have you on their roster.

433
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,183
Any of these hospitals
happen to be in Georgia?

434
00:23:30,267 --> 00:23:31,759
Atlanta, specifically?

435
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,828
Currently, we're only looking
to fill positions in Sacramento.

436
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:36,830
Which is far away.

437
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:38,498
Look,

438
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:41,610
I have the greatest respect
for nurses. My sister is one.

439
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:44,187
I know all about the scut work,
the-the double shifts.

440
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:46,022
You're not appreciated
as you should be.

441
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:49,100
And you're certainly
not compensated as such.

442
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,452
But that is changing.

443
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,448
FHM will not only cover
your relocation expenses,

444
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:59,369
we will pay you $7,500 a week
for only 48 hours of work.

445
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:01,204
Comes out to $150 dollars
an hour.

446
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,632
With unparalleled
health benefits,

447
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:08,296
and we will pay for your housing
as long as you're with us.

448
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,472
- Wow.
- Not to mention,

449
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,641
in California,
nurses are unionized,

450
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,635
so if you decide
to stay longer...

451
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,313
This is an intriguing offer.

452
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,274
But I need to think about it.

453
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,894
Well, my flight leaves
in six hours,

454
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:27,574
so I'll need an answer by then.

455
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:30,053
Oh.

456
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:31,819
Okay.

457
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:40,069
Is the pain normal?

458
00:24:40,153 --> 00:24:41,561
Unfortunately.

459
00:24:41,654 --> 00:24:43,320
You underwent
a massive pelvic repair.

460
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:45,833
The harness that saved you
almost cost you your life.

461
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,835
It may take you a while
before you're scaling

462
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,844
the sides of buildings again,

463
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,572
but give it time.

464
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:53,766
And, until then,
we'll try to keep you

465
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,934
as comfortable as possible.

466
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:56,559
Thank you.

467
00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:01,941
That's all right, dear,
just let it out.

468
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,607
Sorry about that.

469
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:15,778
The anesthesia used in surgery
makes most people nauseous.

470
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:19,016
Surgery? Who had surgery?

471
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,376
You did. After the fall.

472
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:24,195
Don't you remember?

473
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,698
Tara, can you tell us
where you are?

474
00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:35,557
This might be uncomfortable.

475
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,478
Absent gag reflex. Confusion.

476
00:25:38,562 --> 00:25:42,564
This could be a sign
of cerebellar herniation.

477
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,289
<i>What exactly are you saying?</i>

478
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:03,251
I'm withdrawing my complaint
against Porter.

479
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,235
Why?

480
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:05,395
If he was so sure
of his position,

481
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,755
he wouldn't have met with you.

482
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:07,756
He's scared.

483
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,981
- So am I.
- Of what?

484
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,677
Of where this is heading.

485
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:12,168
Don't let him
get into your head.

486
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,422
Look, I am willing
to take any blow myself.

487
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,172
I'm tough enough to handle it.

488
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,674
But I can't inflict damage
on you or Chastain.

489
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,751
I won't fight a battle
I can't win

490
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,604
if it ends up hurting
the people I love.

491
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:25,356
- We're not afraid.
- We're fighting with you.

492
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:28,664
Billie, has something else
happened?

493
00:26:32,949 --> 00:26:37,327
I got pregnant when I was raped,
and I had the baby.

494
00:26:39,272 --> 00:26:42,123
Uh, we've reconnected.

495
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,620
But he's starting to ask
questions and figure things out.

496
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:48,772
If he finds out
how he came into this world,

497
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,256
it might destroy him.

498
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,870
I have to protect him.

499
00:26:54,954 --> 00:26:56,638
I have to put an end to this.

500
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:59,599
We'll stand with you.

501
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,644
Whatever your decision.

502
00:27:12,928 --> 00:27:14,815
Hey. I got your text. What's up?

503
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,242
Did you know Billie
had filed a complaint

504
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:18,745
against a state
medical board nominee?

505
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:19,987
What are you talking about?

506
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,888
He's the one coming
after her online.

507
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:24,585
Because of some interaction
they had a while ago.

508
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,310
I think I figured out who he is.

509
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,779
Listen, Trevor,
you need to stop. All right?

510
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:30,664
- If Billie didn't tell you any of this...
- Yeah, that's the point.

511
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:32,333
Why would she hide it?
Why would she...

512
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,335
Why would she care if I know
about an ethics complaint

513
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,177
against some-some random doctor?

514
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,179
I am advising you,
as your mentor

515
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,766
and your friend,
you need to drop this.

516
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,676
There are only two nominees
to the state medical board.

517
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,687
Bell and this guy.

518
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,182
His name is Robert Porter.

519
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,524
And that's not all I know.

520
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:52,019
I, um, I did this deep dive.

521
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:56,531
It turns out Porter lived
in the same town as Billie.

522
00:27:56,682 --> 00:27:58,107
Same neighborhood.

523
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,202
Until her family moved away,
and you know when they did that?

524
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:02,789
Six months before I was born.

525
00:28:02,873 --> 00:28:05,264
- All right, that's enough. That's it.
- No, no...

526
00:28:05,358 --> 00:28:06,867
You don't know
when to quit, do you?

527
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,777
See, that's your problem.
You don't know anything

528
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:12,706
- about boundaries, Trevor.
- Boundaries?

529
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,634
Boundaries?

530
00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:16,877
Really?

531
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,529
There was no high school romance

532
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,553
with a football player,
was there?

533
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:22,805
No accidental pregnancy.

534
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,568
You know the truth.

535
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:31,190
You need to tell me, um...

536
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:37,673
Robert Porter is my father,
isn't he?

537
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,418
She was 13.

538
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,172
He was an adult.

539
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:59,385
He forced himself on her, and...

540
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:04,766
I'm the product of a rape?

541
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,519
Trevor.

542
00:29:06,603 --> 00:29:11,272
All this time she was
protecting me from the truth.

543
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:17,197
That my biological father
is a monster.

544
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,025
Trevor, listen to me.

545
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,039
You are the product
of your own actions.

546
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:30,710
- You hear me?
- No.

547
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:33,369
Trevor. Trevor!

548
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,779
How's Billie doing?

549
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:38,132
- Is she joining us?
- I don't know.

550
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,469
There's a lot going on.
None of it good.

551
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,136
What's the story?

552
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,138
Tara made it through
an extensive orthopedic

553
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,899
and vascular surgery.

554
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:54,390
Then she developed signs

555
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,310
- of cerebellar herniation.
- What do you see?

556
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,968
Right here.

557
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,213
A traumatic Chiari malformation.

558
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:01,908
It's subtle.
Trauma CTs can easily miss it.

559
00:30:01,992 --> 00:30:03,743
But how did it happen?

560
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:05,152
There wasn't any direct trauma
to her head.

561
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,995
She did have that

562
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,404
spinal fracture.

563
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,232
- It looked stable, but...
- That can cause a tear

564
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:12,418
in the dura, allowing
spinal fluid to leak out.

565
00:30:12,502 --> 00:30:15,670
So we need to close the leak.
First with a spinal surgery,

566
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,505
and then the brain.

567
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,007
I can do it.

568
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,824
Are you sure

569
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:22,510
you're in the right headspace?

570
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:24,338
No doubt.

571
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,682
Well, I'd never bet
against Dr. Billie Sutton.

572
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,938
As Dr. Voss is aware,
I have a hard out,

573
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:35,440
so I'll take Tara to the OR now.

574
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:41,587
Is she gonna fight?

575
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:42,756
No.

576
00:30:42,848 --> 00:30:44,940
The fight is already lost.

577
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:50,203
All we can do is respect
her decision and her privacy...

578
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:51,789
...and back her.

579
00:30:57,631 --> 00:31:00,048
Glad to have you
back in the OR, Dr. Sutton.

580
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,175
We missed you.

581
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:12,733
We need music.

582
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:18,306
<i>"Groove Me"

583
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,147
Whoa, that's
under a lot of pressure.

584
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,968
It is. And you're gonna open it.

585
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:30,237
Efficiently,
so that the cerebellum

586
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,722
doesn't herniate out
the dural opening.

We have to access

How do we do that?

599
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:03,771
We need to cauterize the bottom
of the cerebellum.

600
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,105
That's the only way
we can decompress this.

601

Well, what number

614
00:32:39,573 --> 00:32:42,699
I want to know what Chastain
is offering first.

615
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:02,908
HFM's offer was double.

616
00:33:05,261 --> 00:33:06,721
You can't be serious.

617
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:10,170
But the cost of living
in California is higher, so...

618
00:33:10,308 --> 00:33:13,476
to adjust for that,

619
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,142
I'd need at least...

620
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:28,776
And you have to hire
five more nurses.

621
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,612
- Real ones, not students.
- I...

622
00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:33,065
No more three-to-one assignments
in the ICU.

623
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,737
And stop the mandatory overtime.

624
00:33:34,822 --> 00:33:37,604
Kit has given me
this much room...

625
00:33:37,689 --> 00:33:39,415
and that's it.

626
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,479
You can have three nurses.

627
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:48,225
And... let me just say
that this family

628
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,908
is more than the sum
of its parts.

629
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:52,233
It's like any family.

630
00:33:53,747 --> 00:33:56,998
So do we have a deal?

631
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:09,171
Okay.

632
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:16,861
Oh, Kit told me that you
scrubbed in, in my place.

633
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,603
It made me feel
warm and fuzzy inside.

634
00:34:19,688 --> 00:34:21,167
Yeah, it was a humbling moment
in my career.

635
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:25,345
And one of
the most enlightening.

636
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,691
I'm glad you're staying.

637
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:30,108
Me, too.

638
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:40,548
It's gonna be fine.
Don't worry.

639
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,362
This seat taken?

640
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,396
You didn't have to come.

641
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,408
Yes, we did.

642
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:20,386
We're a team.

643
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:22,079
Teams stick together.

644
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:24,273
- Hey, buddy. Thanks.
- Hey, how are you?

645
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:38,133
So, Dr. Sutton,

646
00:35:38,506 --> 00:35:40,273
you called this meeting.

647
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,314
You have something
you want to say,

648
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:44,747
now is the moment.

649
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:52,190
I'm here
to withdraw my complaint

650
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,168
against Dr. Porter.

651
00:35:56,706 --> 00:36:00,464
Dr. Sutton, you owe
this board an explanation.

652
00:36:00,745 --> 00:36:04,699
Why come up with this heinous
lie against a fellow doctor?

653
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:07,556
A pillar
of our medical community?

654
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:09,307
- A...
- Pedophile.

655
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:17,550
This is a private
meeting, young man.

656
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:19,837
I'm sorry, but...

657
00:36:20,164 --> 00:36:21,980
but who the hell are you?

658
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:24,333
My name is Dr. Trevor Daniels.

659
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,941
I was born August 3, 1995

660
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:30,065
to my mother, Dr. Billie Sutton,

661
00:36:30,214 --> 00:36:31,564
and Robert Porter, who raped her

662
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:33,983
when she was 13 years old.

663
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:37,104
Okay, this...

664
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:39,848
this is a ridiculous stunt.

665
00:36:39,942 --> 00:36:41,775
Test my DNA against his.

666
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:44,706
I am the living proof that
everything my mom says is true.

667
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,208
Oh, my God.

668
00:37:06,543 --> 00:37:09,004
- Is this number real?
- Really real.

669
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:11,636
- And Bell signed off on it?
- Uh-huh.

670
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:14,364
Aren't you gonna say something?

671
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:17,392
- This is more money than I make.
- I know. Are you mad?

672
00:37:17,537 --> 00:37:18,795
Are you kidding me?

673
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:21,112
I have a sugar mama.

674
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,384
Yes! Hello!

675
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:27,729
I'm so proud of you.

676
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:29,731
We can set up
your weekly allowance.

677
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,901
- You can buy me a new car.
- Okay.

678
00:37:35,313 --> 00:37:37,231
Hey.

679
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:38,464
How was work?

680
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:40,401
You rushed out pretty quick
this morning.

681
00:37:40,485 --> 00:37:41,661
Yeah, I know.

682
00:37:41,745 --> 00:37:43,319
Today was weird.

683
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:45,246
But I'm here now.

684
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,875
Are you buying a house?

685
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:52,662
Are you leaving me?

686
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:55,090
We need to talk.

687
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:57,834
Please don't go.

688
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:01,337
Look, I know
I bailed on you earlier.

689
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:03,823
And I'm always grumpy.

690
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:06,101
And I think about strangling you

691
00:38:06,252 --> 00:38:07,669
every time I step
on one of your crystals.

692
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:09,545
Okay, they have
to charge somewhere.

693
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,030
Not on the floor.

694
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,936
The point is,
I love having you here.

695
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,279
In Atlanta, close to me,
so if you're

696
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:21,098
trying to run away, please stay.

697
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:24,268
I'm not running away, Leel.

698
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:26,454
I'm... adulting.

699
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:28,708
Okay.

700
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:31,701
Well, that's great.

701
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:34,629
I've been thinking
a lot about my future.

702
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,523
And while #VanLife

703
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:39,780
has its perks, it's holding me

704
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:42,555
back from what I actually want.

705
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:45,306
A child.

706
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,957
I want to have a baby.

707
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:48,868
But I thought
with the leukemia, it's...

708
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:51,204
I can't get pregnant on my own.

709
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:54,056
That's... that's why I wanted
to talk to you.

710
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,393
Do you want to adopt?

711
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:58,895
Or look for a surrogate?

712
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:02,157
I could gather resources
from Chastain.

713
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:04,652
Um, no, I, um,

714
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:07,822
I want this baby to be

715
00:39:07,906 --> 00:39:10,239
100% me.

716
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,834
And since we're

717
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:15,912
identical twins,
I was wondering...

718
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:18,758
would you give me
one of your eggs?

719
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:20,917
My eggs?

720
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:23,412
In your body?

721
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:24,846
It makes perfect sense.

722
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,182
You and I are
genetically identical.

723
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,742
It would be no different
than me using one of my own.

724
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:31,811
I understand, it's just...

725
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,111
It's a lot
to wrap my head around.

726
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:39,854
And...

727
00:39:39,938 --> 00:39:43,781
in a very real way,
it would be my kid, as well.

728
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,609
And who would
take care of it...?

729
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,536
Adulting, remember?

730
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:51,998
This is... about me growing up.

731
00:39:55,545 --> 00:39:57,879
Anyone home?

732
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:03,259
Just think about it.

733
00:40:07,707 --> 00:40:10,225
- Hey.
- Hi.

734
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:13,019
Did I miss anything?

735
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,956
What did the
lieutenant governor say?

736
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:31,783
Well, Porter's out.

737
00:40:32,323 --> 00:40:35,141
And, hopefully, when the results
of the DNA test come back in,

738
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,669
he'll lose
his license to practice

739
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:37,994
in the state of Georgia.

740
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:40,129
I wouldn't mind seeing him
behind bars.

741
00:40:42,092 --> 00:40:45,126
Does this mean you'll be
on the medical board?

742
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:47,254
Looks that way.

743
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:50,098
Thanks to Billie.

744
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:05,113
You didn't have to do that.

745
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,597
I did.

746
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:09,767
You were incredibly brave.

747
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:11,370
So were you.

748
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:14,956
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you from this.

749
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:19,702
But I'm proud
of how you handled it.

750
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:22,456
Are you okay, Trevor?

751
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,465
I...

752
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:27,093
honestly, I-I don't know.

753
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,314
I'm sorry, I-I think
I just need some time.

754
00:41:32,399 --> 00:41:35,834
Away from all this.

755
00:41:36,295 --> 00:41:37,812
Okay.

756
00:41:46,305 --> 00:41:48,315
Thank you.

757
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:51,567
And I'm here if you...

758
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,953
Okay.

759
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:11,845
Hey.

760
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,742
You okay?

761
00:42:20,172 --> 00:42:22,016
Yes.

762
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,817
Or, at least, I will be.

763
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,014
You know, tomorrow's my day off.

764
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:31,757
My dad has Gigi.

765
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:34,017
You want to go somewhere
with me and just...

766
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,617
talk?

767
00:42:37,529 --> 00:42:39,922
I don't want you to be alone.

768
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,336
I'd like that.
