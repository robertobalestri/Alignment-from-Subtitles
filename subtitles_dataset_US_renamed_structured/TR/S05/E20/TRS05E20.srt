00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:03,834
Hawkins,
what's your problem?

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:04,890
This is the pharmacist

4
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:06,531
<i>who filled
the fake prescriptions.</i>

5
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:08,484
Hey, what are you doing?

6
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:10,687
Phoebe agreed
to wear a wire for us.

7
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,085
Someone must've found out.

8
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,515
We got a good look
at the killer.

9
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,422
- How's Padma?
- Depressed about AJ.

10
00:00:15,507 --> 00:00:17,079
What if I offer
to be the sperm donor?

11
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:18,990
- You can't be serious.
- Why not?

12
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:20,859
Because I couldn't handle that.

13
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:22,328
Mom?

14
00:00:23,617 --> 00:00:26,281
If it's not too late, I would
like to be your sperm donor.

15
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:28,828
Yes, yes, yes!

16
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:31,659
But there is a condition.
So if we're going to do this,

17
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:33,828
I don't want to just be a donor.

18
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:36,931
I want to be a father.

At least for now.

When we buried my father here,

49
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:18,365
three years ago,
my mother wanted

50
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,570
to plant a tree
to mark his grave.

51
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:23,757
She told me
that even after death,

52
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:26,570
she would always want
to be by his side.

As long as I decide
to stay at Chastain,

65
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:21,745
- they've given me an armed escort.
- Good.

66
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:23,072
You need that protection.

67
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:26,304
Yeah, but it's not exactly
a long-term solution.

68
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:30,188
What are you doing?
We have to get to work.

69
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:32,424
Woke up in the middle of the
night wondering about my will.

70
00:03:32,508 --> 00:03:34,100
It was written
a very long time ago

71
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:35,268
and needs to be updated.

72
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:36,961
Funerals do have that effect.

73
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:38,931
- I should probably update mine.
- Well, it turns out

74
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,359
that if I drop dead tomorrow,
everything I own

75
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:44,016
- goes to my ex-wife.
- Feel free to leave her that boat.

76
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:45,620
Lord knows
I'm not maintaining it.

77
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,187
It's serious.

78
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:49,508
You are not about
to drop dead, I promise.

79
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:52,277
People younger than me die
on the treadmill every day.

80
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,619
I just need a trust

81
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:56,040
that benefits
you and Jake and Sammie.

82
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,963
And because Georgia doesn't
recognize common-law marriage,

83
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:01,281
your part in this could be,
you know, pretty complicated.

84
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,958
I have everything I want.

85
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,296
Leave it all to them.

86
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:06,473
Well, I don't want to do that.

87
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:10,028
Okay, let's get married then.

88
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:21,402
So, this is the way

89
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:22,750
you ask me?

90
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,881
No... no fancy dinner?

91
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:26,209
No big ring?

92
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:29,537
Just... didn't even
get down on one knee.

93
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,257
I love you to the moon and back.

94
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:34,369
But I kneel for no man.

95
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,554
Okay, okay.

96
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,991
I've heard your proposal.
I would like, uh,

97
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:44,390
maybe a week to think about it.

98
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:47,023
- Oh, stop it.
- It's a big decision.

99
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,110
So, are we talking, like,
big destination wedding

100
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:56,354
on Lake Como? 'Cause I could,
I could get behind that.

101
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:59,665
I'm thinking a ceremony
in the backyard.

102
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,618
We've both been married twice.

103
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:04,579
What about my bridesmaids?

104
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:09,020
I want it to be special.

105
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:10,955
It will be.

106
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:17,093
<i>And it's that easy?</i>

107
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:20,500
Medicare will pay for anything
if you got the right story.

108
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:23,250
Just last week, I told 'em
my cane wasn't cutting it.

109
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:24,663
I don't even have a cane.

110
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:25,950
And just like that,

111
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:29,836
they handed me
a shiny new motorized scooter.

112
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:33,651
Paid for 100%
by the taxpayers of America.

113
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:34,877
Remind me to count
the wheelchairs.

114
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,311
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm no thief.

115
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,646
But I am an opportunist.

116
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,980
If I had a house,

117
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,557
I'd have one
of them poofy chairs that tilt

118
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:43,576
to help you stand up

119
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:45,486
and an automated bed, too.

120
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:49,508
All I need is a prescription
from a willing doc, cutie.

121
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:51,687
And I know where to find 'em.

122
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:53,745
Yeah, but you don't want
that kind of doc

123
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:54,897
to actually treat you.

124
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,738
So, what brought you in today?

125
00:05:56,907 --> 00:06:00,361
Uh, had a bit of a rumble
a while back with this...

126
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,987
numbnut moving in on my block.

127
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,506
We got into it over
a hot chicken sandwich some...

128
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:07,338
do-gooder brought me.

129
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:10,596
I've been trying to treat it
on my own, but...

130
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,284
That ulcer looks
severely infected.

131
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:15,144
Well, if you want
to keep that arm,

132
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:16,537
we need to clear the infection.

133
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:19,741
Hey. Thought you could use
a pick-me-up.

134
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,164
Triple espresso with an absurd
amount of hazelnut creamer.

135
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:24,960
Thanks.

136
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,612
So, Cade showed up,

137
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:28,113
so I'm off this afternoon.

138
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:30,343
And your shift is over.
You want to grab lunch?

139
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:31,709
Uh, I can't.

140
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:33,608
I have another surgery.

141
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,212
You're starting another shift?

142
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,869
You sure that's a good idea?
You've been here all night.

143
00:06:37,953 --> 00:06:39,948
It's an interesting case.

144
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,617
I'll manage.

145
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:43,302
Leela.

146
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:45,890
Um...

147
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,318
we need to talk.

148
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:48,552
What's there to talk about?

149
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,919
- We're fine.
- I thought so, too.

150
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:52,790
But you haven't been home
all week,

151
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,796
and we've barely spoken
since I floated the idea

152
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,642
of being Padma's sperm donor.

153
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:58,961
Okay.

154
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,453
Truth bomb...

155
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,742
I'm still trying
to process that.

156
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:04,825
Okay.

157
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:05,992
So it...

158
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:07,809
it is still an issue.

159
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:09,286
Leela.

160
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:10,805
Pre-op. Let's go.

161
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,082
Right behind you.

162
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,044
We'll talk tonight.

163
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:16,189
I think we better.

164
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:28,375
This is your second shift,
right?

165
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,854
Sure you don't need that coffee?

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,920
Positive. The adrenaline alone
is enough to keep me up.

167
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:34,576
Especially for a case like this.

168
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,414
Well, a full spinal
reconstruction is a great case.

169
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,599
But it's a marathon,

170
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,267
not a sprint.

171
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,612
Eight to ten hours.

172
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:43,689
A challenge of sheer endurance.

173
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:44,782
I can find someone else

174
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,450
- if you're tapped out.
- No.

175
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,484
I'm good.

176
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,443
I got this.

177
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:50,871
Is that our patient?

178
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:52,645
Yes. Ashley.

179
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,207
24-year-old female
with congenital dextroscoliosis

180
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,101
of the thoracic
and lumbar spine.

181
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:59,462
The pain has started limiting
her activity level, and...

182
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:02,051
she's not the type of person
to be limited.

183
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:03,911
Can one of you tell
my bossy wife

184
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:06,339
that stumbling around
like a troll to get my steps in

185
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:08,057
is irrelevant at this point?

186
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:09,908
Movement is medicine.

187
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:12,277
Music to my ears.

188
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:14,753
Naomi is also
Ashley's physical therapist.

189
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:16,663
I have to input some notes.

190
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:20,777
But Dr. Devi here
will talk you through pre-op.

191
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:24,370
Is that how you two met?

192
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:27,328
I thought I was getting
a lifetime of free massages.

193
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:29,081
But, instead, I get a lecture

194
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,558
every time
my butt touches a chair.

195
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:32,370
She is a couch potato.

196
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:34,295
It's because I can
barely get up off the couch.

197
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,081
That's true.

198
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,222
Well, we need a few more hours
to run all your pre-op tests.

199
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:41,566
The surgery will be
in the early afternoon.

200
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:45,391
Look at me, Dr. Sutton.
Don't I seem rarin' to go?

201
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:46,727
You're very brave.

202
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,027
I know this is scary.

203
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:50,253
- She's terrified.
- Well,

204
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:53,365
let me give you some hope
to hold on to.

205
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:55,426
It's just a mock-up,

206
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,610
but we should be able
to get pretty close.

207
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,849
As long as you make me taller
than Naomi,

208
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:03,208
I'm good.

209
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:04,876
Now get some rest.

210
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:06,044
You earned it.

211
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,698
Her type and screen
will be back in an hour, and...

212
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,377
it'll be another hour
until our OR is clean.

213
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:16,808
Find an empty bed
and get some rest until then.

214
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:18,162
I'll call you when we're ready.

215
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,074
That's an order.

216
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:50,895
I've seen a lot of gross stuff,

217
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,035
- but that has to take the cake.
- Seriously.

218
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,818
How do you get a fish hook
that size stuck in your cheek?

219
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:57,160
Really bad casting.

220
00:09:57,252 --> 00:09:58,136
Hey, did I show you

221
00:09:58,221 --> 00:10:00,262
this new game I got on my phone?

222
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:13,917
We need some help over here!
Please! Anybody!

223
00:10:14,353 --> 00:10:15,990
- What's your name, hon?
- Scott.

224
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:18,155
- But it's not me. It's my coworker.
- What happened?

225
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:19,833
We were working
on some power lines nearby.

226
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:22,529
Uh, the plate wasn't secure.
It fell on top of him.

227
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,926
Looks like a blunt chest wall
injury on his left side.

228
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:26,036
The plate must have crushed

229
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,958
his chest.
Obvious chest wall deformity.

230
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,347
He may have broken every rib
on that side.

231
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:31,672
And whatever's left of the lung

232
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,524
underneath clearly isn't doing
too well.

233
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:35,441
You got to help him.
He's a good guy.

234
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:37,043
He taught me everything I know.

235
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:38,784
Sir, can you please back up,
please?

236
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:39,900
Thank you.

237
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:41,870
IV is in.

238
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,058
Uh, let's give the doctors
some space.

239
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,315
- Thank you so much.
- He's not gonna make it

240
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,341
to the OR like this.
Let's intubate.

241
00:10:47,426 --> 00:10:48,592
Left lung is no<i> bueno.</i>

242
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:50,550
We need to do
a single lung ventilation.

243
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:52,277
You intubate, I'll position it
with the bronchoscope.

244
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,027
We got one good shot at this.

245
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,011
Pushing meds now.

246
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,683
Great view of the cords.

247
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:01,378
Inserting tube now.

248
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:04,886
Scope going in.

249
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:10,289
All right.

250
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:11,550
Advance.

251
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:13,260
Inflate the cuff.

252
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,301
He's stable.

253
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:24,404
But it won't matter
if we don't get him to an OR.

254
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:26,034
Okay, let's get transpo!

255
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:27,983
Hundley, let's call
for a portable chest X-ray

256
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:28,991
and page Austin.

257
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:30,077
Tell him
that I think our patient

258
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:31,583
needs to have his lung removed

259
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:32,943
using an emergent pneumonectomy.

260
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:34,243
Got it.

261
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:37,333
All right. Here you go.

262
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:40,587
- All right.
- Okay, hold on. This is a lot.

263
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,930
Yeah, but don't worry about it.
I will handle it all.

264
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,507
So far,
planning for our future child

265
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,353
has been a great distraction.

266
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:49,011
"Our" future child?

267
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:51,672
AJ, I need a sperm donor, okay?

268
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:53,024
Not-not all this.

269
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,851
Look, Padma,

270
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:56,706
I understand it's a lot.

271
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,187
But bear with me. All right?

272
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:01,659
I assure you, it will be worth
my top-shelf DNA.

273
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:03,019
Arrogant.

274
00:12:03,378 --> 00:12:04,378
But accurate.

275
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:05,587
All right, let's hear it.

276
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:07,281
So, I took the liberty
of opening up

277
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:09,849
a 529 savings account
for the baby.

278
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,210
I will fund it annually

279
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:14,111
to make sure our child's
college tuition is paid in full.

280
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:15,796
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

281
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:17,123
I don't want your money.

282
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,081
You're turning down
a college fund?

283
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:21,210
Ivy League schools
are expensive.

284
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:22,269
Okay, well,

285
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:24,114
what if they don't want to go
to an Ivy League?

286
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:25,949
Or college at all?

287
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:27,958
Good one.

288
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:30,621
All right,
moving on to my main point.

289
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:34,964
Now, I have bio siblings
and parents who I barely know.

290
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:37,893
We're not in touch and
I can't consider them family.

291
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:39,159
And I want a family.

292
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:40,813
Okay, see? This is...

293
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:42,064
this is what I was afraid of.

294
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:44,222
We're not creating a family.

295
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:46,827
I know. But we agreed
that I would be involved

296
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:48,378
- in the child's life.
- Yes.

297
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,690
Involved means visitations,

298
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,441
occasionally, on my schedule.

299
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:56,879
No. No, the child needs to know
that I am their father.

300
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:00,940
Okay, look, you can be there
on birthdays and holidays

301
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,025
and, look, some weekends, too.

302
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:05,513
What are you doing?
We-We're not done here.

303
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:09,176
Padma, I get
that you are a free spirit.

304
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:12,244
But a child has to have a roof
over their head,

305
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,179
- financial security.
- Okay, I have a roof.

306
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:17,309
You are not raising our child
in a van.

307
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:18,675
That's a deal-breaker.

308
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,279
You hear me?

309
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:22,012
Look, I'm needed in the OR.
I'll be back.

310
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:24,348
Okay, but we haven't
settled anything,

311
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,009
except for the fact
that you're gonna be controlling

312
00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:27,496
and I won't be controlled.

313
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,629
I hear you. We're gonna
work it out, all right?

314
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:31,457
Just look over the papers.
I'll be back in a couple hours.

315
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,457
Mm.

316
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,134
Seriously?

317
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:53,793
Sorry to interrupt
your beauty rest, Devi,

318
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:55,380
but I'm on deck,

319
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:56,972
which of course means
you are, too.

320
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:59,519
No. I'm supposed to be
with Dr. Sutton today.

321
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:01,401
Yeah? Well,
you look pretty busy.

322
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:05,160
Now, if you'd like to opt out
of an emergent pneumonectomy,

323
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,233
then be my guest.

324
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:07,729
Pneumonectomy?

325
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:09,511
You're joking, right?

326
00:14:09,628 --> 00:14:10,988
By now, you know me well enough

327
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:12,654
to know the things
I do not joke about.

328
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:14,824
But if you have better things
to do...

329
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:16,091
No.

330
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:18,612
Who needs sleep anyway?

331
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:20,998
My thoughts exactly.

332
00:14:28,612 --> 00:14:32,181
Eh, free food and
a warm blanket, I'm all good.

333
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,687
- Not all good.
- What?

334
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:36,212
You still have a fever, and we

335
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:37,746
flooded you with antibiotics.

336
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:39,864
So, if this combination
doesn't work, we need a plan B.

337
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:41,801
I-I didn't know
there was antibiotics.

338
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:44,196
If antibiotics was gonna work,
I wouldn't be here.

339
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,340
Why is that?

340
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:49,066
I'm already on one.
I've been on one for weeks.

341
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:51,589
I had a bout of walking
pneumonia last month,

342
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:54,464
and I went to Atlanta General ER

343
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:55,561
that time.

344
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,042
I'm an equal opportunity
ER surfer.

345
00:14:58,151 --> 00:15:01,319
They gave me, um, these.

346
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,305
You didn't mention these meds.

347
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:09,879
I need to know everything
you're taking.

348
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:11,905
That's the only one.

349
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:14,562
I owe my life
to fish oil and whiskey.

350
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,456
And lenvatinib.

351
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,659
- This one's for cancer.
- Seriously? Huh.

352
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:21,127
Well, they must have given me
the wrong bottle.

353
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,738
This drug costs, like,
$10,000 a month.

354
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,655
Huh, and it was prescribed

355
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,684
by a Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

356
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:28,926
Funny, think I'd remember that.

357
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:31,053
You know,
if I wanted a pat-down,

358
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:33,330
I would've gone through TSA.
I got to get out of here.

359
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,824
Relax. Just take a second.

360
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:40,012
Look...

361
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,134
I don't know anything.

362
00:15:42,695 --> 00:15:45,797
I'm a nobody. I'm a little cog

363
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:47,863
in a very big machine.

364
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:50,264
I could end up at the bottom

365
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,840
of a lake
with my feet in concrete.

366
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,859
I hear you.

367
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:02,410
So, let's focus first
on how to treat you, okay?

368
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:05,299
I'll be right back.

369
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:11,812
Cancer drugs.

370
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:13,822
Parkinson's meds.

371
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,382
Viagra?

372
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:18,926
The prescribing doctors
are all from Chastain.

373
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,847
Dr. Bell, Dr. Pravesh...

374
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:22,941
And there's a lot more
where that came from.

375
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,902
Well, we have to call the FBI.

376
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:26,479
Let Agent Barker know
about this.

377
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:28,823
I know, and we will,
but Teri needs medical attention

378
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:30,665
immediately,
or she'll lose her arm.

379
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,960
I don't love the idea
of waiting to make that call.

380
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:36,188
I get the feeling
that she'd rather go to jail

381
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:37,530
than talk to the FBI anyway.

382
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:39,873
- So, what do you want to do?
- Treat her,

383
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,715
earn her trust,
and then find some way

384
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:44,142
to get her to open up
about the scam.

385
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,720
Okay. Let's work together.

386
00:16:46,814 --> 00:16:48,146
How do we save her arm?

387
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:52,326
Well, I have a possible
solution, but it's unorthodox.

388
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:56,488
Padma has seemed to
have forgotten the condition

389
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,582
upon which I agreed to do this.

390
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:01,326
She wants my sperm,
but not my involvement.

391
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,169
And when you do have an opinion

392
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:05,175
and draw a clear boundary,
it's still not enough.

393
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,662
I should not have to explain why
I feel a certain type of way.

394
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:09,409
You are absolutely right.

395
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:11,003
Just like I shouldn't
have to explain

396
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,089
why I want a roof
over my child's head

397
00:17:13,173 --> 00:17:14,949
that's not made of vinyl.

398
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,210
You're right.

399
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:17,778
See?

400
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:20,144
At least the two of us have
our heads screwed on straight.

401
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,834
It's his pulmonary artery.

402
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:28,222
Inflammatory mediators
are causing vasoconstriction.

403
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:30,498
He's going into acute heart
failure. Let's hang two liters

404
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,700
of saline and nitroglycerin.

405
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,519
Are my ears bleeding,
or did you just order fluid

406
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:36,345
and nitroglycerin
to save his heart?

407
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:37,816
My-my mistake.

408
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:39,356
I meant nitric oxide,

409
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:40,849
and hold on the bolus.

410
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:42,391
Well, maybe your head
isn't screwed on

411
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:44,136
so straight after all, Devi.

412
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:46,764
I'm sorry.
My brain's a little fogged.

413
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:48,458
Well, un-fog it, Devi.

414
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:51,593
There's no room for error here,
you hear me?

415
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:02,870
You are not putting
maggots on me.

416
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:04,019
I know it sounds medieval,

417
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:05,642
but these are
pharmaceutical-grade larva.

418
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:07,376
- They're grown in a lab.
- The maggots

419
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:09,711
will eat away
at the necrotic tissue.

420
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:11,406
It's your best chance
to avoid amputation.

421
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,824
You can close your eyes
if that makes it easier.

422
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:16,912
It won't stop me from feeling
like a decomposing corpse.

423
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,387
Hey, you seem tough.

424
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,980
You can handle a few bugs.

425
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:22,240
All right.

426
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,792
Get on with it.

427
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,917
I love bugs.

428
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,253
I haven't used sterile maggots
since I was in Afghanistan.

429
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,266
Field medicine at its finest.

430
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,165
I had some experience
with them in Haiti.

431
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,592
Works like a drug, but without

432
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,995
all the undesirable
side effects.

433
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,107
Well, why do I feel sicker
than when I walked in?

434
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,444
All right,

435
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,103
so, by the way,
I think I've found

436
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,024
the perfect solution
for our housing hiccup.

437
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:57,442
You're gonna love it because it
keeps you totally independent.

438
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,352
I don't remember asking
for your help.

439
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:00,956
Well, you didn't have to,
but I am prepared

440
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,539
to offer you my mother's house,

441
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,600
no strings attached, not one.

442
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:07,285
- You can't be serious.
- I know it's a generous offer,

443
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,873
but nothing's too good
for family.

444
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:11,967
It's a great neighborhood,
top-notch school district,

445
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,970
and, of course, I will pay
all the taxes and upkeep.

446
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,621
Just to clarify,
you want me to move into

447
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:18,371
your recently deceased
mother's old house?

448
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,717
Well, I can't imagine a better
place for our child to grow up

449
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:23,386
- than the house I was raised in.
- You are insane.

450
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,871
You didn't hear
a word I said earlier.

451
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,304
I just offered you a free house.

452
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,482
This is not the reaction
I was expecting.

453
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,875
Look, I understand
you're grieving,

454
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,319
so I'm gonna say this
as nicely as I can,

455
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,568
you have crossed a line.

456
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,521
- What're you talking about?
- We clearly have

457
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,565
very different ideas of what
parenthood looks like.

458
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:37,315
I'm not here to create
your Mini-Me.

459
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,635
I want my own baby.

460
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:41,245
This was a huge mistake.
I'm sorry.

461
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,913
I don't think
this is gonna work out.

462
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:47,002
Yeah, private ceremony,
you, me, and a judge.

463
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,568
That could be
just as meaningful.

464
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:50,839
On the other hand,
the world is so dark and dreary

465
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,498
right now, why would we miss
an opportunity to celebrate?

466
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,241
- Okay, now you're flip-flopping.
- No,

467
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:58,180
I'm not. I'm weighing all
options, looking at both sides.

468
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:01,173
Okay, here's what I have to say,
whatever you want,

469
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,246
my answer is, "Yes, dear."

470
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,436
That works both ways.
It can't just be what I want,

471
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:07,950
or what you want.

472
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:09,765
We have to find a middle ground,

473
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,859
- together.
- Yes, dear.

474
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,361
Hey.

475
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,289
I need to talk to someone,

476
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,532
and Leela's so busy.

477
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,126
Is everything okay?

478
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:31,871
No. Everything is terrible.

479
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:40,012
You're not having regrets

480
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:42,448
about the embryo implantation,
are you?

481
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,725
I am.

482
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:47,332
It seems I have chosen
the wrong father.

483
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:54,293
Okay. What do you mean?

484
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:57,313
AJ will make
a great dad one day,

485
00:20:57,397 --> 00:21:00,398
just... not to my child.

486
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:02,661
I shouldn't have
rushed into this.

487
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:05,496
I should've weighed
all my options.

488
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,746
So Leela told you
about my offer?

489
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:11,489
Your offer?

490
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:13,146
I'm still happy to help.

491
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,506
But, look, between you and me,

492
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:16,968
Leela was not thrilled

493
00:21:17,071 --> 00:21:19,637
when I threw out the idea
of being the sperm donor.

494
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:21,512
You did what now?

495
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:24,848
Wait... she didn't tell you?

496
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,348
I'm sorry. I...
I shouldn't have said anything.

497
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,928
Because this would
solve everything.

498
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,389
No. No, it wouldn't.

499
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:36,693
I promise you, this would
make things much worse,

500
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,575
- for the both of us.
- I mean, I get it's a little...

501
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,764
it's a little crazy, but...

502
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:44,387
you wouldn't be making
these demands AJ's making.

503
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:45,489
Padma, listen to me.

504
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:47,114
I love Leela,

505
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:49,504
and I don't want to do
anything to hurt her, so...

506
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,209
Please,

507
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:53,877
just forget that
I said anything.

508
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:09,719
<i>This is what we live for.</i>

509
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:12,434
We have to execute flawlessly.

510
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,973
If we do, our patient's life
will be changed

511
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:16,233
dramatically for the better.

512
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,473
Let's cross our T's
and dot our I's.

513
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:19,888
This is gonna take a while.

514
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,698
One slip,
and we can do great harm,

515
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,225
so let's focus.

516
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:27,125
You good?

517
00:22:27,434 --> 00:22:28,692
Fresh as a daisy.

518
00:22:28,777 --> 00:22:30,694
Well, if everyone's bladders
are empty,

519
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,905
let's get a move on.

520
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:48,066
Maggots are making
some real progress.

521
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:50,038
Never thought I'd say this,

522
00:22:50,123 --> 00:22:52,514
but I'm glad bugs
are eating my flesh.

523
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,428
And I'm grateful to y'all.

524
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,195
Teri, will you tell us
what you know

525
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,780
about those prescription pills?

526
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:04,967
Now, see, you had to go
and ruin the moment.

527
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:08,397
Help us out, and we'll help
keep you safe.

528
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:10,557
What do you mean safe?

529
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:12,129
- Did you call the Feds?
- No,

530
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:13,803
because we understand
why you're afraid.

531
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:15,908
We know the men
behind this are dangerous.

532
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:22,979
A pharmacist,

533
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:25,815
the same one who filled
some of your prescriptions,

534
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:29,336
was murdered right here
in this hospital.

535
00:23:29,488 --> 00:23:31,423
Her name was Phoebe Moffit.

536
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:34,151
No, Phoebe?

537
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:36,176
They killed Phoebe?

538
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:37,671
You knew her?

539
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:40,681
She wasn't like them.

540
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:42,665
She was no different than me.

541
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,511
She was just a good egg

542
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:46,020
who fell on hard times

543
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:48,096
and did whatever
she could to survive.

544
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:50,673
They took advantage of that.

545
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:52,765
And they're taking
advantage of you, too.

546
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,103
- Aren't they?
- We share a common enemy.

547
00:23:55,197 --> 00:23:57,045
We will protect you.

548
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,468
You can help us
put an end to this,

549
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:01,811
so no one else has to die,
like Phoebe.

550
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:05,061
Here's the deal.

551
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:08,794
I'll tell you what I know,

552
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,546
for Phoebe,

553
00:24:10,631 --> 00:24:13,202
but you got to swear
to keep my name out of it.

554
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:14,780
It'll be anonymous.

555
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,217
We swear.

556
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,854
Why don't we find somewhere

557
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:25,796
more private to talk.

558
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,413
Just start from the beginning.

559
00:24:30,225 --> 00:24:31,880
How did the mob find you?

560
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,270
I had some hard times,

561
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:36,229
made some bad choices.

562
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:38,311
I got evicted from my home.

563
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:41,475
I was looking for a place
I could lay my head.

564
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:45,288
<i>It was supposed to be temporary,
until I got back on my feet,</i>

565
00:24:45,373 --> 00:24:47,072
<i>but it never works out that way,</i>

566
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:49,561
<i>so I had to figure out
how to make do.</i>

567
00:24:50,753 --> 00:24:53,531
<i>That was when I first saw them.</i>

568
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:55,582
<i>This sketchy bus showed up.</i>

569
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,666
All right. Y'all know the drill.

570
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,993
Let's see those
red, white, and blues.

571
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:00,253
<i>I thought they were passing out</i>

572
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:02,508
<i>free meals or something,
the way everyone</i>

573
00:25:02,593 --> 00:25:05,038
<i>- was carrying on.</i>
- Hey, lady, you got

574
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:06,464
Medicare?

575
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,656
Maybe. What's it to you?

576
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:10,979
If you want to make some money,
let's see your card.

577
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:14,406
Hop on board.

578
00:25:14,491 --> 00:25:17,703
<i>It turns out
"red, white, and blue" is code</i>

579
00:25:17,788 --> 00:25:19,846
<i>for Medicare ID cards</i>

580
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:22,007
<i>because of their
patriotic coloring.</i>

581
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,648
<i>Oh, I figured it
was some kind of scam,</i>

582
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:27,287
but... if a hound's
hungry enough,

583
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,139
she'll do anything
for her next meal.

584
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:32,935
I had no clue where I was going,
but the moment

585
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,712
<i>we made our first stop,
I knew I was in trouble.</i>

586
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:43,259
Everybody get inside.

587
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:45,141
<i>It looked more like</i>
<i>a massage parlor</i>

588
00:25:45,313 --> 00:25:46,707
<i>than a medical clinic,
and I figured</i>

589
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:48,767
<i>any doctor who worked there</i>

590
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:50,636
<i>shouldn't be
prescribing aspirin,</i>

591
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:52,731
<i>much less real drugs.</i>

592
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:56,642
<i>But I quickly learned
that was the point.</i>

593
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,312
<i>Those guys didn't even bother
with an exam.</i>

594
00:25:59,587 --> 00:26:03,064
<i>They just scribbled on a chart
and handed me scrips.</i>

595
00:26:03,217 --> 00:26:06,344
I didn't know what the drugs
were for, so I asked him.

596
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:07,903
He didn't like that.

597
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:10,672
After that, I learned
to keep my mouth shut.

598
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:12,564
<i>Then they dropped us
at a pharmacy</i>

599
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:15,063
<i>on the other side of town.
That's where I met Phoebe.</i>

600
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:18,798
<i>All the other customers looked
at us like we were vermin.</i>

601
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:20,926
<i>But not Phoebe. She was kind.</i>

602
00:26:21,076 --> 00:26:23,477
<i>Never asked any questions.</i>

603
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:26,664
Her mom was sick.

604
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:28,724
She needed the money.

605
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:31,493
We all make mistakes.

606
00:26:32,344 --> 00:26:34,354
I guess she paid for hers.

607
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:37,352
Oh, those bastards

608
00:26:37,469 --> 00:26:39,111
are scarier than hell.

609
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:41,547
<i>Taron especially.</i>

610
00:26:41,632 --> 00:26:43,252
If you want your fee,
have your bags and prescriptions

611
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:45,770
ready to be counted.

612
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:51,387
First time?

613
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,333
Welcome to the team.

614
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,545
Yeah.

615
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,127
Now, come back next week,

616
00:26:58,212 --> 00:27:00,220
there's more
where that came from.

617
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,439
And if you say anything
to the cops, you'll regret it.

618
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:05,823
Understand?

619
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:09,868
<i>I've been around the block,</i>

620
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:11,977
<i>and I knew the pills
in my hand were worth</i>

621
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:14,711
<i>a hell of a lot more
than 50 bucks.</i>

622
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,258
So, I kept a little on the side.

623
00:27:17,391 --> 00:27:20,024
For street resale,
you know what I mean?

624
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:22,853
Did anyone else keep pills
for themselves?

625
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:25,439
Yeah, we all skimmed.

626
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:27,923
Who were we cheating?
Bunch of crooks.

627
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:30,205
That explains why
we've seen patients O.D.

628
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,735
with those pills
in their pocket.

629
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:33,762
And why you had a cancer drug

630
00:27:33,974 --> 00:27:35,575
with no cancer diagnosis.

631
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,004
Where did they take the pills?

632
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,748
I only saw the place once,

633
00:27:41,832 --> 00:27:44,591
from the outside.

634
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:48,513
<i>Eventually, my curiosity</i>

635
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:50,246
<i>got the best of me.</i>

636
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,601
<i>And-and, one day, I finally
saw them by some warehouse.</i>

637
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,598
<i>My guess is that's where</i>

638
00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:00,107
<i>the mob does its dirty work.</i>

639
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:03,337
<i>Got to count the pills,
they repackage them,</i>

640
00:28:03,422 --> 00:28:05,378
<i>and then they resell them
back to the pharmacies</i>

641
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:07,962
<i>for up to ten times
the original price.</i>

642
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:17,368
This is it.

643
00:28:17,453 --> 00:28:19,716
All the answers
we've been searching for.

644
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:21,444
Once the FBI knows this...

645
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:23,204
They'll shut that operation down

646
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:24,547
in a heartbeat.

647
00:28:24,632 --> 00:28:26,475
But just remember our deal:

648
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:29,032
You can tell the FBI,

649
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:31,758
but keep my name out of it.

650
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:44,074
Almost done with the
high T-spine pedicle screws.

651
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:49,368
Let's shoot another
fluoro image.

652
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:54,995
How are those screws
coming along?

653
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:58,332
You're getting a little close.

654
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:02,047
We need to leave half an inch
more between those screws.

655
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:04,179
Dr. Devi...

656
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:06,081
Dr. Devi!

657
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:10,572
- What happened?
- You fell asleep.

658
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:12,642
There's a massive bleed
in Ashley's spine.

659
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:14,014
Cautery to me, now.

660
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:15,923
We need two units of reds
up and hanging.

661
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:17,868
- She's bleeding fast.
- No, no, no.

662
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:19,416
I asked you if you were ready
for this. You lied to me.

663
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,540
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so...
- Go home, Dr. Devi, now.

664
00:29:34,185 --> 00:29:36,454
This is extraordinary.
With what you just told us,

665
00:29:36,563 --> 00:29:37,815
we should have enough
to get warrants,

666
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:39,849
run surveillance, and with luck,

667
00:29:40,198 --> 00:29:42,198
bring down the entire drug ring.

668
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:45,041
- Thank you both.
- Well, we're not the ones
you should thank.

669
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:46,628
Yeah, well, tell your source
that the Bureau

670
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:49,133
- is eternally grateful.
- We'll pass along the message.

671
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:52,783
Always a pleasure, Dr. Sullivan.

672
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:56,072
I hope for both our sake this is
the last time we work together.

673
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:58,393
If you ever want
to hang up that white coat,

674
00:29:58,478 --> 00:30:00,869
there's a wide world
of Medicare fraud out there.

675
00:30:00,954 --> 00:30:02,954
I prefer a stethoscope
over a handgun.

676
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,001
Wise choice.

677
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:10,740
Look at you.

678
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:15,087
Saving lives and bringing down
the mob at the same time.

679
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:17,952
- It was a team effort.
- Listen,

680
00:30:18,044 --> 00:30:21,322
I know what you said about
not wanting to get comfortable,

681
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:23,552
but our job is done.

682
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:25,419
It's time to start
living your life.

683
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,858
- Same could be said of you.
- Oh.

684
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:30,294
Okay, that's fair,
but I have a life,

685
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:33,541
it's just centered
around my daughter.

686
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,366
No way.

687
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,501
What?

688
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:51,926
- Is that the guy who killed Phoebe?
- Yeah.

689
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:54,068
He saw us with the FBI.

690
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,911
He saw me.

691
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:03,227
Leela.

692
00:31:03,802 --> 00:31:06,221
- I need to talk to you.
- Take a number.

693
00:31:06,306 --> 00:31:08,075
I have a lot of sins
to account for today.

694
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,825
Devon told me everything,

695
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,519
about his offer.

696
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:15,147
I cannot believe

697
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,122
- he told you.
- Well, the question is,

698
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:18,431
why didn't you?

699
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,821
Can we not do this
right now, please?

700
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:23,164
No, we're actually
gonna do this now.

701
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:25,014
Okay.

702
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:27,823
I didn't tell you
because it's insane.

703
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:30,066
And I... I thought
of all people,

704
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:31,506
you would agree.

705
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,508
I don't, actually.

706
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,252
Look, this thing with AJ,

707
00:31:35,346 --> 00:31:36,937
it's-it's really
not working out.

708
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,120
And Devon could be
a good option for us.

709
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:40,278
For us?

710
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,257
No,

711
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:44,917
it is not a good option for us.

712
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,597
It is a good option for you

713
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:48,598
- and only you.
- Look, I know it's
complicated, okay?

714
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:50,032
But Devon's offer solves

715
00:31:50,184 --> 00:31:51,942
- a lot of problems.
- Oh, my God.

716
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,424
Padma, would you listen
to yourself.

717
00:31:55,277 --> 00:31:57,830
I have given you everything,

718
00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:00,831
even the freaking eggs
from my body,

719
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,941
but we cannot share this.
I will not

720
00:32:03,026 --> 00:32:04,338
give you Devon.

721
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,496
Unexpected complications?
What does that mean?

722
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:26,136
One of the screws used
to reconstruct Ashley's spine

723
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:28,058
caused a significant amount
of bleeding.

724
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:30,730
- Will she be okay?
- Yes. With a little rest,

725
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,441
I have no doubt your wife
will make a full recovery.

726
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:36,018
That's a relief. Thank you.

727
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,660
Um, where's Dr. Sutton?

728
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:40,676
She got pulled into
an emergency surgery,

729
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:42,243
but she'll be by
as soon as she can.

730
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,069
And Dr. Devi?

731
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,675
You can spend the night
in Ashley's room, if you like.

732
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,182
The hospital will provide a cot.

733
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,854
Loved ones help
the healing process.

734
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:55,365
Call if you need anything.

735
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,744
So, I-I got your text.

736
00:32:58,828 --> 00:33:00,252
Did you know Dr. Devi

737
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:03,338
was pulling double duty in
cardiothoracic and neurosurgery?

738
00:33:03,423 --> 00:33:04,933
I think everybody was aware.

739
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:07,167
But Leela is
an excellent surgeon.

740
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,762
She's...

741
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:10,813
she's just trying to do more
and be better

742
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:11,798
than any human can be.

743
00:33:11,883 --> 00:33:15,126
Today, her patient paid
the price for that arrogance.

744
00:33:15,345 --> 00:33:17,720
What happened in the OR
could've been catastrophic.

745
00:33:17,805 --> 00:33:18,626
I know, I agree,

746
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:20,385
and so does Billie.
We've had many conversations

747
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:21,949
about her stretching herself
too thin.

748
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:24,368
It's past time someone had
that conversation with Leela.

749
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:27,813
She has to make a decision,
or I will make it for her.

750
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:42,739
Hey.

751
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:46,984
You don't look so good.

752
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,738
I'm not.

753
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:51,024
I've lost everything today.

754
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:54,422
My future child
and my own sister.

755
00:33:58,957 --> 00:34:00,329
May I join you?

756
00:34:06,103 --> 00:34:07,618
Listen.

757
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:10,743
I grew up in foster care.

758
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,430
- I didn't know that.
- Moved from house to house,

759
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:18,696
never had a place to call home.

760
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:21,797
It made me resentful and angry

761
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,274
because all I wanted

762
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,118
was stability, right?

763
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:28,691
So, the very idea of you
raising our child

764
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:30,672
in a van...

765
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:32,504
Well, it was triggering.

766
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:34,680
I see.

767
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,513
And I'm sorry.

768
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:40,830
I'm sorry, too.
You know, I-I made this about

769
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:43,594
my past when it should've been
about your future.

770
00:34:44,903 --> 00:34:47,329
But you did ask me
to be the father,

771
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:49,574
not some stranger.

772
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:52,555
So, you would have to
meet me halfway.

773
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,793
Padma, I can't help you
bring a child

774
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:57,536
into this world
and then abandon it.

775
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,110
This would be your baby

776
00:34:59,272 --> 00:35:02,096
as much as it would be mine.

777
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:04,106
And you should tell your story.

778
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:05,191
But I cannot watch

779
00:35:05,276 --> 00:35:08,389
my child grow up
from the sidelines.

780
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:10,566
I need a relationship,
a connection.

781
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,409
And if that's not what
you're looking for,

782
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:15,012
then I'm willing
to bow out gracefully.

783
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,162
But you are going to
have to find someone else.

784
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,890
You're a good man, Dr. Austin.

785
00:35:30,237 --> 00:35:32,944
I think our child
should witness that firsthand.

786
00:35:35,582 --> 00:35:37,415
Our child?

787
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:41,233
- You sure about that?
- You were right.

788
00:35:41,318 --> 00:35:44,092
It was wrong of me to trivialize
your involvement.

789
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:46,999
It takes a village
to raise a child,

790
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,599
if you're still willing.

791
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:51,701
Absolutely, I am.

792
00:35:55,123 --> 00:35:58,280
But just so you know,
the van is a deal-breaker.

793
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:01,257
Fine, but you need to ease up
on the Ivy League talk.

794
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:03,779
Let's let our child decide
what their future looks like.

795
00:36:03,863 --> 00:36:06,013
Hey, you saying you don't want
a 529 account?

796
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:07,375
I never said that.

797
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,451
God knows how much college
is gonna cost in 18 years.

798
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:19,897
- What are your options?
- I leave tonight.

799
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,005
It may seem impulsive,

800
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,290
but I'm pretty sure that's how

801
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:26,121
- I've stayed alive so far.
- That's one option.

802
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:28,557
What else?

803
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:30,855
I quit running.

804
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:35,630
Try to build a life for myself.

805
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:39,727
Make friends
I can keep over time,

806
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:41,972
put down roots.

807
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:44,709
But I'd risk that, one day,
I'd find myself

808
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:47,850
bleeding on the pavement.

809
00:36:51,394 --> 00:36:53,127
I don't want to go.

810
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:57,007
I've felt more at home here

811
00:36:57,092 --> 00:37:00,093
than I did as a kid
in my own home, honestly.

812
00:37:03,545 --> 00:37:05,537
What was your home like?

813
00:37:06,178 --> 00:37:08,726
My parents divorced
when I was young.

814
00:37:09,942 --> 00:37:11,700
Same here.

815
00:37:13,736 --> 00:37:15,865
I was raised by my dad,

816
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:19,987
a man-child genius surgeon.

817
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:25,037
I was the gardener,
he was the flower.

818
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:27,733
Mm, the dots are connecting.

819
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,168
All this will be over soon.

820
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:37,428
Why are you still running?

821
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,707
We spoke to Agent Barker.

822
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,710
They have everything they need
to shut this down,

823
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:44,209
and your FBI protection
is right outside.

824
00:37:45,248 --> 00:37:48,050
They're gonna put me
in a hotel for the night.

825
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:50,881
Try and find the man we saw
and arrest him.

826
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:52,766
And when they do...

827
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:58,151
...you could stay.

828
00:38:01,147 --> 00:38:03,858
Create that life you want, here.

829
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:09,829
The people who want to kill me
have more than one soldier.

830
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:15,646
I hear that.

831
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:21,841
I'm so tired.

832
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,709
Tired of running.

833
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:29,647
Tired of... fear.

834
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:50,608
Why don't you just
give it the night?

835
00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:55,533
I'll walk you out,
make sure the FBI tail's

836
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,460
got your back.

837
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:04,425
Yeah, just this once.

838
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:14,869
Hey.

839
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:16,729
You're up.

840
00:39:17,874 --> 00:39:19,482
I thought you'd be
passed out by now.

841
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:22,226
I slept for a few hours.

842
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,937
I'm awake now.

843
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,308
- So, how'd your surgery go?
- I don't know.

844
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:33,496
I was asked to leave after
I nearly paralyzed my patient.

845
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:42,590
What happened?

846
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,249
It doesn't matter.

847
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:48,845
Kit gave me a week
to pick a specialty.

848
00:39:48,996 --> 00:39:51,507
So, you were right.

849
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:53,933
I can't do it all.

850
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:58,746
You push yourself too hard.

851
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:01,350
It's as if you have
something to prove.

852
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:04,527
I do have something to prove.

853
00:40:04,754 --> 00:40:06,863
I know you talked to Padma.

854
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:09,440
Why would you go behind
my back like that?

855
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:11,654
You knew exactly how I felt.

856
00:40:11,873 --> 00:40:13,536
How would I?

857
00:40:13,763 --> 00:40:16,372
You don't even talk
to me about it.

858
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:19,351
I should not have to explain

859
00:40:19,436 --> 00:40:21,308
why I don't want my boyfriend
to have a baby

860
00:40:21,393 --> 00:40:22,910
- with my sister.
- That's not true.

861
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:25,516
I was trying to help,
and I wish I never had.

862
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:27,884
But why can't you be honest
with me about it?

863
00:40:29,623 --> 00:40:33,186
You do not want me
to be honest with you, Devon.

864
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:36,434
Well, what is that
supposed to mean?

865
00:40:38,256 --> 00:40:40,722
I don't want kids.

866
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:43,896
Not now, not in a few years,

867
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:46,481
maybe never, okay?

868
00:40:50,316 --> 00:40:52,084
So, you lied to me.

869
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:54,319
I think, deep down,
we both knew.

870
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:56,467
- I didn't know.
- Why else would you offer
to father

871
00:40:56,552 --> 00:40:57,868
another woman's baby?

872
00:40:58,293 --> 00:40:59,642
This isn't about Padma.

873
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:01,577
You led me on.

874
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:04,045
Made me think that
there was a chance.

875
00:41:04,905 --> 00:41:06,507
A future for us.

876
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:08,303
And now there isn't?

877
00:41:09,306 --> 00:41:10,973
A future for us?

878
00:41:13,402 --> 00:41:14,751
I love you.

879
00:41:14,836 --> 00:41:16,402
But not enough.

880
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:20,573
You want a baby
more than you want me.

881
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:22,835
I want you.

882
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,545
I want us.

883
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,603
But I also want
a family one day,

884
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:30,068
and I never hid that from you.

885
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,532
I'm not gonna apologize for it.

886
00:41:36,552 --> 00:41:39,733
I'm not going to apologize
for wanting something different.

887
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:46,018
So, what are you saying then?

888
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:48,830
That this is it?

889
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:50,965
This is the end?

890
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:59,802
Yeah. I guess I am.

891
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:22,273
So, we haven't got a verdict
on the venue,

892
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:24,084
but we both agree it should...

893
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,495
- Be small.
- We'll invite a few friends

894
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:28,504
and figure the rest out
as we go.

895
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:30,339
Either way,
it's gonna be perfect.

896
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:34,373
Well, not quite.

897
00:42:35,592 --> 00:42:38,432
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

898
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,757
I would hate
to disappoint you, darling.

899
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:43,437
That would be a terrible way
to start a marriage.

900
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,637
Randolph Bell,

901
00:42:46,005 --> 00:42:47,928
will you marry me?

902
00:42:53,162 --> 00:42:54,897
Thank God...

903
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:59,569
...because I can't return this.
