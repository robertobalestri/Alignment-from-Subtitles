1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,128
<i>Previously on the resident...</i>

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:03,211
So that means we're going

3
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,757
to have to talk about
hospice. Don't. Not yet.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,467
Oh, you can have
hospice for months.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,769
It's a great service
that most people.

6
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:12,263
Wait too long to use.

7
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,607
I wouldn't mind a
kid a lot like you.

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,809
You want me to be
your sperm donor?

9
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,310
Thank you, Emily.

10
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,179
We'll pass this up To
the complaint division.

11
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:23,190
And discuss the status
Of the investigation.

12
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,254
How is she?

13
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:31,073
Well, I'll let her
tell you herself.

14
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,576
- Hey, carol.
- Conrad.

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,504
Come and meet my hospice
nurse. This is janaya.

16
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:39,259
Hello, dr. Hawkins.
We met years ago,

17
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:41,167
When my father was A
patient before he passed.

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,066
Darius purcell.

19
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,188
Yeah, I remember him. You
were in nursing school then.

20
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,331
Now she takes care.

21
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:47,665
Of dying folk like me.

22
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:48,748
Mom.

23
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,354
Aj gets prickly when
I use the "D" word.

24
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:54,986
Dr. Austin, I need you.

25
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:56,407
To help me review
some med dosages.

26
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,559
And update carol's charts.

27
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,102
Before I go.

28
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,029
Hey, I'll be right back, mom.

29
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:03,704
Mm.

30
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,279
Anything I can do for you?

31
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,707
Oh, I have everything I need.

32
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,549
It's aj I'm worried about.

33
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:21,665
He wanted me in hospice,
But now he can't seem.

34
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,477
To face what we
both know is ahead.

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,422
This is very hard
for him, Conrad.

36
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,481
Well, of course it
is. He loves you.

37
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:32,426
And he has been in the
business Of saving people.

38
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,562
For a long time.

39
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:36,322
I'm a realist.

40
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:38,825
I have one clear goal.

41
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:42,895
I want all the time I have
left To spend with him.

42
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,573
And no pain. That's all.

43
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:49,985
But he can't seem to
stop trying to fix.

44
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,012
What can't be fixed.

45
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:54,806
I'll talk to him.

46
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:57,894
Good news, dr. Devi.

47
00:01:57,977 --> 00:02:00,419
Your body's responding
well To the hormones.

48
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,106
Your follicles
are maturing well.

49
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,276
We should be able to retrieve
The eggs within the week.

50
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,019
I can't believe this
is all happening.

51
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:08,390
We hope. But a
first-time course of ivf

52
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:11,715
- only has a 33% success rate.
- Dr. Devi is correct.

53
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,952
It's important to manage
Your expectations, padma.

54
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:16,041
The path to motherhood Is
not always an easy one.

55
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:17,617
I know, I know. I just...

56
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,867
- I want this baby so badly.
- It's all I want for you, too.

57
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,610
Once we have the
eggs from dr. Devi,

58
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:24,020
We can fertilize
them and choose.

59
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:25,964
The viable embryo To
be implanted into you.

60
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,971
Uh, one last question: Will
your donor sperm arrive

61
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:30,785
- in a test tube or...
- oh, no, no, my donor's here, in the hospital.

62
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:32,803
- He's a, he's a doctor.
- Great.

63
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,839
And he is available to come
in During the egg retrieval.

64
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,534
So we can create embryos
As quickly as possible?

65
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:39,961
I hope. He has a
personal situation.

66
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:41,372
Which makes it a
bit complicated.

67
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:44,276
Yeah, if he's, um, unavailable
Due to a family emergency,

68
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:46,800
Can we... Can we wait?

69
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:48,523
I'm afraid not.
In that instance,

70
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:50,045
We would have to
freeze the eggs.

71
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:58,263
What's wrong?

72
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:01,434
I haven't been able to reach
Aj yet to finalize details.

73
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:04,131
- What details?
- Just little things.

74
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,145
You're blinking.

75
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,990
Too many blinks.

76
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:11,859
Come on, that's your tell. Talk.

77
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,835
Aj hasn't fully committed
To be the sperm donor yet.

78
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:17,906
We just lied to dr. Johnson?

79
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,834
Okay, calm down. She's
a doctor, not a<i> pujari.</i>

80
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:23,912
Have a little
faith. The universe

81
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,672
- has a way of working things out.
- No.

82
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:26,898
You need to work this out.

83
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,001
The universe is not
paying attention.

84
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,378
Talk to dr. Austin today.

85
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,757
Okay? If he's not all
in, You need to know.

86
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,774
You're so bossy.

87
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,327
Okay.

88
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,427
Okay.

89
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:49,029
Hey.

90
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:52,231
My mother is taking
Escalating doses of morphine,

91
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:53,876
And we don't even know
Her kidney function.

92
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,869
You think maybe I should
Switch to hydromorphone?

93
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:57,854
Uh, that depends.

94
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,911
Are you worried about
Long-term complications.

95
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,370
Or focused on keeping
her Comfortable for now?

96
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,938
I-I don't think there's
Any harm in running labs.

97
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:08,248
To check her kidney function.

98
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,834
Well, there's no harm,
But I think the key.

99
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,993
Is to ask yourself,
Is there any benefit?

100
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:15,155
Will this bring her
More comfort or less?

101
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:19,743
Look, I-I know there's no fix.

102
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,954
I-I know where this is going,

103
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:25,960
I just want to spend as much
Time with my mother as I can.

104
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:27,242
There's nothing
wrong with that, man.

105
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,462
Of course not, but your
mom Is worried about you.

106
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:32,172
More than anything else.

107
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:35,425
She's worried about
How you're taking this.

108
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:38,552
She told you that?

109
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,408
What was that? Mom!

110
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,735
Oh, she's seizing.

111
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,645
Let's get her on her side.

112
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:49,975
- Hospice left you lorazepam, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,726
It's in the, uh, It's
in the medicine cabinet.

114
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,865
Okay.

115
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:56,135
Hey, mom, you're
gonna be all right.

116
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,858
So, tell me what happened
On your camping trip.

117
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:02,868
I was heading to the
river For a morning dip.

118
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:05,497
When I caught my
big toe on a root.

119
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,274
I felt a pop in my
ankle And I went down.

120
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:10,093
- And you were barefoot?
- Bare everything.

121
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,003
- Oh.
- We're not nudists.

122
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:13,188
We were earthing.

123
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,282
Reconnecting to earth's
Electromagnetic field.

124
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:16,599
Through bare skin.

125
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:20,095
Sounds silly, but it works.

126
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,491
101.2.

127
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,775
Patient is spiking a fever.

128
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,684
That can't be from his ankle.

129
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,663
Bp is 83/50.

130
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,957
- Um, okay, uh...
- and dropping.

131
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,501
- Uh, it's...
- dr. Pravesh?

132
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:36,908
What's the problem?

133
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:38,654
Bp is dropping rapidly.

134
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:41,597
Dr. Pravesh is here
To take a closer look.

135
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,969
Do you hear that ringing?

136
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:47,105
- He's going down.
- One liter of lr.

137
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:48,857
And get that norepi pump
Next to his bedside.

138
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,064
Let's go.

139
00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:07,225
I think it's best To
call the hospice nurse.

140
00:06:07,308 --> 00:06:09,895
Have her come back
and take over.

141
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,980
Yeah, but what if
it's a brain bleed?

142
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:15,024
We know the cancer has
spread To her brain,

143
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:17,085
So then that wouldn't
be unexpected.

144
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,737
She could be hyponatremic.

145
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,830
She hasn't been taking
in Enough electrolytes.

146
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,966
- Aj...
- no, if there's any chance

147
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,669
I can get her a few extra
weeks, A few extra days,

148
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,671
Even a few extra hours...

149
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:31,266
Any intervention now
could cause harm.

150
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,065
Well, I got to try.

151
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,247
As an investigator For
the state medical board,

152
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,458
My job is to weigh The
merits of the case.

153
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,235
And this case is clear.

154
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:02,088
Emily benesch was irreparably
Injured by dr. Bosley.

155
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:07,302
When I reviewed common outcomes
For the surgery in question...

156
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,346
Spinal, neurological,
high risk...

157
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,123
It appears miss
benesch's outcome is...

158
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:13,433
Is not at all unusual.

159
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,670
Paralysis is not unusual?

160
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,981
I mean, surely you know
How ludicrous that sounds.

161
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,135
Did you even speak with Emily?

162
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,788
The goal of my investigation
Is to remain impartial.

163
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:28,156
And unbiased.

164
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,325
Right, well, you only took
Statements from experts.

165
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,416
Provided by the defendant.

166
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,499
You've become emotionally
Involved in this case, dr. Bell.

167
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,543
It's blinding you
to the reality.

168
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,379
That what happened To this
patient, while tragic,

169
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,656
Is not the fault of her surgeon.

170
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:45,882
This case is closed.

171
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,888
Bryce came in here with A
pulled tendon in his ankle,

172
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,000
And has developed fevers,
Hypotension requiring pressors.

173
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,102
And increasing agitation.

174
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,378
The broad-spectrum antibiotics.

175
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,035
Haven't really helped
With what's going on.

176
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,357
This muscle spasm
happened In the past hour,

177
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,825
So I checked his electrolytes,
And they're all in normal range.

178
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,737
His-his thyroid is normal, too.

179
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,879
Have you been doing.

180
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:09,955
Any intense exercising lately?

181
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:12,200
I meditate, go for walks.

182
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,411
We've been working
Through the<i> kama sutra.</i>

183
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,934
Sounds like quite a regimen.

184
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,653
Percussive myoedema.

185
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,114
Touch your chin to
your chest for me?

186
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,717
The stiff neck is new.

187
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,803
Bryce, we're gonna
run some tests.

188
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,480
To check for an infection In
your central nervous system.

189
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:37,016
And we're gonna start With
a lumbar puncture, okay?

190
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,228
There you go. Breathe.

191
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,933
Good, good.

192
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,884
Just breathe.

193
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,153
There you go.

194
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,989
- I almost got it.
- Breathe.

195
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,102
I brought kale and apple.

196
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:56,927
Oh, my god. What are
you doing to him?

197
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,429
I'm needle-phobic.
I can't watch.

198
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,839
- Here.
- No, get that away from...

199
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:02,841
I feel sick.

200
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:04,268
He really doesn't
like that drink.

201
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:06,902
It's triggering a
physical reaction.

202
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:11,650
He's afraid of it.

203
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:12,802
Hydrophobia.

204
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:18,516
Bryce, we have to
test you for rabies.

205
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:26,216
Just one second, love.

206
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,292
I got you.

207
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,294
I got you, I got you.

208
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:33,038
I know, I know. I got you.

209
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:36,181
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.

210
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,061
- Mm.
- It's okay.

211
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,660
She's not getting
enough calories.

212
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:05,922
I've tried five other flavors
And she wouldn't touch them.

213
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,592
But this one, chocolate
raspberry chia,

214
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,168
I think this is the one.

215
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,821
Uh, you might want To
stick it in the freezer.

216
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,839
She just fell asleep.

217
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:17,159
She could be tired
from the pain meds.

218
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,511
And I know that also
affects appetite.

219
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:25,683
Or her body is
requiring less energy.

220
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,351
Less input, less output.

221
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:30,778
As she begins to enter
A hibernation state.

222
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,843
Dr. Austin, I'm not just
here For your mother.

223
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,787
I'm here for you, too.

224
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,081
So, if you have any questions...

225
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:47,780
How much longer does she have?

226
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:51,784
Could be a week, or a few days.

227
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,362
Her metabolic functions
will be telling.

228
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:56,946
But she'll also give
us signs as well.

229
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,762
She may want to
open up and start.

230
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:02,600
To talk about things She's
never discussed before.

231
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:04,585
She may get a burst of energy.

232
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:07,708
We call that "Planes,
Trains and automobiles."

233
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:11,712
If your mom starts
Making plans for a trip,

234
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:14,169
That usually means
she's ready to go.

235
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,325
I don't know how you do it.

236
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,683
You know, your job
Seems incredibly hard.

237
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,426
And being a surgeon is easy?

238
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,249
I can solve problems
with a scalpel.

239
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:35,076
You know, I can find a cure.
There's always an answer.

240
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:38,890
But waiting for death to come.

241
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:43,561
A-and not trying to do
Anything to stop it, I don't...

242
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,439
I don't know how to do that.

243
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:52,749
All you have to do Is
follow your mother's lead.

244
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,100
He's positive.

245
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:09,235
- Bryce has rabies.
- Rabies?

246
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:11,261
But that's so impossibly rare.

247
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:13,716
The odds of a doctor seeing A
rabies patient over the course.

248
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,702
Of their career is
one in 325 million.

249
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:18,613
O-okay, we know the
rabies virus spreads.

250
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,407
To the brain through
the nerve cells,

251
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,827
- and once it's there...
- it multiplies rapidly,

252
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,412
Causing severe inflammation
In the brain and the spine.

253
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,498
It's 99.9% fatal if it's not
Treated almost immediately.

254
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,292
Only 11 patients have survived.

255
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,903
Clearly the odds Aren't
in bryce's favor,

256
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,130
But people have
been saved before.

257
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,634
So, now it's all about When
Bryce contracted the virus.

258
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,652
Uh

259
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:44,098
- What?
- During intake,

260
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,093
He told me that he went camping.

261
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:48,337
Naked. No tent, no sleeping bag.

262
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,417
It's some kind of
an earth-love thing.

263
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:53,940
He could've been bitten By
a bat and never noticed.

264
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:56,902
I wish you told us this sooner.

265
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,335
I didn't think...

266
00:12:58,418 --> 00:13:00,488
I'm sorry, I screwed up.

267
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:03,174
Let's find the bite.

268
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:05,342
The further away From the
central nervous system,

269
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:08,921
The longer it takes the virus
To reach the brain, okay?

270
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:10,623
Every second counts.

271
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,602
Why is he being tied up?

272
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:22,302
Bryce never hurt anyone.

273
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,102
You're making him
feel claustrophobic.

274
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:25,572
I know it's hard to
see him like this,

275
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,198
But rabies can cause aggression.

276
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:29,684
It's safer for everyone,
Including Bryce.

277
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,536
We're gonna give him lorazepam

278
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:34,209
- to relax him, okay?
- Bryce, we're looking for a bite.

279
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:36,664
It may be so small,
like a scratch,

280
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:37,793
Something you wouldn't
Have even noticed.

281
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,118
I don't know. I don't know, I...

282
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,874
Bryce, tell me,
how do you sleep?

283
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,741
What do you mean?
With my eyes closed.

284
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,025
He means back, side,

285
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:47,160
- stomach?
- Side.

286
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,393
- Okay.
- Let's go.

287
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,125
All right, here.

288
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,418
There's some puncture marks.

289
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,212
We need to get as
much hrig as possible.

290
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,490
Into this infected
area Beneath the bite.

291
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,218
Bryce, we're gonna give
you A series of injections.

292
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,395
A vaccine and some
immunoglobulins.

293
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,263
We're gonna repeat
them every 12 hours.

294
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,647
You're gonna get pretty sore.

295
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,418
Those needles are huge.

296
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:12,095
And if he's already sick,

297
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:14,062
- then why are you giving him a vaccine?
- Janice.

298
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,563
We're trying to stop the virus.

299
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,065
From spreading to
his nervous system.

300
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,308
If we can slow The
progress of the virus,

301
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:19,986
Then we have a chance
at treating him.

302
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:22,987
That'll work? You'll cure him?

303
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:25,365
If he got here in time.

304
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,327
Oh, god.

305
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,621
No, I-I... I can't...

306
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,298
I can't handle this. I...

307
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:36,398
I can't watch him
get worse and worse.

308
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,152
Oh, my god.

309
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,913
The board lied.

310
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:55,743
Promised the patient
A fair investigation.

311
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:58,690
Instead, case closed,
no further review.

312
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,408
Unbelievable.

313
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:02,441
So I did more
investigating myself.

314
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:05,398
And the names of the same Five
doctors, including bosley,

315
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:06,711
Come up again and again.

316
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:08,524
These are career bad apples
With multiple complaints.

317
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:09,951
Of the worst kind.

318
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,328
You remember that surgeon
They called dr. Death?

319
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,533
Of course. He maimed And
killed patients in Texas.

320
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,861
His colleagues knew it. They
took it to the state board.

321
00:15:17,944 --> 00:15:19,461
And the state board did nothing.

322
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,128
But he got caught.

323
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,925
When someone leaked
The story to the press.

324
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,459
There you are.

325
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,977
I've been texting you nonstop.

326
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,423
I know. I got your
5,000 messages.

327
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,151
Don't worry, I didn't call aj.

328
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,553
I heard about his mom and
I'm respecting their privacy.

329
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:46,433
Good.

330
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:51,423
Okay, so... Next steps?

331
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:54,162
We call dr. Johnson and we tell
Her we're freezing the eggs.

332
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,772
I'm not willing to give up On
this cycle of ivf just yet.

333
00:15:57,721 --> 00:15:58,941
It's not giving up.

334
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:00,919
A lot of people
freeze their eggs.

335
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,311
They do it because the timing.

336
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,464
Of making a baby
is just not right.

337
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,341
Last week, I went to
the farmers' market.

338
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,425
And I got bagels.

339
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,595
Okay? They were fresh
Out of the oven, perfect.

340
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,264
But I didn't think I'd be
able To eat them all in time.

341
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,992
Before they went
stale, so I froze them.

342
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,119
And guess what
happened the next day?

343
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:20,279
You microwaved one and ate it?

344
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,849
It wasn't the same.

345
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,985
Padma,

346
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,612
That is a ridiculous metaphor,

347
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,448
And you cannot expect a donor
To just fall into your lap.

348
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,509
It is really hard for me to talk
To you when you get like this.

349
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:37,021
- Get like what?
- Overly logical Leela.

350
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,664
Trust the universe. No freezing.

351
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,114
He snapped the restraint.

352
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,860
Push two of lorazepam
And five of haloperidol.

353
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,581
On it.

354
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:54,977
We're treating him
too late, aren't we?

355
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,866
I hope not.

356
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,535
This virus is a
terrible way to die.

357
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,489
Hey. What are you
doing on your feet?

358
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:27,560
Dust inflames my sinuses.

359
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,757
I thought I told you last night.

360
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,087
You need a haircut.

361
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,406
Well, you also called me dad,

362
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,517
So I figured I
would let it ride.

363
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:43,171
And come on, you really should
Get back in bed, mom, come on.

364
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,465
Okay? Come on.

365
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:51,137
Jana ya said your peach
tree Was blooming.

366
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:53,364
I'd like to see it.

367
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,533
Okay.

368
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,109
We'll get you in the wheelchair.

369
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,853
And we'll move
you to the window.

370
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,606
No, son.

371
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,885
Hear my words. I feel good.

372
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,837
I want to go outside.

373
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:10,872
Okay.

374
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:13,451
We'll make it a field trip.

375
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,120
All right, let's do it.

376
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:23,645
So far, I've identified.

377
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,939
Two major hurdles
in rabies protocols.

378
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:29,067
We have antiviral effectiveness
And neuroprotection.

379
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,735
So once the virus enters.

380
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,947
His spinal cord or the brain,
The antivirals are ineffective.

381
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,966
The meds can't pass through
The blood-brain barrier.

382
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,134
- Patient dies.
- So, what if we made

383
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,826
- the barrier more porous?
- How?

384
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:43,773
Something I learned
in clinical trials.

385
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,001
Some brain cancer studies
Show that mannitol.

386
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,170
Can actually poke
holes in the barrier

387
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,927
- so that the chemo can get in.
- Yeah, poke enough holes.

388
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,632
In the blood-brain barrier and
The antivirals can seep through.

389
00:18:58,151 --> 00:18:59,430
That's an incredible long shot.

390
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,057
And it doesn't explain
how we preserve.

391
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,008
The nervous system Long
enough for it to work.

392
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,436
So we need to figure out
A way to cool him down.

393
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,846
Without heavy sedation.

394
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:09,565
What if we lower his
temperature From the inside out?

395
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,335
We place an iv cooling
probe In a blood vessel.

396
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,529
Warm him from the outside.

397
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,085
With blankets and
meds for shivering.

398
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:18,157
So we take the existing
rabies protocol.

399
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,657
And tweak it just a bit.
I mean, it could work.

400
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:23,788
I mean,

401
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,873
It has never been done before.

402
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,291
This is completely hypothetical.

403
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,168
And the minute Bryce was bitten,

404
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,629
Hypothetical became
his only chance.

405
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,448
- Thanks for coming.
- Flattered you remembered me.

406
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:40,427
You wrote that "Dr.
Reality star" piece.

407
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,722
I framed it.

408
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,770
That's kind of you,
since it was, uh,

409
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:50,801
Shall we say, a
balanced profile?

410
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,737
Well, I appreciated
your honesty.

411
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,695
- That's why I called you.
- Look, we've sniffed around.

412
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,789
The medical board's
incompetence Many times before,

413
00:19:57,872 --> 00:20:00,866
But without any proof,
We never get anywhere.

414
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:03,311
I have case files.

415
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:09,876
And patients that all
Are willing to talk.

416
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,603
And I thought if you
published Their stories...

417
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,546
The board is appointed
by the governor,

418
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,122
Approved by the state senate.

419
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:16,552
You understand
that, by doing this,

420
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,956
You'll be rocking
a very big boat.

421
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,719
Oh, yeah, it's an ocean liner.

422
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,388
You know, all doctors
Benefit from the shield.

423
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,944
The white coat provides.

424
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:25,526
And I have, too.

425
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,562
Malpractice breaks Our
oath to do no harm,

426
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,019
But it also destroys the public
Trust in even the best doctors.

427
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:34,800
And the-the bad ones are few.

428
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,429
But they need to be weeded out.

429
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:41,148
And the guard dogs
need to be reminded.

430
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:43,040
Of who they're meant to protect.

431
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,047
You mind if I record this?

432
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,835
I'm counting on it.

433
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,741
Heavenly.

434
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:02,578
You have a green thumb.

435
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:05,749
Well, I have a
well-paid landscaper.

436
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:16,955
You've got your career,
Your beautiful home,

437
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,613
Your well-paid landscaper.

438
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,709
Is that all you need?

439
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,097
Well, if-if you're inquiring
About my dating life,

440
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,124
I-I assure you,
it's-it's quite robust.

441
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,192
Dating is fine.

442
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:38,387
But you have to open
Yourself up to love.

443
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:41,726
What about a family?

444
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,896
Bah.

445
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,069
Don't you worry about me, mom.

446
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,918
- Mm.
- I'm gonna be okay.

447
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:58,050
I want you to be more than okay.

448
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,932
You know what we need?

449
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,854
A trip to butter bean
beach in savannah.

450
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:13,315
We haven't been in so long.

451
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:16,285
Yeah, I don't think We
can manage that, mom.

452
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,920
I've turned a corner, aj.

453
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,841
We'll bring home
a pile of shells.

454
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,678
Come on, baby. Let's go.

455
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:30,635
Mom, you... You okay?
Need some water?

456
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:35,596
Can you get me back inside?

457
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,905
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

458
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:47,581
Rabies.

459
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,157
Crazy, huh?

460
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,704
I heard you did the intake.

461
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,523
More like blew the intake.

462
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,037
I'm trying to convince myself.

463
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,176
That it wasn't what will Kill
him because no matter what,

464
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,957
Too many days had
passed since the bite,

465
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,796
And he came in too late.

466
00:23:05,393 --> 00:23:06,903
All right.

467
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,629
Temperature probe is set.

468
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:11,440
We're gonna start Cooling
you down now, okay?

469
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,897
In order to protect your airway.

470
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,706
We're gonna intubate you
With a breathing tube.

471
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,897
And you'll enter A
light hibernation state.

472
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,087
You'll feel drowsy.

473
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,693
And your breathing And
heart rates will fall.

474
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,888
Like a bear. Love bears.

475
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,906
Yeah, like a bear.

476
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:31,957
But we need to keep you awake
As long as possible. So,

477
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,518
Dr. Bonner is
gonna sit with you,

478
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:38,508
And she's gonna perform
Serial neurochecks.

479
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:42,422
Basically, that just means
She's gonna talk to you.

480
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:45,017
And keep you awake. All right?

481
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,240
Listen, we-we were
just outside, right?

482
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:04,817
- She-she was lucid, she was happy...
- remember what I said.

483
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,612
At the very end,
patients can rally.

484
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,400
And have their best
day in a long time.

485
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:12,247
Your mother is
dying. Maybe today,

486
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,870
Maybe tomorrow or the next
day. We don't know when.

487
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:19,459
She is accepting,
no longer fighting.

488
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,550
That is a huge win.

489
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,573
Now, dr. Austin, it's your turn.

490
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,219
What-what should I do?

491
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,182
Don't burden her
with your grief.

492
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:33,915
Honor all that she
is and has been.

493
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,292
Say any words left unsaid.

494
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,952
The last thing they
lose Is their hearing,

495
00:24:37,985 --> 00:24:40,212
So talk to her, if you wish.

496
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:11,160
Hey, ma.

497
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,082
You know, I don't know...

498
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:22,379
If I've ever said
thank you enough.

499
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:30,911
Everything that I have become...

500
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,292
Is because of you.

501
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,611
I think all this time

502
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:40,713
I've been afraid of losing you.

503
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,378
But these last couple of days,

504
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,927
You have shown me that

505
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,973
I can never lose you.

506
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,889
And...

507
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,398
You will not lose me.

508
00:26:02,032 --> 00:26:04,300
'Cause I will be
here by your side.

509
00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:10,034
I'm not gonna leave you.

510
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,743
We've done all this...

511
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,435
And it looks like Bryce
is gonna die anyway.

512
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,594
Should we have already quit?

513
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:42,727
You're tired.

514
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,657
You haven't slept in days.

515
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,525
Come here.

516
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,859
How's padma?

517
00:26:58,942 --> 00:27:00,421
Depressed about aj.

518
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:03,288
Feeling the loss of this chance.

519
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:07,686
But she'll understand The
story is just beginning.

520
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:10,037
She'll come around
to freezing the eggs.

521
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,679
Hmm.

522
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,093
What if I offered to
be the sperm donor?

523
00:27:19,842 --> 00:27:21,671
You can't be serious.

524
00:27:21,754 --> 00:27:22,754
Why not?

525
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,551
Doesn't it solve
everyone's problems?

526
00:27:24,634 --> 00:27:28,418
Wouldn't it help us, too,

527
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:29,723
In the end?

528
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,276
No, Devon.

529
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,562
My egg and your sperm
Would make<i> our</i> baby.

530
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:37,231
We couldn't give that baby away.

531
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:40,213
Well, I agree it would be
Complicated, but hear me out.

532
00:27:40,296 --> 00:27:43,158
We would be the-the
fun Uncle and auntie.

533
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:45,421
Everybody wins,
especially the kid.

534
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:48,233
You're tired.

535
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:51,396
I'm going to have to
Believe that because this is

536
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,340
- a truly awful idea.
- Why?

537
00:27:55,569 --> 00:27:57,590
Because I couldn't handle that.

538
00:27:59,151 --> 00:28:01,773
And I'm utterly
astonished that you can.

539
00:28:03,173 --> 00:28:05,847
It puts my sister between
us In a bizarre way.

540
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,687
It affects my relationship
With her profoundly,

541
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,687
And with the kid,
and with you and me.

542
00:28:12,748 --> 00:28:14,610
Can't you just
discuss it with her?

543
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,287
No.

544
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:21,055
I don't want to talk
about Any of this at all.

545
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:32,880
You like music? You
have a favorite band?

546
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:38,644
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

547
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:41,552
Stay with me. Uh, how about
I try to guess what it is?

548
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:43,060
Grateful dead?

549
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:46,977
Okay, um, how about phish?

550
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,853
You seem like a phish guy.

551
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:53,107
Oxygen is dropping.

552
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,641
The vent's starting
to take over.

553
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:56,466
Page pravesh and Hawkins.

554
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:58,634
Let them know he's got
signs Of papilledema.

555
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:00,235
Increased pressure in the brain.

556
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,990
I think we need
neuro right away.

557
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,685
Good call. Not
very many doctors.

558
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:09,678
Would have caught it off
of Such a subtle finding.

559
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:11,995
Can you give him The
extra ventricular drain?

560
00:29:12,078 --> 00:29:15,492
We can, but there's a limit to
How much csf fluid he can lose.

561
00:29:15,575 --> 00:29:17,345
If the pressure shoots
up Too high, too fast...

562
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,841
I'm not sure I'll
be able to stop it.

563
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,897
This patient is young,
Otherwise healthy.

564
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,357
He's got good brain plasticity.
No signs of herniation.

565
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,008
So you're saying
we risk the evd.

566
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:29,252
I am.

567
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,228
We push ten milligrams
of Ketamine.

568
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,321
And midazolam to drop his
Temperature by two more degrees.

569
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:38,338
Okay, let's do it.

570
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:01,917
Mom?

571
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:34,851
Devon.

572
00:31:38,425 --> 00:31:39,757
What?

573
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,476
He's getting better.

574
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:45,605
His antibody titers are rising.

575
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:49,324
His body's fighting
this infection.

576
00:31:53,387 --> 00:31:55,808
His intracranial pressure
Is in normal range.

577
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:57,193
This is amazing.

578
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:58,739
We won't know what deficits
He'll have until we.

579
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:01,053
Bring him out of the
Hypothermic state, but...

580
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:06,851
These are really good signs.

581
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:11,055
Okay, uh, we start slow.

582
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,940
We raise his core
body temperature up.

583
00:32:13,023 --> 00:32:15,692
Half a degree at a time until
He regains consciousness.

584
00:32:30,797 --> 00:32:33,157
Frank, how's the
morning treating you?

585
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,354
How dare you go to the press?

586
00:32:35,437 --> 00:32:36,800
You've had it in
for other doctors.

587
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:39,128
From the moment you
set foot On our board.

588
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:41,654
<i>Not true. I love
doctors. Good doctors.</i>

589
00:32:41,737 --> 00:32:43,729
You think I can't
get a story out.

590
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:45,005
To counter the one you leaked?

591
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,073
<i>You want to start a
media war, Be my guest.</i>

592
00:32:47,156 --> 00:32:49,346
And we'll be asking The
governor to relieve you.

593
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:50,895
Of your position.

594
00:32:51,808 --> 00:32:54,307
Enjoy your little
victory While it lasts.

595
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,505
No, it's our little
victory, frank.

596
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:58,854
Bad doctors will now
be Brought to justice.

597
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,817
That's what we
all wanted, right?

598
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,446
That's the job.

599
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:09,828
Leela.

600
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,308
What's this?

601
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,589
An apology.

602
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:26,810
I've had time to think.
Freezing is the right option.

603
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:29,793
It's also the only option.

604
00:33:31,755 --> 00:33:33,587
Apology accepted.

605
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,256
I would have loved to
find Another donor.

606
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:39,323
A doctor or a nurse,

607
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:41,133
Or just a nice guy
hanging around.

608
00:33:44,464 --> 00:33:46,316
You're so lucky to
have found Devon.

609
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:49,010
You have no idea, Leela.

610
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,530
I know he's not perfect, but...

611
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,442
But he's gonna make A
great father one day.

612
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,240
And you'll never have to
wonder About who's gonna be.

613
00:33:58,264 --> 00:33:59,371
Part of your baby.

614
00:34:00,744 --> 00:34:03,250
If you ever decide To
have a family, that is.

615
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:09,805
You'll find a new
donor. Someone great.

616
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,909
When the time is right.

617
00:35:54,497 --> 00:35:55,988
And he's back.

618
00:35:59,377 --> 00:36:01,167
Welcome back, buddy.

619
00:36:58,813 --> 00:37:00,683
<i>Welcome back. I'm Kimberly gund</i>

620
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:03,142
- shh!
<i>- Joined now by dr. Randolph bell,</i>

621
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:05,664
<i>chastain memorial surgeon
And now former member</i>

622
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:08,490
<i>- of georgia's state medical board.
- Thank you for having me.</i>

623
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:10,354
<i>There's quite a
scandal unfolding.</i>

624
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,614
<i>Lack of oversight.</i>

625
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,083
<i>Doctors who should
lose their licenses</i>

626
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:14,509
<i>are still practicing.</i>

627
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:16,552
<i>The board doing nothing
To protect the patients</i>

628
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,846
<i>- they are tasked to protect.
- Oh, it doesn't end there.</i>

629
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:21,683
<i>The governor and politicians
All over Georgia,</i>

630
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:24,287
<i>who are supposed to make sure
That the board does its work,</i>

631
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,844
<i>are bought and paid for
By every single entity</i>

632
00:37:27,927 --> 00:37:30,037
<i>that stands to lose
In a malpractice suit.</i>

633
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,333
<i>And there are many.</i>

634
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,045
<i>Hospitals, doctors, insurance
Companies; The list is long.</i>

635
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,467
<i>- And it is full of deep pockets.</i>
- Finally!

636
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,133
<i>The medical industrial
complex Gives more money</i>

637
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,757
<i>than any other single
donor, Including the nra.</i>

638
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,555
<i>It just has to stop.</i>

639
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,317
<i>I understand only 2% Of
all malpractice cases</i>

640
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,395
<i>are ever reviewed By
the state medical board.</i>

641
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:51,045
<i>Break down for us, if you will,</i>

642
00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:53,538
<i>how everyday citizens are
Supposed to get the attention</i>

643
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:56,240
<i>- of the board.
- Well, that's at the very - heart of this, isn't it?</i>

644
00:37:56,323 --> 00:38:00,388
<i>Because most people don't know
That the state medical board</i>

645
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:03,391
<i>is there to protect patients.</i>

646
00:38:03,474 --> 00:38:04,542
<i>Who knew?</i>

647
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:06,731
He just called out The
whole medical board.

648
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,771
He just called out
The freaking governor.

649
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,665
That's my man.

650
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:19,757
You're tracking
much better, Bryce.

651
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,347
And you have some
intentional movement.

652
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,095
In all four of your limbs.

653
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:26,389
And it may not seem like it yet,

654
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:28,416
But that is monumental.

655
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:31,187
The virus did a number
On your nervous system,

656
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,255
But you just beat one of
The most fatal diseases

657
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:36,270
- on the planet, man.
- Yes, you did.

658
00:38:36,932 --> 00:38:39,443
And you're a young guy
With a young brain.

659
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,687
With the ability
to rewire itself.

660
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,598
I spoke to the rehab facility.

661
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:45,681
They're gonna roll out The
red carpet for you, Bryce.

662
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:48,193
You're a medical celebrity.

663
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:55,346
You know, people are
saying You ought to have.

664
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,030
A whole wing dedicated
To this success story.

665
00:38:58,113 --> 00:39:01,616
The Hawkins-pravesh
rabies Treatment facility.

666
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:03,968
You mean the
pravesh-Hawkins facility.

667
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,001
Ha-ha, I like hers better.

668
00:39:06,084 --> 00:39:08,956
But honestly, if I never see
Another rabies patient again.

669
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,814
It'll be too soon.

670
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,888
Excuse me a sec, guys.

671
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,150
Congratulations.
I'm so proud of you.

672
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:22,302
It was a team effort.

673
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:25,691
So, uh

674
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:31,036
- are things weird between us?
- Not weird.

675
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,922
And we don't even
have to discuss it.

676
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:35,211
Because padma agreed
To freezing the eggs.

677
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:38,067
Oh.

678
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:42,267
I thought you said Her
biological clock was ticking.

679
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,990
What can I say?

680
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,050
She hit snooze.

681
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:50,625
You know my sister.

682
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:52,439
Hmm.

683
00:39:55,491 --> 00:39:58,156
Devon, did you really want
To father my sister's child?

684
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,191
No, I-I...

685
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,008
I don't know, I just...

686
00:40:03,726 --> 00:40:06,613
I don't know, I just want
To help in any way I can.

687
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:11,826
I have to get to surgery.

688
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:13,995
Congrats again on your patient.

689
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:27,468
Hey.

690
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,476
- Look at that.
- Italian. Gigi's favorite.

691
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:32,295
And she insisted It
was your favorite, too.

692
00:40:32,378 --> 00:40:34,484
Of course. Come on in.

693
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,118
- Hey.
- This is for you, dr. Austin.

694
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,882
I'm sorry about your mommy.

695
00:40:38,965 --> 00:40:40,977
Oh, thank you, double-g.

696
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,965
Oh, I really appreciate it.

697
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:44,908
All right, you guys come on in.

698
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:52,708
Oh, these flowers are
So nice. Thank you.

699
00:41:08,492 --> 00:41:10,938
Everyone at chastain misses you.

700
00:41:12,271 --> 00:41:13,413
I feel that.

701
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,249
I'm not ready to come back yet.

702
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:18,919
You know, I...

703
00:41:19,002 --> 00:41:20,755
I'm used to checking on her.

704
00:41:21,475 --> 00:41:23,441
You know, listening
for her voice,

705
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:25,276
For her every move.

706
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:27,385
Now it's just silent.

707
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,306
And I'm all alone.

708
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:35,577
I could lend you gigi.

709
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,707
Daddy!

710
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,537
Daddy needs a break.
I'll pick you up in.

711
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,207
Say, what, about a week?

712
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,967
What do you say, uncle aj? Yeah?

713
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:56,559
- Are you nervous?
- Why would I be nervous?

714
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:57,820
Because it's hatch day.

715
00:41:57,903 --> 00:41:59,600
Time to find out If
you're a good chicken.

716
00:42:04,156 --> 00:42:05,316
Dr. Austin.

717
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:07,485
I didn't expect to see you here.

718
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:10,194
I'm so sorry about your mother.

719
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,872
Me, too. How are you?

720
00:42:16,168 --> 00:42:17,310
Grieving.

721
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:21,482
It's gonna take
some time, right?

722
00:42:22,422 --> 00:42:25,547
But it's time that a woman

723
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,717
<i>women</i> going through ivf.

724
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,014
Cannot afford to waste.

725
00:42:32,857 --> 00:42:35,564
So, padma, if it's not too late,

726
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,467
I would like to be
your sperm donor.

727
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:42,860
And you didn't think The
universe would come through.

728
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:45,737
Yes. Yes. Yes!

729
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,709
But there is a condition.

730
00:42:54,098 --> 00:42:57,189
Now that I'm alone in the world,

731
00:42:58,007 --> 00:42:59,867
I realize I-I don't
like being alone.

732
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,540
So if we're going to do this,

733
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:05,617
I don't want to just be a donor.

734
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,169
I've got to help
you raise this kid.

735
00:43:09,946 --> 00:43:12,765
I want to be a father.
