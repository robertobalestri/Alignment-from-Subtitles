1
00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:04,621
The CEO job is yours
if you want it.

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:05,522
You're damn right I do.

3
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:07,023
Your name's on everyone's lips.

4
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:09,159
The CEO who made Chastain
$900 million.

5
00:00:09,159 --> 00:00:11,361
Yeah, we made a huge profit,

6
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:12,962
but now we're in business
with Big Pharma.

7
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:14,531
What's her deal?

8
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,032
Billie's the most promising
neurosurgery resident.

9
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:17,434
Or was, until she

10
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,869
wrecked one of Conrad's patients
and got fired.

11
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:21,205
Who'd have thought you
and Dr. Devi

12
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:22,639
would be so perfect
for each other?

13
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,209
You guys must have a name
picked out by now.

14
00:00:25,209 --> 00:00:27,211
Giorgiana Grace Hawkins.

15
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:32,116
Mama.
-Mama isn't here.

16
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:33,983
We talked about that.

17
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:36,486
She's gonna be back
tomorrow night.

18
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:38,888
You are with Da Da now.

19
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:41,125
Can you say "Da Da"? Huh?

20
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,193
Da Da. Da Da.
No, not the bag.

21
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:45,295
-Okay.

22
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,365
It's Mommy.
Hey, sweetheart.

23
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,800
Hey, how's it going so far?

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,370
You've only been gone for
30 minutes. So far so good.

25
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,705
I'm worried GiGi will
be upset without me.

26
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:57,207
Don't forget Mr. Giraffe.

27
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:59,409
He's already packed.

28
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,678
I already miss her.
Let me talk to her.

29
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:03,747
No, you're driving.

30
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:06,883
-Then I'll pull over.

31
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:09,886
Keep going. I got this.
I'm Super Dad.

32
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:11,988
I am turning back.

33
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,192
No, don't. Look,
you're making GiGi cry saying

34
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:16,526
you're gonna turn back.

35
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:18,195
She wants to spend time
with her daddy.

36
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:19,929
Just enjoy the spa retreat,

37
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:22,065
and I promise I won't
drop GiGi on her head.

38
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:23,433
Okay, I love you. Bye.

39
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:26,002
Eh, I know you want to
just hang out with me.

40
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,371
That's why you're crying. Right?
And this bag.

41
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:29,005
You were probably crying
about this bag.

42
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,107
We need a daddy bag.
That's a mommy bag.

43
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:33,777
* Love you most of all... *

44
00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:35,279
You need to eat.

45
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:37,046
You skip breakfast
way too often.

46
00:01:37,046 --> 00:01:39,115
Oh, smell that coffee.

47
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:40,950
-You're too good to me.
-Half-caf,

48
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,419
-just the way you like it.
-Eh!

49
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,725
-I have news.
-Mm-hmm.

50
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:53,430
Chastain is in the black
for the first time ever.

51
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,265
Well, kudos.

52
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:58,602
Speaking as a former CEO,
don't rub it in.

53
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:02,206
Oh, please. You have plenty
to be proud of.

54
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,609
You're doing more surgeries
than anyone, except AJ.

55
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:08,745
You're a patient magnet,
and our top earner.

56
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:11,281
Well, now that Cain's gone,
I suppose that's true.

57
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:13,983
I hear he's raking in the coin
at Johns Hopkins.

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,322
What is that?

59
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:25,128
We control your systems.

60
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,631
Soon we will send our demands.

61
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:30,767
First, a demonstration
of our power.

62
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:32,736
Watch what crashes first.

63
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:37,173
It's a ransomware attack.

64
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:40,510
* Called a bad seed,
banging on the street

65
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,980
* Hanging around the wolfpack
every night...

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,283
That's my thank-you
for last night.

67
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:48,618
That birthday feast you made me.

68
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,487
You did it up nice.

69
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,322
I aim to please.

70
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,190
That tandoori fish...

71
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,994
Was almost as good
as the long, slow,

72
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:00,997
-delicious dessert.

73
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:02,599
* All right. *

74
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,439
So how about we stay
at my place tonight?

75
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,641
That's two full nights in a row.

76
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:13,176
-Devon...
-What?

77
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:14,544
You don't think everyone doesn't
know about us already?

78
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:16,980
I don't want to be looked at
that way at work.

79
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,348
What way?

80
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:20,884
Like the girlfriend.

81
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:24,153
Okay. I get that.

82
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:26,189
Well, we'll keep talking
about it, all right?

83
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,825
Fine. Your place.

84
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:30,327
No. No, no, no, no.

85
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:31,861
I mean moving in together.

86
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,963
Enough of this back-and-forth.

87
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,065
-I like my place.
-And I like mine.

88
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:38,067
But if we put our money
together, we can get

89
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,404
something special.

90
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:43,006
And I could wake up to you
every single day.

91
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,208
Devi, Pravesh, ER stat.

92
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,710
Five traumas headed to Chastain.

93
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,314
Multiple victims.
Car versus charity 5K.

94
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:53,249
Wasn't Dr. Austin doing
a 5K today?

95
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,097
All right, Winston, buddy,
we're here.

96
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:09,599
We're going to the emergency
entrance,

97
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,267
and you're gonna meet
the finest team of doctors

98
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:12,536
I work with.

99
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:14,938
Hey, car came down
the belt line.

100
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:16,773
Drunk driver.
My velociraptors

101
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:19,443
and spectators got hit.
Winston Robards.

102
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:22,111
He'd be dead if my best runner
didn't push him out the way.

103
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:24,848
All right, let's move him.

104
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:30,454
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

105
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:36,292
-Good morning, Marion.
-Hi.

106
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,294
I'm so sorry. We have
multiple traumas incoming.

107
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,864
-I gotta run.
-You agreed to wait
for 15 minutes,

108
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,867
-Dr. Hawkins, to help
with GiGi's transition.
-I know. I know.

109
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,735
But this is an emergency.

110
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:48,037
-And when will Nic be back?
-Tomorrow night.

111
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:52,208
-All right, I think we can
hold out until then.
-When I'm out of sight,

112
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,710
pull Mr. Giraffe out
of the backpack.

113
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,713
That's her comfort animal.
Okay, GiGi.

114
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,282
It's okay. Have fun with Marion
and the other kids.

115
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:00,650
You like the giraffe?

116
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:06,322
Where's the girl who saved me?

117
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:07,824
She was in the ambulance
right behind you.

118
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:09,993
I have to meet it.

119
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:14,431
Ignore that alarm, Mr. Robards.

120
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:16,633
Your pulse is strong.

121
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,468
Check the leads and make sure
they're on right.

122
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:20,336
His heart rate is 300.

123
00:05:20,336 --> 00:05:22,506
Are you having chest pains?

124
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:25,274
No. My arm hurts, but that's it.

125
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:28,077
I'm fine, really.

126
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,345
His heart rate is normal.

127
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:32,348
This thing must be broken.

128
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,418
Hey, we need a new monitor,
please.

129
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,522
Something's wrong.
I can't access patient records.

130
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:41,357
Conrad!

131
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:43,760
14-year-old pedestrian
versus drunk driver.

132
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,696
Possible abdominal injury.
Head lac. Bleeding controlled.

133
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:49,132
Tachy. BP 102/60.

134
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:50,634
All right, Esty.

135
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,469
All right, honey, just hang
in there, all right?

136
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,838
I'm not leaving you, but I'm
tagging in another all-star.

137
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:57,974
This is Dr. Hawkins.
Conrad, this is Esty Hartman.

138
00:05:57,974 --> 00:06:00,009
This is my right hand at
the Georgia Youth Association.

139
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,344
And her dad, Ronan.

140
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,046
Daddy, it hurts.

141
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:05,949
-I'm right here, baby.
You're in great hands.
-One, two,

142
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,552
-and three.

143
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:11,488
She'll be okay, right?

144
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:13,156
She tried to help
the blind pedestrian

145
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:15,224
get out of the path of the car,
and they both got hit.

146
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:19,195
I see a little black and blue
around your eyes.

147
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:20,564
Does your head hurt?

148
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:23,967
Mm-hmm. But this hurts
a lot more.

149
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,072
There's possible internal
bleeding.

150
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,875
Dr. Devi, ultrasound, please.

151
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:36,580
It hurts.

152
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:44,153
Free fluid.

153
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,156
What the hell?

154
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,992
-We've been hacked.
-Oh, my God.

155
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,594
The ER is going haywire.

156
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:51,861
Can we have your attention?

157
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,329
Chastain is experiencing
a cyberattack.

158
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,332
Our systems have been
compromised.

159
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,601
Divert all ambulances.
No new admissions.

160
00:06:57,601 --> 00:07:00,737
Okay.
-Dr. Sutton. Dr. Bell.

161
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:02,772
A 14-year-old may need
an emergent ex-lap.

162
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:05,441
-Also a scalp lac...
What's going on?

163
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:07,210
...with possible
basilar skull fracture.

164
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,678
What's going on here?
-Daddy!

165
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,413
W-What's happening to my Esty?

166
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:11,881
-Daddy. Daddy, help me!
Okay, we've got you.

167
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:13,883
Just hang on, your dad will
join you in a bit.

168
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:15,585
Be right back, Ronan.
-Daddy!

169
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:17,521
Dr. Hawkins, what's going on?

170
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,856
Is this attack going to
compromise her care?

171
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,290
Here's how you help
your daughter.

172
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,226
You stay calm
and she stays safe. Okay?

173
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:25,094
You panic, she panics.

174
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:26,630
Where's she going?

175
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,297
Imaging.
I'll keep you updated.

176
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:30,133
-Is Dr. Austin gonna
stay with her?
-Yes.

177
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:33,637
Will you, too? Please.

178
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:35,438
I will.

179
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:37,140
Back to paper charting.

180
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,543
Use your heads,
remember the basics,

181
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:40,910
take manual vitals.

182
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,813
And if you don't remember how,
ask Hundley.

183
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,817
They just sent me their demands.

184
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:50,920
What do they want?

185
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,289
$5 million.

186
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:15,745
-$5 million?
-This is insanity.

187
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,246
How could you let this happen
on your watch?

188
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,684
It's happened to 200 hospitals
so far.

189
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:22,485
Health care involves
huge amounts of data

190
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,187
and relies on high tech.

191
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:25,922
A group called Ryuk
out of Russia

192
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,658
collected over $100 million
from health care providers

193
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,993
in ransom just last year.

194
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:31,761
Well, we're not adding
to their windfall.

195
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,264
The health of our patients
must be our focus.

196
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,435
-If we don't pay, people die.
-The ER is already crippled.

197
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,470
Next they might target
Dialysis, Labs, Imaging,

198
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,607
ICUs, ORs.

199
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,275
Dr. Voss has called in the FBI,

200
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,344
but we are looking at
a ticking clock

201
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:51,781
that will go off long before
help arrives.

202
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,484
Fix this, both of you,
or you're both fired.

203
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,964
-All right, we're good.

204
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,667
The ransomware hasn't
hit Imaging yet.

205
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,535
Let's hope they
can't crash all our systems.

206
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:14,303
Hey, Esty, don't worry.

207
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,905
That machine will not
hurt you one bit.

208
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,207
Yeah, it's not as bad
as it looks.

209
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:19,676
It looks hella scary.

210
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:22,411
Well, it's nothing
a velociraptor can't handle.

211
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:24,380
Especially my favorite one.

212
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,383
How's the blind man?
Is he gonna be okay?

213
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,018
Just a broken bone.

214
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:31,755
You saved his life.

215
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,757
And the other kids? Riley?

216
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:36,425
Riley's fine.
So is Mary Charles.

217
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:39,428
See? That's Esty.

218
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:41,230
She's in pain, she's scared,

219
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,533
and yet she's thinking about
everyone else but herself.

220
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:47,937
Hang in.

221
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:50,907
I'll go update your dad
and I'll be right back.

222
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,780
Hey... you're in good hands now.

223
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:04,553
So, we just took Esty to CT.

224
00:10:04,553 --> 00:10:06,055
I'll let you know the minute
we have a full picture

225
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:07,556
of her condition, okay?

226
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:09,525
Okay. Thank you.

227
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,628
I-I-I... I can't lose her.

228
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:15,231
I-I'm reeling here, I'm...

229
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:17,133
Sit down, sit down.

230
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:27,811
I-I know everyone says that
their kid is special, but...

231
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,445
Esty...

232
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:32,548
She's something else.

233
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:36,485
She's compassionate, loving.

234
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,654
She's my whole life.

235
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:42,091
You know, her mom left
a year after she was born.

236
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:45,128
It's always been
just the two of us.

237
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:50,233
I get it.

238
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,802
I'm a father, too.

239
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,838
I can imagine how awful
this is for you,

240
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:57,673
but rest assured, we are doing
everything we can.

241
00:10:57,673 --> 00:11:00,009
-Okay?

242
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:08,852
I'm sorry.
Just give me a minute.

243
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:10,486
Hey, Marion,
is everything all right?

244
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:13,823
Dr. Hawkins,
I don't mean to interrupt,

245
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:17,093
but GiGi is inconsolable;
we could really use your help.

246
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:20,964
Tell her I'm coming.

247
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:28,371
It's okay.
It's okay.

248
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,840
Da Da's here.

249
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,777
-Da Da's here.

250
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,546
-GiGi...

251
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:40,649
Okay...

252
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:48,391
:
Whoa, my love

253
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:52,061
My darling

254
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:55,664
* I've hungered
for your touch...

255
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:57,000
That's sweet.

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,734
I'll have to try that next time.

257
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:02,538
Sorry I haven't been back
sooner.

258
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:05,674
DEFCON 5 here.

259
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:09,012
Hospital's under
a ransomware attack.

260
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:11,380
I heard.
No sign of it here.

261
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,649
Text me right away
if that changes.

262
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,151
If I'm not available,
call my dad.

263
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,353
Okay.

264
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,989
Okay, Da Da's gotta go.

265
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,592
-Can you say "Da Da"?

266
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:25,661
Da Da. Da Da.

267
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,263
-Da Da!

268
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,165
Mama.

269
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,700
-Work on that, honey.

270
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,369
Can you say "bye-bye"?

271
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:35,939
-Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

272
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:40,776
How we doing, guys?

273
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:43,446
There. Basilar skull fracture.

274
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:44,948
Good call, Conrad.

275
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:46,682
There's no evidence of bleed.

276
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,284
We should be able to
get away without operating.

277
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:50,786
Well, we may not be so lucky
with her abdominal injuries.

278
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,956
Looks like a Grade 3
splenic lac

279
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:54,190
with a ruptured sub-capsular
hematoma.

280
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,960
Oh, no.

281
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,962
It's the ransomware.
They've hit Imaging.

282
00:12:58,962 --> 00:13:00,964
Spread the damage, upping
the stakes or something?

283
00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:02,131
It's the worst possible time
for this girl.

284
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:03,199
What's going on?

285
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,600
They could hit the ORs.

286
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,402
Can you please
let me out of here?

287
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:08,471
...she could just die
while we're waiting.

288
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,039
I thought you said the
splenic lac was a Grade 3.

289
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,807
I can't be sure.
The images disappeared...

290
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,943
It's a Grade 3.
I'm sure of it.

291
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:16,812
I've just-- I've trained myself

292
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,915
to absorb visual data
very quickly.

293
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:20,416
Her vitals are stable.

294
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,085
Grade 3 can be managed
non-operatively, so we wait.

295
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:23,652
And we watch her like a hawk.

296
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:26,655
We do serial abdominal exams
and blood counts.

297
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,724
Take her to the OR
if anything changes.

298
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,627
All right, Esty,
let's get you out of there.

299
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:33,396
How you feeling?

300
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,266
Esty?

301
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:48,912
-She's unresponsive.
-I'll call a code.
Grab that crash cart.

302
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:54,850
Heart rate's going
to 200 and climbing.

303
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,486
Help me get the pads on her.

304
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:03,792
She's hypotensive.
60 over palp.

305
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,594
Finally, a monitor we can trust.

306
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,930
She's in unstable tachycardia.

307
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,366
We're gonna have to shock.
Charge to 200.

308
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:11,634
And clear.

309
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,142
-And she's back.

310
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:22,378
Why did we need to shock
a 14-year-old?

311
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:27,050
-We almost lost her.
-Which is why my hand
is on this pulse.

312
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,551
We need to figure out
what's going on

313
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:30,153
before she crashes again.

314
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:45,734
I don't know what you're gonna
say; we've got a bum hand.

315
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,736
With one wild card.

316
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:49,405
I anticipated this could happen,

317
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:52,408
and last year I got
cyber insurance for Chastain.

318
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:55,078
-Well, that's a brilliant move.
-The insurance company

319
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:57,746
will pay something,
even if the board won't,

320
00:14:57,746 --> 00:14:59,382
but not $5 million.

321
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,250
So we negotiate.

322
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,520
Dobroye utro.
As by now,

323
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,224
you've seen your systems are
fully under our control.

324
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,826
The damage we can do
is unlimited.

325
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,396
We know we have to pay you,
and we will,

326
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:17,000
but the figure you've asked for
is too high.

327
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,334
It's more than we can
possibly...

328
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,036
Don't try to play us
for fools.

329
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:23,939
We-we have all
of your financial records.

330
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,183
I can get you $836,000
by the end of today.

331
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:39,222
Because you insult us,
we now want $10 million.

332
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,092
And don't forget...

333
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:45,028
If we don't pay, people die.

334
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,296
-People die. People die.

335
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,365
:
People die. People die.

336
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,101
People die.

337
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:58,474
We finally got her settled.

338
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:01,410
I'd really rather you not
stir her up again.

339
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:06,049
I just watched a 14-year-old
nearly die.

340
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,716
I just want to hold
my baby, you know?

341
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,552
I am so sorry.

342
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:15,824
This is a lot harder
than I thought it would be.

343
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:18,161
If it's any help,

344
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:20,296
it is for every parent.

345
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,568
Doc, Doc!

346
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,936
They can't reschedule
my routine colonoscopy.

347
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:30,473
-I am not drinking
that chalk soup again.
-Okay.

348
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:32,608
Just go back upstairs
and ask them for

349
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:34,810
a fit screening test.

350
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,946
You can do it yourself at home.
No prep.

351
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:40,015
Hey, Winston.

352
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:41,617
So, I can't access
your X-rays,

353
00:16:41,617 --> 00:16:45,521
but based on my exam,
you have a fractured radius

354
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:46,955
below the elbow here.

355
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,657
We're gonna have to
reset the bone, okay?

356
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,093
It's going to hurt.

357
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,860
We can't access anything
for the pain right now.

358
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,264
Not necessary.
I'm a hearty farm boy.

359
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,967
My father's remedy for
everything was rub dirt on it.

360
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:02,505
I trust your father
wasn't a doctor.

361
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:04,039
Full-time alcoholic.

362
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:06,609
But he loved all ten of us
till his last drunken day.

363
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,877
Go ahead, reset the bone.

364
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:10,546
Okay.

365
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:14,717
All right.
All right, you ready?

366
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,154
Okay. Okay.

367
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:20,456
All right, deep breath.

368
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,993
You're very brave.

369
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:27,530
Listen, you're gonna need
a splint,

370
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,665
but the cast room is backed up,
and so is Transport.

371
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:32,801
You may need to hang out here
with us for a while.

372
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,471
Happy to. And thank you.

373
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,006
We'll be back.

374
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,250
Leela.

375
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:56,592
Come here.

376
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,333
What's going on?

377
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:09,738
I've never experienced anything
like this before.

378
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:13,509
We're just trying to keep
our heads above water down here.

379
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,211
How's the girl?

380
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,112
She went into V tach.

381
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:19,748
-V tach? Why?
-We don't know.

382
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:23,118
Without imaging, it's just,
it's a total nightmare.

383
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,921
It's okay, come here.
It's all right.

384
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:28,557
It's gonna be okay.

385
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:31,059
What kind of monsters
extort blood money

386
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,696
by threatening the lives
of sick people?

387
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,364
These scammers are everywhere.

388
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,233
I have an old college friend,
a brilliant one,

389
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,468
who made it her mission to
turn the tables on hackers

390
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:42,971
who are stealing from
old people online.

391
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:45,241
That happened to
my uncle once.

392
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,643
They pretended he had
a bank refund coming in,

393
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:50,613
got him to give them
the number of the account,

394
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:53,382
and then they took
his entire life savings.

395
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:03,292
Nice, but...

396
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,328
possibly inappropriate
in this moment.

397
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:07,830
Thank you. Thank you for
helping me remember her.

398
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,733
I'm gonna call her. Well,
actually, maybe she can help us.

399
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,601
-Devon...
-Thank you.

400
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:43,198
I just-- I can't believe
I almost lost her.

401
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:44,833
Do you have any idea
why this happened?

402
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,470
We don't know for sure,
but our full team is on it.

403
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,772
And we're gonna do as extensive
of a workup as we can,

404
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,040
despite this ransomware attack.

405
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,776
It just feels like
everyone I love disappears.

406
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,778
-If anything happens to Esty...
-Don't go there.

407
00:19:57,846 --> 00:19:59,782
Any heart problems
in the family?

408
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,717
Uh...

409
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:05,288
I had an EKG once.
They said it was negative,

410
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,655
my heart was fine.

411
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:09,224
I have one brother--
he's healthy, too--

412
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:12,395
but our-our father died
young of a heart attack.

413
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,799
Okay.

414
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:20,135
Okay, give me a minute.

415
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,742
-Are the OR's running
for emergency surgeries?
-For now.

416
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:30,078
But we expect they could be
hit at any moment.

417
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,047
Anyone critical
who can be moved

418
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:33,582
is being transported
to Atlanta General.

419
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:36,352
We should probably transfer Esty
just to be safe.

420
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:41,924
Talk to my team.
Be right back.

421
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:44,827
How are we looking? Can we
move her to Atlanta General?

422
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,429
Neuro exam is still stable.

423
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:48,697
No electrolyte abnormalities
to explain the V tach.

424
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:49,698
Tox reports are negative.

425
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:53,201
Daddy, I don't feel good.

426
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,237
I'm here. I'm right here.
What's wrong?

427
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:57,239
Daddy, my shoulder hurts.

428
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,007
How about here?

429
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,009
Yeah, that hurts, too.

430
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,412
Much more than before.

431
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:04,947
Sir, you should step outside.

432
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,683
The shoulder pain is referred
pain from the abdomen.

433
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,452
Her splenic lac
must be worsening.

434
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:11,454
Her pressure is trending down.
90/60.

435
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:13,055
Well, she's too unstable.
We need to get blood into her,

436
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:16,058
and we need to find a way
to operate as soon as we can.

437
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:18,026
Our ORs are vulnerable
to attack.

438
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,630
Well, if this gets any worse,
she could bleed out and die.

439
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:25,401
Daddy!

440
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,778
-Daddy!
It's okay.
We're gonna help him.

441
00:21:35,778 --> 00:21:37,980
His heart's racing,
just like Esty's.
-Daddy!

442
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,649
Ambu Bag.
Give me
the defib pads now.

443
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:41,817
Daddy?!

444
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:44,453
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.

445
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:46,889
All right, charging. 200.

446
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,825
Daddy...

447
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:50,826
Clear!

448
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,106
All non-emergent surgeries
canceled. I can help.

449
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:05,340
Great. Uh, can you handle

450
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,509
the extensor tendon injury
in Three?

451
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:08,243
Yes.

452
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,946
Hey, Nolan,
I have to go upstairs.

453
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:13,516
I called in a friend who might
be able to help Chastain

454
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,518
with this attack;
it could be a while.

455
00:22:15,518 --> 00:22:17,420
-Yeah, go ahead. I got you.
-Okay.

456
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,488
Oh, and when you get a chance,
can you take Winston

457
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:21,524
-down to the cast room?
-Sure.

458
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:23,158
Hey, give me directions.
I can find my way

459
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:24,359
with my cane.

460
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:26,028
I'm sure the elevator
has braille.

461
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,530
No can do, buddy.

462
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,765
Let me finish up here and
I'll take you myself, okay?

463
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,017
What happened?

464
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:52,154
Your heart went into a dangerous
rhythm called V tach,

465
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:54,723
and you passed out.

466
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:56,892
It's the same thing
that happened to Esty.

467
00:22:57,693 --> 00:23:00,696
You mentioned you had an EKG?

468
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:03,966
Yeah. I got, uh,
hit with a line drive

469
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,401
at an Atlanta Braves game.

470
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:10,005
Passed out. A few minutes after,
they, they took me

471
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,040
to the, uh, ER.

472
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,243
-EKG was normal.
-Which ER?

473
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:17,513
Atlanta General.

474
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:21,349
Oh!

475
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:25,020
It's not V tach.

476
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,422
Anterior ST elevation.
He's having a heart attack.

477
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:33,195
Amy, we need 325 of aspirin,
sublingual nitro,

478
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:34,429
and 5,000 units of heparin.

479
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:35,898
Run to the pharmacy.

480
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:37,432
-Is the CATH lab up?
-Last time I checked.

481
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:39,201
Fluoro is still working.
I'll take him there.

482
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,837
I'll meet you as soon as I can.
I got to call Atlanta General.

483
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,607
The ORs have lost power
and they have no imaging.

484
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:47,075
We have critical patients
who need surgery.

485
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:49,912
It's life or death right now.
We have to act.

486
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:52,581
We must pay the ransom,
and we must pay it now.

487
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,517
If that means I'm fired,
so be it.

488
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:57,019
We have to get the bank to
move quickly with the money.

489
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,954
We will pay in cryptocurrency.

490
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:00,889
They will dictate the process.

491
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:03,792
If you refuse to do this,

492
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,360
you'll have blood
on your hands.

493
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,462
Dr. Voss, sorry to interrupt,

494
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:09,431
but I have someone who
might be able to help you.

495
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:11,133
This is Jessie Bhattacharjee,
an old friend,

496
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:14,803
who made a crusade of exposing
phishing scammers online,

497
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:18,406
the kind that raid
personal computers.

498
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:19,942
-This is a whole other league.
-We know.

499
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:21,710
But the exploit I created
hasn't been deployed

500
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,211
on your particular malware.

501
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,446
With a little tweaking,
it could work.

502
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:25,814
There's a chance

503
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:28,050
that we can turn the tables
on these hackers.

504
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,484
It's too late.

505
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:30,753
They want the money now.

506
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:32,454
We need the ORs.
They've lost power.

507
00:24:32,454 --> 00:24:34,657
Okay, get to work.

508
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:37,793
And just stall
as long as you can.

509
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,465
I've been waiting ten minutes.

510
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:44,967
This is urgent.

511
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,836
Okay, okay, hold on.

512
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,172
I think I got it.
EKG on Ronan Hartman

513
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:51,674
from last August.

514
00:24:51,674 --> 00:24:54,409
Um, no ischemic changes.
Nothing going on.

515
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:58,080
What I'm looking for is
subtle and easily missed.

516
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,582
Coved ST elevations in V2

517
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,517
or V3, like you see
in Brugada syndrome. Look again.

518
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:06,421
Hmm. I'll be damned. Yes.

519
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,657
Subtle, but it's there.
Brugada waves.

520
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:11,159
Text me an image.
And thank you.

521
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:17,199
Yes, we've agreed to your terms.
$10 million.

522
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,001
There's a minor glitch
on our end.

523
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,869
We're waiting for the bank
to release the funds

524
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:23,038
so we can convert
to cryptocurrency.

525
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:26,374
Why should we b-believe you?

526
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:28,677
The money is coming.

527
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:31,647
We just need a little more time.

528
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,489
This is Mr. Robards.

529
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:44,192
He has a fractured radius
just below the elbow.

530
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,460
I'll be right with him.

531
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,229
Can you have him wait
over there?

532
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:49,998
Uh, yeah, sure.

533
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:52,067
Winston, just gonna
chill out here

534
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,168
for a minute, okay, buddy?

535
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,405
-You okay?
-Yeah, it's nothing.

536
00:25:57,405 --> 00:26:00,075
-Just a hell of a headache.
-Uh-huh.

537
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,346
All right, Winston,
I'm gonna need you to

538
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:05,748
hang out here for a second,
okay?

539
00:26:05,748 --> 00:26:07,482
I'm gonna have you
hold onto that, okay?

540
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,717
Thank you, Dr. Nolan.

541
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:10,218
Thank the whole ER team
for me.

542
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:12,921
It's more than our pleasure.
Take care, all right?

543
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,842
Ronan has Brugada.

544
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,878
Likely his father did, too.

545
00:26:35,878 --> 00:26:38,346
Esty must have inherited it.

546
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,848
Strong work.

547
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,350
All right, a family history
of sudden cardiac death.

548
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,753
Well, they both need
defibrillators.

549
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,623
But that's the least
of his problems.

550
00:26:48,623 --> 00:26:52,360
Ronan's heart couldn't tolerate
the rapid rhythm.

551
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,763
He's having a massive
anterior wall MI.

552
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:56,799
Severe blockage
of the left main.

553
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,400
Tight narrowing of the LAD.

554
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,768
This is a widow-maker, Hawkins.

555
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:01,804
This isn't amenable to stent.

556
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:04,639
The ORs are down, and if
we don't operate now,

557
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:07,242
he'll be dead in an hour.

558
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:10,312
Esty's running out of time, too.

559
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:18,286
Devon, it's me.
I need your help.

560
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:20,989
Listen to me carefully.

561
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:28,831
Where are we at?

562
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,299
We've given her two
units of blood,

563
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:32,500
and she's still hypotensive.

564
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,169
Her splenic bleed is
opening up.

565
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:37,940
Look.

566
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:49,017
Halo sign.
This is spinal fluid.

567
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:54,289
The skull fracture.

568
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:55,858
Created a tear in the dura,
the lining of the brain.

569
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,425
She doesn't just need
a splenectomy.

570
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,427
Now, with this CSF leak,
she's at high risk of infection.

571
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,863
That's just great.

572
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:03,265
Let's start her on vancomycin
and ceftriaxone.

573
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:06,668
-Esty will need
neurosurgery, too.
No, that's impossible.

574
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:09,704
We don't have an OR,
or imaging of any kind.

575
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:12,474
We do of her spleen and brain.

576
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:15,010
I drew what I saw
after the CT went down.

577
00:28:19,181 --> 00:28:20,715
You have an incredible
visual memory.

578
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:24,186
-And you're an artist.

579
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:26,054
It's Devon.

580
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:28,824
Talk fast, friend.
Two lives are on the line.

581
00:28:28,824 --> 00:28:30,492
We found a power station.

582
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,294
Does it have enough juice?

583
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,696
Just enough to light up one OR.

584
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:36,899
We'll have to bag intubated
patients,

585
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:38,733
repurpose defibrillators
to monitor heart rates,

586
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:40,035
and hand-crank
the bypass machine.

587
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:42,304
We're on our way
with two patients.

588
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:51,213
He's tanking. Please tell me
there's an OR ready.

589
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:52,981
We'll have to handle
two patients at once.

590
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,383
We only have one OR
in the hospital with any power.

591
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,393
Excuse me.

592
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:08,831
I've been waiting to get
a cast for some time now,

593
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,765
and it's starting
to really hurt a lot.

594
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:13,201
And this sling helps
a little, but...

595
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:15,770
I-I'm so sorry.

596
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,439
Our tech just
went home sick,

597
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:20,442
and I don't feel great myself.
I'll find someone else

598
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:21,877
to do your cast for you.

599
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:25,080
Will you be okay down here alone
for a few minutes?

600
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,783
Yes, but please, I-I,
I don't mean to be a pain,

601
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:30,785
but I've been here all day,

602
00:29:30,785 --> 00:29:32,287
so please don't make me wait
much longer.

603
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:35,390
I'll have someone with you
as soon as possible.

604
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:46,368
Need more suction.

605
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,403
Lap pad.

606
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:51,473
Bell, I need your
assist on the CABG.

607
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,708
My hands are a little full
at the moment.

608
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,809
Yeah, well, mine are, too.

609
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:57,579
I have a massive anterior MI,

610
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:00,648
and you seem to have
capable assistants.

611
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:02,750
Well, I'm just finishing
the splenectomy.

612
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:06,154
Okay, Leela, I'm gonna need
you to take it from here.

613
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:07,255
Got it.

614
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:08,991
I know her anatomy
well from the scans.

615
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:11,659
And I can help, as soon as
I patch the dura here.

616
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:13,161
All right, let's
put him on bypass.

617
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,266
Talk to me.

618
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:20,602
His arteries are so
calcified, we can't find

619
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:22,270
a good landing zone.

620
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,438
It's a tough graft.

621
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:25,340
Needle driver to me.

622
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:33,015
Devi, Sutton, how's it going?

623
00:30:33,015 --> 00:30:36,084
Found the bleeder at the
resection line. Got it.

624
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,752
Still working on patching
the dura.

625
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:41,256
I'm using AlloDerm, but I
can't stop the CSF leak.

626
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,192
Leela, harvest a piece
of omentum.

627
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:45,793
I need to use the
lining of her abdomen

628
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:47,695
to patch the dura
and seal her brain.

629
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:49,364
On it.

630
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:54,536
-Okay, we are there.
-All right, stop bypass.

631
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,639
He's in V fib.

632
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,943
Charge to 20 and give
him an amp of epi.

633
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:05,013
Epi.

634
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:08,050
-Clear!

635
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:10,718
Again!

636
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:16,858
-Clear!

637
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:19,727
-Damn it!

638
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:22,230
-Clear!

639
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,032
-All right, someone,

640
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:26,801
someone with another idea.

641
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,736
Okay, the grafts are patent.
There's no clot.

642
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:31,039
-A good arterial flow.
-Why did this happen?

643
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,841
Because his ventricle
was too sick.

644
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,410
It couldn't tolerate being
on bypass.

645
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,145
No, that-that's unacceptable.
We can't call it.

646
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,082
He's going through
multisystem organ failure.

647
00:31:40,082 --> 00:31:42,484
We have to keep trying.
Think of Esty.

648
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,587
I am thinking about Esty!

649
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:48,090
I'm the one who has to tell her
that we lost her father!

650
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,260
Ea-Easy. Steady. Ev-Everyone.
Just...

651
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,929
even with full power, it would
have ended this way.

652
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:58,600
They call it the
widow-maker for a reason.

653
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:05,173
Leela... stop cardiac massage.

654
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,539
Time of death: 16:04.

655
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:02,297
Hello?

656
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,078
Hello? Hello?

657
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,793
Somebody help.

658
00:33:36,164 --> 00:33:38,166
Help me.

659
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:41,936
I'm almost done
updating the exploit.

660
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,139
We'll stall them
as long as possible.

661
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:45,440
Time is up.

662
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,175
-Where's our money?
Good news.

663
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:49,177
The bank has released the funds.

664
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:51,379
The entire board is here

665
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:54,482
to witness this transfer.
It will be done.

666
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:57,719
However, the crypto exchange
you directed us to

667
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,521
has flagged the transaction but

668
00:33:59,521 --> 00:34:00,888
says it should be approved

669
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:02,890
-momentarily.
-You are lying.

670
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,059
All of your data
will be destroyed.

671
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:08,230
Please, we're almost there.
You'll have all...

672
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,032
...all of your money very soon.

673
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:12,734
Be patient.

674
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,407
It's done.

675
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:23,311
I'll send proof of payment now.

676
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:27,749
Hello, fellas.

677
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:30,752
So, which one of you is Russian?

678
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:33,655
Because your IP address says
you're in Baltimore.

679
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,923
Oh, I wouldn't bother fleeing.

680
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,925
The FBI are on their way
to greet you.

681
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:39,761
Log out, log out.

682
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:47,369
Yes!

683
00:35:13,295 --> 00:35:15,062
My heart is breaking
for this girl.

684
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:17,299
Mine, too.

685
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,768
Life hangs
by such a fragile thread, man.

686
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:23,238
One minute, I'm talking to him,
and then, the next...

687
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:26,107
You know what?
I'm the one telling people

688
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:28,643
not to get emotionally involved,

689
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:31,713
but Esty--

690
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,216
she's a special girl, man.

691
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:37,452
And her father will not
see her...

692
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:39,254
graduate.

693
00:35:39,254 --> 00:35:42,290
He won't
walk her down the aisle.

694
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,329
You know, you did everything
humanly possible.

695
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:50,498
The-the man had a time bomb
in his chest.

696
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:53,435
Yeah, we could have
lost them both.

697
00:35:53,435 --> 00:35:54,836
We almost did.

698
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:58,506
You know, the silver lining
for Esty is

699
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:00,642
that Conrad diagnosed
her Brugada.

700
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:03,278
And when she recovers,
she'll get a defibrillator.

701
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:05,280
And without that,
she would have died young

702
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,014
like her father
and her grandfather.

703
00:36:07,014 --> 00:36:09,917
But she's gonna be alone, Bell.

704
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,186
Well, her father mentioned
Esty's mother.

705
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:14,188
She left
shortly after Esty's birth.

706
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:17,325
So I had our social workers
reach out to them.

707
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:19,861
They're working hard
to find her.

708
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:21,329
'Cause, yeah, maybe they will.

709
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,197
The woman left Esty already.

710
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:25,300
There's no way she's gonna
love her the way Ronan did.

711
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,535
Well, I have hope.

712
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,539
It's hard not
to love a child like Esty.

713
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:37,645
She has an uncle.

714
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:41,215
Her father listed his brother
as next of kin.

715
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:44,151
I'll call him.

716
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:46,521
He should be here
when you tell her.

717
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:53,295
I have to pick up my daughter.

718
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,046
Yeah. Oh, they're very nice.

719
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:14,048
-Can I borrow those?
Wow.

720
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:15,917
She's gorgeous.
The nursery called me.

721
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:18,353
Grandpa to the rescue.

722
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:22,357
Incredible job, man,
jerry-rigging that OR.

723
00:37:22,357 --> 00:37:24,392
Yeah, well, it takes a village.

724
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:25,893
And luckily, we have one.

725
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:27,429
That's not all Devon did.

726
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:30,732
His, uh, buddy Jessie,
a gray-hat hacker,

727
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:32,567
beat the attackers
at their own game.

728
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:36,504
Yeah, we got them on camera.
Now the FBI can track them down.

729
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,606
All systems are secure
and back online.

730
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:42,276
The hospital power has been
restored, including the ORs.

731
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:48,115
-You know what a lucky man

732
00:37:48,115 --> 00:37:50,585
-you are to have
this little one?

733
00:37:50,585 --> 00:37:54,088
Yes, I'm aware
of exactly how lucky I am.

734
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:57,291
Never more than at this moment.

735
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:22,249
I have to go sign out
my last few patients.

736
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,288
-I'll wait for you.
-No.

737
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:29,491
No, you go on home.

738
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:33,227
I'll go to my place,
you go to yours.

739
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,063
-We'll sleep.

740
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,065
Something we don't do a lot of

741
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,334
when we spend the night
together.

742
00:38:42,437 --> 00:38:44,839
And... we can

743
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,175
talk about moving in together

744
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,978
over coffee
tomorrow morning, okay?

745
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,416
Okay.

746
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,987
I'll see you.

747
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:08,362
Hey, guys, get out of here.
Next shift is coming.

748
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:10,364
Yeah, fine. No argument there.

749
00:39:10,364 --> 00:39:13,267
We're getting a beer.
Come along.

750
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,670
-You're buying.

751
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,275
We must get hammered.

752
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,646
Um, not yet.
I'm almost finished.

753
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:29,884
Hey, I don't see
that Winston ever checked out.

754
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:32,386
Did-did he get his cast?

755
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:34,822
Nolan took him down there.

756
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:38,626
Yup, took him there in person,
safe and sound.

757
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,396
He must have left
without signing out.

758
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:44,832
You can check on him tomorrow.

759
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:49,070
Hey, Shelly,

760
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,838
I'm gonna go down

761
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:53,340
and check on my patient
Winston Robards, okay?

762
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:16,363
Hello? Hello?

763
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,380
Winston.

764
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,217
Winston? Winston?

765
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:38,252
Hey, Winston?
Wake up, buddy. Come on.

766
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:43,257
Hey, can I get some help
in here?

767
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:46,260
Winston?

768
00:40:49,797 --> 00:40:54,035
You know, apart from work,
I spend 90% of my time alone.

769
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,937
Me, too.

770
00:40:55,937 --> 00:40:58,973
Tonight I just especially
am kind of feeling it.

771
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:00,708
-Yeah.
-Hey, do you...?

772
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,944
Do you want to get a bite?

773
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,949
That's really, really sweet, but

774
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:09,984
-I am just whipped, and...
-Yeah, of course you are.

775
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:12,486
That's... No, that's, uh...
Forget I asked. It's, uh...

776
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:14,989
You know, it's not like
I meant anything by it.

777
00:41:16,323 --> 00:41:19,093
-Good night.
-Night. Good night.

778
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,904
Till tomorrow.

779
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:34,942
* She never says
"I told you so"

780
00:41:36,611 --> 00:41:39,581
* And if she's mad,
you'd never know

781
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,853
* Exactly what it is
you've heard...

782
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:50,157
Yes.

783
00:41:50,157 --> 00:41:52,426
I know you love Mr. Giraffe.

784
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:59,133
* "It's nothing,
oh, just never mind"

785
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,369
* "Forget about it *

786
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:05,139
* Can't you see I'm fine?" *

787
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,509
* I get I've blown it *

788
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:11,979
* I don't know quite how *

789
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:16,450
* The mystery's on ice
for now

790
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:22,523
* What do you want me to do? *

791
00:42:24,558 --> 00:42:29,230
* What do you want me
to say?

792
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:35,703
* What do you want me
to prove?

793
00:42:36,871 --> 00:42:40,708
* Should I just get out
of the way?

794
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:45,179
* What do you want me
to say?

795
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,485
Mama.

796
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:57,491
Okay, honey. Okay.

797
00:42:59,393 --> 00:43:01,195
Mama.

798
00:43:01,195 --> 00:43:04,699
Da Da will have to do
until tomorrow night.

799
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:09,270
Da Da.
