00:00:02,404 --> 00:00:05,289
Bell, yank that sucker
and get out of here.

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:07,954
Dr. Bell.

4
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:09,876
Oh, my God.
Did you hit an artery?

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,078
On an appendectomy?

6
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:14,157
Maybe we should move in
together.

7
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:15,438
So you can look after me?

8
00:00:15,523 --> 00:00:17,659
If you're gonna keep being
a hero, somebody has to.

How to Go On Living

When Someone You Love Dies.

11
00:00:23,117 --> 00:00:24,719
Those books
don't have the answer I need

12
00:00:24,804 --> 00:00:26,142
when GiGi asks me
how her mother died.

13
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,477
Nic's dead.
Nothing's gonna change that.

14
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,244
If he doesn't find
what he wants, then what?

15
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:31,695
You'll be there
for him.

16
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:33,773
We all will.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,133
We need to get going.

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,375
Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:57,264
Five more minutes
in the love bubble.

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,199
Mmm.

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,929
Life.

23
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:08,134
Hey.

24
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:09,969

Good morning, angel.

39
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:07,228
You're up early.

40
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:09,330
What do you say we get you
changed into something fresher?

41
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:10,466
Huh?

42
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:11,717
Any objections?

43
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:14,109
<i>I know we're all excited</i>

44
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:16,264
for Halloween, but let's sit down.

45
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,803
Dr. Voss has
a very special surprise for us.

46
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:22,041
Spit spot, little ones.

47
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:24,811
Oh, don't we all look
wonderful.

48
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,451
Now, what do you suppose I have
in my magical bag?

49
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:30,529
I bet it's bones.

50
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:32,428
It most certainly
is not bones.

51
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:33,513
It's...

52
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:35,647
Oh.
Oh, wait a minute.

53
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:36,740
That is most odd.

54
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:38,763
It<i> is</i> bones.

55
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:42,990
Oh-ho.

56
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:45,224
Totally spaced
on getting GiGi a costume.

57
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,921
She doesn't know that.
Gonna be plenty

58
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:49,428
of costumes
in the dress-up bin.

59
00:02:49,513 --> 00:02:50,724
You can be a spider

60
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:52,147
- or a firefighter.
- Mm.

61
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:53,906
Right, GiGi?

62
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:54,741
Mm-hmm.

63
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:55,908
- Mwah.
- Ba-ba.

64
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:57,743
- Yep.
- Bye-bye.

65
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:59,076
Love you, GiGi.
Bye-bye.

66
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:01,429
May I venture a guess
at your costume?

67
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:04,990
Are you perhaps an on-duty
physician who should be off?

68
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:08,530
I know you're understaffed
today, so I thought...

69
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:10,593
Well, if it helps...

70
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:11,991
to have something
to focus on,

71
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:12,851
we'd love to have you.

72
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:13,944
Distraction.

73
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:16,303
- That's what I'm hoping.
- Good.

74
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:17,614
Good.

75
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:24,912
Uh, please.

76
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:25,842
What happened, hon?

77
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:27,272
I was pumpkin carving
with my boys

78
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:28,577
and I sliced a big chunk off.

79
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:30,139
- Can you put it back?
- Um, no.

80
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:31,693
Consider it a souvenir.

81
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:34,688
Pro tip: if you put salt
and baking soda on it,

82
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:36,006
it'll mummify.

83
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,171
Now, this place is
incredible.

84
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:39,367
Incredibly creepy.

85
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,102
Look at the fixtures.
They're ancient.

86
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,415
- What?
- And there's a place to store the bodies.

87
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:44,794
I prefer an apartment
without

88
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:46,172
the annual
cost of an exorcism.

89
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:47,444
They can't be cheap.

90
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:49,077
You're joking, right?

91
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:51,250
You don't seriously believe
in ghosts, Leela.

92
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:53,313
Hey, if you spent the holidays
at my uncle's place

93
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:54,742
in the Himalayas,
you would, too.

94
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:56,344
There are some mean spirits
there.

95
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:57,523
But look at this place.

96
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:59,063
21st-century plumbing,

97
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:00,640
heated pool, city views.

98
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:02,078
And it's right
on the BeltLine.

99
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:04,430
And no personality.
No craftsmanship.

100
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,310
Dogecoin or death!

101
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,195
Too much?

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,297
- Yeah.
- Maybe lose the machete.

103
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:12,483
Hey.

104
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:14,544
I didn't think
you were coming in.

105
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,400
Are you sure you're ready,
Conrad?

106
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:19,602
No.

107
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:21,805
But GiGi needed a change.

108
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,010
Well, if you get the urge
to bolt, we got you covered.

109
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,523
Get me out!

110
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:30,132
Get me out of here!

111
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:32,000
No, no, no!

112
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,523
Responded to a 911 call

113
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,350
from a neighbor!

114
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:37,054
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- One with head trauma.

115
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:38,093
All floridly delirious.

116
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,610
Tachycardic
but with stable blood pressure.

117
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:40,890
- Get off of me!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

118
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:41,914
You have to stay still.

119
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,164
- Calm down. -
- Get me out of here!

120
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,960
- How dare you.
- Let go of me!

123

Where's the high priestess?
I need to see her.

124
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:08,110
You will soon.
Your blood pressure is normal,

125
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:09,326
but your heart rate is fast.

126
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,520
I got to take a look at that wound,

127
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:12,387
- No, I won't stay here.
- Okay? Well, you have to.

128
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:14,145
I need to take a look at your head, okay?

129
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,347
Will you page Dr. Sutton,
have her meet you in CT?

130
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:17,776
- Sure.
- You're the one with the hat.

131
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,112
I hate those hats!

132
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:21,324
I can't help you
if I can't get a set of vitals.

133
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:22,898
They're burning
my skin!

134
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:24,993
Hundley,
can I get a hand over here?

135
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,827
Where-where are my girls?

136
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,513
Where are my girls?
Are they okay?

137
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,910
- L-Let me see them.
- I can take off your restraints

138
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:33,364
- as soon as you calm down.
- W...

139
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,973
- Can't let you hurt yourself.
- Aah!

140
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,481
That's just
the blood pressure cuff

141
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:38,761
inflating.

142
00:05:39,988 --> 00:05:41,341
Everything is so...

143
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,101
strange.

144
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:45,587
Aside from the abdominal pain,
does anything else hurt?

145
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:46,870
Hey,
does your head hurt?

146
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,942
We need to draw some blood,

147
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:50,216
but I need to make sure
you're safe.

148
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,339
Can you hold still
for me?

149
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:56,230

<i>How's it there?</i>

156
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,933
It's shaping up
to be a fun Halloween.

157
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,511
Although Conrad's here.

158
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,233
<i>I'm not sure

159

160
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:24,456
how was the sailing trip?

161
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,847
<i>It was phenomenal.</i>

162
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:26,988
It was a beautiful boat,

163
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:28,963
perfect weather, reconnecting

164
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:30,240
<i>with my running buddies was...</i>

165
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,370
U-Uh, lost you there.

166
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:32,817
Now, the whole trip
was like a time machine.

167
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:34,269
Took me right back to '76.

168
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:36,605
Just the-the innocence
and adventure,

169
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:39,400
<i>- and freedom!</i>
- Seems like you haven't returned.

170
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:40,774
<i>Hello?</i>

171
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:42,326
<i>- You still there?</i>
- Hey,

172
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,146
did I ever tell you
about the time I hitchhiked

173
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,981
across the country
between college and med school?

174
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:48,425
I can tell you're in the grip
of a powerful nostalgia.

175
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,152
But do be careful.

176
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:52,236
And don't you go picking up
any hitchhikers.

177
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:54,990
Yeah. I'll see you in a few hours.

178
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:58,251
<i>♪ I hope you'll understand ♪</i>

179
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:02,105
<i>♪ That I was born
a ramblin' man. ♪</i>

180
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:10,374
I want to see Holly and Cat.

181
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:11,635
They must be terrified.

182
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,878
We are caring
for them both.

183
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,777
Glad to see
you're calmer.

184
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,254
How you feeling?

185
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:19,522
Uh, like I could throw up.

186
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:22,469
Sounds like a wild morning.
Drugs?

187
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:23,989
- Alcohol?
- Oh, no, no.

188
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:25,496
Nothing like that.

189
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,855
No, we were just preparing
our Samhain ceremony.

190
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,863
Samhain?
What is that?

191
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:31,511
Witches' New Year.

192
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:34,714
When the invisible veil
that separates the worlds

193
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,738
of the living and dead is
at its thinnest

194
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,691
and we can connect
with those we've lost.

195
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,566
And this happens
on Halloween?

196
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:48,113
Halloween originates
from Samhain.

197
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,956
If you pay attention,
you'll see the spirits.

198
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:53,915
They're all around us.

199
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,574
When did you all
start feeling sick?

200
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,871
When I was cooking
for the "dumb supper,"

201
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:01,292
I started to see visions.

202
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:04,386
And then I had barely cut
the potat...

203
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:07,324
- Ugh.
- What's wrong?

204
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:08,760
Talk to me. Magdalena.

205
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:11,254
- Hurts. It hurts here.
- Sharp and stabbing

206
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,242
- or dull and throbbing?
- It's sharp. It's very sharp.

207
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,515
All right, I'll get an ultrasound

208
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,459
to take a look. Send off
another set of labs.

209
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:18,292
Hang tight.
I'll be right back.

210
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,355
What'd you think of that rental
property I sent you, huh?

211
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,540
We'd be neighbors.

212
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,389
One minute, 12 seconds
door-to-door.

213
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:46,631
I timed it.

214
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:49,969
I really liked it,
but Leela thought it was creepy.

215
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,350
Well, she should.
A guy did get murdered there.

216
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,795
How do you know that?

217
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:56,373
Oh, I-I track these things.
It's morbid,

218
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
fascinating.

219
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,945
Dude,
why didn't you tell me that?

220
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,054
Happened years ago.

221
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,748
I didn't think
it would bother you.

222
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,331
Well...

223
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:06,353
I mean, it doesn't.

224
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:08,007
I don't think.

225
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,616
Then you should grab it.
It's a steal.

226
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:16,992
Ethan.

227
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:18,445
I'm Dr. Pravesh.

228
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,859
- I'm Keitra, his girlfriend.
- Nice to meet you.

229
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:21,889
- Likewise.
- So I see that

230
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:23,133
you're having
some chest pain?

231
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,062
Weird...
bumpin' with my heart.

232
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:28,139
You know,
it don't feel right one bit.

233
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:29,988
I got tightness, too.

234
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:32,179
Like someone's got their hands
around my throat.

235
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:33,264
Okay.

236
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,650
Um, how long
have you been experiencing this?

237
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:36,989
Ever since we moved in.

238
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:39,295
Ethan believes some things

239
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,163
- about our new home.
- I know some things.

240
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,706
The-the place is crawling
with unruly spirits.

241
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,393
It's just old and a bit creaky.

242
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:47,259
But the English Regency
architecture

243
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:48,634
really
is something else.

244
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,244
It's inspiring, really.

245
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:51,760
- It's horrifying, more like.
- Okay.

246
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:53,707
I feel like I looked at
your house online this morning.

247
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,918
My girlfriend
and I are house-hunting.

248
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:58,869
Well, good luck.
Finding the right home isn't easy.

249
00:09:58,954 --> 00:10:02,495
Doctor, I-I'm not some prankster
here to waste time.

250
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,252
But I-I've heard

251
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,979
and seen things in the house
that-that ain't right.

252
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,236
And it's them that's causing all
these problems with my health.

253
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:12,036
Oh.

254
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,871
Here they go again.

255
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:15,292
Oh, they followed me here.

256
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:16,524
- It's okay.
- Relax.

257
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:17,542
Just breathe.

258
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,138
- Relax. Breathe. Breathe.
- Breathe.

259
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:22,955
It's okay. It's okay. Breathe.

260
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:24,854
Ethan, we're gonna get a nurse
in here

261
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,222
to give you some meds
to bring down

262
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:27,784
your blood pressure
and your heart rate.

263
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:29,487
We'll figure out
what is causing this.

264
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:31,121
And I'm pretty sure
it has nothing to do

265
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,250
with haunted spirits.

266
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:33,086
Agreed.

267
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,916
You want evidence
ghosts exist?

268
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,200
I can prove it.

269
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:38,321
I have video.

270
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:54,487
<i>No! Get off me!</i>

271
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:57,456
You believe me now?

272
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,760
Look, lights flicker.

273
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:01,753
It happens.

274
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,104
A-And the sheets
flying off my bed?

275
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:06,010
A breeze, maybe,
from an open window?

276
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:08,018
There was something heavy
on my chest.

277
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:09,352
I-I couldn't breathe.

278
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,814
I-I was suffocating.

279
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:13,596
Okay, let's assume
that your house is haunted

280
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:15,859
by cruel, vindictive spirits.

281
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,181
You must challenge
the spirits.

282
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:20,470
You have to earn their respect,
man.

283
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:22,014
They're air,

284
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,274
not corporeal.

285
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:25,184
They're puffs of smoke
at best.

286
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:27,946
Fear alone
sustains them.

287
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,166
If you're terrified of them,
they win.

288
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:31,783
And you cannot
let that happen.

289
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,210
I'm sorry, you're...

290
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:34,463
you're joking,

291
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:35,794
right, Doctor?

292
00:11:37,173 --> 00:11:40,217
I lived opposite a cemetery
in my younger years.

293
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:45,541
The view from my window
was row after row of headstones.

294
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:50,393
Imagine a graveyard full
of rowdy, disgruntled spirits.

295
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:51,698
They gave me nightmares.

296
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:56,124
They scared me witless
until I laid those suckers down.

297
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,087
I made them fear me
more than I feared them.

298
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:00,256
Right.

299
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,580
Wh-What'd you do?

300
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,581
I pointed out that they
didn't even have a working hand

301
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,041
to form a fist.

302
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,009
They couldn't hurt me.

303
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,414
Sure, they could blow
some wind.

304
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,229
They could stir
a curtain.

305
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:15,814
They could mess with the wiring
in the house.

306
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,322
But it was all to hide the fact
that they were powerless.

307
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:25,752
So, your treatment plan
is to stand up to ghosts?

308
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:28,436
If they are obstreperous,
yes.

309
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:33,127
But we'll also figure out what's
going on medically. All right?

310
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:34,495
That's right.

311
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,752
Thank you.

312
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:38,948
<i>No, I'm dead serious.</i>

313
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,685
Wait,
Al-Albert Collins is who?

314
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,182
Th-The Iceman.

315
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:45,150
- Just a le-legendary blues guitarist.
- Ah.

316
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:47,859
Anyway, his-his tour bus
was blazing down the highway

317
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:49,799
and they-they scooped me up.

318
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:51,417
The band had lost a roadie,

319
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:52,424
so I got to fill in.

320
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:53,745
Oh, that must've been wild.

321
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,877
Oh, it was a...
It was a great adventure.

322
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:57,878
I mean, I... I mean, I learned so much.

323
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:00,042
And, you know...
And for a moment, I mean, maybe,

324
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,824
I kind of thought
music might be my world and...

325
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,707
But then I...
On the road, I realized

326
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,173
I would never
be good enough.

327
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,636
Like, to get anywhere, you got
to figure out what you love

328
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,289
that you're good at
and then... and then do that.

329
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:12,448
Just play to your strengths.

330
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:15,276
- That is key.
- I'm still trying to figure out

331
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,418
what I'm good at, I think.

332
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:18,596
Well, I mean,
you... you will.

333
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,814
S... I mean, something
will grab you and then...

334
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:23,299
you'll realize you've found
your place and...

335
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:27,447
So d-did you grab medicine
or did-did medicine grab you?

336
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:29,721
That was a mutual embrace.

337
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,478
Just...

338
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:35,572
Hey, Kit. What's up?

339
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,479
Hey, Kit.

340
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,338
<i>Hi, whoever you are.</i>

341
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:42,190
Uh, yeah, this is...
This is Mike.

342
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:44,408
Just, uh,
giving him a quick lift.

343
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:47,569
<i>Right. Well, uh,
this is nothing urgent.</i>

344
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:48,971
<i>Just, uh, call me back</i>

345
00:13:49,056 --> 00:13:50,513
<i>when you've dropped off
your new friend.</i>

346
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:51,906
Okay.

347
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,768
Ooh.

348
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:55,502
- She seems concerned.
- W...

349
00:13:55,587 --> 00:13:57,230
It's probably 'cause
you picked up a hitchhiker.

350
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:59,207
Yeah, it would have been...

351
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,486
It would have been better
to just keep that between us.

352
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,692
What do you mean?
And not-not tell her?

353
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,344
Well, that...

354
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,104
She seems like she cares
about you.

355
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:09,107
- That would be dishonest.
- Y...

356
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:10,274
Oh.

357
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,205
Not good to be dishonest,
Randolph.

358
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:15,650
No. No, it isn't.

359
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,002
There's a trick-or-treat joke
that ends

360
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,471
with a Halloween arrhythmia,
but it escapes me.

361
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:28,885
All I've got is
a Halloween epidural hematoma

362
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,276
and some hyperkalemia in here.

363
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:31,543
But her colleagues could benefit

364
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:32,872
from your diagnostic acumen.

365
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:34,271
Dr. Angel?

366
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,759
Oh, he's hardly that.

367
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:38,201
His halo.

368
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,472
She's suffering
from wild hallucinations,

369
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:42,871
and I don't think
it's just the head injury.

370
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:43,909
Oh, Dr. Sutton,

371
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:45,736
my halo is no hallucination.

372
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:47,439
This is fact.

373
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,767
But let's take a look
at some EKGs.

374
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:56,642
<i>Hey.</i>

375
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,245
- So sorry...
- Hey. Get this.

376
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:01,557
Raptor, of all people,
believes in ghosts.

377
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:03,673
Seems like a lot of
people around here do.

378
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:05,730
Any word on the witch
with the head wound?

379
00:15:05,814 --> 00:15:07,706
Epidural hematoma...

380
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,206
uh, that requires surgery.

381
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,853
Billie and Leela
are gonna do it.

382
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:13,668
You think they took something
that caused all this madness?

383
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:15,667
Magdalena said
no drugs or drinking.

384
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:16,612
I'm inclined to believe her.

385
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:18,657
I'll let you know
when I get the tox screens back.

386
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:22,056
Hey.
What were you listening to?

387
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,342
<i>Hey. So sorry I missed your call.</i>

388
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:35,784
<i>That yoga teacher was a sadist.</i>

389
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,196
<i>Her session destroyed me
and I fell asleep.</i>

390
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:41,002
<i>I don't know if I got anything
from my retreat.</i>

391
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,776
<i>The pain of missing you and GiGi</i>

392
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:46,736
<i>was more than a mud bath
could make up for.</i>

393
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:48,979
<i>I love you both.
I'll see you soon.</i>

394
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,449
<i>Kiss GiGi for me, okay?</i>

395
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,736
You know you can go home.

396
00:15:58,002 --> 00:15:58,862
I got this.

397
00:15:58,947 --> 00:16:01,283
It's worse at home.
I'd rather be here.

398
00:16:04,978 --> 00:16:05,965
Come on.

399
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,174
- It hurts so bad.
- Hey, hey, hey. 'Kay.

400
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:15,474
Whoa.

401
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,144
Got ya, got ya. Okay.

402
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,987
She's bradying.

403
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:22,907
Let's get 0.5 of atropine
in here now!

404
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:24,154
I'll run an EKG.

405
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:27,033
Stay with us.

406
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:28,404
Stay with us.

407
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,907
Can you grab that EKG printout
for me?

408
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:32,823
Got it.

409
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,587
Okay,
we're back in business.

410
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,713
If this wasn't just
a vagal response

411
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,244
to the abdominal pain...

412
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:40,939
It could happen again.

413
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,275
Leave me alone!

414
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,525
Leave me alone!

415
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,503
- No! Leave me alone!
- Hey. Hey.

416
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,598
- Ethan. Ethan.
- Y-You're good. -

417
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:06,917
You're okay. You're okay.

418
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:08,862
Just take deep breaths
and try to stay calm.

419
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:10,151
Hey, I'm seeing some things.

420
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:12,198
- Spirits or symptoms?
- The latter. -

421
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:14,158
I'm ordering
a head and chest CT.

422
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,962
Magdalena?

423
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:19,906
Hey.

424
00:17:20,053 --> 00:17:21,195
You with me?

425
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:22,666
I'm dying.

426
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,212
But it's okay.

427
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,916
I'm gonna see him...

428
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:28,863
again.

429
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:29,988
Her heart rate's dropping.

430
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:31,439
Same thing happened to Cat.

431
00:17:31,524 --> 00:17:33,298
I'll get the atropine.

432
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:35,861
No time!
We need a code cart.

433
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:41,776
Giving first round of epi now.

434
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,705
Besides hallucinating,
she was fine a second ago.

435
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:48,525
Pulse check.

436
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,541
No pulse. She's in V fib.

437
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:52,194
Charge to 200
and everybody clear.

438
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,423
Shocking now.

439
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:56,439
She converted,

440
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:57,632
but her pulse seems thready.

441
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,009
She's in complete heart block.

442
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,837
Start transcutaneous pacing

443
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:02,152
at 60 and sync.

444
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:03,733
This could be hyperkalemia,
so...

445
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,400
let's give her
an amp of calcium gluconate

446
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,416
and two amps
of sodium bicarbonate.

447
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,752
Whoa.

448
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:22,934
I died.

449
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,923
But I'm back.

450
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,224
I mean,
that totally happened, right?

451
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:30,708
Stop pacing.

452
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:33,326
There's no tunnel.
There's no light

453
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:34,570
at the end.
There...

454
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,252
There's no angels.

455
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,252
I didn't see him.

456
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:41,291
I didn't see him.

457
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,791
See who?

458
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,409
My son.

459
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,792
I just wanted

460
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,564
to see his face.

461
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:54,791
Let's get a full set of labs
and another 12-lead EKG.

462
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:02,775
Why don't we let Dr. Pravesh
take over?

463
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,459
This isn't the best case
for you, Dr. Hawkins.

464
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,564
No,
I want to see this through.

465
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,189
Thank you.

466
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:20,400
All right, Cat,
let's see how you're doing.

467
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,331
Code Green.

468
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,596
Missing patient.

469
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,009
Attention, staff.

470
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:31,102
Code Green.

471
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,159
23-year-old Caucasian female.

472
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:36,424
<i>Last seen in ER Bay Seven.</i>

473
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,198
What's happening to me?

474
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,200
We're figuring it out, hon.

475
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,627
Labs are back?

476
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:24,297
Tox screens are clear,
but they do have hyperkalemia.

477
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,708
Potassium levels are sky-high.

478
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:29,018
But their creatinine
is barely elevated.

479
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,370
So their kidneys are working.

480
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:32,189
- PH is normal.
<i>- Just breathe.</i>

481
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:34,120
Why are their electrolytes
going haywire?

482
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:36,407
It's okay.

483
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:39,181
See this here in your chest?

484
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:40,581
Oh, I knew it.

485
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,252
They've invaded my body.

486
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:43,197
Actually,

487
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:45,743
I believe it is a growth
called a pheochromocytoma.

488
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,479
It's a medical condition

489
00:20:47,564 --> 00:20:49,752
that causes your body
to produce adrenaline

490
00:20:49,837 --> 00:20:52,400
and make you feel flushed
and anxious,

491
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:53,910
like you're having
a panic attack.

492
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:56,163
So he's not possessed
by spirits.

493
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:58,190
- It isn't the house?
- No.

494
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:01,743
And it will disappear when
Dr. Austin removes it in the OR.

495
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,259
Thank you, Doctor.

496
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:04,741
Of course.

497
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,057
<i>Police say they're on the trail</i>

498
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:12,705
<i>of a possible serial killer
near Reidsville,</i>

499
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,095
<i>about an hour west of Savannah.</i>

500
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:17,987
<i>A tip led them to this property.</i>

501
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:21,276
<i>Human remains were found
behind that shed.</i>

502
00:21:21,361 --> 00:21:25,008
<i>And it's possible there may be
as many as three victims.</i>

503
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:27,898
<i>The suspect,
Michael Jonah Rellie,</i>

504
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:30,271
<i>is likely armed and dangerous.</i>

505
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,624
<i>If you see him, do not approach.</i>

506
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,376
<i>Call the authorities
immediately.</i>

507
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:40,672
<i>You've reached Dr. Bell.</i>

508
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:42,282
<i>Leave a message.
I'll get back to you shortly.</i>

509
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,132
Randolph, you'll
probably think this is silly,

510
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:47,623
but I know
you picked up a hitchhiker

511
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:50,050
and I just saw something on TV
that made me a bit worried.

512
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:53,123
So... call me back, okay?

513
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:59,764
You all presented with a similar
constellation of symptoms.

514
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:00,709
Abdominal pain.

515
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:02,623
Abnormal EKGs.
Elevated potassium.

516
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:03,975
Hallucinations.

517
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,734
Your friend Holly said she saw

518
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:07,234
a halo above my head.

519
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,660
Do you see it, too?

520
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:10,288
And he has one, too.

521
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:11,803
Does everything look yellow?

522
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:14,307
- Yes. Very.
- Xanthopsia.

523
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,757
Uncommon visual side effect
of digoxin.

524
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:18,984
Well, that would explain
everything.

525
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:21,248
But are you taking
heart medication?

526
00:22:21,332 --> 00:22:23,491
I've never had a problem
with my heart.

527
00:22:23,881 --> 00:22:25,523
At least as far as I know.

528
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:27,587
Yeah, the others
aren't taking it either.

529
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:30,164
What plant is used
to make digoxin?

530
00:22:30,397 --> 00:22:33,116
Highly toxic foxglove.

531
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,762
Is there anyone
who would want to poison you?

532
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:38,190
A, uh, rival witch

533
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,866
or coven, perhaps?

534
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,155
Uh...

535
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:43,109
- I don't think so. Uh...
<i>- Well,</i>

536
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:44,889
we'll get you the antidote
to digoxin,

537
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:46,366
see if it helps.

538
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420
Okay.

539
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,384
You don't have to answer this,

540
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:55,006
but...

541
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:56,524
I've always wondered...

542
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:58,937
What's it like
to be a surgeon?

543
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,873
I mean, the-the knife.

544
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:05,108
Cutting into the human flesh.

545
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:06,051
I mean, that must be...

546
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,514
It's intoxicating.

547
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:13,827
That's-that's not something
I would normally tell a stranger.

548
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,453
But I...

549
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,382
Yeah, I don't think
a hit of heroin

550
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:20,492
could hold a candle
to the euphoria that I feel

551
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:22,046
when I have a scalpel
in my hand.

552
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:23,960
That's...

553
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:25,287
I'll bet.

554
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,555
All right. Mm.

555
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,409
This may be crossing the line.

556
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,795
Uh...

557
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,904
You ever killed anybody?

558
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:38,399
Mistakes happen

559
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,310
- in the OR. That's-that's...
- Yeah.

560
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:41,718
That's part of being a surgeon.

561
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:42,609
Sure. Of course.

562
00:23:42,694 --> 00:23:44,072
But what I mean is...

563
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:48,093
have you ever done something
where y-you knew it was wrong

564
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:49,994
but you did it anyway?

565
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,492
Oh, I see I hit a nerve.

566
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:57,467
No.
You didn't.

567
00:23:57,928 --> 00:23:58,977
Oh.

568
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:02,819
Whatever you say, boss.

569
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,782
Well, uh,
if you make a left up there,

570
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,453
I'm just about, uh, five minutes
down that road.

571
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:16,829
If it's not too much trouble.

572
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:28,373
I heard the patient is Wiccan.

573
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:32,092
She came into the ER
with two other witches.

574
00:24:32,358 --> 00:24:35,459
Really think they believe
in spells and potions and stuff?

575
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:37,679
I think people believe
in whatever gives them comfort

576
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:38,664
in this world.

577
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:41,358
And I'm okay with that.

578
00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:44,795
What do you think,
Dr. Sutton?

579
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:50,903
Right after Nic died,

580
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:53,325
I bought a copy of
<i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead.</i>

581
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:55,493
Read it every night for a week.

582
00:24:56,113 --> 00:24:58,163
In Tibetan Buddhism,
when you die,

583
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,769
your soul spends 49 days
in the Bardo...

584
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:03,396
the place in between
life and death.

585
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:06,192
After 49 days,

586
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:08,020
you're reborn into
another body.

587
00:25:10,113 --> 00:25:11,842
I want that
to be true.

588
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:18,027
I miss her so much.

589
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:27,582
Let's do this.

590
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:35,543
This-this is good.
You can... you can stop

591
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:36,628
right here.

592
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:38,053
This is in the middle
of nowhere.

593
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,162
There's not a house in sight.

594
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,469
Well, I know my way.

595
00:25:40,554 --> 00:25:41,638
Okay.

596
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:43,013
- If you say so.
- Mm.

597
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:45,667
Well, it's been good
traveling with you, Mike.

598
00:25:50,473 --> 00:25:52,067
Is there a problem?

599
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:58,099
Well, I think I have
to raise that question again,

600
00:25:58,184 --> 00:25:59,184
about...

601
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,607
killing people
and doing the right thing.

602
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,841
Because I can't help but feel
like you have something

603
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:05,506
that you really have
to get off your chest.

604
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,982
Okay, I really don't.
And I'm not comfortable

605
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,389
- with this.
- Dr. Bell, we were building a relationship.

606
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:10,709
- I need to get back on the highway.
- We were bonding.

607
00:26:10,793 --> 00:26:11,865
Get out of the car. Please.

608
00:26:11,949 --> 00:26:14,902
- I feel like we are cut from the same cloth.
- I...

609
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:16,474
I barely know you, Mike.

610
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,005
I-I just picked you up.

611
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,107
Okay, that's a good point.
We are strangers.

612
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:25,637
But I'm really good
at reading people.

613
00:26:27,177 --> 00:26:28,595
And I see things in you.

614
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:30,663
You've hurt people.

615
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,464
You've taken lives.

616
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,591
If you keep secrets...

617
00:26:38,676 --> 00:26:40,848
they become burdens.

618
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,818
'Kay, you're making...
You're making a mistake, Mike.

619
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:51,247
Well, you're-you're lying to me.

620
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:53,761
And you know how I feel

621
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,505
about dishonesty.

622
00:26:55,895 --> 00:26:57,067
So...

623
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,138
you should tell the truth.

624
00:27:00,223 --> 00:27:03,271
I think that it would be
very good for you.

625
00:27:07,473 --> 00:27:10,027
There was a-a time when, um...

626
00:27:12,012 --> 00:27:14,466
out of hubris,

627
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:17,009
I operated
when I shouldn't have.

628
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,098
I had... I had a physical problem

629
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:22,918
that meant I shouldn't...

630
00:27:23,746 --> 00:27:24,993
hold a blade in my hand.

631
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:27,795
And I, um...

632
00:27:29,723 --> 00:27:31,132
And I thought
I could control it.

633
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,775
Did you really think that?

634
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:39,575
No. I knew I was a risk.

635
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,234
Mm.

636
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,996
And you killed somebody.

637
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,991
- In a simple operation that...
- Mm.

638
00:27:50,827 --> 00:27:52,838
Shouldn't have been risky.

639
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,005
And the man bled to death.

640
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,342
And what was your punishment?

641
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,569
There was none.

642
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:05,809
Mm.

643
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,930
Because the white coat
is a shield.

644
00:28:12,748 --> 00:28:14,606
So you got away with it.

645
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,868
No,
I didn't get away with it.

646
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:23,130
That death haunts me
to this day,

647
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:24,732
and I live with that guilt.

648
00:28:24,817 --> 00:28:26,661
Ooh, guilt means
nothing to me.

649
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,067
Guilt is pointless.

650
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,762
There's a saying
in my line of work.

651
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:38,207
It's one that all surgeons know.

652
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:42,457
"Killing someone is so easy."

653
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:49,098
"What's hard
is not killing someone."

654
00:29:00,262 --> 00:29:01,434
Well...

655
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:04,849
it is a pleasure

656
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:07,228
to make your acquaintance,
Dr. Bell.

657
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:12,923
Drive safe.

658
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,286
Another life saved.

659
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:41,113
I can't take all the glory.

660
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:42,731
His ghost gets partial credit.

661
00:29:42,871 --> 00:29:44,021
Pericardial patch.

662
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:45,323
Sutures to me.

663
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:48,958
Should we enroll the ghost
in med school?

664
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:51,263
Ah, you joke, Dr. Devi.

665
00:29:51,348 --> 00:29:53,677
But that spirit
scared Ethan enough

666
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:55,044
to bring him to this hospital,

667
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:57,388
where we unmasked
a life-threatening tumor.

668
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,965
Ghosts get a bad rep.

669
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:02,005
Some are vicious, yes,

670
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,145
but others are guardians.

671
00:30:05,481 --> 00:30:09,613
And some
are just restless memories.

672
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,949
One thing they all have
in common is they freak me out.

673
00:30:13,598 --> 00:30:16,480
With all due respect,
I just like them to stay dead.

674
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,160
Holly's doing well.

675
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,223
She's recovering from surgery.

676
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:24,430
Oh, such a relief.

677
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,958
- Sweetie.
- Oh.

678
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:28,177
Oh, how are you doing?

679
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:30,122
- Oh, like I had a horrible dream.
- Oh.

680
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:32,131
- What happened to us, High Priestess?
- That's what I'm trying

681
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:33,489
to find out.

682
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:35,575
When you made the tea
this morning,

683
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,841
do you remember
what you put in it?

684
00:30:37,926 --> 00:30:39,380
Um, hibiscus,

685
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:42,357
blackberry leaves,
peppermint petals,

686
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:43,560
foxglove and some...

687
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,715
So you added the foxglove?

688
00:30:46,394 --> 00:30:47,494
Was that wrong?

689
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:49,071
Oh.

690
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,545
- Listen, it's not... No, no.
- I did this.

691
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:53,763
It's not your fault.

692
00:30:53,848 --> 00:30:55,724
I should have kept
that jar separate.

693
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:57,457
- I am so sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no.

694
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:59,052
It's okay.
It's okay.

695
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:02,052
- Everyone is well.
<i>- I keep saying</i>

696
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:05,082
we should label the jars
"edible" and "non-edible."

697
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:06,840
That sounds wise.

698
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:10,294
I'm usually such a stickler
for organization.

699
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:12,848
If you'd seen my bookstore
in Inman Park.

700
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:14,596
Book Zoo?

701
00:31:14,962 --> 00:31:16,388
That was it.

702
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:17,568
Did you... did you visit?

703
00:31:17,652 --> 00:31:19,254
Yeah. My wife and I,
we went there a lot

704
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:20,701
- when we first started dating.
- Oh.

705
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:22,517
I knew you looked familiar.
I just...

706
00:31:22,602 --> 00:31:24,018
couldn't place you.

707
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:28,035
And I remember your son.

708
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:34,284
He would've been eight
this year.

709
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:36,803
Joseph.

710
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:38,717
So sorry.

711
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:42,637
Tell me about your wife.

712
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:45,933
You lost her recently?

713
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,926
I sensed something. Um...

714
00:31:51,457 --> 00:31:53,129
I feel these things.

715
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:57,002
Also, I asked that lovely nurse,
Hundley.

716
00:32:00,723 --> 00:32:02,395
She died suddenly.

717
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,168
My whole world stopped.

718
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:10,677
I feel like I'm living
in some kind of alternate space.

719
00:32:12,449 --> 00:32:13,847
Nothing makes sense.

720
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,051
But I have a daughter.

721
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,870
And...

722
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:28,519
She keeps me going.

723
00:32:28,604 --> 00:32:30,277
And I have to keep going
for her.

724
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,617
Has your wife visited you
yet?

725
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:35,926
Um...

726
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,981
I don't believe in ghosts.

727
00:32:45,871 --> 00:32:48,021
But I do dream about her and...

728
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,387
feels very real.

729
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,531
Then I wake up.

730
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:02,692
And she's still gone.

731
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:03,777
Mm.

732
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,637
Actually...

733
00:33:10,683 --> 00:33:11,765
she's with you.

734
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,366
She always will be.

735
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:18,245
Just like my son
is with me.

736
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,296
Your memories, your dreams

737
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:24,726
keep her alive.

738
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:28,651
It's like a conversation
between you and her

739
00:33:28,752 --> 00:33:30,768
that death can't take away.

740
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:34,047
Joseph...

741
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,787
he lives in my heart,

742
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:40,388
always.

743
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:45,002
Just like your love
will always live with you.

744
00:33:51,736 --> 00:33:53,745
We made way
more than we needed.

745
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,042
Feel free to offer it
to any kids who come.

746
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:00,183
Why didn't you answer?

747
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:01,828
Why didn't you call?

748
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,105
Oh, I thought you were

749
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,722
dead in a ditch,
you old fool.

750
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:07,362
It's a long story.
And let's just say I won't be driving

751
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:09,240
down dark roads
with strangers anytime soon.

752
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:10,425
The hitchhiker?

753
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,862
Yeah, not-not my best idea.

754
00:34:12,502 --> 00:34:13,463
He didn't hurt you, did he?

755
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:15,072
- No, no. And...
<i>- Police have captured</i>

756
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:18,785
<i>suspected serial killer
Michael Jonah Rellie</i>

757
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,686
<i>and are conducting a search
of his property</i>

758
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,582
<i>- in Reidsville after an anonymous tip...</i>
- Is that him?

759
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,542
<i>- Led to his arrest earlier today.</i>
- Yeah.

760
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:28,057
- Oh...
- I... At some point,

761
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:30,385
I'll-I'll tell you...
everything.

762
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:31,524
But I, uh...

763
00:34:31,752 --> 00:34:33,768
Right now, I just want to forget
it happened.

764
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:36,754
- You want to go for a drink?
- Yes, please.

765
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:37,854
Okay.

766
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:50,276
AJ, you got to level
with me here.

767
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:53,049
You don't really believe
in ghosts?

768
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:54,457
And why shouldn't I?

769
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:55,882
Well, you're a doctor, for one.

770
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:57,948
A surgeon.
A man of science.

771
00:34:58,301 --> 00:34:59,471
Ah.

772
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,721
Perhaps you'll appreciate
the deep, dark history

773
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:05,058
of Chastain Park Memorial,
my friend.

774
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:07,871
The building that stood
before this one,

775
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:10,464
right below our feet,
one floor lower,

776
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:12,588
is where
the incinerator sat.

777
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:15,832
And the body chute, as it were,
was right here,

778
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,253
where the staircase is.

779
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:18,387
You're making this up.

780
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:19,667
Oh, am I?

781
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:23,323
Some 100 years ago, my friend,

782
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:26,987
tuberculosis overtaxed
this hospital.

783
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:28,667
And when the treatments failed,

784
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,417
this handy Slip 'N Slide
allowed the doctors

785
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:34,316
to discreetly dispose

786
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:37,253
of the deceased downstairs
in a superiorly

787
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:38,301
smooth fashion.

788
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:40,534
You laugh.

789
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:43,763
However, that is not where
they forever remain.

790
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:48,308
Nolan, please enlighten
these gentlemen on Room 2413.

791
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:50,073
It's haunted
and I won't set foot in there.

792
00:35:50,243 --> 00:35:51,323
Happy Halloween.

793
00:35:51,453 --> 00:35:52,917
Keep your eyes open, Pravesh.

794
00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:55,487
You may see
something extraordinary.

795
00:36:43,396 --> 00:36:44,728
Hello?

796
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:50,736
Hello?

797
00:37:07,821 --> 00:37:09,307
You startled me, man.

798
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:28,517
<i>Hey, Leela,</i>

799
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:31,447
if that soulless apartment on
the BeltLine is still available,

800
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:33,372
I say let's just take it.

801
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:34,856
Great.

802
00:37:35,314 --> 00:37:36,709
What changed your mind?

803
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:37,877
Nothing.

804
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:39,675
I just want
to make you happy.

805
00:37:41,174 --> 00:37:42,822
Raptor got in your ear,
didn't he?

806
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:45,109
No. No, he did not.

807
00:37:45,408 --> 00:37:46,597
He didn't. But...

808
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,847
let's just make sure
that it wasn't built

809
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,831
on some ancient burial ground,
okay,

810
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,348
before we sign a lease. That's all...

811
00:37:52,432 --> 00:37:54,175
Hey! I know it's last-minute,

812
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,612
but are you guys free for dinner?
Thought about having

813
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:57,292
some people over
and-and order takeout.

814
00:37:57,377 --> 00:37:58,456
Nothing formal.

815
00:37:58,883 --> 00:37:59,983
Sure. Of course.

816
00:38:00,143 --> 00:38:00,940
You want us to bring anything?

817
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:03,069
No, no.
Just bring yourself, 'kay?

818
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,220
All right, great.
See you then.

819
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:06,717
Yeah.

820
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,659
Sorry I forgot
to get you a costume, sweetheart.

821
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:11,979
You still look cute though.

822
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:14,396
Next year, I promise I will.

823
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:20,971
What do we have here?

824
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:25,758
Whew.

825
00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:27,474
Yeah.

826
00:38:37,078 --> 00:38:39,605
Look what Mommy did.

827
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:42,924
I forgot about Halloween,
but your mommy didn't.

828
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:44,925
Ah.

829
00:38:46,455 --> 00:38:48,705
Mommy got you a costume.

830
00:38:49,923 --> 00:38:52,119
She's still looking out
for you.

831
00:39:00,658 --> 00:39:02,549
She's still looking out
for us.

832
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:04,986
Come here.

833
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,697
Ooh-hoo!

834
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:10,838
There you go.
Yeah.

835
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:13,565
Okay, now let's say good night
to your fans.

836
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,683
It's someone's bedtime.

837
00:39:15,768 --> 00:39:18,175
Aw, not already.

838
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,621
Are you kidding me?
Can I eat you, baby chick?

839
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:23,097
- Could she be any cuter?
- Impossible.

840
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:24,817
Do they sell outfits like that
in my size?

841
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:27,987
Can Auntie Billie
put you to bed?

842
00:39:28,071 --> 00:39:28,970
You sure?

843
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:30,214
Of course.

844
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:32,027
- She's my favorite person.
- Aw.

845
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:33,410
Say good night, everybody.

846
00:39:33,495 --> 00:39:35,661
Good night. - Bye.

847
00:39:35,745 --> 00:39:37,555
- Good night.
- Love you, GiGi.

848
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:40,164
Let's go upstairs.

849
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,894
- Smells delicious.
- Thai food.

850
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:45,074
Nic's favorite.

851
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,660
All right.
Everyone take your seats.

852
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,133
This is all very mysterious.

853
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:53,922
I... learned about something
today from my patient.

854
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:55,610
Something...

855
00:39:56,571 --> 00:39:57,999
pretty special.

856
00:39:58,477 --> 00:39:59,978
It's a ritual that helps her,

857
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:02,262
and...
I think it might help us.

858
00:40:02,516 --> 00:40:04,587
It's called a dumb supper.

859
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:06,586
"Dumb" as in "silent."

860
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,533
Which I realize won't be easy
for some of you.

861
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:10,921
Yeah.

862
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:13,107
Good, good, good.

863
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:15,438
- Uh, it's a pagan ritual...
- Thank you...

864
00:40:15,798 --> 00:40:18,066
To honor those we've lost.

865
00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:20,353
It's really just a chance for us

866
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:22,805
to quietly reflect
on our memories,

867
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:25,001
in silence, among friends.

868
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:27,611
Magdalena told me that

869
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:29,649
on Samhain, which is tonight,

870
00:40:30,774 --> 00:40:34,039
that the veil between the living
and the dead is at its thinnest.

871
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:38,556
So if you have something
you want to say to Nic...

872
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:41,434
<i>"Naked As We Came"
by Iron & Wine playing...</i>

873
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,289
we close our eyes...

874
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,066
and you speak without words.

875
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,119
Speak from your heart.

876
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,297
And we say it now.
