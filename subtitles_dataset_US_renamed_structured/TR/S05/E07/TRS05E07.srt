2
00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:03,734
I can't have you in my life
right now.

3
00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:05,158
- I told you that.
- I am not trying

4
00:00:05,242 --> 00:00:06,571
to reconnect
with my birth mother.

5
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:09,875
Mother has stage 4
lung cancer.

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,440
There's only one hope
left.

7
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:13,031
Oh, it's targeted therapy.

8
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:14,525
It could buy my mother years.

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,790
You don't eat,
you barely sleep.

10
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,211
All you talk about
is medicine.

11
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:21,960
- I'm literally saving lives.
- And what about your life?

12
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:24,710
You and Nic
are missed every day.

13
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:25,993
I miss it, man.

14
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:28,187
It wasn't my plan
to leave, but...

15
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:30,273
Gigi's my everything.

New interns,

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,682
welcome to Chastain.

21
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:42,292
I'm Dr. Pravesh.

22
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:45,421
Follow me, and you might
survive your first day.

23
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:46,688
If you're smart,

24
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:49,633
you will see the nurses
as your best teachers.

25
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,960
They are your lifelines.

26
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:54,218
Use them if you want to succeed.

27
00:00:55,295 --> 00:00:58,472
Look... I know you're scared.

28
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:02,876
I remember, on my first day,
I was shaking in my boots.

29
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,726
You have something
you want to add back there?

30
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,133
No disrespect, Doc.

31
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:11,046
It's just that some of us
don't scare so easily.

32
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,941
Hmm.

33
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:15,404
Challenge accepted.

36
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:34,773
They want Daddy to come back
and work here,

37
00:01:34,858 --> 00:01:37,298
so Auntie Kit
is gonna pull out all the stops.

38
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:40,109
So, when she asks us
what we think,

39
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:44,156
you are gonna say...
what?

40
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,459
I love it,
but not as much as my house.

41
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:48,571
Ah.

42
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:51,148
Hey, yes, you nailed it.

43
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:53,109
Nailed it.

44
00:01:56,343 --> 00:01:58,320
That's not Auntie Kit.

45
00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:00,319
No, it isn't.

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,484
Auntie Kit got called away

47
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,485
on emergency business,
so she asked me to show you

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,360
our nursery
and convince your daddy

49
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:09,875
to come back
and work here.

50
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:11,390
Therefore...

51
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:15,593
it looks like
you are stuck with Dr. Bell.

52
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:17,563
This is a renowned surgeon,

53
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:20,633
TV personality, and now
a preschool tour guide.

54
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:22,539
Oh, you never cease
to amaze me, Dr. Bell.

55
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:24,968
Not how either of us expected to
spend our morning.

56
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:26,515
Come on in.

57
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:32,413
So, the hope is to expand
the grade levels

58
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:33,696
as the kids grow up.

59
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,875
Sounds like Kit
has thought of everything.

60
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:38,586
- Gigi.
- Yes?

61
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:40,484
What do you think?

62
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:42,202
I love it!

63
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,554
But do you love it
more than our house?

64
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:47,336
Way more than our house.

65
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:48,664
Can I go color?

66
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:49,790
What?

67
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:50,969
Oh, my God.

68
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:53,445
Yeah, get out of here.
Go do your coloring.

69
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:56,641
I have hope
because you came today.

70
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,594
If you weren't gonna
consider it, why even show up?

71
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,399
Ah, same reason you did.

72
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:02,000
You don't say
no to Kit Voss.

73
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:04,312
Look,

74
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:06,688
- I'd love to come back...
- That's what we want.

75
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,851
...but my priorities
have changed.

76
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:11,571
It's not just childcare.
I need flexibility, weekends.

77
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:13,120
There's a laundry list
of things I would need.

78
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:16,164
If there's a hospital out there
that wants to do that for you,

79
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:17,899
- it's this one.
- Okay, well,

80
00:03:17,984 --> 00:03:19,523
a private practice
in Buckhead

81
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:22,132
offered me three years
and childcare

82
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:23,836
and I make my own hours.

83
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:27,461
You're impossibly talented,

84
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:30,875
and doling out B12 shots

85
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:33,359
for hangovers, I mean...

86
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,757
And that impact is minuscule

87
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,718
compared to
what you can do here.

88
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:41,203
I appreciate
the sentiment, but...

89
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:43,531
Okay.
Well, so what about this?

90
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,203
What about
we're stretched so thin,

91
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,734
just pitch in
for the day

92
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:50,539
and just see
how it feels?

93
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:53,266
Really?
Your plan is to hold me hostage

94
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,790
until I agree to come back?

95
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:56,141
Well, that depends.
Is it working?

96
00:03:57,164 --> 00:03:58,164
Hawkins.

97
00:03:58,386 --> 00:03:59,875
Hey, I heard
you were around.

98
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,721
Listen, brother,
I need your help with a patient.

99
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:03,804
And you got AJ involved.
That's impressive.

100
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:05,211
It's about my mother.

101
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:06,855
She's back in the hospital.

102
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:12,938
Careful. It's hot.

103
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:14,179
Hey. Uh, sorry.

104
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:16,086
Hi, Dr. Sutton.

105
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:18,359
Dr. Daniels.

106
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:21,226
Daily grind.
Am I right?

107
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:24,984
- Here you go.
- Uh, thank you.

108
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:31,570
Obviously, you... you knew
I was coming, right?

109
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,062
AJ told me.

110
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:36,199
I hope it's okay
that I'm here.

111
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:38,836
I'm, uh...

112
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:41,874
I'm not the same person
I was years ago.

113
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:43,562
Good.

114
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:46,228
And congratulations
on getting through med school.

115
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:47,961
That's no small feat.

116
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:51,757
Uh,
I mean, it wasn't that hard.

117
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,304
For me, anyway.

118
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,796
Well, maybe you haven't changed
that much after all.

119
00:04:56,888 --> 00:04:58,064
I see you're still suffering

120
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:00,351
from that dangerously
high opinion of yourself.

121
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:03,071
It's incurable, so...

122
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:07,328
Can I ask you
a personal question?

123
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:09,047
No.

124
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:10,969
Obviously, you don't seem
to despise me anymore,

125
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:12,547
- so...
- I never despised you.

126
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:14,048
- No, you-you definitely did.
- Look,

127
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:15,430
Trevor,
it is inappropriate

128
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,203
for you to tell me
what I feel or don't feel

129
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:18,632
about you or anything else.

130
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:20,813
I knew it.
Huh.

131
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:22,868
You've been in therapy.
You're setting your boundary.

132
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:24,429
- Kudos.
- Okay.

133
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:26,211
God.

134
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:29,109
Look, we're gonna need
to set some rules.

135
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:31,782
No one here needs to know
that we're related,

136
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:33,250
that you're
my biological son.

137
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:34,902
Agreed.
It's none of their business.

138
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:36,031
- Mm-hmm.
- And?

139
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,715
Try really hard
not to be an ass.

140
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:40,585
- Good advice. Anything else?
- Just one more.

141
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,765
Don't ever ask me for money.

142
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:54,063
And we're positive
this isn't a resurgence

143
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:55,325
of Carol's lung cancer, right?

144
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,876
Well, according
to her oncologist,

145
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:59,586
all tests show
zero cancer progression.

146
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,295
That means her targeted
immunotherapy's working.

147
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:06,101
She cycled through several drugs
these last few years.

148
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,039
You know, I honestly thought

149
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,399
we'd reached the end of the road
till we found this one.

150
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:13,531
Now, I know it's not a cure,
but, uh, you'd have me fooled.

151
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:14,743
That's good.

152
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:17,068
If it's not the cancer, it's
likely something we can fix.

153
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:21,617
- Hey, Carol.
- Oh.

154
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:24,477
AJ,
you didn't tell me

155
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:28,433
we were having
a VIP guest visit.

156
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:29,796
Ah, careful, Ma.

157
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:32,828
You know, flattery goes
to his head, like brain freeze.

158
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,367
It's good to see you again.
How you feeling?

159
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:38,062
Uh, I've been better.

160
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:41,743
Sad to hear
you had left Chastain.

161
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:43,843
I hope this means
you'll be back for good.

162
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,751
Yeah, well, plenty of time
to talk about me.

163
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,835
I want to hear about you.
Tell me, what's going on?

164
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,773
Well...

165
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,875
I've never been so tired.

166
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:56,148
Can't make it through<i> The Crown</i>
without nodding off.

167
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,368
This woman loves Princess Diana.

168
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,227
Then I started losing weight,

169
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:06,539
and that had me worried.

170
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:09,610
- Maybe an infection?
- That's what I thought,

171
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,235
but she's not responding
to any antibiotics.

172
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,462
Could be bacterial resistance

173
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:16,765
or an... atypical infection.

174
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,558
You know what? Let me get
some labs, run some tests.

175
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:22,257
Don't you worry.
We'll get you some answers.

176
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:27,539
Mm.

177
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:36,651
Janice Bonner. Surgery.

178
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,843
Trevor. Anesthesia.

179
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:41,339
I'm Gemma. I'm I.M.

180
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,383
Not, I'm "I am."

181
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,937
I mean, I, Gemma, am I.M.

182
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:48,468
Internal medicine.
We got it.

183
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,554
I'm Zach.

184
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,313
- Primary care.
- Yikes.

185
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:54,227
Hope you qualify
for student loan forgiveness.

186
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:55,336
What's up?

187
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:57,320
Let's get started, shall we?

188
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,251
Dan, good morning.

189
00:07:59,336 --> 00:08:01,093
These are the interns
I told you about.

190
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,621
Are they children, or am I old?

191
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,864
48-year-old male
with pancreatitis.

192
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:08,375
What is the first thing
that we do?

193
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,035
Oh, I hope it's all right,
I threw together

194
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,628
a little PowerPoint
for a possible plan of action.

195
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:13,370
I love the initiative,
Dr. Bonner,

196
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,881
- but before that, what's first?
- Get smashed.

197
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:19,469
It's a mnemonic. Gallstones,

198
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:21,934
ethanol, trauma, steroids,
mumps, autoimmune,

199
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,637
scorpion sting,
hypercalcemia, ERCP

200
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:26,367
and drugs.

201
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:28,794
No, the first thing
we do is listen.

202
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,566
To the patient,
and then to me.

203
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:34,394
Incoming. Multi-casualty event.

204
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,262
Someone crashed
a boat into a dock.

205
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:37,425
Okay.

206
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,980
Time to suit up.

207
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:40,620
We'll be back.

208
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:49,390
That's Trevor Daniels.

209
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:50,474
You know him?

210
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:52,727
He made quite the impression
when he tried to lecture

211
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,386
the doctors on how to treat
his junkie girlfriend.

212
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,237
Now I guess
he's a doctor himself.

213
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:00,753
Well, he's an M.D.,
not a doctor, yet.

214
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:03,300
Not with that arrogance.

215
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,409
22-year-old female
with blunt head trauma. GCS 9.

216
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:10,191
Dr. Bonner, you're with Hundley.

217
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:11,800
- Yes.
- And, um...

218
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,058
Brooks, you're with Dr. Feldman.

219
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,333
Are you sure, Coach?
I know the upper extremity neurovascular

220
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:17,974
- anatomy by heart, so...
- They've got it handled,

221
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,309
but there's a woman in bay five

222
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:21,028
who needs her blood work drawn.
Go help her.

223
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:23,191
Seriously? That guy's hand's
hanging on by a thread,

224
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,246
and you trust
Thing One and Thing Two?

225
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,348
Your patient isn't
any less important

226
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,245
because she doesn't have
a cleat in her hand.

227
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,665
She needs you.
Go help her.

228
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:41,190
Hey, Dad just messaged.

229
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:42,611
They're a couple minutes out.

230
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,598
Padma, I love you,

231
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:47,390
but maybe put the sage down
and pick up a vacuum.

232
00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:49,875
It's important that
we cleanse the space of

233
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,152
all of the negative energy.

234
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:52,848
Mom and Dad
are the negative energy.

235
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,168
Why do they do this?
Just pop by randomly.

236
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:58,809
At least they don't
stick around, okay?

237
00:09:58,894 --> 00:09:59,823
It's just lunch.

238
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,894
Yeah, it starts as lunch, and
then it becomes an intervention.

239
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:06,800
Hence hiding
your boyfriend's shoes.

240
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:08,215
You do realize that, someday,

241
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,988
they're gonna figure out
you live together, right?

242
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,090
Mm-hmm.
Today is not that day.

243
00:10:12,175 --> 00:10:13,587
Oh.

244
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:22,091
- Hi!
- Oh!

245
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:23,501
- Hello, my...
- Ooh.

246
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:26,026
Oh, my darling girls. Mwah.

247
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:27,701
Come on in.

248
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:30,341
- Oh, my.
- Hi.

249
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,676
So, how was the trip?

250
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:33,845
Not long enough.

251
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:36,278
I had to practically
drag your father

252
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:38,015
out of that Venetian Pool.

253
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,231
Piña coladas and the greatest
hits of Olivia Newton-John.

254
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:43,036
I've never been more relaxed.

255
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:45,692
Beautiful place
you've got here, Leela.

256
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:47,433
I hope that
Devon is joining us.

257
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:49,808
- Uh, no.
- Oh.

258
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:52,621
- Devon's at the hospital.
- Is something burning?

259
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:55,621
Oh, yeah, it's, um, sage.

260
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,606
It really purifies the air.

261
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:59,753
- No, there's something else.
- Oh, my gosh!

262
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:03,466
No, no, no, no, no, no.

263
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,310
Oh, shoot.

264
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:09,116
Everything all right?

265
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,303
Why don't we go out for lunch?

266
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:15,461
Hmm?

267
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:20,541
I know you're here for Carol.

268
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,530
Yeah, well, my buddy says
it's an emergency.

269
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:24,755
Would I have called you
if it wasn't?

270
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:25,896
I don't know.

271
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:27,991
Protocol suggests
we send the patient home

272
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:29,014
with some painkillers.

273
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:31,553
- Something else going on?
- Call it instinct.

274
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:34,139
You and your instincts are lucky
I'm waiting on Carol's tests.

275
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:35,411
You got five minutes.

276
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,576
Intern. Bullet. Go.

277
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:42,756
Um, Kevin is a 72-year-old male
with a history of hypertension.

278
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:44,404
Uh, he came in with
sudden onset

279
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:45,752
- right flank pain...
- Left.

280
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:46,944
Left flank.

281
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:48,552
Uh, right. Uh, sorry.
I mean, left.

282
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:52,057
That's, um, what he is, uh...

283
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:54,068
What are his vitals telling you?

284
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:56,014
Uh, slightly tachycardic.

285
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,123
Uh, you know,
with the flank pain,

286
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,355
that could be kidney stones.

287
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:02,099
72 is a strange time to have
your first kidney stone, hmm?

288
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:05,162
- What about his blood pressure?
- Oh, it's been stable.

289
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,576
- Has it?
- Yeah.

290
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:09,795
Hmm. Since we started talking,
his BP dipped down

291
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,935
to 95/48
before it popped back up.

292
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:15,771
Devil's in the details.

293
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,795
Kevin is headed into shock
due to a ruptured aortic aneurysm

294
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,169
that's leaking into
his retroperitoneum.

295
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,186
Wait, but that-that's emergent.

296
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:29,771
We-we can't send him home.
He needs surgery.

297
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:31,161
Don't you miss this?

298
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:33,447
Daniels.

299
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:36,997
Page Vascular,
tell them we're coming.

300
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:42,475
He's amazing.

301
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,356
Her cortisolis severely low.

302
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:58,685
So, she has
adrenal insufficiency.

303
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:02,497
Likely due to her past courses
of high-dose steroids.

304
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:05,638
Which would explain
the severity of the infection

305
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:08,036
and the low blood pressure
despite fluids.

306
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,870
We can give her
IV hydrocortisone.

307
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,475
She should turn around quickly.

308
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,366
I'll order some follow-up labs
just to make sure

309
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,810
there are no other
systemic issues.

310
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,888
I owe you one, Hawkins.

311
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:20,752
I didn't do anything.

312
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:23,310
You just needed
a fresh set of eyes.

313
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:27,498
You lost your dad.

314
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,256
It makes sense you
want to be thorough.

315
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,708
Yeah.

316
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,803
If I'm gonna lose
the last parent I have,

317
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:34,481
I don't want to be
blindsided again.

318
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:36,817
No, that's not
where we are, not yet.

319
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,379
Look at you.

320
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:41,889
I knew you didn't lose
your touch.

321
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:43,271
Who said I lost my touch?

322
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,869
Well, people talk.

323
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:47,889
But don't worry,
I got your back.

324
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:58,514
Ow! Didn't you hear me?

325
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,383
- I'm sensitive.
- Okay.

326
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,202
I heard you,

327
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:03,872
and I'd be done already
if you'd stop squirming.

328
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,418
I'd stop squirming
if you knew how to do your job.

329
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,863
Do you have a
supervisor I can talk to?

330
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:13,934
Somebody needs to call
the health department.

331
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:17,246
Ants on the ceiling.
Spiders crawling up the walls.

332
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:18,896
Spider angioma,

333
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:21,786
when small blood vessels appear
resembling a spider's web.

334
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,053
It's subtle, but not uncommon
for someone with liver disease.

335
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:25,795
How long has it been
since you've had a drink?

336
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,676
Excuse me, I'm a mother.
I have four kids.

337
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:31,590
Hannah, I've spent a lot of time
around addicts,

338
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:34,137
and you check
all the boxes, okay?

339
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:36,581
Sweaty, agitated,

340
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,518
uh, weird hallucinations...

341
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:41,992
- How dare you?!
- Hey. All right, I'm just trying to help, okay?

342
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:44,724
- Who do you think you are?!
- The hell?!

343
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:46,105
Get off of me!

344
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,596
You don't know
anything about me!

345
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:48,848
- Nothing!
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

346
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:50,604
- Okay.
- Get off me!

347
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:51,448
What happened here?

348
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:53,666
- Hannah's in withdrawal. She's an alcoholic.
- Hey.

349
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:56,074
We don't talk about patients
like they're not in the room.

350
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:57,925
No, no, no. I'm just trying to
tell you what's wrong with her,

351
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:00,073
why she tried to claw
my eyes out. Do you understand?

352
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:01,924
There's two feet of paperwork
over there

353
00:15:02,008 --> 00:15:04,065
that needs to get done.
See if you can manage that.

354
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:09,461
Wow.

355
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:17,324
<i>♪ Just stay a little while... ♪</i>

356
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,003
Is there
someplace else to eat?

357
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,800
We can't even hear
each other.

358
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:23,777
I'll ask to turn the music down.

359
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,496
Whew.

360
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:28,128
$23 for a burger.

361
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:30,097
No vegetarian options.

362
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:31,543
They're on the back of the menu.

363
00:15:31,628 --> 00:15:33,058
Don't worry about me.

364
00:15:34,288 --> 00:15:36,902
I'm sure they have...
bread.

365
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,246
Oh, no, Mom,
look at the back of the menu.

366
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:41,043
There's some
vegetarian options there.

367
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,082
Thank you, darling Paddie.

368
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:47,281
You take such good care
of your mother.

369
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,066
Hang on,
I literally just told you that.

370
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:53,348
- Please, Leela, don't be so sensitive.
- I'm being sensitive?

371
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:55,347
Leela, restroom?

372
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,509
Come on.

373
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,074
<i>♪ And show me... ♪</i>

374
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,970
God, it's just they're so...

375
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:05,058
Intolerable.

376
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:06,543
It's always something.

377
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,816
But you can't let them
get to you like this.

378
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:10,753
That's easy for you
to say.

379
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,097
- You're the favorite.
- I'm not the favorite.

380
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,136
Come on.

381
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:17,386
You're "darling Paddie,"
and I'm...

382
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:21,339
I'm
she who must not be named.

383
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:30,379
And every time they're here,
just, I feel like I'm 12 again

384
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:32,199
and I can't do anything right.

385
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,551
Then let me do the talking.

386
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:34,683
They'll leave,

387
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:37,003
and we don't have to see them
again until the holidays.

388
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:38,418
How's that?

389
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:40,074
Okay?

390
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,035
Come on.

391
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:44,308
Okay.

392
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:52,535
How you feeling?

393
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:54,964
Like my old self again.

394
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:56,673
Now, let me see
that beautiful baby.

395
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:59,566
Not a baby anymore.

396
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:01,511
At least if you ask her.

397
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,798
Oh, my heart.

398
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,777
She is the spitting image
of Nic.

399
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:12,480
And there's a hint of mischief
in her eye,

400
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,575
just like her father.

401
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,028
Gigi knows what she wants
and she knows how to get it.

402
00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:19,075
And what about you?
Are you taking care of yourself?

403
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:21,222
Well, remembered to shower
this morning.

404
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:23,175
You know what I mean.

405
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:26,629
If there's anything
I've learned from raising AJ,

406
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:29,175
it's that you have to
prioritize yourself.

407
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:32,215
Kids are only as happy
as the parents that raise them.

408
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:34,714
I have Gigi, I have my friends,
like your son.

409
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,182
- What more could I ask for?
- You tell me.

410
00:17:38,378 --> 00:17:40,027
Are you happy, Conrad?

411
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:46,355
Hey-hey.
Mom, let's take a stroll.

412
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:47,925
Someplace I want to take you.

413
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,153
That sounds wonderful.

414
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:58,303
Thank you, and you take care.

415
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:01,863
- Don't be a stranger.
- You heard the lady.

416
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:04,603
Yeah.
I'll see you around.

417
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:22,197
Hey.

418
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:24,048
Um...

419
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:27,431
I've come to apologize
for earlier.

420
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,165
You called me a drunk.
I'm not.

421
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,239
And I believe you.

422
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:34,073
Dr. Pravesh was right.

423
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:38,337
I was completely out of line,
and I'm so, so sorry.

424
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:41,978
Um...

425
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:44,654
All right.

426
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:50,431
That...

427
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,622
Just a little bit
more comfortable, right?

428
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:58,548
And don't worry,
I'm gonna make sure you leave

429
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,173
feeling a whole lot better
than when you came in.

430
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:02,908
Just you wait.

431
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,915
Here you go. All right.

432
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,604
- Hey.
- Hi.

433
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:36,198
I love how you say, "The heart
is the key to the body

434
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:38,118
but the door to the soul."

435
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:41,658
- It's-it's pure poetry.
- Oh, well, you're too kind.

436
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:43,755
I love that one, too.

437
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,212
You know, maybe the next book
will be a poetry book.

438
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,298
I can't wait.

439
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,759
Make you jealous?

440
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:57,025
Why would it?

441
00:19:58,368 --> 00:19:59,493
Used to be you.

442
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,353
You know,
we should write a book.

443
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,213
Your brains.

444
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,181
My face, for obvious reasons.

445
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,733
I mean, the public
will be clamoring

446
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,068
for something like that.

447
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,814
Goodbye, Nolan.

448
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,892
Think it over.

449
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,123
What on earth?

450
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:29,595
I'm feeling much better now.

451
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:48,744
I like it here, Daddy.

452
00:20:48,829 --> 00:20:51,213
Can we come back
tomorrow, please?

453
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:52,932
Dr. Hawkins.

454
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:55,511
Carol Austin's
follow-up labs are back.

455
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:57,179
Thank you.

456
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,618
Okay, what's your name?

457
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:15,337
- Uh, to Sherry.
- Sherry. Okay.

458
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:18,634
Mom, take it easy.

459
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:21,137
Oh, hush.

460
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:24,689
I need a photo... of my son.

461
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:30,374
Mom!

462
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:40,497
Her pulse is racing.
We need a defibrillator.

463
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,996
This is my fault.
I shouldn't have moved her so soon.

464
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,683
This wasn't you.
Something else is going on.

465
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,424
Let's get the pads on her.

466
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:52,504
We were right
about her cortisol,

467
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:53,926
but it was masking
something bigger.

468
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,447
Which is what?

469
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:58,223
- That's what we're gonna figure out together.
- Prepare to shock.

470
00:21:58,307 --> 00:22:00,400
Clear.

471
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:08,291
Pulse is strong and regular.

472
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,713
What the hell is going on?

473
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,908
Your mother, she's...

474
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:16,502
she's in multi-organ failure.

475
00:22:21,846 --> 00:22:24,290
Doesn't make sense.

476
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:28,534
Her cardiac MRI is
consistent with myocarditis.

477
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,039
Which explains the arrhythmia.

478
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,775
But not where
the heart issues came from.

479
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:33,525
So, whatever it is

480
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,839
has sent her liver and
kidney values through the roof.

481
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:37,713
Same with her thyroid hormone.

482
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:41,567
Infection's being treated,
no toxins, no traumas, no...

483
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:46,353
...no preexisting
organ dysfunction.

484
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:50,839
Oh, man.

485
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:52,777
Her body's attacking itself.

486
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,238
All right, fellas.

487
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:03,908
Just let me have it.

488
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:10,283
It's her immunotherapy.

489
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:14,580
It's keeping her alive,
but it's also the reason...

490
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:18,010
...her organs are shutting down.

491
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,237
Champagne tap, baby.

492
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,912
Nothing but spinal fluid.

493
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:28,563
Nice going, Daniels.

494
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:30,120
I had so much blood in my tap,

495
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:31,658
I thought my patient
was gonna faint.

496
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:34,511
- I thought I was about to faint.
- Hannah.

497
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:36,807
Stop, stop.

498
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,378
Listen, please. We can help you.

499
00:23:38,463 --> 00:23:40,299
Uh, you've done
more than enough, really.

500
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,610
I have to go.

501
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:51,210
Daniels.

502
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:55,532
You gave a beer to a patient
in alcohol withdrawal.

503
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:57,800
- You did what?
- I can explain, okay?

504
00:23:57,885 --> 00:23:59,168
I know it wasn't
exactly protocol...

505
00:23:59,252 --> 00:24:00,612
You didn't just break protocol.

506
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:01,949
You broke every rule
of medicine.

507
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:04,057
We could've helped Hannah,
gotten her treatment,

508
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,504
- saved her life.
- Yeah, I wouldn't have done it

509
00:24:05,588 --> 00:24:06,660
if you had just listened to me.

510
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:08,603
I proved to you
she was an alcoholic.

511
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:10,885
Wait, so you contributed

512
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:14,425
to a patient's addiction
to prove a point?

513
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,995
Are your patients just pawns
to prove how smart you are?

514
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,089
What? No.

515
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:19,315
What? Of course not.

516
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,284
I was just trying to...

517
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:23,135
I hope you took a picture
of that champagne tap

518
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:24,827
'cause it's gonna be your last.

519
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:29,103
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.
What-what does that mean?

520
00:24:30,361 --> 00:24:31,879
It's not obvious?

521
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,588
I'm cutting you.

522
00:24:35,244 --> 00:24:36,370
No, no, no, no, no.

523
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:38,800
You can't do that.
Please, I'm-I'm begging you.

524
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:39,853
I'll be better.
I didn't even realize...

525
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,206
See? Right there.

526
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:43,854
Even your apology
is about you.

527
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:45,881
- You have no remorse, no humility.
- If I get kicked out...

528
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:47,981
If I get kicked out,
I won't be a doctor.

529
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,801
Maybe that's for the best.

530
00:24:58,978 --> 00:25:01,645
I don't want-want to hear this.

531
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:05,396
The immunotherapy saved me.

532
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:07,294
It-It's my miracle.

533
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,825
It was.

534
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:12,520
But it's causing your body
to attack itself.

535
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:15,918
The drugs prompt the body
to target the cancer,

536
00:25:16,003 --> 00:25:20,379
but sometimes the immune system
reacts too aggressively.

537
00:25:21,149 --> 00:25:23,293
Attacking your healthy organs.

538
00:25:24,794 --> 00:25:29,106
We need to stop
your immunotherapy temporarily.

539
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:32,582
To let your body heal.

540
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:36,302
Then you can consult
with your doctors and loved ones

541
00:25:36,395 --> 00:25:39,051
to decide if you want
to continue the treatment

542
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,758
or stop it permanently.

543
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:42,244
I've...

544
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:45,044
already decided.

545
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:50,043
I'm going to continue
the immunotherapy.

546
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,426
Carol, this is a big decision.

547
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:00,567
Mom.

548
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:02,865
What you decide now

549
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,543
will determine
how we spend your final days.

550
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:11,934
Final days?

551
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,613
We knew when you started
this drug

552
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:17,709
that this could be
the last option.

553
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:20,092
But it would give us time.

554
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:22,476
And it did.

555
00:26:25,953 --> 00:26:28,264
But now the time is limited.

556
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:30,920
Don't you say that.

557
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,912
Don't you give up on me.

558
00:26:35,786 --> 00:26:38,006
I will never give up on you,
Mom.

559
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:40,115
I promise.

560
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,092
Then help me do something.

561
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:49,982
There's no rush to decide.

562
00:26:52,517 --> 00:26:54,240
Let's revisit this later.

563
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:20,248
I'm sorry, AJ.

564
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:22,178
I'm sorry.

565
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:28,639
My mother is dying,

566
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:31,443
and she won't face it.

567
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,084
She just needs time to process.

568
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:38,264
You both do.

569
00:27:39,914 --> 00:27:42,349
I don't like being
on this side of the curtain.

570
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:50,639
I had my doubts about this,

571
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:53,045
- but the salmon's quite good.
- Mm.

572
00:27:53,287 --> 00:27:55,865
I'm just thankful
I get to see both my girls.

573
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:57,998
What does Devon think
of children?

574
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,740
It's the 21st century.

575
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:01,468
We're not in a rush.

576
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:04,217
Does your biological clock
know what century it is?

577
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:05,451
Mom.

578
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:09,326
It's not a bad idea to start
planning for the future.

579
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:13,146
The life of a surgeon is not
conducive to raising a family.

580
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:15,974
Not just in residency
but forever.

581
00:28:16,271 --> 00:28:19,861
Besides, surgery
is a dangerous place.

582
00:28:20,513 --> 00:28:23,256
Especially considering,
you know, your...

583
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,571
...your condition.

584
00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:29,529
You mean my dyslexia?

585
00:28:29,998 --> 00:28:31,498
- Mm.
- Yeah.

586
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:32,865
You can say it.

587
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,803
- It's not a bad word.
- I know.

588
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:38,613
Is that what this is about?

589
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,623
You're afraid
I might kill someone?

590
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:41,717
Uh...

591
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,202
No, because, honestly, if you're
so concerned about my patients,

592
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:45,703
why don't you just ask me?

593
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:48,608
Like the young woman who came in
with adenoid cystic carcinoma.

594
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,780
I performed her double
mastectomy six months ago.

595
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:52,443
You want to know
where she is right now?

596
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:54,445
She's backpacking through Spain.

597
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:55,967
Okay. You're making a scene.

598
00:28:56,482 --> 00:29:00,006
You actually think dyslexia
is the hardest part of my job?

599
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:02,544
It's not.

600
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:03,920
It's you.

601
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,394
And your voices in my head

602
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,842
constantly telling me
I'm not good enough.

603
00:29:08,974 --> 00:29:11,460
- Now you're just being cruel.
- I think I'm gonna go home.

604
00:29:11,545 --> 00:29:13,061
- Leela, come on.
- Yeah.

605
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:15,225
I'm gonna go home
to the apartment that I share

606
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:16,634
with my boyfriend.

607
00:29:16,718 --> 00:29:18,394
- Leela.
- Yeah.

608
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:20,137
Devon and I live together.

609
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:22,974
And you know what?
Don't worry about the bill.

610
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:25,994
At least there's one benefit to
having a surgeon for a daughter.

611
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:27,078
Leela.

612
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,836
First day in the bag?

613
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,896
You mean first and last.

614
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:01,646
I, uh...

615
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,154
I lied.

616
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,284
About medical school
being easy.

617
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:10,763
Chastain
wasn't my first choice.

618
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:13,198
It was the only one.

619
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:16,878
I mean, if I didn't match
here...

620
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:20,255
I wouldn't have gotten
an internship spot anywhere.

621
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,709
- How is that possible?
- I got rejected from

622
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:27,054
every internship opportunity
I applied for.

623
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:28,421
I mean, the only reason I'm here

624
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:30,474
is because AJ wrote
a recommendation.

625
00:30:32,154 --> 00:30:33,469
He's a good guy.

626
00:30:33,896 --> 00:30:37,314
But now I've ruined
every opportunity he gave me.

627
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,232
Dr. Pravesh cut me.

628
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:42,881
He said that?

629
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:44,498
With great satisfaction.

630
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:05,555
I threw you under the bus
in there.

631
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:07,014
I'm really sorry.

632
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,936
It's okay.

633
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:10,396
No, it's not.

634
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:16,240
When I got leukemia,
it affected us both as children.

635
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:19,006
It took my fertility.

636
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:24,787
But it also gave me
something far more powerful.

637
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,646
The ability to live each day
as if it were the last.

638
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:33,680
That freed me from everything,

639
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:35,467
including their judgment.

640
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:39,209
And you're free now, too.

641
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,514
I am so proud of you for
standing up for yourself today.

642
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:47,007
At the expense of ever having a
peaceful family gathering again.

643
00:31:47,092 --> 00:31:48,279
Nah.

644
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,615
Peace is overrated.

645
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:52,205
You demanded respect.

646
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:56,476
And I've never been prouder
to share your DNA.

647
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:09,414
Shh.

648
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:13,249
- Hey.
- Hey, Doctor.

649
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:14,911
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

650
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:17,666
Hey.

651
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,908
Billie told me
you're having some problems

652
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:20,560
- with Dr. Daniels.
- Mm.

653
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,059
Problems?

654
00:32:22,449 --> 00:32:24,897
He's arrogant
with no compassion.

655
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:26,920
Well, we all make mistakes.

656
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:28,654
Well, this isn't
just about a mistake.

657
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,069
This is who he is.

658
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:33,395
I see a lot of problems ahead
with Trevor.

659
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,021
Well, let me
give something a try,

660
00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:39,137
maybe get a peek inside
the kid, huh?

661
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:43,081
Just don't let him
touch any patients.

662
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:51,092
AJ's mom is sick?

663
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,905
I-I don't understand
what I'm supposed to do.

664
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:54,637
Nothing.
You're here to watch, listen.

665
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,814
Don't offer the patient
a cocktail.

666
00:32:57,598 --> 00:32:58,936
How long until
I live that one down?

667
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,287
Eh, intern idiocy
has a short news cycle.

668
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:02,895
But let me be clear.

669
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,862
If you step out of line, then...

670
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:07,247
it won't just be Pravesh
who comes for you.

671
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:12,146
Hi, Carol.

672
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:14,420
This is Dr. Daniels.
He's an intern.

673
00:33:14,505 --> 00:33:16,745
I was wondering if you'd be
kind enough to let him listen

674
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:18,856
while you and I talk about
the future.

675
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:23,458
Of course.

676
00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:26,848
AJ was an intern once.

677
00:33:28,328 --> 00:33:30,006
But there's not much
to talk about.

678
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,148
I've made my choice.

679
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:32,723
And I will make that happen
for you.

680
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:35,034
I just want to help you
understand what you're choosing.

681
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:38,403
If either choice
ends up killing me,

682
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:39,980
what difference does it make?

683
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:41,380
That's a good question.

684
00:33:43,274 --> 00:33:44,741
It makes a big difference.

685
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:48,661
If... just if...

686
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:50,630
We stop the immunotherapy

687
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:52,755
to protect you from the symptoms
you're feeling now,

688
00:33:53,246 --> 00:33:54,958
you will regain your energy.

689
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:57,005
Fevers, headaches,
they'll go away.

690
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:00,723
You'll be able to get back
to the life you were living.

691
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:04,380
Until the cancer comes back.

692
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:06,207
Correct.

693
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,919
But you don't know how soon
your cancer will come back,

694
00:34:09,033 --> 00:34:10,205
if at all.

695
00:34:10,808 --> 00:34:12,612
You may have more life
than you realize.

696
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:14,510
You can travel,
you can exercise.

697
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:17,833
But when it's back,

698
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,119
it could return anywhere,
in any part of my body.

699
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:25,151
You've never felt a pain
like this.

700
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:26,768
You're right.

701
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:30,596
But we can help you
with that pain.

702
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:32,323
Now...

703
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,459
...if you continue
the immunotherapy,

704
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:40,338
that's not
a painless choice either.

705
00:34:40,794 --> 00:34:43,643
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

706
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,096
- Mrs. Austin.
- Hmm?

707
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,034
Carol.

708
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,299
Your son is
the reason I'm a doctor.

709
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:09,227
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,871
He's, uh, a mentor, I guess.

711
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:18,694
And if we hadn't had a lot of,
uh, tough conversations,

712
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:20,744
you know, things that
scared the hell out of me,

713
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:23,073
I wouldn't be here.

714
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:27,455
A few years ago, AJ asked me
what kind of man I want to be.

715
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:31,193
It wasn't easy
to get the answer.

716
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,692
Now Dr. Hawkins is asking you

717
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:40,619
what kind of life you want
from here on.

718
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:44,135
Not an easy answer here either.

719
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:49,612
But I am learning that
it is the greatest respect

720
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:52,823
a doctor
can show a patient.

721
00:35:56,998 --> 00:36:00,080
Look, the immunotherapy
has done wonders

722
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:01,698
at keeping your cancer
at bay.

723
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:03,903
There's no reason to believe
it won't keep doing that.

724
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:07,346
Then
what's the problem?

725
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:11,444
Well, the problem is

726
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:15,929
the symptoms that have destroyed
your quality of life

727
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,401
now will worsen.

728
00:36:18,729 --> 00:36:20,260
Your heart stopped today.

729
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:24,144
It can happen again, and...

730
00:36:25,781 --> 00:36:27,229
...it might kill you.

731
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,747
Your liver, adrenal,
uh, thyroid glands,

732
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:35,127
one by one, will likely fail.

733
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:37,869
Carol, when that happens,
you'll be hospitalized.

734
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:39,377
You'll need surgeries,

735
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:42,065
medications, dialysis,
ventilators.

736
00:36:42,692 --> 00:36:48,362
I have
fought so hard for so long.

737
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,409
And now you're telling me
there's no hope.

738
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:54,669
No.

739
00:36:55,307 --> 00:36:57,135
That's not
what we're saying, Carol.

740
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,879
We just...

741
00:36:58,964 --> 00:37:01,906
we just want you to clearly
understand your options.

742
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:08,377
What should I do?

743
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:12,776
There's no right
or wrong answer.

744
00:37:15,311 --> 00:37:16,963
And you don't
have to answer now.

745
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,872
We can take some time.
We can talk about it later.

746
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,901
That was brutal.

747
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:40,877
We're all gonna die.

748
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:44,549
One day,
we'll all be the patient.

749
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:49,237
We stand between them
and the day that moment comes.

750
00:37:50,091 --> 00:37:51,534
And we owe them the truth.

751
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:53,089
And you found it hard
to give her the truth,

752
00:37:53,173 --> 00:37:54,984
but you did it anyway
because the patient is

753
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:56,619
what comes first, not us.

754
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:02,713
Hey.

755
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:04,549
You did good in there.

756
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:08,713
Now,

757
00:38:09,648 --> 00:38:13,180
if your interests come
before the patient again,

758
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:16,619
like they did earlier today,
then Dr. Pravesh is right.

759
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,893
This should be your last day
as a doctor.

760
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,258
So?

761
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:36,057
Um...

762
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:40,482
He felt pain for Carol and AJ.
He wanted to help.

763
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:41,909
I could see that.

764
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,994
But...

765
00:38:44,483 --> 00:38:46,309
would be a journey with him.

766
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:49,362
Yeah. I'm conflicted.

767
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:53,573
I'm thinking
about my first day.

768
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:55,534
God knows I screwed up
worse than Trevor did.

769
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:57,846
You screwed up because of
a desperate need to help.

770
00:38:57,931 --> 00:38:59,830
Your empathy is
what got you in trouble,

771
00:38:59,915 --> 00:39:01,409
not your self-interest.

772
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:04,596
As for Trevor, that's...

773
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,385
...that's your call.

774
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:09,151
Yeah.

775
00:39:10,104 --> 00:39:11,510
I'll think about it.

776
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,151
Wait.

777
00:39:17,512 --> 00:39:18,619
Listen.

778
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,599
What you did today,

779
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,409
every part of it,

780
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,604
is why you belong here.

781
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:30,682
I guess we both have
a big decision to make.

782
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:37,260
You're a good man, Dr. Pravesh.
Remember that.

783
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:43,135
I'm so sorry, AJ.

784
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,494
I had no idea.

785
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,104
I appreciate
what you did back there.

786
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:54,643
Sorry to interrupt.

787
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,416
Can I steal Dr. Daniels
for a second?

788
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:00,596
Yeah.

789
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:09,510
Uh, should I sit?

790
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:10,702
Nope.

791
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:14,468
This will be quick.

792
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:16,327
Okay.

793
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:21,199
Trevor, on my first day
as an intern,

794
00:40:21,908 --> 00:40:25,719
I ran a code
on a 21-year-old drug user

795
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:27,324
for over a half an hour.

796
00:40:27,902 --> 00:40:29,987
My resident, Dr. Hawkins,
told me to stop,

797
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:31,332
but I didn't listen.

798
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:34,425
I resuscitated her
until I got a heartbeat.

799
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,371
She was alive...

800
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:39,230
but brain-dead.

801
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:41,785
Her family wouldn't
let her pass.

802
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:45,121
It prolonged the agony.

803
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:47,632
And Hawkins threaten
to cut you.

804
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:50,911
I got another shot.

805
00:40:54,113 --> 00:40:55,777
And now I'm gonna
give one to you.

806
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,518
Uh... th-thank you.

807
00:41:02,728 --> 00:41:05,129
Seriously, I-I'll try
not to disappoint you.

808
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:18,097
Austin.

809
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:20,035
Hey.

810
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:23,366
I heard about Carol.

811
00:41:23,497 --> 00:41:24,785
How are you?

812
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:27,371
Fine.

813
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:29,964
Oh, AJ, I'm so sorry.

814
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,121
Look, I talked
to your boy today.

815
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:40,078
And
I have hope for him.

816
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:42,707
Me, too.

817
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,379
But, listen, he...

818
00:41:46,144 --> 00:41:48,558
he thinks I recommended him
to Chastain.

819
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,843
That I got him
his residency.

820
00:41:51,928 --> 00:41:54,566
Billie, I want you to know
I did no such thing.

821
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,050
I know.

822
00:41:57,537 --> 00:41:58,754
I did.

823
00:42:01,674 --> 00:42:05,578
No man wants his mother
to pull strings for him.

824
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:07,066
Agreed.

825
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,261
But I'm not his mother.

826
00:42:10,347 --> 00:42:11,441
Right.

827
00:42:13,524 --> 00:42:14,884
None of that matters.

828
00:42:15,071 --> 00:42:16,144
I want you to know,

829
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:18,648
if there's anything I can do
at all for Carol...

830
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:20,054
She wants hope.

831
00:42:21,788 --> 00:42:23,597
And I can't give it to her.

832
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,004
How did it go?

833
00:42:33,429 --> 00:42:35,269
Said Gigi had a great day.

834
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,666
And you?

835
00:42:39,135 --> 00:42:43,271
I wouldn't call it great,
but it was important.

836
00:42:44,402 --> 00:42:46,058
I need to be here.
I'm ready.

837
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,316
I'm ready to suit back up
for Chastain.

838
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:52,014
Um...

839
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:56,355
So what about
the work-life balance?

840
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,933
I have no idea.

841
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:03,472
But we'll make it work.

842
00:43:03,721 --> 00:43:05,613
Welcome back, Dr. Hawkins.
