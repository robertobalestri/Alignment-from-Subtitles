2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,618
I think we should

3
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:06,815
dig into Dr. Bosley's
patient outcomes and...

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,000
give Ms. Benesch a fair hearing.

5
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:10,743
Let's just simmer down.

6
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:12,286
Just watch

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,671
and learn how we operate.

8
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:16,111
I-I think I'm getting a pretty
good sense of how you operate.

9
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:18,354
Are you looking
for a financial settlement?

10
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,281
No. I'm looking
for accountability.

11
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:22,766
I did not have to end up
like this.

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,528
I don't want future patients
of Dr. Bosley to, either.

13
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:27,680
I want the board
to do something.

14
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:30,291
- Will they?
- Honestly, probably not.

15
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,418
But I will do something.

16
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,693
So what's happening
in the world?

17
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:47,362
I'm not reading the news.

18
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,586
I'm watching a video
of a bulldog

19
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:51,554
failing to eat its kibble.

20
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:53,039
Okay.

21
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:54,564
Slow news day.

22
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:56,460
What's going on with your leg?

23
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:58,820
Oh, I guess it slept in.

24
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:01,639
Could be an MS flare-up.

25
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:03,938
I'll email Dr. Greer,
see if she can fit you in today.

26
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,610
Yeah, well, early is better.

27
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:07,046
I have a 10:00 with Abernathy,

28
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:08,478
the head of the medical board,

29
00:01:08,563 --> 00:01:10,406
'cause I found more complaints
against Bosley,

30
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,023
the neurosurgeon
who paralyzed Emily Benesch.

31
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:15,395
Do you think you have enough
to convince the board

32
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,125
to look into Bosley now?

33
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,789
I'm not gonna give 'em
any choice.

34
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:24,687
You know,
this whole moral crusader thing

35
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:26,399
looks good on you.

36
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:27,572
It's very...

37
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:29,091
super hero-y.

38
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:30,336
You should see me in spandex.

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,562
Well, that's ruined it.

40
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:37,362
Can I help you?

41
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,860
You look familiar,
but I can't place you.

42
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:41,398
Are you gonna harass me
every time I have an ER shift?

43
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:42,047
Yes.

44
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:43,938
You know, please look
into your abandonment issues.

45
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:46,266
You know my father left me
at Yankee Stadium and got home

46
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,603
with my brother before
he realized I was missing.

47
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:50,601
I'm sorry I triggered you,
Irving.

48
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:52,202
You don't care. Where's Leela?

49
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:53,889
Sister day with Padma.

50
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:55,460
Bonding over the gifting
of eggs.

51
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:57,055
Level-1 trauma coming in!

52
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,231
Bay 11's ready.

53
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:01,708
Eliza Brock ton.
32-year-old female.

54
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:03,785
Status post-fall from her
sixth-floor apartment building.

55
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,030
BP 120/68, tachy to 100,

56
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:07,389
satting at 98%.

57
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,116
Trauma survey.

58
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:14,221
Pupils equal and reactive.

59
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:15,705
Airway's intact.

60
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:18,466
- Good breath sounds bilaterally.
- Pulse strong.

61
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,802
Vitals stable. I'll get labs.

62
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:23,319
I'll do a FAST exam
and put in for a chest X-ray.

63
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:24,579
Eliza,

64
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:27,341
how did you fall
from your apartment building?

65
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:28,796
I-I was, um...

66
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:31,476
I was hanging
a-an orchid on my balcony,

67
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:35,046
and I-I reached too far over the
railing and I just...

68
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:36,548
lost my balance.

69
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:40,226
Thank God the entry awning
broke my fall.

70
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,806
Well, we're gonna get
that chest X-ray

71
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,249
and CT scan
to check for head trauma.

72
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:45,494
We'll be back, okay?

73
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,313
- Uh, okay.
- All right, hang tight.

74
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,985
You want to get her records
and I'll arrange the CT?

75
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,302
Yeah.

76
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:02,585
What is it?

77
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:04,420
Eliza's attempted suicide
three times

78
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:06,063
in the past six years.

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,018
Let's get a psych consult
down here.

80
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:13,469
Eliza.

81
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:18,951
Hundley.

82
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:21,202
My patient eloped from 11.
Call the code.

83
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:22,287
Excuse me.

84
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:26,016
<i>Attention, staff. Code Green.</i>

85
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:29,187
<i>32-year-old Caucasian female.</i>

86
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:31,838
<i>Dark hair, blue eyes.
Code Green.</i>

87
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,989
Eliza!

88
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:47,859
Eliza!

89
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,344
Wait!

90
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:00,784
Eliza!

93
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,902
You all right?

94
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:30,996
I'm fine.

95
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:32,314
Eliza's stable.

96
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:34,418
Scans were negative.
BP was borderline,

97
00:04:34,503 --> 00:04:35,362
so we placed an A-line.

98
00:04:35,446 --> 00:04:36,863
And Psych is en route.

99
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:40,182
That was a very brave thing
you did, Dr. Pravesh.

100
00:04:41,252 --> 00:04:42,503
I'm just glad
we got to her in time.

101
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:44,328
Mm-hmm.

102
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:50,563
We're good.

103
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:54,838
So...

104
00:04:56,737 --> 00:04:58,579
I guess the truth is out.

105
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:00,421
I don't want this anymore.

106
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:04,510
And I wish you would just mind
your own business and let me go.

107
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,549
You know we can't do that.

108
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:13,874
This is Dr. Malco.

109
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:17,237
She's from
the psychiatry department.

110
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,072
Hi, Eliza.

111
00:05:19,156 --> 00:05:20,799
I'm guessing
you know the drill here.

112
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:22,366
I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.

113
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,417
You have my file.

114
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,143
So you could just read
my old answers.

115
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:30,082
My new answers are all the same.

116
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,501
I'm out of words.

117
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:36,535
I imagine that must be
very difficult for a writer.

118
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,003
To be out of words.

119
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:41,288
I'm out of everything.

120
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:43,154
I want you to know,

121
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:46,933
both of your books have informed
the way I treat depression.

122
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:49,351
I'd like to return the favor.

123
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,215
Do you have a gun?

124
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:56,400
We're gonna keep you
on a 36-hour hold.

125
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:05,785
Dear merciful Father,

126
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,440
we ask for Your blessings
on Daisy.

127
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,943
She needs You.

128
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:14,643
We're asking that You grant her
the patience to...

129
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:17,258
help her with her affliction

130
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,782
and the freedom from her pain.

131
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:23,544
And lead her out
the shadow of the valley

132
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:27,307
so that we can heal her body
and spirit.

133
00:06:30,118 --> 00:06:32,312
Now let's go get you
a damn kidney, huh?

134
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,481
- Amen.
- Amen.

135
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:44,549
Ah...

136
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:47,218
Aaron, it is good to see you.

137
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:48,720
Yeah, it's been a minute.

138
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:51,572
You know we've had our
own conversations about pain.

139
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:52,557
Mm.

140
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,559
How are you and Gigi holding up?

141
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:56,318
Yeah, really well.

142
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:58,505
Gigi's definitely
my greatest achievement so far.

143
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,507
You got that right.

144
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:01,566
Yeah.

145
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,843
Speaking
of our past conversations,

146
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:06,237
the last few days, I've...

147
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:07,588
been...

148
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:10,183
Back in the fresh grief
of Nic's passing,

149
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:12,668
I-I guess. I don't...

150
00:07:12,752 --> 00:07:15,171
Uh, I don't know
what set it off.

151
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:18,191
Ah, well, if it isn't Pastor
Aaron, my favorite clergyman.

152
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:21,177
AJ, my big bad Buddhist, you.

153
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:22,845
- Hey.
- How are you?

154
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:24,013
How's your mother?

155
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:27,425
She is as well as she can be.

156
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:29,427
The cancer is progressing.

157
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:31,687
I'm sorry to hear that.

158
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:34,042
I-I'll definitely have
to go see her.

159
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:37,174
Well, you see, her palliative
care is top-tier, right?

160
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,545
But she's gonna need
to transition

161
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,456
to hospice sooner
rather than later,

162
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,608
and she is not keen on the idea.

163
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,552
So I was thinking
maybe you can help me

164
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:48,129
have that conversation with her
when it's time.

165
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:49,222
I'll be happy to.

166
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:50,465
Appreciate it, man.

167
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:54,710
I have a favor of my own
to ask you two.

168
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:56,955
Yeah. Anything.

169
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,900
Recently, I had a heart stent
placed a few months back.

170
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:03,795
A fit young dude like you?

171
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,572
They found some blockage.
Now, the doctor told me

172
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:06,906
that I should be feeling better,

173
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,484
but I've been having
a lot of chest pain lately.

174
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:13,246
Ah, say no more. AJ and I will
take a look at you in the ER.

175
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,748
Better safe than sorry.

176
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:16,414
Let's go now.

177
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:20,152
Head scans are good.

178
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:21,312
- Nothing to worry about.
- Great.

179
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:23,394
But the leg issue is
a little MS flare-up.

180
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,074
No biggie. This will happen
from time to time.

181
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:26,760
Well, I'm glad we checked, then.

182
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:28,410
We'll put you on a short course
of steroids

183
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:29,578
that should improve
your symptoms.

184
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:31,155
In the meantime,
take the pressure

185
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,991
- off your leg with this.
- Oh.

186
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:36,714
No. That is...
uh, won't be necessary.

187
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,573
It's only for a few days.

188
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,332
The last thing we want
is for you to stumble

189
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,121
- and hit your head.
- Randolph,

190
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,973
- take the cane.
- No, it's...

191
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,217
It starts
with a cane, and then it goes

192
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:47,977
to adult diapers and a chairlift
to get up the stairs.

193
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,721
It's a concession to the
disease, and I won't make it.

194
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:52,574
Good Lord, Randolph.
Typical man.

195
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,968
You can dress it as bravery,
but it's just vanity.

196
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:57,971
Okay. Uh,
I'd love to stick around

197
00:08:58,055 --> 00:08:59,639
and talk about canes and men,

198
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:02,142
but... I have
an important meeting to get to.

199
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:03,625
So, Meghan, thank you.

200
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:12,260
I remember

201
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:16,339
being at a birthday party when
I was four or five years old.

202
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,249
And...

203
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:21,553
the birthday girl
shrieked with joy

204
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:25,515
when she unwrapped a doll
from her parents.

205
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:28,350
For the first time,
I became distinctly aware

206
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:33,135
that it was something
that I had never... felt.

207
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:35,463
Is there anything
in your daily life

208
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:38,199
that brings relief
from the pain and dread?

209
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:41,957
Periodically, when I'm writing.

210
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,942
Are there any moments
in your past where you...

211
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:47,336
can recall feeling happy?

212
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,997
This morning.

213
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,468
When I felt the wind on my face

214
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:57,638
as I fell to what
should have been my death.

215
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,591
My reservoir of hope...

216
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:05,735
is empty.

217
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,981
Eliza has what we call
treatment-resistant depression.

218
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:26,668
Cognitive behavioral therapy,
antidepressants,

219
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,004
and ECT have all
been ineffective.

220
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,821
So, what do we do?

221
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:32,565
We just keep her here

222
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,325
for 34 hours and then just

223
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,903
- let her walk out?
- We don't have a lot of options.

224
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:39,681
Sad to say, I have no beds free
on the unit.

225
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:42,037
Don't patients with

226
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:43,927
treatment-resistant depression

227
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,731
qualify for off-label
deep brain stimulation?

228
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:48,233
I've read

229
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:49,840
some clinical trials on it,

230
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:52,084
and I know Dr. Sutton
has used it on patients

231
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:54,196
with Parkinson's and even OCD.

232
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,755
They do,

233
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,781
but there's no guarantee
it works.

234
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:00,628
Well, in one trial,

235
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:04,056
50% of patients saw some relief
from their symptoms.

236
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,044
Do you think Eliza
would consider the procedure?

237
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:15,451
All Eliza wants is to exit life.

238
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,092
It'll be challenging

239
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,113
to get her to agree
to any treatment,

240
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:22,039
much less one that requires
holes drilled in her skull

241
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:24,542
and electrodes placed
in her brain.

242
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,819
Well, if we do nothing, there
is no doubt that she will try

243
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,122
- to kill herself again.
- No doubt.

244
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:30,724
I'll talk to Dr. Sutton.

245
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:33,598
See if she can discuss
the procedure with Eliza.

246
00:11:42,113 --> 00:11:43,548
Dr. Sullivan didn't come in?

247
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:45,110
She took the day off.

248
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,967
We got Pravesh back instead.

249
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:48,351
Who?

250
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,829
Good thing we looked into
your chest pain. You have EKG

251
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:56,091
changes and labs consistent
with an NSTEMI.

252
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,908
It's a minor heart attack.

253
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:00,428
What? A minor heart attack?

254
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,452
- How is that possible?
- Take it easy, Aaron.

255
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:04,415
All right, we're on it.
We got you.

256
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,009
Taking good care
of yourself, right?

257
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,011
- Yes.
- All right, well,

258
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,904
explain to us how you ended up
with a cardiac stent.

259
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:14,303
Well, this cardiac clinic came
to the church leaving flyers.

260
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:15,944
They were offering
heart screenings

261
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,004
with no out-of-pocket
with Medicaid.

262
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:21,325
And, uh, now, my congregation

263
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,660
relies on outreach, so

264
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:26,128
I wanted to set an example
to the flock, so I went.

265
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,938
And what did the screening
turn up?

266
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:30,867
Cardiologist said that my...

267
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,202
my labs and my tests were...

268
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,462
"borderline" was the word,

269
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:37,255
and that I needed a cath ASAP.

270
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,409
Were you feeling any chest pain?

271
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,953
No. No.

272
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:46,551
He said that the cath
was very important

273
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:48,959
to screen for heart disease.
Silent killer.

274
00:12:49,043 --> 00:12:53,313
Okay, but why did
they stent you?

275
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:57,968
Well, during the procedure,

276
00:12:58,052 --> 00:13:00,730
my heart was beating
out of my chest.

277
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,640
And the pain,

278
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:04,884
I mean, it's very severe, but

279
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:07,737
once they put in the stent,
I had relief.

280
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,664
You know, I'm a little
achy and tired

281
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:10,907
here and there,
but for the most part,

282
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,566
I'm-I'm thankful.

283
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,246
Chest pain usually comes
before cardiac

284
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,341
catheterization, not after.

285
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:20,733
Excuse me, I need to take this.

286
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:23,011
I hate to do this
to you, brother,

287
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:26,514
but we need to get you
in our cath lab right away.

288
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:30,259
And I promise you, you won't
feel any pain with these hands.

289
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,144
All right?

290
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:36,006
We got you, man.

291
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,342
Hey, Billie.

292
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:40,086
- You got a sec?
- What's up?

293
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,938
So, I have a young woman
in the ER,

294
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,423
she's banged up pretty bad

295
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:45,108
from two failed
suicide attempts today.

296
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:48,277
Yeah, I heard Superman
flew in and saved her.

297
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:52,215
Her name is Eliza Brock ton.
She's very smart, wily.

298
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,601
She's a memoirist
who wrote two best sellers

299
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:55,768
about depression.

300
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:57,528
Sure, yeah, I read
the first one,

301
00:13:57,612 --> 00:13:58,938
<i>The Lure of the Void.</i>

302
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:00,745
Right.

303
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:03,792
So, I think she's
a good candidate for DBS.

304
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,055
Well, DBS is still experimental
for depression.

305
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,832
Does she meet
the inclusion criteria?

306
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:09,707
Yes.

307
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,996
No improvement
from CBT, SSRIs, or ECT.

308
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:13,966
Okay.

309
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,706
- I'll talk to her.
- Thanks.

310
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:18,751
It's Trevor. I've been trying
to reach him for weeks.

311
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:23,112
Take it. No, take it, and
let him know that we miss him.

312
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:26,980
Trevor, I'm so glad
you finally called.

313
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:29,135
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

314
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:31,370
I'm sorry it took so long
to get back to you. Just...

315
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:34,082
- dealing with a lot of stuff.
<i>- Of course.</i>

316
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,808
I can only imagine
a horrible revelation like...

317
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,334
<i>Yeah. We don't have to, um...</i>

318
00:14:39,006 --> 00:14:40,941
Look, there's some...
there's some stuff

319
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,924
I want to tell you in person.

320
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:45,985
Okay. Sure.

321
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:48,430
Just know, I've been
worried about you.

322
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:49,839
All of us here have.

323
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,266
<i>And I'm not sure
if you're aware of this,</i>

324
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,160
<i>but you're in danger
of losing your residency.</i>

325
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:56,587
Yeah, I know.

326
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:59,689
Uh, look, can we meet up
tomorrow? I'll fill you in.

327
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,259
Yeah, sure. That works.

328
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:04,277
<i>Cool. Thanks, Billie.</i>

329
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,678
Phones in your locker
while you're at the warehouse.

330
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:12,695
Yeah, yeah, sorry. My bad.

331
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,204
- You know that.
- Yeah.

332
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,187
What's with the limp?
You okay, Randolph?

333
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:23,998
Oh, I'm-I'm doing great.
Thanks for your concern.

334
00:15:24,082 --> 00:15:26,375
I want to talk to you
about Bosley.

335
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:28,402
I don't get it.

336
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:30,029
What is your beef
with Dr. Bosley?

337
00:15:30,113 --> 00:15:33,049
- Is this personal?
- I've never met the man.

338
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,202
I told you last week,
Dr. Elkins was looking

339
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,704
- into the Emily Benesch case.
- Well, you know...

340
00:15:37,788 --> 00:15:39,563
She didn't.

341
00:15:40,715 --> 00:15:42,800
These are five more complaints
against Bosley

342
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:44,894
for catastrophic outcomes
that the board

343
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,971
didn't look into either.

344
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:50,307
Look...

345
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:52,068
I-I'm just not familiar with

346
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,995
the details
of these old complaints

347
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,312
off the top of my head,

348
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:57,573
but I can tell you that,
if we made the decision

349
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,408
not to investigate,

350
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,336
we had good reasons.

351
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,230
See, I can't imagine what those

352
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:06,007
could possibly be.

353
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,402
Randolph, you're a good man,
and I like you.

354
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:12,830
You can be a very valuable
member of the medical board.

355
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:14,999
That's what I'm trying to be.

356
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,075
Well, typically,

357
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,669
new members tend to stay
on the sidelines

358
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:20,246
for a period
to see how things work

359
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,840
before going full Norma Rae,

360
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:25,084
you know what I mean?

361
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:29,089
I'll see you at the
board meeting this afternoon.

362
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,760
All right, Aaron,
I found the stent,

363
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:36,262
and I also found the cause

364
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:38,097
of your heart attack.

365
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:41,117
Unfortunately,
they're one and the same.

366
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,044
Uh, what does that mean?

367
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,863
The stent your doctors placed
is actually blocking

368
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:47,940
one of the other arteries
in your heart.

369
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:50,610
That's why you were
feeling so much pain.

370
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:53,037
AJ, the rest of his vessels
are pristine.

371
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:56,668
Cholesterol's low,
no family history...

372
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,779
And it looks like the
stent was placed in the location

373
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:01,632
of a coronary artery dissection.
Are we thinking the same thing?

374
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:03,534
Yeah. It sickens me

375
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:04,745
to say this,

376
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,324
but you never should have had
a cath in the first place.

377
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:10,716
Worse, the cardiologist
tore blood vessels

378
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,569
when he put it in, which is why
the procedure was so painful.

379
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:16,239
I should prepare
to see my maker.

380
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:17,965
No need to pack your bags.

381
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,825
You will get to your next
great achievement.

382
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,768
Aaron,

383
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:26,520
what was the name
of your cardiologist?

384
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Eliza,

385
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,215
this is Dr. Billie Sutton,

386
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,910
and she is a neurosurgeon,

387
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:40,246
and I've asked her to come here
and talk to you.

388
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,339
Hi, Eliza.

389
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,766
I've seen that expression

390
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,268
on your face too many times.

391
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,807
You have a plan to fix me,

392
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,518
but I am unfixable.

393
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:54,183
I don't want to go
through this again.

394
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:56,534
I-I get that.

395
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,300
And, truth be told,
my plan might not work.

396
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:01,933
The success rate
of deep brain stimulation

397
00:18:02,017 --> 00:18:03,511
for depression is about 50%.

398
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:05,454
That is a broad definition
of success,

399
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:08,373
from modest improvement
to complete absence

400
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,725
of symptoms.

401
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:12,427
Deep brain stimulation?

402
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,631
A small conductor, an electrode,

403
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:19,543
is permanently placed in a
specific region of the brain.

404
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:22,379
The conductor carries a
low-level impulse from a battery

405
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:23,881
to the area of the brain
that regulates mood.

406
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:25,791
What could possibly go wrong?

407
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,118
In very rare circumstances,
a hemorrhage can occur.

408
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,757
Wh-Which would conceivably
turn me into a can of peas.

409
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:37,503
Well, like I said,
that outcome is very rare,

410
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:38,672
and I'm very good at this.

411
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:41,065
And here's the part
you might like...

412
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:42,566
Can't imagine
what that would be.

413
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,994
Well, first we have
to scan your brain.

414
00:18:45,078 --> 00:18:47,663
Then, I give you a tour
of the organ

415
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:50,482
that's not only the source
of your literary success,

416
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,393
but the thing
that wants you dead.

417
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:54,670
I'll pull some strings
to get you out

418
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:57,422
- of the ER while you wait.
- Mm.

419
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:02,236
We'll be back.

420
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,165
Aaron is stable,

421
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:09,518
but I can't undo the injury
his heart has sustained.

422
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:12,413
Once a blood vessel's been torn,
it can tear again.

423
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:15,076
And an acute clot could form,

424
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:16,900
cause him more heart attacks.

425
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:18,935
His cardiac function
has decreased

426
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,604
to only a third
of what it should be.

427
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:23,181
- In time, it could improve.
- It's all wrong,

428
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:24,683
and the worst part is,

429
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:27,444
the procedure
was entirely unnecessary.

430
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:29,930
Look, I got a quick errand
I got to run.

431
00:19:30,014 --> 00:19:31,540
I'll be back as fast as I can.

432
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:33,977
I'll hold the pastor in the ER,
keep an eye on him.

433
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:36,462
- Yeah, man.
- I'll update you.

434
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,423
This is the cerebrum...

435
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:54,142
...where consciousness,
emotion, perception,

436
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,962
and memory are all integrated.

437
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:59,501
Like any other part of the body,

438
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:02,801
pathways of connections
can be too strong or too weak,

439
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:04,416
and when they are weak, we try

440
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:05,810
to augment them
with medications,

441
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:07,645
you know, SSRIs, ECT...

442
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:10,090
- But those didn't work.
- Which is why we get

443
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:11,591
to try something more intense.

444
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:13,927
We would place electrodes

445
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:16,170
here and here.

446
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:18,656
Like a pacemaker for the brain

447
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,341
instead of the heart.

448
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:22,827
The electrodes stimulate
Brodmann area 25,

449
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,921
which is like the interstate
highway of nerve connections,

450
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,348
or white matter,

451
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:29,334
and it's sitting right on top

452
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:31,611
of a huge serotonin depot.

453
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:34,948
It's like drilling
for a well of happiness.

454
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:38,343
If you like that image.

455
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:41,937
Reminds me of those
flimsy claws at arcades

456
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:45,683
that kids dump their money into
and try to grab a prize,

457
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:47,828
but they never get one.

458
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:52,766
Well, DBS has much higher odds
of success than those claws.

459
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:55,081
Define success.

460
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:58,138
We banish the hell in your head

461
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:00,031
but keep the heavenly talent.

462
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:02,141
I won't wake up

463
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:04,477
and be someone else,

464
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,646
will I?

465
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,648
Everyone facing DBS
asks that question.

466
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:12,818
Surely not everybody.

467
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,472
Look, they say
in Alcoholics Anonymous,

468
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:18,474
if you sober up a horse thief,

469
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:20,617
all you have is
a sober horse thief.

470
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,492
You will remain you,

471
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:26,123
but a happy you.

472
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:31,294
You're describing a stranger.

473
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:35,416
<i>You know,
I really appreciate you</i>

474
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,919
making time for me
on such short notice,

475
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:39,253
Dr. Pellington.

476
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:41,275
Well, I'm glad we could
make it work, Mr. Austin.

477
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,350
Now, as you know, we took
a picture of your heart

478
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:46,376
a few minutes ago,
I sure am glad we did.

479
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:48,246
It revealed some extra beats.

480
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,747
Now, we have
a fancy term for that.

481
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:52,083
It's called premature
ventricular contractions,

482
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,085
but the important thing is,

483
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:55,587
it may have shown a blockage

484
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:57,755
in your arteries
that feed blood to your heart,

485
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,015
and that's the first step
to a heart attack.

486
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:02,427
Whoa, a heart attack.

487
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:04,946
C-Can I take
a look at that?

488
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,356
- Oh, sure, sure.
- Thanks.

489
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,434
You are one lucky man

490
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:11,884
because we can do
a cardiac cath.

491
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:13,400
That's a procedure

492
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:15,268
where we can get a better view
of those arteries,

493
00:22:15,352 --> 00:22:16,866
and if there is blockages,

494
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,766
which I suspect there will be,

495
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:21,346
we can open 'em right up.
Any questions?

496
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:23,965
Yeah, just one.

497
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:27,118
Did you go into medicine
intending to become a fraud?

498
00:22:27,202 --> 00:22:28,803
Excuse me?

499
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:31,139
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon

500
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:33,066
at Chastain Park Memorial,

501
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,143
and you and I both know that

502
00:22:35,227 --> 00:22:36,644
my EKG is normal.

503
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:39,704
There is no medical reason
to take me to cath,

504
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:42,316
just like there wasn't
for Pastor Aaron either.

505
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,468
I could point to hundreds...

506
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:46,564
Pastor Aaron is in our ICU

507
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:49,158
right now as a result
of the botched stent

508
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,111
you put in when you dissected

509
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:54,254
his LAD during
an unnecessary cath.

510
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:56,481
So, not only are you greedy,

511
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:58,816
you are incompetent at best.

512
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,335
I don't know what the hell
you think you're getting at,

513
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:03,078
but everything I did is legal.

514
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:05,765
Legal? Really?

515
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:09,392
You know, that's a pretty
low bar for a doctor.

516
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:12,665
I'll tell you what,

517
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,999
Pellington,

518
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,001
if my friend takes a turn
for the worse,

519
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:20,838
you will find yourself
on the losing end of a lawsuit

520
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:23,865
with me as the expert witness.

521
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:29,030
Aaron.

522
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:30,515
How you doing?

523
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,749
I was just working
on next week's sermon.

524
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:36,296
You know, today's been
all about me,

525
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,539
and earlier you mentioned
about being pulled back in

526
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,160
the pain of your wife's death,
before we got interrupted.

527
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:43,544
And it will continue
to be all about you.

528
00:23:43,628 --> 00:23:46,288
Numbers look good.
Any chest pain?

529
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:48,673
Ah, nothing significant.

530
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,537
You and I are in
the "you" business.

531
00:23:52,621 --> 00:23:55,297
You let me do my job.

532
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:57,650
This resurgence of grief,

533
00:23:57,734 --> 00:24:00,378
have you had any big recent
changes in your life?

534
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:04,114
Crazy work stuff the past week.

535
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,476
Have you been

536
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:10,939
stepping out with any women
since Nic's death?

537
00:24:11,024 --> 00:24:13,741
Eh... one. Nothing serious.
Potentially others.

538
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:15,893
- They all come with complications.
- Yeah.

539
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:19,488
Yeah, and I'm sure that you had
those complications with Nic.

540
00:24:19,572 --> 00:24:21,916
Yeah, but the baggage
was mostly mine.

541
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:25,290
You know, my experience with

542
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,072
counseling widowers is that
guilt and loyalty

543
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:31,224
can toss you back
into the original grief.

544
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:34,687
Maybe.

545
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:36,523
Hey.

546
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:37,857
If it's this woman,

547
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:40,931
or if it's that woman,
you deserve

548
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:42,809
your next
great romantic achievement.

549
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,180
Patient's in V tach!
I need a crash cart!

550
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:55,449
He's pulse less. Now in V fib.

551
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:59,337
We need to shock.
Get the pads on.

552
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:07,766
Charging. And clear.

553
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:10,114
Now.

554
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:12,266
Still in V fib.

555
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:15,008
Get me a bolus of amio
and shock again.

556
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:23,402
Charging.

557
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:25,713
Clear. And shock.

558
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:31,251
- He has a pulse.
- Sinus rhythm.

559
00:25:31,336 --> 00:25:34,618
- But if this happens again, he is not...
- When it happens again,

560
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:36,065
he won't survive it.

561
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:39,126
Let's get him to the ICU.
I'll page AJ.

562
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:47,259
- Hey, what's going on?
- I got him out of V fib, but...

563
00:25:47,344 --> 00:25:50,553
Hey. Right here,
I got you, brother.

564
00:25:55,696 --> 00:25:57,954
His left ventricle
is barely contracting.

565
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:00,176
Down to about 15%.
He couldn't tolerate

566
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:01,702
the refractory arrhythmia.

567
00:26:01,922 --> 00:26:03,704
We can't fix
his coronary arteries

568
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:05,594
with more stents.
They're too damaged.

569
00:26:05,678 --> 00:26:09,064
I'm gonna have to take a vessel
from his chest and go around it.

570
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:12,360
From an unnecessary cath
to open-heart surgery.

571
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:19,350
His systolic's
dropping to the 60s.

572
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:20,954
I need more pressure than that

573
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,204
- to do surgery.
- I'm maxed out on pressors.

574
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:26,207
We're gonna have to
put him on ECMO.

575
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:29,193
Wh-What's going on, fellas?

576
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:31,954
AJ needs to perform
bypass surgery,

577
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,837
so we're gonna
put you on a machine

578
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:35,306
that will take over
for your heart,

579
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:37,522
so your heart can survive
the procedure, okay?

580
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:41,038
If God wants me
at His table right now,

581
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:42,815
I have faith in Him.

582
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:45,209
Have faith in me.

583
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:48,907
I'm gonna do my best to make you
late for that dinner.

584
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:50,880
You hear me?

585
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,369
I am glad to see that you
agreed to the DBS.

586
00:26:56,922 --> 00:26:58,846
Of course, you'll be
under psychiatric care

587
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:01,165
for some time
after the surgery, but...

588
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:03,167
have you thought about

589
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:05,004
what kind of support
you're gonna need

590
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:06,630
when you get back
into your life?

591
00:27:08,497 --> 00:27:09,781
Well, if this works,

592
00:27:09,866 --> 00:27:12,643
I'll be happy, right? So...

593
00:27:12,836 --> 00:27:14,611
I won't need anything.

594
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:16,671
I started reading
your first book.

595
00:27:16,755 --> 00:27:19,931
Hmm. Enjoy it while you can.

596
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:24,097
And that description
of the conversation that you had

597
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:26,857
with your therapist after
your first suicide attempt...

598
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:30,119
About falling in love with

599
00:27:30,203 --> 00:27:32,196
my depression.

600
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,107
Yeah.

601
00:27:34,191 --> 00:27:36,174
It's hard to conceive of that.

602
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,867
Well, for most people, it's...

603
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,870
impossible, which is...

604
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:44,799
why this is all so futile.

605
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:47,971
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

606
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:50,647
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just tired.

607
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:55,275
This is so weird.

608
00:27:56,878 --> 00:27:59,055
- Eliza?
- Hmm? Yeah.

609
00:27:59,154 --> 00:28:00,737
Hey.

610
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:05,563
My God, she pulled out
her A-line!

611
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:08,141
I need another set
of hands in here!

612
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,376
Eliza, I'm not letting you go.

613
00:28:12,362 --> 00:28:14,280
Please...

614
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:16,490
give us a chance.

615
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:23,172
Okay, so, remember, stay calm,
avoid an accusatory tone.

616
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:25,875
But just share your truth.

617
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:27,868
Yeah. Okay.

618
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:30,854
I'm nervous, but I can do that.

619
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:34,501
I wouldn't put you
in front of these people

620
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:36,503
if I didn't think
you could reach them.

621
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:38,280
Okay.

622
00:28:38,364 --> 00:28:40,614
Okay. All right. Here we go.

623
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,609
I'm gonna move that chair.

624
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:54,169
Just the top of the table.

625
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:57,331
Okay.

626
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,039
Uh...

627
00:28:59,124 --> 00:29:00,657
Who is this woman, Dr. Bell?

628
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,368
You didn't mention that you were
bringing a guest this morning.

629
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,864
This is Emily Benesch.

630
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:08,034
She's gonna tell us her story,

631
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:09,883
and we are going to listen.

632
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:13,130
The last time I
walked on my own two feet,

633
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,691
it was into
Dr. Bosley's practice.

634
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:19,974
The man I was engaged to marry

635
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:22,485
left me
after I was paralyzed.

636
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,419
I can't...
turn over in bed,

637
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:36,689
reach a book on the shelf,

638
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:38,565
get out of my house, into a car,

639
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:42,585
through a store
without pain and struggle.

640
00:29:42,887 --> 00:29:44,937
And why?

641
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:47,977
Because no one stopped a man

642
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:51,643
who should never have been
operating to begin with.

643
00:29:52,431 --> 00:29:55,834
You sit in here and review
his explanations.

644
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,692
Accidents happen,

645
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:00,352
but again and again?

646
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,732
Who else will end up like me?

647
00:30:06,124 --> 00:30:08,805
Would you send your wife to him?

648
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:11,563
Your son?

649
00:30:11,848 --> 00:30:13,616
Your father?

650
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:16,005
Then why a stranger?

651
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,268
I know that a very high
percentage of doctors

652
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:22,172
are-are competent

653
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:23,932
and good people.

654
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:27,130
And the few who ruin

655
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:28,965
people's lives,

656
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:32,543
they're... are repeat offenders.

657
00:30:32,627 --> 00:30:34,686
Like Dr. Bosley.

658
00:30:35,642 --> 00:30:38,561
If a hundred good doctors
do nothing

659
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:41,180
about one bad one,

660
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:44,196
then we've got 101 bad doctors.

661
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,726
You owe it to yourselves.

662
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,161
You owe it to me.

663
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:58,376
Thank you, Emily.

664
00:31:00,154 --> 00:31:03,983
We'll pass this up to
the complaint division and...

665
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,836
discuss the status
of the investigation

666
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,265
on a weekly basis.

667
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:12,373
Thank you.

668
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:29,134
The ECMO's giving his heart
some relief,

669
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:31,268
but this is as strong
as he's gonna get.

670
00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:33,604
If I don't operate now,
there might not be

671
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:36,719
- any heart muscle left to save.
- Yeah, it's time.

672
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:41,027
Let's hope he's strong enough
to survive.

673
00:32:04,127 --> 00:32:06,896
All right, the first graft
is complete.

674
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,807
This LAD is gonna be
a little tougher.

675
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:11,616
4.0 Prolene to me.

676
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:20,083
Suturing over the dissection.

677
00:32:21,144 --> 00:32:22,820
You're using both internal

678
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:25,081
mammary arteries for grafts.

679
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:27,175
Is there a risk
of recurring heart disease?

680
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:29,569
Oh, good question, Chu.

681
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:33,102
Not in a man who doesn't
actually have heart disease.

682
00:32:34,674 --> 00:32:37,093
Both anastomoses complete.

683
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:38,852
Removing the clamp.

684
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,109
Let me know when you're ready.

685
00:32:49,522 --> 00:32:52,683
I am in position.

686
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:54,852
Let's hit the reset button

687
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:57,947
on the good pastor's
new and improved heart.

688
00:32:58,031 --> 00:32:59,706
Starting with five joules.

689
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:07,172
Going up to ten.

690
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:18,725
Take it to 20.

691
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:32,906
Come on.

692
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:44,827
I'm placing the electrode.

693
00:33:44,911 --> 00:33:47,647
Now, there are no pain receptors
in the brain,

694
00:33:47,731 --> 00:33:49,424
so this won't hurt.

695
00:33:49,508 --> 00:33:50,840
That's ironic.

696
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:53,928
Advancing the electrode.

697
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:56,672
60 millimeters.

698
00:33:56,756 --> 00:34:00,183
78 millimeters.

699
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:06,332
We're at the target region.

700
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:08,017
Dr. Malco?

701
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:09,110
Pass it over to me.

702
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:13,022
For what it's worth,
I feel no different.

703
00:34:13,106 --> 00:34:15,191
I...

704
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:16,692
maybe feel worse, even.

705
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:18,194
Perhaps because now

706
00:34:18,278 --> 00:34:20,771
my head is screwed
into a metal frame.

707
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:23,273
We haven't turned it on
yet, Eliza.

708
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:26,628
- That's what I'm about to do.
- Oh.

709
00:34:26,712 --> 00:34:29,355
Two volts.

710
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:32,967
Eliza, rate your mood
on a scale of zero to ten.

711
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:34,302
Unchanged.

712
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:37,530
Zero.

713
00:34:37,614 --> 00:34:41,291
Adjusting to four volts.

714
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:44,185
And now?

715
00:34:46,547 --> 00:34:48,231
Nothing.

716
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:54,601
Six volts.

717
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,282
Eliza, how about now?

718
00:34:58,726 --> 00:35:01,786
Eliza, are you okay?

719
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:06,040
I'm...

720
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:08,853
- I'm...
- Eliza, if we

721
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:11,460
- went too far we can turn it back down.
- No.

722
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:14,017
No. Don't-don't-don't
turn it back down.

723
00:35:14,102 --> 00:35:15,318
Don't-don't...

724
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,644
Don't do anything.

725
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:20,515
Tell us how you feel, Eliza.

726
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,666
I feel calm?

727
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,186
Everything...

728
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,313
everything seems... brighter.

729
00:35:32,352 --> 00:35:34,921
Is...?

730
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:38,158
Could this be...

731
00:35:38,243 --> 00:35:40,943
Could this be happiness?

732
00:35:52,936 --> 00:35:55,389
Well, against all odds,
Aaron's alive

733
00:35:55,692 --> 00:35:57,774
with plenty more sermons
to give.

734
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,628
Yeah, well,
it's a flawed victory.

735
00:35:59,712 --> 00:36:01,611
His heart
is permanently damaged,

736
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:03,539
and he'll spend the rest
of his life exhausted.

737
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:07,284
All because of unnecessary tests
and useless procedures

738
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:08,953
that were detrimental
to his health.

739
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:11,547
You know, I talked to Bell, now
that he's on the medical board.

740
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:15,109
Ah, let me guess.
The system is so broken,

741
00:36:15,193 --> 00:36:17,111
Pellington won't face
any ramifications.

742
00:36:17,195 --> 00:36:18,594
Bingo.

743
00:36:20,048 --> 00:36:22,466
There's literally
nothing we can do.

744
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,135
Maybe not, but there
is always karma.

745
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:26,712
So we'd like to think.

746
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:30,399

747
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:32,460

00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:03,222
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, Nic has just...

760
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:06,351
Nic has just been on my mind.

761
00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:09,513
And...

762
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:11,423
and what we do,

763
00:37:11,507 --> 00:37:13,609
just...

764
00:37:13,693 --> 00:37:17,095
watching people slide
to the very edge

765
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:20,114
while we fight to save them.

766
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:23,276
Yeah.

767
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:27,899
Yeah, like
we're surrounded by loss.

768
00:37:28,203 --> 00:37:30,626
Past, present, the future.

769
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,628
Ours, other people's.

770
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,193
Look, man, I'm preparing

771
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:41,286
for my mother's passing.

772
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,532
And when she does, I...

773
00:37:44,616 --> 00:37:46,309
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

774
00:37:46,393 --> 00:37:49,602
I know I'll never know
another like her.

775
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:52,622
No.

776
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:56,818
There are some holes
you just can't fill.

777
00:37:57,629 --> 00:37:58,811
Yeah.

778
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:02,883
<i>♪ I know there's gonna be
some brighter ♪</i>

779
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:05,143
<i>♪ Days. ♪</i>

780
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:11,575
Go ahead, ask.

781
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:13,334
How are you feeling?

782
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:16,243
Good.

783
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,899
Weird. Um, hopeful.

784
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:21,418
Scared. Bionic.

785
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:24,003
I feel like I'm at one
of those all-you-can-eat

786
00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:27,252
buffet restaurants,
only it's for emotions.

787
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,583
Sounds dizzying,

788
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:33,293
but an improvement.

789
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:36,926
Dr. Malco has a few options for
psychiatric treatment centers,

790
00:38:37,018 --> 00:38:38,863
and they all accept
your insurance,

791
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:40,728
and they're gonna
take you right away.

792
00:38:40,994 --> 00:38:42,590
You'll come back
and see me in two weeks,

793
00:38:42,674 --> 00:38:45,366
and I'll adjust your stim level
if necessary.

794
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:49,263
Okay.

795
00:38:49,347 --> 00:38:51,622
Uh, thank you...

796
00:38:52,775 --> 00:38:54,792
...for not letting me go.

797
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,587
Of course.

798
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:11,042
Days like this,
I love being a doctor.

799
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:13,769
Best job in the world.

800
00:39:21,395 --> 00:39:23,147
Bell.

801
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:25,574
Bell, Bell, Bell.

802
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:28,152
You know, I thought
I had the deepest,

803
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:29,745
highest-octane reservoir

804
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:33,641
of ego, but, brother,
your vanity makes mine blush.

805
00:39:33,725 --> 00:39:36,143
Randolph, you are my friend,

806
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:38,587
but it's a good thing
you don't have cancer

807
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:40,481
because you are not
a good enough friend

808
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,525
for me to shave off this.
I mean, this is like a silken

809
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,486
- masterpiece up here.
- That it is, it is. - Ooh.

810
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,136
So...

811
00:39:48,163 --> 00:39:50,139
What do you say?

812
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:53,844
Okay, I will take this...

813
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:55,938
walking stick,

814
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:57,773
but not because
I'm old or infirm,

815
00:39:57,857 --> 00:40:00,109
but because it's really cool.

816
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:04,779
- Thanks, guys.
- You got it.

817
00:40:24,366 --> 00:40:26,217
Well, you look good.

818
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,305
You okay?

819
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:31,456
I am.

820
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,182
I'm good.

821
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:46,821
So, what's going on?

822
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:49,657
Okay, first...

823
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:53,645
I'm not sure
I want to be a doctor.

824
00:40:53,729 --> 00:40:57,415
I went into it
for the wrong reasons.

825
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,626
Why did you go into it?

826
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,919
I wanted to be the person
I thought you'd love enough

827
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:11,347
to wish you'd kept me.

828
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:14,241
Now I realize you were a child.

829
00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:16,334
That's why you couldn't keep me.

830
00:41:16,418 --> 00:41:19,228
I know we both suffered.

831
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:25,977
Right now
it feels like being a doctor

832
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:27,895
won't give me what it gives you.

833
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:33,110
The good news is, being an M.D.

834
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:36,096
opens up a lot of opportunities.

835
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,523
Yeah. I...

836
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:41,920
got a job in
research and development

837
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:43,708
at a bio tech start-up.

838
00:41:44,122 --> 00:41:46,031
Drug chemistry, my sweet spot.

839
00:41:46,552 --> 00:41:48,755
But I'm gonna do it,
you know, by the rules.

840
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,295
Try to make a difference.

841
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,306
I don't know.
We'll see what happens.

842
00:41:57,718 --> 00:41:59,727
I'm happy for you, Trevor.

843
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:04,190
And I'm very proud.

844
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:07,218
Yeah, since Porter,

845
00:42:07,302 --> 00:42:09,463
since giving you away, I...

846
00:42:09,638 --> 00:42:12,120
It had been inconceivable to me

847
00:42:12,205 --> 00:42:15,206
that I could ever feel maternal
towards anyone.

848
00:42:16,145 --> 00:42:18,120
I never wanted kids.

849
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,233
But you forced me to meet you,

850
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:23,896
and what had been inconceivable
happened.

851
00:42:24,326 --> 00:42:26,967
Something opened up in me.
No, these last couple

852
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:29,921
of weeks, when I didn't know
where you were,

853
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,015
what you were doing...

854
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,575
I was beside myself with worry.

855
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:39,858
Which I suspect means
I was feeling a little bit

856
00:42:39,943 --> 00:42:41,901
like a real mother.

857
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:51,051
You are my son.

858
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,928
Nothing can ever change that.

859
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:56,891
And I love you.
