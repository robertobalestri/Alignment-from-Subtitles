Browner? The neurosurgeon?

He's a specialist
in skull-based tumors.

44

00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,734
101.4.

174
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:33,753
Could be the drugs you took,

175
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:36,163
but have you been having
any fevers at home?

176
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,831
Any cough or cold?

177
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,018
Mm-mmm.

178
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,747
Anyone ever tell you
you have a heart murmur?

179
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:46,607
No. Why are you asking?

180
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,348
Page Raptor.
We need an echo.

181
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,826
There's a lot
she's not telling us.

182
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:11,290
We just heard.
How is he?

183
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,885
Still profoundly altered.

184
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,294
Bradycardic, hypotensive.

185
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:17,113
Well, a nurse told us
he might have been assaulted.

186
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:17,947
Was there head trauma?

187
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,465
Bruising and lacerations,

188
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,041
but I'm reserving judgment

189
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,543
until that CT comes up.

190
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,620
If he was assaulted
in our hospital,

191
00:09:24,622 --> 00:09:26,064
I have to call the police.

192
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,857
Scans are coming up now.

193
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,460
Well, that's a normal
head CT.

194
00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:33,296
No evidence of stroke
or bleed.

195
00:09:33,298 --> 00:09:36,148
Which rules out brain injury
as the primary issue.

196
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,725
I don't think he was assaulted.

197
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:41,153
Look at his lungs.

198
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:44,473
-Bilateral infiltrates.
You know, he could have
aspirated when he was down,

199
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:46,250
and that would explain
the hypoxemia.

200
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,962
He might have, but that wouldn't
explain the seizure.

201
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,091
I just don't know.

202
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:00,823
Let's review the differential.

203
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:02,491
We ruled out brain bleed.

204
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,102
And stroke.
-What about an arrhythmia?

205
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,995
Maybe it made him pass out
and hit his head.

206
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:07,997
It's possible,
but his EKG was normal.

207
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,108
Nothing strange on telemetry.

208
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,500
Are his labs back?

209
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:14,612
Uh, his potassium and magnesium
are okay.

210
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,763
His urine tox was negative,

211
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:18,691
but his lactate is sky-high.

212
00:10:18,693 --> 00:10:20,025
He's got profound
metabolic acidosis.

213
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:22,194
No, he's septic?
That makes no sense.

214
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:24,938
White count's normal, his
abdominal scan was benign.

215
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,106
No, it doesn't read
like an infection.

216
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:27,583
Must be something else.

217
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:30,628
Look at his watch.

218
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,131
His dad gave it to him,

219
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,708
but it was silver
and now it's black.

220
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,969
-It's tarnished.

221
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,263
It's blood.

222
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,558
A tarnished watch.

223
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,036
Frothy, blood-tinged secretions.

224
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:49,981
It's a chemical reaction.
His airways are involved.

225
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,633
And whatever it is crossed
the blood-brain barrier.

226
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:53,967
That's why he seized.

227
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,228
And if it's in his airway,
chances are...

228
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,382
It's a gas.
But which one?

229
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:02,476
-Carbon monoxide doesn't fit.
-Yeah, but hydrogen sulfide
would.

230
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:06,389
Okay. Yes, that's a possibility.
We'll keep him on oxygen,

231
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:09,358
bolus fluids and give him the
antidotes to hydrogen sulfide.

232
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,127
Leela.

233
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:15,673
We're getting there.

234
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:24,164
Something poisoned him
at Chastain.

235
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,332
If it was hydrogen sulfide,

236
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,926
then there is an imminent threat

237
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:29,187
-to patients and staff.
-Yeah, I know, I agree.

238
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:33,006
You stay, and I'll cover for you
with Browner and the board.

239
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:34,083
Are you sure?

240
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:38,029
I know all about
wooing arrogant doctors.

241
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,089
I won't blow it.

242
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:42,158
Thanks.

243
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:48,188
So I see you've had an
aortic valve replacement.

244
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:51,767
Your scar here in the
ultrasound tells the tale.

245
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:53,786
-What does that mean?
-Well, it means

246
00:11:53,788 --> 00:11:55,955
your friend needed surgery
to replace the valve

247
00:11:55,957 --> 00:11:58,549
that allows the blood
to exit the heart.

248
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:04,555
Sophomore year.

249
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,615
I thought I had the flu.

250
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:08,451
I... I'd been partying.

251
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:10,061
A lot.

252
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,980
And I collapsed in my dorm.

253
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:15,716
When I woke up in the hospital,

254
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:18,194
they told me I had
an infection in my heart.

255
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,647
Well, now the new valve
is infected,

256
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:22,965
which is why you have a fever.

257
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,301
And I'm guessing the source is

258
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:28,153
recent IV drug use.

259
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:31,249
You told me no more dope.

260
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,992
Junkie broke a promise.

261
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:35,169
I'm shocked.

262
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:38,756
I'm gonna go check on Devon.

263
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:45,930
My head's pounding.
Can we move on?

264
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,267
Sure.
You see that bright spot

265
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,676
on your heart?

266
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:52,177
It's called vegetation.

267
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:55,848
It means there's a mess
of germs and clot on your valve.

268
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,426
And these infections travel fast
in the bloodstream.

269
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,186
And given that you have
a headache,

270
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:04,782
my guess is your heart
is not the only thing in danger.

271
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,702
So I'm going to page
a neuro consult.

272
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,735
How's he doing?

273
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:18,713
He's on oxygen and fluids.

274
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,191
We gave him
the potential antidotes.

275
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:24,218
Fingers crossed they work.

276
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:34,812
He's waking up.

277
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,314
Devon?

278
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,107
Can you hear me?

279
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,696
Can you hear me?

280
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:05,992
W-Where am I?

281
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:07,994
Oh, my God.

282
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:09,996
You're at Chastain.

283
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:12,725
You're okay.
You're gonna be fine.

284
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:16,095
Did I almost die?

285
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:18,689
Definitely almost died.

286
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,007
Welcome back, brother.

287
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:22,434
How do you feel?

288
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:25,437
Like I drank a bottle of gin.

289
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:27,347
Three bottles.

290
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:32,078
-It really, really hurts
to breathe.

291
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:36,690
I got to go.

292
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,692
You scared us.

293
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:40,795
Hang in there.

294
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,956
What happened?

295
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,842
Do you remember anything
from yesterday?

296
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,054
Nothing.

297
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:53,616
That's okay.

298
00:14:53,618 --> 00:14:55,467
It'll come to you.

299
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:57,395
-Okay.

300
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,622
Just take it easy.

301
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,978
We'll figure it out.

302
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,963
Get some rest.

303
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:11,016
If your breathing gets worse,
you tell me right away.

304
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:12,484
He can tell me.

305
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:13,744
I'm not leaving his side

306
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,654
until he walks
out of this hospital.

307
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:17,790
Probably not after that, either.

308
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:34,557
You called a neuro consult?

309
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:36,492
Yeah.

310
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:38,769
Yeah, the patient
is Janey Moore.

311
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,690
Prosthetic aortic valve
endocarditis with headache.

312
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,609
Excuse me.

313
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,931
Any trouble with your eyesight?

314
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,024
Double vision?

315
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:54,009
If I study all night.

316
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:55,661
Follow my finger.

317
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:01,700
Tell me about the headache.

318
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,519
Just a migraine, I think.

319
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:06,780
-No big.
-You've had one every day
this past week.

320
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:12,361
Exam suggests

321
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:13,954
a possible sixth nerve palsy.

322
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:15,714
She'll need a CT angiogram
of her head and neck

323
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:16,957
to rule out stroke, aneurysm

324
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,143
or abscess
related to the infection.

325
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:22,646
Ms. Moore,
I'll see you in imaging.

326
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:32,214
Oh.

327
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:34,216
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey. Hey.

328
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:35,826
Is she gonna be okay?

329
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,811
-I'll need to see her scans.
-Okay.

330
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:38,829
But do you think
there's something wrong

331
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,331
-with her brain?
-I don't know.

332
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,592
I mean, she's a junkie,
so there's that.

333
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:47,838
-What, is she your girlfriend?
-Not really.

334
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,231
Well, if I were you,
I'd count my blessings

335
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:51,008
-and move on.
-Oh, well, you don't know her.

336
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,235
And I'm not taking
romantic advice from you.

337
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:55,012
For obvious reasons.

338
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,680
You don't know
what you're talking about.

339
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,923
Oh. Well, you got that right.

340
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,742
Because I don't know
where I come from.

341
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:00,926
I don't know
why I am the way that I am.

342
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:02,761
I thought
maybe you could explain

343
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:05,005
-given the fact that you're...
-Excuse me.

344
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:07,233
Bro, you want to...
you want to explain this?

345
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:11,529
Oh.

346
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,682
-Yeah, right.
-Wait a minute. Hold on.

347
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:17,493
Where you going, bro?

348
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:21,780
It's, uh, it's an entactogen.

349
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:25,209
A dopamine agonist that bonds
to the serotonin receptors

350
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,712
but with zero effect
on the GABA receptors.

351
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,198
So it's a schematic for a drug

352
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,792
that you created?

353
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:35,944
Yeah. It's recreational.

354
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:37,296
For parties.

355
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:39,782
You know, emotional connection.

356
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:41,875
Bring people
out of their shells.

357
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:43,877
And if I'd known she was using,

358
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:45,804
I would've synthesized
a Suboxone equivalent,

359
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:48,807
-given her that instead.
-Hang on, how do you know
how to do all this?

360
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:50,959
I'm a medicinal chemistry major.

361
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:54,630
I formulated the drug
so she wouldn't get too high.

362
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:56,131
It's totally safe.

363
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:57,983
You can clutch your pearls,
act all outraged.

364
00:17:57,985 --> 00:17:59,893
Whatever. I don't care.

365
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:01,820
The only reason
I was cooking that stuff

366
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:03,063
was to keep her happy
and off dope.

367
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,898
You think it matters
if your motivation

368
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,825
is to keep your dream girl
off heroin?

369
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:09,144
You're a drug dealer.
That's just the truth.

370
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:10,662
I don't sell drugs.

371
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:13,406
-I'm a chemist.
I create them for fun.

372
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:14,758
What I made

373
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,759
didn't put Janey
in the hospital,

374
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,153
because my science works.

375
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:20,080
Now, I'm fully prepared

376
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:22,749
to accept the consequences
of my actions.

377
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:24,159
-Can you say that
about yourself?
Oh,

378
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:26,328
you are not as clever
as you think you are.

379
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,163
-Oh, did I ask for your opinion?
-And you sure as hell
haven't earned

380
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:30,165
-the moral high ground.
-What gives you the right
to talk

381
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,000
-about a moral high ground
while you...
Hey, hey.

382
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:34,686
This is not the place,
all right?

383
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:36,763
-Uh...

384
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:40,509
Trevor, why don't you go
in the waiting area

385
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,120
and just give us a few minutes,
all right?

386
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:49,460
I'm calling the police.

387
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,961
Do it.

388
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,446
You know, if I wasn't
a semi-observant Buddhist,

389
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:55,966
I'd punch him in the throat
myself.

390
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,527
But it occurs to me

391
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:00,045
that if someone
called the cops on me

392
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:03,623
every time I deserved it,
I wouldn't be standing here.

393
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,793
Triple Board-certified all-star.

394
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:09,647
Now, clearly,
you two know each other.

395
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:13,525
Want to tell me what the deal is
between you two?

396
00:19:15,562 --> 00:19:17,212
No, I don't.

397
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:19,882
What I want is to run the scans
on Janey's head

398
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:21,533
and be done with both of them.

399
00:19:27,224 --> 00:19:28,832
Does Devon's recovery

400
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,834
mean he was poisoned
by hydrogen sulfide?

401
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,003
Unclear.
But seems most likely.

402
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,007
Hydrogen sulfide
mostly comes out of septic tanks

403
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,084
and manure pits.

404
00:19:39,086 --> 00:19:40,827
Devon didn't leave Chastain
yesterday.

405
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:42,346
That means whatever he got
in his lungs--

406
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,330
hydrogen sulfide
or something else--

407
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,741
he inhaled inside the hospital.

408
00:19:45,743 --> 00:19:48,018
Well, if there's a poisonous
gas leak in the hospital,

409
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,429
it could be devastating.
People could die.

410
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:52,431
We may have to evacuate.

411
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:53,765
Agreed.

412
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,435
But no one else is sick yet.

413
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:57,861
If we retrace Devon's steps,

414
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,271
account for every second
of the day,

415
00:19:59,273 --> 00:20:02,199
there's a decent chance
we'll run into the source.

416
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,276
I'll talk to security.

417
00:20:04,278 --> 00:20:05,928
I'll check with the nurses.

418
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,431
We have to figure this out.
Fast.

419
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:13,936
Hey, Bailey, what time did
Dr. Pravesh badge in yesterday?

420
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:17,047
Start of his shift.
7:00 a.m.

421
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,791
And he never badged out?

422
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:22,535
Nope.
Here all day.

423
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:24,888
-Thank you.
How many patients</i>

424
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,224
-did he see?
-Yesterday in the ER?

425
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,875
There were too many to count.

426
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:30,802
Well,
any out of the ordinary cases?

427
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:32,396
-Toxins? Poisonings?
-No.

428
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,380
-I'd remember that.
Does he show up</i>

429
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:36,216
on any of the CCTVs
outside the ER?

430
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:38,143
-Getting onto the elevator?
-We don't have cameras

431
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:40,571
in the elevators, and all
of our other CCTVs went down

432
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,407
-because
of the ransomware attack.
So Devon was in the ER</i>

433
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,468
-all night?
-Yep. Well, all of my time.

434
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,136
-What do you mean?
-I had a half shift.

435
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:52,207
Uh, Shelly, the night nurse--
she finished up.

436
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,812
</i>
<i> Hi, Shelly.</i>
<i> It's Kit Voss from Chastain.</i>

437
00:20:56,814 --> 00:20:59,331
I'm so sorry to wake you,
but we're trying to track down

438
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,833
Dr. Pravesh's movements
in the hospital last night.

439
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:05,220
Did you ever see him
leave the ER?

440
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,824
Do you remember
the name of the patient

441
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:11,326
he went to check on?

442
00:21:11,328 --> 00:21:14,271
Winston Robards.
Fractured wrist.

443
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,939
Devon sent him for X-rays.

444
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,257
And a cast?

445
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:21,094
-Casting room.
-Thanks, Shelly.
You're an angel.

446
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:25,199
♪

447
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:32,224
Andrew!

448
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,686
Grab the wheelchair.

449
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,028
One, two, three.

450
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:48,924
I'm gonna take him to the ER.
Call Kit Voss,

451
00:22:48,926 --> 00:22:50,592
tell her
to seal off the basement.

452
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:52,995
I'll notify hazmat.

453
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:02,362
No, I know Dr. Voss was sorry
she couldn't be here.

454
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,122
-Something serious came up.
-Honestly,

455
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:05,883
it's a chance to meet
the famous Dr. Bell,

456
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,292
so, uh, no worries.

457
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:10,445
You know, I-I'm-I'm gonna
spare you the small talk.

458
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:13,039
Chastain is a fabulous hospital.

459
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,799
It's full of smart,
hardworking doctors,

460
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,084
and yeah,

461
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:17,561
we're a public hospital,
so no, you won't make

462
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,803
as much money as you're used to.

463
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:21,289
But, you know, I look at that

464
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,474
as a chance to give back.

465
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:25,402
To our community,
to our young residents. And,

466
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,813
you know, and at this point
in my career, it...

467
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:31,724
This feels
like the right thing to do.

468
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:33,059
So come to Chastain.

469
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:35,579
You'll never be sorry you did.

470
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,207
Done.

471
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,648
That was considerably easier
than I expected.

472
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,408
Dr. Voss will be overjoyed.

473
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,427
You mind
if I just make a few calls

474
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,597
-just to do my due diligence?
-Would expect nothing less.

475
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,824
Uh, I'll text you
some phone numbers.

476
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:58,143
Great.

477
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:00,604
Janey's scans are up.

478
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,181
What you got?

479
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:05,350
Mycotic aneurysm.

480
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:07,093
The bacteria
from her heart valve

481
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,187
-lodged
in her anterior cerebral artery.
Well,

482
00:24:09,189 --> 00:24:10,855
-that explains the vision issues
and the migraines.
-Mm-hmm.

483
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:12,023
And she has a sentinel bleed.

484
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,951
The aneurysm
has started to leak.

485
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,527
So you'll repair it?

486
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,103
Sure.

487
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,347
But not until we make a decision
on replacing her heart valve.

488
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:22,125
Until<i> you</i> make a decision.

489
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,776
Look, I know some surgeons

490
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:25,462
who would refuse
a valve replacement

491
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,688
on a drug user.

492
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,799
Some of my mentors, even.

493
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,026
But I say, look, if she's
strong enough for surgery,

494
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:33,528
this might be
the second chance she needs.

495
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,697
Third chance, actually.

496
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:38,717
She was born healthy, used,

497
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:41,036
got repaired, then used again.

498
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:42,962
And we have proof.

499
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:46,725
Her urine tox screen
came back positive for opiates.

500
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:48,727
-She's a chronic user.
-Great.

501
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:50,803
I recommend
clipping the aneurysm,

502
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:52,138
continue antibiotics

503
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,065
and hold off on the
valve surgery until she's logged

504
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:56,142
-some sober hours.
-Which could kill her

505
00:24:56,144 --> 00:24:59,571
-before she has a chance
to recover.
-Whoa, hold up.

506
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:02,682
You get to decide
whether she lives or dies?

507
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:06,228
-You cannot be a part
of this discussion.
-What?

508
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,063
Who made you God?

509
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:10,507
Because that's what you're doing
right now. You're playing God.

510
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,567
Am I missing something?
You're not the patient

511
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:15,403
and you're not family.
Go sit in the waiting room.

512
00:25:15,405 --> 00:25:16,738
Oh, I am not leaving.

513
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,348
And you're missing
everything, dude.

514
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,183
All you see
are these lab results.

515
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,019
You don't even know her.
Janey,

516
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,521
who's literally
the best person I know.

517
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,339
I'll call security.

518
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:27,749
Hold up, Irving.

519
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:29,175
Listen to me, dude.

520
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:32,362
It's not as simple
as her being a good person.

521
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,348
All right?
If I replace Janey's valve,

522
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,867
her recovery's gonna be tough.

523
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,928
Not just physically
but mentally.

524
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,264
She's got to stay clean.

525
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:43,932
That valve gets infected,

526
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:46,692
she won't live long enough
to get another one.

527
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:49,212
Without rock-solid support,

528
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,031
even my masterful
surgical skills

529
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:53,958
are useless.

530
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,628
Then I'll make sure
she stays clean.

531
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,129
No, she already
had you fooled once.

532
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:00,799
What makes you think
she can't spin your head again?

533
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:02,559
This is not about her,

534
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,020
Dr. Sutton.

535
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,125
I never abandon
the people who need me.

536
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:12,486
Never.

537
00:26:13,964 --> 00:26:16,481
Bay 2, Doctors.

538
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:19,818
Janey is hypotensive.
She's crashing.

539
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,821
Her pulse pressure
wasn't this wide before.

540
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:26,732
I'm hearing crackles
half the way up.

541
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:28,868
Fluid is backing up
into her lungs.

542
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:31,421
I see a new paravalvular leak.

543
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,998
-This valve is shot.
-I can still repair
the aneurysm,

544
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,926
but we all know
that won't save her life.

545
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,094
What's the call,

546
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,170
Dr. Austin?
You fixing her valve or not?

547
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:41,598
It's not up to me to decide
how many chances

548
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,675
a person gets.
Brain first,

549
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:45,677
then heart.
Let's book an OR.

550
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,663
I'll start prep.
I'll get transpo.

551
00:26:48,665 --> 00:26:50,665
I-Is she gonna be okay?

552
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:51,924
No guarantees.

553
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:53,276
They need to get her to prep.

554
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,760
That's gonna take a minute.

555
00:26:54,762 --> 00:26:58,198
Meanwhile,
let's you and I have a talk.

556
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,701
Follow. Now.

557
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,697
Get him on 100% O2.
Bolus a liter

558
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:07,773
and give him what we
gave Devon-- sodium nitrate

559
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:09,701
and hydroxocobalamin.

560
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:13,130
It might be too late to work,
but it's worth a try.

561
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,966
Confirmed it was
hydrogen sulfide.

562
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,860
Rotten egg smell
all over the casting room.

563
00:27:18,862 --> 00:27:20,044
I called hazmat response.

564
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:22,530
The basement's being sealed off.

565
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:25,033
Do we know
how long he was exposed?

566
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:26,643
Since last night.

567
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,961
Best hope is the exposure
was low-level.

568
00:27:28,963 --> 00:27:30,963
Someone vented
the room he was in,

569
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,540
so it's possible
he got a small dose.

570
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,526
Well, here's hoping.

571
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:39,397
Look, if this is gonna be
a lecture on addiction,

572
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:41,232
spare me, okay?
I know it's a disease...

573
00:27:41,234 --> 00:27:43,902
A disease that you can't cure
no matter what drug you make.

574
00:27:43,904 --> 00:27:45,904
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Seriously, man, uh,

575
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:48,999
there's nothing you can tell me
I don't already know.

576
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,627
Are you gonna
fix her heart or not?

577
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:55,255
Of course.

578
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:58,566
Okay.

579
00:27:58,568 --> 00:28:00,010
Great.

580
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:03,663
And you won't let Dr. Sutton
talk you out of it?

581
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:06,850
What's your beef
with Dr. Sutton, huh?

582
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,227
Home come
you keep coming at her?

583
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,360
She's my mother.

584
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,696
That's why.

585
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,364
She gave birth to me

586
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,609
and then wanted
nothing to do with me.

587
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:28,521
So, if it seems
like I'm coming at her,

588
00:28:28,523 --> 00:28:31,499
there's your reason.

589
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:37,505
Okay. Um...

590
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:39,883
Look, there's a, uh,

591
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,794
a surgery waiting room
on the fifth floor.

592
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:45,538
All right?
You go there.

593
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,225
And I'll call you

594
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,810
when the surgery's over.

595
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,069
You must have been quite young
when you had him.

596
00:29:17,831 --> 00:29:20,498
I should have
figured it out myself.

597
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,260
Watching you and Trevor go at it

598
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,429
is like watching someone fight
with themselves in the mirror.

599
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,932
I don't want to talk about it.
I told you that.

600
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,676
And I heard you.
But we're going to be operating

601
00:29:31,678 --> 00:29:33,919
on your son's friend.

602
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:36,088
I know you've had
a complicated day today,

603
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,441
and I want to respect that,
but I must

604
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,336
point out the elephant
in the room and ask...

605
00:29:41,338 --> 00:29:43,780
I'll be able to do my job?

606
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,104
Well?

607
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:56,584
If you want to know,
I was 13 years old.

608
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,878
-Hey.
Hey.

609
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,881
Winston's recovering.
He's awake.

610
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:11,624
Lucid.

611
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:13,718
He breathed in a small dose.

612
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,961
That's a huge relief.

613
00:30:15,963 --> 00:30:19,298
It's good to hear your voice,
Dr. Pravesh.

614
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,985
Dr. Hawkins says
you don't remember yesterday.

615
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,395
I don't.

616
00:30:24,397 --> 00:30:27,991
But I thought
if I saw your face, I would.

617
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,218
Maybe if you just listen
to my voice.

618
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,236
I've been blind my whole life,

619
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:35,206
so that's how I remember people.

620
00:30:38,562 --> 00:30:40,670
Your voice.

621
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,674
Your father's remedy
for everything

622
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,659
is to rub dirt on it.

623
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:50,096
I thought that was hilarious.

624
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:54,500
<i> I sent you to get a cast.</i>

625
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:56,001
<i> You didn't come back.</i>

626
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:58,763
<i> So I went down</i>
<i> to the casting room</i>

627
00:30:58,765 --> 00:31:00,857
<i>because I thought you were lost.</i>

628
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,609
Hello?

629
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,153
Hello?

630
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,269
<i>Then you were out on the floor.</i>

631
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:23,104
<i> I could smell the gas.</i>

632
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:26,216
Hey, can I get
some help in here?!

633
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,224
<i> -I vented the room.</i>

634
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:38,228
I tried to drag you, but I got

635
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,140
<i> very dizzy. I-I just, like...</i>
<i> I remember I couldn't breathe.</i>

636
00:31:42,142 --> 00:31:45,718
<i> I thought if I could get</i>
<i>to the elevator, get to the ER,</i>

637
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,404
<i> I could call for help.</i>

638
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,731
<i> Then everything went black.</i>

639
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:28,778
You turned on the vent.

640
00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:33,616
That cleared out the worst
of the hydrogen sulfide.

641
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,601
Winston had limited exposure.

642
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:37,579
That saved his life.

643
00:32:38,515 --> 00:32:41,207
You saved his life.

644
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:43,626
Thank you.

645
00:32:55,381 --> 00:32:57,807
Okay. First brain,

646
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,703
then heart. That way,
we get in and out safely.

647
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:03,963
You okay with that, Sutton?

648
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,890
You don't need to worry
about my focus.

649
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:08,559
Regardless of what's going on
outside of this room.

650
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:09,969
Good to know.

651
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:13,698
Okay, removing the skull cup.

652
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,660
Opening the dura.

653
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:21,998
Working my way down
through the fissure.

654
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,392
Cannulating the femoral artery.

655
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:25,910
Okay, I see the aneurysm.

656
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:29,154
Just need to establish control
around the blood flow.

657
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:31,508
Clip applier to me.

658
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:36,829
-Damn it.

659
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:38,998
The aneurysm ruptured.
I need your hands. Get up here.

660
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,242
All right. What do you need?
Consider me

661
00:33:41,244 --> 00:33:44,562
-your assistant.
I need you
to suction the field. Now.

662
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,008
Come on.

663
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,012
Sutton, I watched you operate
on my mother.

664
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:54,656
You got this.

665
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:05,767
All right. Bleeding stopped.

666
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:07,935
I think I've got control.

667
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:10,938
-Straight clip, please.
Great work.

668
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,640
What'd you do?

669
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:14,199
Not sure.

670
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:16,043
Sometimes you get lucky.

671
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:18,780
-Or else...

672
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:21,057
We didn't actually fix it.

673
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,875
Her heart is failing.
She doesn't have

674
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:24,543
enough blood pressure
to bleed from the aneurysm.

675
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:27,730
-Chu, how we doing?
Not good, team.
Maxing my pressors.

676
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,124
It's the valve. It's blown.

677
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:31,459
Wide-open regurge.

678
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:32,794
I'm gonna have to crack
her chest open,

679
00:34:32,796 --> 00:34:34,237
put her on bypass
before we lose her.

680
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,116
And this time, Sutton,
I'm gonna need you to help me.

681
00:34:42,822 --> 00:34:45,081
</i>
<i> Browner raked in the money</i>

00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:31,794
He threw a cell phone at a PA.
Broke the guy's nose.

699
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,796
<i> He's a walking court order.</i>

700
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,281
Every doctor I spoke to
at St. Paul's

701
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:37,783
gave him glowing reviews.

702
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:38,951
They're trying
to unload him on you

703
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:40,194
to get him off their payroll.

704
00:35:40,196 --> 00:35:41,696
Classic pump and dump.

705
00:35:41,698 --> 00:35:43,789
<i> He's costing them a fortune.</i>

706
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,225
I have one word for you.
Run.

707
00:35:47,294 --> 00:35:48,978
Thanks.

708
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,799
All right, I'm inside the aorta.

709
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:57,061
This valve is totally destroyed.

710
00:35:57,063 --> 00:35:59,138
Leaflets this thick
and inflamed,

711
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,716
patient's been sitting
on this infection for a while.

712
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:02,825
And yet she was determined

713
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,976
to keep it
from those around her.

714
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:06,145
Even as her heart
started to fail.

715
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:08,998
Some secrets need to be kept.

716
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,834
But they can corrode
nonetheless.

717
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,129
Hold my valve for me.

718
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,327
What made you decide
to give her the valve?

719
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:24,088
I'd always intended to

720
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,740
if it became necessary.

721
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:27,742
People make mistakes, right?

722
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:29,760
And like Trevor said,

723
00:36:29,762 --> 00:36:32,671
no one should get to play God.

724
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:35,525
Not even surgeons.

725
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:40,679
In my OR,
there is no room for judgment.

726
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:43,090
Not for Janey.

727
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:45,159
Not for anyone.

728
00:36:51,434 --> 00:36:53,358
Well, you were right.

729
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,618
Fits perfectly.

730
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,863
Now, listen,
when we leave this OR,

731
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:02,093
you don't have to see Janey
or Trevor ever again.

732
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:05,555
I'll handle the post-ops.

733
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,965
And I won't say a word.

734
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:10,226
To anyone.

735
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,114
Dr. Voss.

736
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,391
It was hydrogen sulfide gas.

737
00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:28,911
How the hell did that get
into Chastain?

738
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,806
The hazmat team says it's
happened in hospitals before.

739
00:37:31,808 --> 00:37:33,249
Techs dump plaster of paris

740
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,234
from casts down the drain.

741
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:36,902
It clogs the pipes,

742
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:39,756
so janitors
use acid-based cleaner

743
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,332
to cut through the sludge,

744
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:43,092
-and the...
-And the acid, um...

745
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,910
Mixes with the sulfate
in the plaster,

746
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:46,320
and you get hydrogen sulfide.

747
00:37:46,322 --> 00:37:47,913
Right.

748
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:50,415
And how about the patient
Conrad found?

749
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,994
-He's gonna make it.
-Oh, fantastic.

750
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:55,997
Yeah.
But for all the good we do here,

751
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:59,424
sometimes running this hospital
feels like

752
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:01,093
a Sisyphean task.

753
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:02,261
Ransomware attacks,

754
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:04,930
gas leaks. So come on,
give me some good news.

755
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:06,598
How did it go with Browner?

756
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,691
You can't hire him.

757
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:10,177
He's got a raft of problems.

758
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:11,603
HR issues, lawsuits.

759
00:38:11,605 --> 00:38:14,365
St. Paul's was just trying
to dump him on us.

760
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:17,794
-How did you find out?
-Every doctor I talked to
at St. Paul's

761
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,111
did nothing
but sing his praises.

762
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:22,540
Not a single bad word,
and it just s-seemed off,

763
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,449
so I called a friend,

764
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:27,452
and friends tell you the truth.

765
00:38:27,454 --> 00:38:29,196
Oh, bloody hell.

766
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:33,050
Well... it's disappointing,
but at least we know

767
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:36,295
the truth.
Thanks for having my back.

768
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:38,147
Yeah, l-listen, I've been...

769
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,234
I've been meaning to talk to you
about this all day.

770
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,063
Uh...

771
00:38:46,065 --> 00:38:49,917
Just wanted to apologize
for yesterday, asking you out.

772
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:52,144
We have
such a good thing together,

773
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:53,571
and I... I don't want

774
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:55,072
to mess that up
by stepping over the line,

775
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:58,835
so I promise,
it won't happen again.

776
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,086
Oh.

777
00:39:00,913 --> 00:39:02,654
Really?

778
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,732
Because I was...

779
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:07,401
I was wondering
if you would want

780
00:39:07,403 --> 00:39:09,161
to have dinner with me tonight?

781
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:10,829
Yes. Absolutely.

782
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:15,500
-I know
this great Italian place.

783
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:17,687
Open late.

784
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:22,692
Hey, it's me.

785
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,528
Just trying you again.
Call me back.

786
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,756
-Nic?
Yeah.

787
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:30,199
She's driving back from the spa.

788
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,928
I got to pick up GiGi. She had
a long day at the nursery.

789
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,746
I love my girls.

790
00:39:36,782 --> 00:39:38,523
Thought we were gonna
lose you there

791
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:40,209
for a second.
I didn't like that at all.

792
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,027
Thanks.

793
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:43,787
Me, neither.

794
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:46,173
I'm really happy you're okay.

795
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,968
See you.

796
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:55,224
-See you guys tomorrow.
Thanks, Conrad.

797
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,685
So...

798
00:39:59,472 --> 00:40:01,647
I was thinking...

799
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:06,218
Maybe we
should move in together.

800
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,796
So you can look after me?

801
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:10,722
If you're gonna keep being
a hero, somebody has to.

802
00:40:15,562 --> 00:40:17,705
I'd love that.

803
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:38,417
Surgery was a success.

804
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:40,811
She's looking good.

805
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:44,165
The recovery
is going to be a beast,

806
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:48,002
but I'll check again
in the morning.

807
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:49,428
I get it.

808
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,188
No, really.
I do.

809
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,359
The defining experience
of your life is abandonment.

810
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:57,528
I don't know
what you're talki...

811
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,205
Just shut up.

812
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:02,291
I was the same way, bro.

813
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,460
I was hurt.
I was alone.

814
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,370
I lashed out.

815
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:09,448
See, I used my words
and my intelligence

816
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,950
like a bully uses his fists.

817
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:15,120
-And it worked for a while.

818
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:16,305
I felt good.

819
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,549
But it never gave me
the one thing

820
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:20,625
that I really wanted,

821
00:41:20,627 --> 00:41:23,479
which was to belong.

822
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,559
Look, you're loyal.
You care.

823
00:41:28,561 --> 00:41:30,486
Everybody sees it.

824
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,063
But in the long run?

825
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,808
That's not going to end well,

826
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,495
and I know you know that.

827
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,831
But you don't know me,
so I'm not gonna be the one

828
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,907
to tell you
don't go down that path.

829
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:47,819
But I will tell you
that if you do,

830
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:52,591
brother, you aren't gonna
end well, either.

831
00:41:56,163 --> 00:41:58,556
See you in the morning.

832
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,782
I have to go check on a patient.

833
00:42:25,692 --> 00:42:28,860
How about I give GiGi
a big kiss?

834
00:42:28,862 --> 00:42:30,713
Oh, my gosh.

835
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,715
You ate all your food.

836
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:35,626
Let's see.

837
00:42:35,628 --> 00:42:37,278
Let's see where she is.

838
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,130
-Mommy's gonna be
so impressed with you.

839
00:42:40,132 --> 00:42:41,799
Ate all your dinner.

840
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:43,392
-Where are you going?

841
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,062
-What? I just... Oh!

842
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,547
Who's that?
Who's there?

843
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:50,808
Is it Mommy?
Yes!

844
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,128
Mommy. Mommy.
Mommy's home.

845
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,556
Let's go.
Whee!

846
00:42:57,558 --> 00:43:00,159
Let's go get Mommy.

847
00:43:06,142 --> 00:43:08,501
Conrad Hawkins?

848
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:13,255
There's been an accident.
