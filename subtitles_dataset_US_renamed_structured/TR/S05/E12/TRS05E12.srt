1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:02,630
Previously on The Resident...

2
00:00:02,655 --> 00:00:04,601
I have multiple sclerosis.

3
00:00:05,358 --> 00:00:07,732
We could always use more
women in neurosurgery,

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,419
but I would never
try to recruit you.

5
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:11,444
- Why?
- Devon would kill me, for one thing.

6
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:13,295
He'll support whatever
I choose to do.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,207
- Kit, I'm leaving Chastain.
- A leave of absence.

8
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:18,393
- Of course, to heal...
- No, permanently.

9
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:22,122
I was raped by our
neighbor. I was 13.

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,581
- He was a grown man.
- Billie...

11
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:38,335
Hey, come here.

12
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:40,248
No, I'm fine.

13
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:42,043
You're getting soaked.

14
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:45,170
I'm not gonna melt. Promise.

15
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:54,078
Hey, I need some help!

16
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:56,523
Hey. I was headed to a call

17
00:00:56,548 --> 00:00:58,802
when I found her on the
Centerville exit off of 124.

18
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:00,543
She was all by herself.

19
00:01:00,604 --> 00:01:02,640
She's limping, and
she's freezing cold.

20
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:04,475
She needs help, so I
brought her straight here.

21
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:05,752
You did the right
thing. What's your name?

22
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:07,069
She hasn't said a word

23
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:08,980
since I found her. She
hasn't cried either.

24
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:10,779
Not a sound.

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,490
I'm gonna take you inside
and get you warm, okay?

26
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,038
I'm a doctor. I won't hurt you.

27
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:20,298
I'm gonna take care
of you, I promise.

28
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,266
Don't be afraid.

29
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:34,093
My little girl made
that. Do you like it?

30
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:38,625
Okay.

31
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:44,070
-  Here we go.
- Thanks, Doc.

32
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:47,491
What happened?

33
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:49,307
Tow truck driver brought her in.

34
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:51,182
Found her alone by
the side of the road.

35
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:54,430
She is not speaking.

36
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:57,402
Clara, let's get a temp, change
her out of these clothes,

37
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:59,126
and get her on the monitor.

38
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:05,981
It's not registering.

39
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:08,430
She's hypothermic.
We need a core temp.

40
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:11,984
And some blankets
and warmed saline.

41
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,346
I'm on it.

42
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:14,512
Her right arm.

43
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:20,423
Posterior shoulder dislocation.

44
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:24,437
- No swelling around the joint.
- Let's reduce that, quick.

45
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:30,775
This will hurt, but then it
will feel much better, okay?

46
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:37,083
Not a peep.

47
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:39,367
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

48
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,390
Clara, can you call Winston?

49
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:44,039
- Tell him we have an unaccompanied minor.
- Yeah.

50
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:54,097
So, I did the math.

51
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56,242
For you to be double
board-certified

52
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:58,386
in neuro and
cardiothoracic surgery,

53
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,656
it would take you,
like, eight years.

54
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:04,343
Think about it, Devon. I could
drain a brain bleed on a Monday

55
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:07,287
and hold a beating heart
in my hands on a Tuesday.

56
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,047
Look, I love that you want to do

57
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,680
all the things,

58
00:03:12,178 --> 00:03:15,162
but I'm just concerned that
you're gonna get burned out.

59
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:17,003
There's only 24 hours in a day.

60
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,960
I'm spending two of them
standing outside in the rain

61
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:22,274
so you can buy sneakers.

62
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:24,631
Come on, the line's moving.

63
00:03:24,656 --> 00:03:26,155
You're a good woman.

64
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:29,944
Look at you all
coming out in the rain

65
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:30,819
for this drop.

66
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:32,976
From my heart, I thank you.

67
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:35,498
- Now, come and get these kicks.

68
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:40,093
Oh, damn. These black
vapor lows are fire.

69
00:03:40,118 --> 00:03:43,126
Geez. I have to have these.

70
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:46,359
Hey, Haircut. Caught your
drip the moment you walked up,

71
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:49,162
and I saw you eyeing
these.

72
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:51,859
Are you feeling all right?

73
00:03:51,884 --> 00:03:54,921
Oh, don't worry about me.
I just got "big girl-itis."

74
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:57,867
My name is Dr. Pravesh.
This is Dr. Devi.

75
00:03:58,345 --> 00:04:00,250
Seems like you're
having some chest pain.

76
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,525
Why don't we just
take a seat here.

77
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:09,000
I just need
another antacid.

78
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,510
Will you hand me my purse?

79
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:14,577
Just gonna
check your pulse.

80
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:16,947
How many of these
have you taken today?

81
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:19,742
Uh... all of them.

82
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:23,039
- Your heart is racing.
- It's just nerves, is all.

83
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:26,031
This is my big day. I have
been planning this for months.

84
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,360
We need to get
you to a hospital.

85
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:28,867
No, no, no, no,
no, ham, no, ma'am.

86
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:31,460
There is a photographer
coming from Best of Atlanta.

87
00:04:31,485 --> 00:04:33,281
I got an interview later.

88
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,345
You could be having
a heart attack.

89
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,944
No. I... No.

90
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:39,538
-  - We are not
gonna take no for an answer.

91
00:04:57,985 --> 00:04:59,334
Hey.

92
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,734
Hope you didn't
have plans later.

93
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:05,429
No problem. I
already cleared my schedule.

94
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,740
I want to hang out with
my new best friend here.

95
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,508
I'm sad to say no one's ever
mistook me for Mary Poppins.

96
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:15,093
Shoulder should
be feeling better.

97
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:17,727
Can you move your arm for me?

98
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:21,846
So, she understands what
we say. Follows direction.

99
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:23,514
That's progress.

100
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,762
Winston's here.

101
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,876
Nurse Clara's gonna
take care of you

102
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,677
while we talk to Winston, okay?

103
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,737
Be right back.

104
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,540
- Thanks for coming.
- Oh, not a problem at all.

105
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:49,828
You have an unaccompanied minor?

106
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:52,657
She was left on the side of the
road with a dislocated shoulder.

107
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:55,081
Seems like she was
running from something

108
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:56,616
or someone.

109
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:00,306
She's not talking,
so there's a lot

110
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:02,045
we don't know yet. We've
established her lack

111
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,664
of speech isn't a
lack of understanding.

112
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:05,722
Have you checked for
signs of physical abuse?

113
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:07,531
She's headed for scans shortly.

114
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:09,765
Oh, I'll contact Atlanta P.D.

115
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,687
If there's been a
missing child report,

116
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:13,257
we'll know soon.
In the meantime,

117
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:14,375
Chastain has to assume

118
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,669
an emergency temporary
guardianship.

119
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,147
Who's gonna be
taking care of her?

120
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:19,912
Dr. Sullivan, it's
your ER shift,

121
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:22,039
- so I presume... - Me.
Happy to.

122
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:26,050
She's bonded with me, so

123
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,962
I'll run point.

124
00:06:30,142 --> 00:06:32,765
It's good with me.
Takes a village, right?

125
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,468
The village of Drs. Hawkins-Sullivan.

126
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:38,178
Got it. And the child's name?

127
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:42,249
Jane Doe.

128
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,564
Good morning.

129
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:52,484
Didn't I leave you in a
warm bed blissfully asleep?

130
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,956
Yes, you did. And for
that, I thank you.

131
00:06:55,605 --> 00:06:57,601
But-but, listen, before
you get too excited,

132
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,110
I'm not here officially.

133
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,257
Just a social call.

134
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:04,949
The doctors at the Mayo said
you could return to surgery.

135
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:07,250
The steroid pulse
and immunomodulators

136
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:09,312
have been amazing at
stopping your M.S. symptoms.

137
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:12,187
I know, and I'm grateful
and I'm, and I'm hopeful

138
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:13,791
and I'm reassured,

139
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:17,532
but I'm... I'm not there yet.

140
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:20,054
If this isn't your
official return,

141
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,963
did you really come
all the way here

142
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:24,523
in the rain just to
bring me a latte?

143
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:26,614
No. There's something I wanted
to tell you. I've, um...

144
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,214
I've been shortlisted

145
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,843
for a seat at the
state medical board.

146
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:35,456
That's wonderful, Randolph.

147
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,587
They could use people like you.

148
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:40,046
Doctors policing doctors

149
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:41,750
has not worked
well for patients.

150
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:44,154
We all need to be more
accountable, and...

151
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:46,818
You know, it's been a
long career, and I've seen

152
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:48,742
mistakes happen
that shouldn't have,

153
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,494
and you know I've
made them myself.

154
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:52,473
And I'd just...

155
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,809
like to try and
make up for that.

156
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:57,890
It's a brilliant idea.

157
00:07:57,938 --> 00:08:00,452
Well, it's-it's not a done deal.
There's-there's only one seat

158
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:03,845
- open on the board.
- Oh, they'll pick you.

159
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,676
You know, if I get it,

160
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:08,921
I can fight for
patients' rights without

161
00:08:09,182 --> 00:08:11,423
having a patient's
life in my hands.

162
00:08:12,184 --> 00:08:14,806
I hope it adds some new
meaning to my career.

163
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,931
Just promise me one thing.

164
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,657
You won't give up
on the OR just yet.

165
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,400
We still need you.

166
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:29,280
I need a full blood panel,
chest X-ray and EKG.

167
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:32,860
The EMTs said they
couldn't find a vein.

168
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:36,057
- Hundley?
- Leave it to me.

169
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,058
Sit up for me, Roxie.

170
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:40,855
Can we talk?

171
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,993
Woman to woman?

172
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:47,218
That normal BP cuff, that
is not gonna fit my arm.

173
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:48,665
Thanks for the tip,

174
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,540
but I'm one step ahead of you.

175
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:54,122
This is a leg BP cuff.

176
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:55,554
It'll do the trick.

177
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:58,070
In my ER, you get what you need.

178
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,543
Sit back
please. Thank you.

179
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,475
- Hi.
Hey.

180
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,903
I'm glad I listened to
you and Dr. Pravesh.

181
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,078
This pain is no joke.

182
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:09,982
Keep me posted.

183
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,353
Will do.

184
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:17,179
I brought you something
to eat and drink

185
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:19,493
from our world-famous

186
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:20,776
Chastain cafeteria.

187
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:22,921
Let's start with the juice.

188
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,736
No issues swallowing.

189
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:32,390
And no respiratory
symptoms either.

190
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,507
Her lungs are clear,

191
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:36,078
but look at this.

192
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:37,487
We just took off
her socks and...

193
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:49,011
Tachy. 140. She's in pain.
Let's get her some ibuprofen.

194
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:50,131
Got it.

195
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:54,580
Soft tissue is macerated.
This could be trench foot.

196
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,670
I'll elevate her feet.

197
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:01,754
Looks like she was standing
in the rain all night.

198
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:04,582
Must've been numb from the cold.
Now that we're warming her up,

199
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:06,463
her feeling's coming back.

200
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:11,453
Skin is already infected,
and it could get worse.

201
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:15,873
If you need to cry or yell,

202
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:18,159
or if you want to hold my hand,

203
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,533
you can do that,

204
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,293
okay, honey?

205
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:30,940
You try sitting still

206
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,614
while you're crammed
into a metal cage.

207
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,083
I got you.

208
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,911
I should've done
that. I'm sorry.

209
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,192
It's not your fault.

210
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:41,309
The world's made for
folks your size, not mine,

211
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:43,290
but I see you trying.

212
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:44,825
He's one of the good ones.

213
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:50,599
And that is one
of the fine ones.

214
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:52,729
Don't let him hear that.

215
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:55,645
Hey. I am Dr. Austin.

216
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,446
Dr. Pravesh tells me that
you're having some chest pains.

217
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,006
And
shortness of breath,

218
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:02,067
with a normal EKG.

219
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:03,883
We're just waiting
on the chest X-ray.

220
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,997
Reflux?

221
00:11:06,022 --> 00:11:08,098
Here we go. Heard that
one a dozen times.

222
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:10,272
Not from what I can
tell. I think it's more.

223
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:13,733
It sounds like mediastinal
crepitus to me.

224
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:16,643
It's hard to hear anything
through the soft tissue.

225
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:22,262
There are no signs
of SUBQ emphysema.That's good,

226
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:23,918
but, Pravesh,
you know I can't do

227
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:26,043
a complete consult
without all the data.

228
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:29,021
Call me when you get
an X-ray, all right?

229
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,434
He always that way?

230
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:39,114
Well, he is a very busy surgeon.

231
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,842
And there's something going
on with his mother recently.

232
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,692
He's just got a
lot on his plate.

233
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:46,340
But that is not an excuse, I know.

234
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,756
Sounds like one.

235
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:01,262
Morning.

236
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,691
- Dr. Bell?
- Yeah.

237
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:04,106
The lieutenant governor
needs a few minutes

238
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,254
before your meeting
begins. Please have a seat.

239
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,182
Thank you.

240
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,533
Well, it's
the famous Dr. Bell.

241
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,332
Bob Porter.

242
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:19,241
University Hospital, Augusta.

243
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:20,765
I know who you are.

244
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,590
- The highest billing ortho in Georgia.
- Well, I'd prefer

245
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,848
to be known for my
outcomes, but I'll take it.

246
00:12:24,873 --> 00:12:27,204
So you must be the other name
on the governor's short list

247
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,701
for a seat on the medical board.

248
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,076
So we are competitors.

249
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,811
Honored indeed.

250
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,051
Do you know Beaumont?

251
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:35,317
No. Never met him.

252
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,322
A lovely guy. He
and I go way back.

253
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:38,605
We were roommates at Dartmouth.

254
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,483
Okay, well, I
guess the fix is in.

255
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:43,082
No, no, no. Your reputation
speaks for itself.

256
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:44,700
Well, thank you,
that's very kind...

257
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:48,066
You mind if I ask you why
you want a seat on the board?

258
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:50,215
Licensing physicians,
investigating

259
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,742
patient complaints... I mean,

260
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,387
that can't hold a candle to
running four ORs at once.

261
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:56,388
Don't believe
everything you hear.

262
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:58,240
Seriously, why do you want it?

263
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:01,545
Well, I don't know, I guess
at this point in my life, I, uh...

264
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,187
just want to give back.

265
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:08,177
He's ready for you, Dr. Bell.

266
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:10,376
Nice meeting you.

267
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:12,587
Same here.

268
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:15,795
So, show me
this hand of yours

269
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,420
that hurts so much.

270
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:19,057
Yeah, it's really sore.

271
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:22,178
Is it sore in your thumb?
- Yeah, it's...

272
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,645
Is it this, just this
finger right here?

273
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,207
Really? And you don't feel anything on this side?

274
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,140
- No. Oh, yeah.
- Do you feel anything in your wrist?

275
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:31,090
- Anything in your forearm?
- Of course.

276
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:32,450
The elbow?

277
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:33,762
You're hurt everywhere.

278
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:35,591
There's got to be
a specific place...

279
00:13:36,513 --> 00:13:38,609
Atlanta PD doesn't
have any missing child

280
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:40,634
reports that match
your Jane Doe.

281
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,417
But I notified DFCS.

282
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,276
And if anyone recognizes her,

283
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:46,680
they'll let me
know. Until then...

284
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:50,488
The hospital has temporary
emergency guardianship

285
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:51,918
and you two are in charge.

286
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:53,020
Thank you.

287
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,465
Did she have her psych consults?

288
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,549
Yes, and as we suspected,

289
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,908
her silence is very likely
the result of trauma.

290
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,613
Whether that's from
her recent injuries

291
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:02,347
or something much
worse, they don't know.

292
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:03,441
She has a cracked rib,

293
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:05,985
- a few suspicious bruises.
- All signs point to abuse.

294
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,833
Well, it's definitely
a possibility, but...

295
00:14:07,858 --> 00:14:09,358
I'll keep looking for family.

296
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,956
Let me know if there's anything
else I can do to protect her.

297
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:19,103
Hey, I know you have a daughter.

298
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:21,322
So if this case is hitting
too close to home for you...

299
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:23,177
Yeah, it hits close to home.

300
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:24,285
But...

301
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,878
there's nowhere
else I'd rather be.

302
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:32,775
She's choosing not to
speak to feel safe.

303
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:36,868
I'm seeing a lot
of that recently.

304
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,266
My savior.

305
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,821
My last doctor used to make
me bring my own hospital gown

306
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:52,626
to her office. Sewed it myself.

307
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,733
Denim and rhinestones.

308
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:56,844
Well, that sounds fly as hell.

309
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:58,155
Where can I get one?

310
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,735
If y'all make me feel better,

311
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:01,563
I'll sew one for you, too.

312
00:15:01,787 --> 00:15:03,097
- Deal.

313
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:05,425
Can we get her close-up

314
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,374
over with so she
can sit back down?

315
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,110
This will take just
a minute, Roxie.

316
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,245
Dr. Pravesh?

317
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,561
The picture probably
won't be very clear

318
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,495
because of... her size.

319
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,128
The lungs
are the same size

320
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:23,651
even when the patient
is very large.

321
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,079
Yeah, but the body mass

322
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:26,932
around the lungs can
mess up the image.

323
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:28,214
A CT might be better...

324
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:30,276
except the machine
has a weight limit.

325
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,384
The CT delivers 200 times

326
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:34,042
more radiation
than a chest X-ray.

327
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,034
I'm the doctor.

328
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,804
I ordered a chest X-ray.

329
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:40,171
So please make that happen.

330
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:49,101
How are we doing?

331
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:51,018
Her heart rate is normal.

332
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:53,167
And she just got her
first dose of antibiotics.

333
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:54,053
Okay.

334
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,813
So...

335
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,114
this is my house.

336
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:03,980
Can you draw yours?

337
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:16,606
Do you live in a car, honey?

338
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,339
This line...

339
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,135
tells us how your foot

340
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,734
is doing.

341
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:32,786
If the medicine is working,

342
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:36,012
the infection won't
spread outside the line.

343
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:41,361
You need another color
marker over there?

344
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:48,917
Trade colors with me.

345
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:52,862
He is so good with kids ever
since he had one of his own.

346
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,362
Well, I'm still struggling

347
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:55,950
to find a way to
make her trust me.

348
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,217
She bonded with him instantly.

349
00:16:58,242 --> 00:16:59,557
Don't feel bad.

350
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:01,981
- You never had a chance.
- Yeah, no, I get that.

351
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:04,773
The guy's like a picnic
basket filled with cupcakes

352
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,115
and ponies and sunbeams.

353
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:12,917
Anyway, I reviewed
your patient's chart.

354
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:15,658
If she were unable to talk
due to damage to her brain,

355
00:17:15,683 --> 00:17:18,143
she'd be making sounds or
struggling to be understood.

356
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:19,534
Which isn't the case.

357
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,862
So you're good with us
holding off on a head CT?

358
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:23,003
Completely.

359
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:24,964
She's been through enough.

360
00:17:24,989 --> 00:17:27,682
Clearly. The question is what?

361
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:29,942
She's guarding some
kind of secret.

362
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:33,161
But we need the
truth to help her.

363
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:43,776
Now do you see any
evidence of pneumothorax

364
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:45,543
or pneumomediastinum?

365
00:17:45,568 --> 00:17:47,895
- Because I'm thinking that maybe right here...
- No.

366
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:50,232
Okay.

367
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:52,132
But given her
symptoms, we have to...

368
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:54,314
You know how to read
an X-ray, Pravesh.

369
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:57,578
This one is not giving us
any actionable information.

370
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:00,999
With her body habitus, we can't
even comment on the lung field,

371
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:02,712
let alone make out
a subtle finding.

372
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,110
AJ?

373
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:07,269
- You are being dismissive.
- No.

374
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,492
I'm being real. There
are complications

375
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:10,742
when carrying around
that kind of weight.

376
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:13,736
Believe me when I tell you
that she is painfully aware

377
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,658
of that fact, and it's
part of the reason

378
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:18,461
- why she hasn't gotten treated.
- So stop dancing around the issue

379
00:18:18,486 --> 00:18:20,375
and explain to your
patient that her size

380
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,281
is preventing you from
reaching a diagnosis.

381
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:25,269
She does not need me to
tell her that she is obese.

382
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:26,369
Why not?

383
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:28,548
It's a medical condition,
like any other.

384
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,570
Who do you think does
more harm, Pravesh?

385
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:36,508
The doctor who names the disease

386
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,573
or the doctor who
won't even utter it?

387
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:43,920
Get a better picture of what's
going on inside Ms. Cabot.

388
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:56,922
- What happened?
- Her heart rate shot up.

389
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:58,744
She's febrile to 102.

390
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:00,820
Her white blood cell
count is up to 25,000.

391
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:03,469
The cellulitis is advancing
outside the margins,

392
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:05,366
- despite antibiotics.

393
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,486
Pain out of proportion.

394
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,494
You're worried about
necrotizing fasciitis?

395
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,532
We need a surgical consult.

396
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:19,425
She might be headed to the OR.

397
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:24,173
We are talking about a
highly lethal infection.

398
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:26,266
Which we're not certain she has.

399
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,047
The CT shows no evidence
of gas in the tissue.

400
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:30,570
But a CT scan can
miss the diagnosis.

401
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:32,300
And if this is
necrotizing fasciitis,

402
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:33,445
we can't afford to wait.

403
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,168
She could lose
her leg. Or worse.

404
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:37,786
None of us
want that, but we have

405
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:39,878
to consider what
recovery from surgery

406
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,292
will look like for this patient.

407
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:43,840
Limited mobility or
amputation would be

408
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:45,809
a massive hurdle for a kid

409
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,244
whose basic needs
aren't being met.

410
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,295
You're asking me to open
up a little girl's leg

411
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,486
based on a hunch.

412
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:53,503
Yes, her leg is still red.

413
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:56,632
But the swelling is minimal,
no evidence of blistering.

414
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:58,823
I would have a hard time
justifying this kind

415
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:01,666
of exploration even on a
fully consenting adult.

416
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,533
We have no medical record
for our little Jane Doe, so

417
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,487
if we're wrong and she
suffers any complications,

418
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:10,197
then it's not just
surgery without consent.

419
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:12,432
It's criminal
assault on a minor.

420
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:14,393
What happened to our
emergency guardianship?

421
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:15,989
It allows
Chastain to do

422
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,628
anything necessary
to save her life.

423
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:20,127
Can you tell yourself
with certainty

424
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,325
that this falls into
those parameters?

425
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:27,667
Right now, my suspicion
for necrotizing fasciitis

426
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,747
is just a suspicion.

427
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:33,237
I agree. The infection doesn't

428
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:35,870
constitute an immediate
life-or-death threat.

429
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:37,973
But waiting is dangerous, too.

430
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,175
Things could change fast.

431
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,538
Get her admitted to
the pediatric floor.

432
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,073
We'll monitor her
leg like a hawk.

433
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:49,088
If she worsens, if she
becomes hemodynamically

434
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:51,447
unstable, if the wind
blows the wrong way,

435
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:53,293
I'll take her to the OR.

436
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,315
Regardless of the consequences.

437
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:00,509
Hey, Billie.

438
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:06,156
I have a favor to ask.

439
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,550
Well, if it's about jumping
in on these two hernia repairs

440
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:10,219
or the bowel
obstruction, then yes.

441
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:13,711
- A thousand times yes.
- No, I need a letter of recommendation

442
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,447
for the Georgia
State Medical Board.

443
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:17,078
Oh, well...

444
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:19,319
Georgia could certainly
use more doctors

445
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,297
willing to fight
for patient safety.

446
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,127
I'm competing for the
spot with another doctor.

447
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:24,687
And he's-he's
connected, he's a star

448
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:26,283
at his hospital in Augusta...

449
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,124
- top earner.
- And you want to outshine him?

450
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:30,835
Yeah, it's not gonna
be easy. He's, uh,

451
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,620
he's a powerful guy,
he's very slick.

452
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:34,645
I just need to stack the deck

453
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,499
- as much as I can.
- Who is he?

454
00:21:36,524 --> 00:21:37,981
Robert Porter.

455
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:42,872
Oh, you know him?
Yeah, well, of course.

456
00:21:42,897 --> 00:21:45,739
Well, maybe. There are probably
a lot of doctors with that name.

457
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:48,199
This is him.

458
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:54,988
You'll have your recommendation
on your desk by end of day.

459
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,515
Okay, thank you.

460
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,378
That is an esophageal
perforation.

461
00:22:28,232 --> 00:22:30,611
Roxie, what that means is
fluid is leaking out of

462
00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:32,355
your esophagus into
your chest cavity,

463
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,802
which is why you're in pain.

464
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:36,871
Can you repair it?

465
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:39,307
Well, the perf is a
tough surgery on anyone.

466
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:41,700
It's even more complex if
I'm operating on someone

467
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:44,691
- with a BMI of 50.
- Wow. Do you talk that insensitively

468
00:22:44,716 --> 00:22:46,058
about all your patients?

469
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,777
Or just the ones whose body
type you don't approve of?

470
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:49,708
Forgive Dr. Austin.

471
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:51,638
- What he means to say...
- He meant to insult me!

472
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,669
Maybe I don't need surgery.

473
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:57,800
Maybe he can't handle me
because I have too much

474
00:22:57,825 --> 00:23:01,370
- "soft tissue."
- My job is to assess the entire patient.

475
00:23:01,395 --> 00:23:03,394
And make sure you are
aware of the risks.

476
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,378
I'm guessing you're 30, 31?

477
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:08,143
I'm flattered, but no, I have
a few more years under my belt.

478
00:23:08,168 --> 00:23:09,488
I'm not asking your age.

479
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,721
I'm talking your BMI.

480
00:23:11,746 --> 00:23:13,667
I'd put you at... 32?

481
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,034
Anything over 29
makes you obese.

482
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:18,027
- Which is why I work out.
- So do I!

483
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:20,028
Six miles on a bike
every other day

484
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:21,386
and yoga in between.

485
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:24,630
I'm a person, Dr. Austin.

486
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,227
And you're an arrogant jerk.

487
00:23:28,252 --> 00:23:29,380
True.

488
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,785
But I'm also the most
straightforward doctor

489
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,812
you will meet in this
hospital. I heal with my hands.

490
00:23:34,837 --> 00:23:36,925
Not my oratory
skills. Now, when

491
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,183
I look at you, Ms. Cabot, I
see a woman who is very strong

492
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,380
who can handle
some straight talk.

493
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:45,996
So...

494
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,497
are you ready to talk
about the vomiting?

495
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:54,888
Roxie, I found enamel erosion
and staining in your mouth

496
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:56,771
when I did the exam.

497
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:59,884
Classic signs of... bulimia.

498
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:02,892
Which caused the damage
in your esophagus.

499
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:05,509
The surgery will be a
waste if we don't get

500
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:07,626
to the root cause
of all the problems.

501
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:14,725
I've dieted all my life.

502
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,610
And no one believes
how hard I try.

503
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:20,180
I try...

504
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:26,109
Somewhere along
the line I just...

505
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:29,615
I got desperate, I...

506
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,411
There is nothing
to be ashamed of.

507
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,108
Obesity is a complex disease

508
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:40,829
with a myriad of factors.

509
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:44,001
But purging after every
meal is not the answer.

510
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,507
AJ.

511
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,039
No...

512
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:49,548
it's okay.

513
00:24:50,277 --> 00:24:53,168
I'm actually beginning
to appreciate his candor.

514
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:54,773
Well, thank you.

515
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:57,702
And I appreciate
yours, Ms. Cabot.

516
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,352
I've never had a doctor talk
to me the way you two have.

517
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:06,524
They either ignore
me or write me off.

518
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,714
I gave up thinking
anyone could help me.

519
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:15,318
We can help you.

520
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:16,768
All right?

521
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,892
Dr. Austin is gonna
repair the perforation.

522
00:25:19,943 --> 00:25:21,319
And we are gonna come up

523
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:23,306
with a plan for
treating the rest.

524
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:25,344
Deal?

525
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:29,544
Deal.

526
00:25:32,443 --> 00:25:34,791
Hey, my shift is over.

527
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:36,224
But I couldn't leave
without finding out

528
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:37,904
how our little
Jane Doe is doing.

529
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,967
I have to show you something.

530
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,010
Hey.

531
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:47,302
Dr. Cade would like
to see that burn.

532
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:48,802
Is that okay?

533
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:57,921
It's a Lichtenberg figure.

534
00:25:58,009 --> 00:25:59,652
From a lightning strike.

535
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:02,373
Lightning could explain the
posterior shoulder dislocation.

536
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:04,673
And maybe help us figure
out where she came from.

537
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:07,159
Let me check my weather app.

538
00:26:09,686 --> 00:26:10,981
Three lightning strikes

539
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:13,230
touched down here,
here and here.

540
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:15,667
This is sort of near where
she was found... it's near

541
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:18,535
Black Shoals Park area.

542
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,323
I've biked out there.

543
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:22,254
It's a tough area for a kid.

544
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:24,472
Lots of homeless encampments.

545
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:27,261
She couldn't have been all
the way out there on her own.

546
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,840
Maybe whoever she was
with is still out there?

547
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:32,759
- I'll go find out.
- No, that's a bad idea.

548
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:35,439
- We don't know what you'd be walking into.
- I can handle myself.

549
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:37,517
And you have to stay
with her and if this

550
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,173
gets worse, you got to get
Kit to authorize surgery.

551
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,808
You can't go out there alone.

552
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,641
You stay. Let me go.

553
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,753
I'm glad to have
a way I can help.

554
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:04,149
What can I do for
you, Dr. Sutton?

555
00:27:07,122 --> 00:27:09,031
This is hard.

556
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:11,558
I don't want to involve
you, but I have no choice.

557
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:15,275
I need to talk to the
state medical board.

558
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,915
And why is that?

559
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,797
Dr. Bell asked me to write
him a recommendation for it.

560
00:27:19,822 --> 00:27:22,230
He told me Robert Porter

561
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:24,080
is angling for a
seat on the board.

562
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:27,463
Robert Porter, the orthopedic
surgeon in Augusta?

563
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:29,247
He has to be stopped.

564
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:31,001
He's a pedophile.

565
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:34,816
How do you know that?

566
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:38,583
He raped me when I
was 13 years old.

567
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,526
Oh, Billie.

568
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:44,909
I am so sorry.

569
00:27:45,484 --> 00:27:46,564
It was a long time ago.

570
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,720
I survived.

571
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:50,658
My feelings aren't
what matters right now.

572
00:27:51,565 --> 00:27:53,888
What matters is
there's no way in hell

573
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:55,258
Porter should be
allowed to judge

574
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:57,214
the moral failings
of other doctors.

575
00:27:57,518 --> 00:28:00,355
You want to go before
the board and tell them?Yes.

576
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:01,767
I want to make a statement.

577
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,648
Porter will deny it, of course.

578
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:06,853
Do you have any proof?

579
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:10,051
It's complicated.

580
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:14,212
There's another person involved
that I can't bring into this.

581
00:28:15,663 --> 00:28:18,046
It will have to be
Porter's word against mine.

582
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:21,889
You know women who come forward

583
00:28:21,914 --> 00:28:23,954
with abuse allegations
are often attacked.

584
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:25,420
I know.

585
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,227
But I have to try.

586
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,709
Let me talk to the
lieutenant governor

587
00:28:31,734 --> 00:28:34,227
and tell him you have
crucial information.

588
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:38,712
Perhaps we can keep them
from releasing your name.

589
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:41,590
But I can't guarantee it.

590
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:46,123
Thank you.

591
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:53,295
- Dr. Hawkins?

592
00:28:57,968 --> 00:28:59,151
How's she doing?

593
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:01,285
Her infection is worsening.

594
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,965
I suspect it's bacteremic.

595
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,328
We are gonna have to operate
without family consent.

596
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:07,005
Well, I have something
you should see.

597
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,967
I may have found a family
member, though it's

598
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,155
not the kind any of
us hoped to find.

599
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,967
He has a record of
domestic violence.

600
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,358
Cade went to find
the girl's family

601
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:20,530
- out at Black Shoals Park.
- Oh, no.

602
00:29:20,555 --> 00:29:23,089
Your call has
been forwarded to an automated

603
00:29:23,114 --> 00:29:24,760
- voice message system.
- What's going on?

604
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:27,358
Winston, call the police. We
need to get them to Cade's location.

605
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,705
The cellulitis is expanding
beyond even the most recent

606
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,560
marker, her blood
pressure's borderline.

607
00:30:24,764 --> 00:30:26,369
It's more swollen than before.

608
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:28,383
- And these blisters are new.
- We can't wait any longer.

609
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:31,862
- I don't know that we'll get parental consent.
- It's life or death now.

610
00:30:33,752 --> 00:30:35,227
Then Chastain will
take the risk.

611
00:30:35,385 --> 00:30:37,346
Let's prep her for surgery.

612
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,183
Your call has
been forwarded to an automated

613
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,390
voice message...

614
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:21,403
I'm sorry.I...

615
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:22,545
It's okay.

616
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,569
Do you have a few dollars?

617
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:27,202
I'm really hungry.

618
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:28,858
Of course.

619
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,959
Maybe you can help me.

620
00:31:34,854 --> 00:31:36,483
I'm looking for a family.

621
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:38,208
They're possibly
living in their car.

622
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:40,367
- Have you seen any...?
- Can you help me?!

623
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:42,960
Are you okay?

624
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,158
My car, it was struck
by lightning. I-I'm hurt.

625
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:47,228
That's Ana.

626
00:31:48,462 --> 00:31:51,264
Do you have a sister
around eight years old?

627
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:52,361
She has dark hair.

628
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:54,124
That's Scout! That's Scout!

629
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:56,390
She disappeared a few days ago.

630
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,836
- Please...
- She's at the hospital.

631
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:00,728
Let's get you there, too. Okay?

632
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,936
These blisters
are developing rapidly.

633
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:08,944
It means the
infection is moving fast.

634
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,764
Then we need
to move faster.

635
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:12,766
Making the
initial incision now.

636
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:38,390
Let's start
the debridement.

637
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,950
We're looking for
healthy tissue.

638
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:41,475
How deep
do we need to go?

639
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,836
Until we find some.

640
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,445
Forceps to me.

641
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:50,351
Better get equipment

642
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:52,601
for a below-the-knee
amputation just in case.

643
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,125
Amputation?

644
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,425
She's just a child.

645
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,975
It's a precaution.
We have to be ready.

646
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:12,281
Been calling you nonstop.

647
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:14,820
- Why didn't you pick up?
- This is Ana,

648
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:16,515
our minor's older sister.

649
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:18,711
She's hypothermic
with a wrist fracture.

650
00:33:18,736 --> 00:33:19,781
Where's Scout?

651
00:33:19,806 --> 00:33:21,725
- She's in surgery.
- What?

652
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,662
Let's just focus on
you right now, okay?

653
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:27,604
Clara? Page Winston.

654
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,115
I've got clean margins,

655
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,773
but the infection is close to
the anterior tibial artery.

656
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:42,952
If we compromise that,

657
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:45,367
we risk seeding the
infection further.

658
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,117
We'd have to amputate.

659
00:33:48,303 --> 00:33:49,875
So let's not.

660
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:58,305
Let's lose the tray.
I want step stools

661
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,351
on both sides of the
bed. How many sides?

662
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:03,353
Both sides.
Thank you very much.

663
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:09,445
Roxie,
welcome to your OR.

664
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:18,361
Warm blankets.

665
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:21,084
- Am I flying business class?

666
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:23,803
Now we're gonna transfer
you to the bed, Ms. Cabot.

667
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,920
All you need to do is
lay back and relax.

668
00:34:34,387 --> 00:34:36,179
Dr. Austin,
you keep talking to me

669
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:37,838
with that Barry White baritone,

670
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:40,079
I'll relax right into a puddle.

671
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,418
Where's Haircut?

672
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:48,393
I'm right
here with you, Roxie.

673
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:51,543
I thought we said no nicknames
in front of Dr. Austin.

674
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:53,543
Oh, too
late. I heard it.

675
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,131
I'm committing it to memory,

676
00:34:55,156 --> 00:34:56,964
and I'll be using
it from here on out.

677
00:34:57,816 --> 00:34:59,019
He stays.

678
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:01,018
Okay.

679
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:02,746
Change of plans, people.

680
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,082
Dr. Haircut will be
observing us today

681
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:08,558
very much the way a music stand

682
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:10,621
observes the first chair violin.

683
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:12,160
Silent and invisible.

684
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:15,199
It's time to rest now.

685
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,822
Winston, how's
the surgery going?

686
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:28,821
Not my area, but it's
still touch and go.

687
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:31,001
Please, I really just
need to see my sister.

688
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:33,174
We will take you to
her as soon as we can.

689
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:37,886
Scout wouldn't speak
or tell us her name.

690
00:35:37,911 --> 00:35:40,058
She hasn't talked since
our mom disappeared.

691
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:42,557
Can you start from
the beginning?

692
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,939
We're from Memphis.

693
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,183
Father said our mom ran off.

694
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,331
I don't believe it.

695
00:35:52,785 --> 00:35:54,086
She wouldn't.

696
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:57,183
He beat her.

697
00:35:57,784 --> 00:35:58,777
And me.

698
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:01,869
And when he hit Scout,

699
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:03,986
I stole the car,
and we ran away.

700
00:36:04,558 --> 00:36:07,339
We were living in the
car when that storm came,

701
00:36:07,364 --> 00:36:09,900
and, uh, the lightning hit,

702
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:12,894
and I don't remember
anything after that.

703
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:15,887
When I came to,

704
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:17,940
Scout was gone.

705
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:23,166
I'm your
social worker,

706
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:27,280
and I will figure out how
best to take care of you.

707
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:28,480
Please, you...

708
00:36:28,629 --> 00:36:30,665
You won't call our
father, will you?

709
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,822
No, you won't be returned
to an abusive home.

710
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:34,328
That's certain.

711
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,947
Hey. I'm here.

712
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:58,252
We're safe.

713
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,354
Everything's gonna be okay.

714
00:37:02,078 --> 00:37:03,636
Ana.

715
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:04,385
Hey.

716
00:37:04,996 --> 00:37:06,628
She speaks.

717
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:12,285
She does, indeed.

718
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,785
They saved you.

719
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,072
Thank you.

720
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:23,394
You are very welcome.

721
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:25,694
Your leg will heal. You'll
have quite the scar,

722
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,230
but otherwise,
you'll be just fine.

723
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:30,626
One more thing.

724
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,943
My daughter said I
could give this to you.

725
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,842
So, I think

726
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,815
they complete my drip rather
well, don't you think?

727
00:38:08,512 --> 00:38:11,140
This is officially the
hardest I've ever had to work

728
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:12,029
for a sale.

729
00:38:12,786 --> 00:38:14,209
Ms. Cabot,

730
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:17,425
just want you to know that
your surgery went flawlessly.

731
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,912
I expect a full
recovery very soon.

732
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:23,404
However, there is one
important open question.

733
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:30,689
- Do these come in 13?

734
00:38:31,154 --> 00:38:33,551
You two sure know how to
make a girl feel special.

735
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:37,490
I made a referral for
you for Dr. Frank.

736
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:40,409
She's an obesity specialist.
I know her personally.

737
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:42,628
She creates individualized
plans for her patients

738
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,137
that include genetics,
environmental factors

739
00:38:45,162 --> 00:38:46,832
and even metabolic function.

740
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,336
And she can get you
into a treatment program

741
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:50,527
for the bulimia.

742
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:53,553
It's a combination
of therapy and SSRIs.

743
00:38:53,578 --> 00:38:55,225
So no more judgment.

744
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:57,988
No more one-size-fits-all
medicine.

745
00:38:58,013 --> 00:39:00,350
You know, I do love my couture.

746
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:06,037
Being caught in a storm
nearly killed those two girls.

747
00:39:06,062 --> 00:39:07,971
But running away may
have saved their lives.

748
00:39:07,996 --> 00:39:10,250
These are the kind of choices
no kid should have to make.

749
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:12,090
- They needed help.
- Well,

750
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:14,863
their access to social
services may have been limited.

751
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:17,350
Chances are they would've
been returned to their father.

752
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:21,938
Tell me they won't be separated.

753
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:23,474
I will bend heaven and earth

754
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:25,011
to make sure that
doesn't happen.

755
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:26,373
Thank you, Winston.

756
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:32,941
This case got personal
for you, didn't it?

757
00:39:33,133 --> 00:39:34,857
Got personal for all of us.

758
00:39:34,882 --> 00:39:36,457
A child not willing to open up

759
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:37,857
even to those who
wanted to help her.

760
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,771
- A child on the run...
- Okay, full disclosure,

761
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,443
I'm beginning to
enjoy your company.

762
00:39:42,468 --> 00:39:43,342
We work well together.

763
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,323
But I do not enjoy
being psychoanalyzed.

764
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:48,037
- Psychoanalyzed? Really?
- Just no third degree.

765
00:39:48,062 --> 00:39:49,764
Offering you my umbrella?

766
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,146
Did that feel like the
third degree to you?

767
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:52,687
I'm not a minor in your ER.

768
00:39:52,712 --> 00:39:54,605
I'm an adult who can
make her own decisions.

769
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,662
And I'm your colleague. I
helped you get this job.

770
00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:00,623
Are you in trouble?

771
00:40:02,582 --> 00:40:03,568
No.

772
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:06,837
I'm fully in control
of my past, present

773
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,614
and, to some extent, my future.

774
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,760
- If I need help, I will ask.

775
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:14,332
But will you?

776
00:40:15,754 --> 00:40:17,544
I'll see you around, Hawkins.

777
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:24,225
So, what should we
do on our day off?

778
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,066
We can go have lunch in Roswell.

779
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,006
- Or we can go for massages.
-  Dev.

780
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:33,167
Well, we could quit our jobs

781
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,545
and go live in the
Maldives before they sink.

782
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:41,185
My schedule changed.

783
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:44,064
I have to do a valve
replacement with AJ,

784
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:46,806
and then Billie and I have a
schwannoma resection later tonight.

785
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:48,532
Don't be angry.

786
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:52,704
I'm not angry.

787
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:55,564
I'm worried, though.

788
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,306
Do Billie and AJ know

789
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:59,212
that you want to be
double board-certified

790
00:40:59,237 --> 00:41:00,782
in the hardest
field of medicine,

791
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:03,008
neuro and
cardiothoracic surgery?

792
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:04,516
Yes.

793
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:07,462
I've mentioned that
I want to do this.

794
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,423
And did they think
you can do it?

795
00:41:09,994 --> 00:41:11,047
No.

796
00:41:12,454 --> 00:41:14,118
They didn't take me seriously.

797
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,736
Are you serious?

798
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,383
Have you thought it through?

799
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:21,932
There's a reason why no
one else has done it.

800
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:24,954
Can you please just support me?

801
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:27,040
I support you in every
dream you want to chase

802
00:41:27,065 --> 00:41:28,954
as long as it's not impossible.

803
00:41:30,132 --> 00:41:31,172
Leela,

804
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:34,843
this is literally impossible.

805
00:41:35,977 --> 00:41:39,531
Even for the most talented
surgical resident in the world,

806
00:41:39,556 --> 00:41:41,579
and I'm ready to say
that that is you.

807
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,710
Did I tell you how sexy it is
that you stood up to Dr. Austin

808
00:41:51,735 --> 00:41:53,547
and lived to tell it?

809
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:55,196
It was a conversation.

810
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,100
I didn't wrestle
him to the ground.

811
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:58,860
Don't shortchange yourself.

812
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:02,382
You advocated for your patient.

813
00:42:02,735 --> 00:42:05,506
I find that incredibly sexy.

814
00:42:05,531 --> 00:42:06,891
Oh, yeah?

815
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:17,312
Okay, uh, why don't you
pencil him in for 3:00, then.

816
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:18,955
I have good news.

817
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:20,730
I could use some.

818
00:42:20,878 --> 00:42:23,620
I extracted a promise from
the lieutenant governor

819
00:42:23,645 --> 00:42:26,071
to assure your anonymity.

820
00:42:26,098 --> 00:42:28,712
You can testify to him
and the whole board.

821
00:42:29,302 --> 00:42:30,814
When?

822
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,159
Today. 2:00 p.m.

823
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,436
I cleared your schedule.
No sense delaying.

824
00:42:37,267 --> 00:42:40,189
I've been private
about this for so long.

825
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,977
Are you sure you're ready?

826
00:42:43,678 --> 00:42:45,836
You should know
there's still danger.

827
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:48,369
Porter is powerful within
the medical community,

828
00:42:48,394 --> 00:42:51,759
and Randolph told me he
and the lieutenant governor

829
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:53,916
were in the same
fraternity in college.

830
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:55,259
So this is a boat

831
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:56,907
- that could spring a hundred leaks.
- Yes.

832
00:42:56,932 --> 00:42:58,975
But he also told me

833
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,513
there are other ethics
complaints against Porter.

834
00:43:01,733 --> 00:43:03,298
After your testimony,

835
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:04,798
they may take those seriously.

836
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,337
I hope so.

837
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,681
It's still risky.

838
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:10,580
I know.

839
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:13,632
And you're determined?

840
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:15,611
I am.
