<font color="#fffc00">"The Resident"...</font>

2
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:03,507
No way.

3
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:05,492
Is that the guy
who killed Phoebe?

4
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:07,641
He saw us with the FBI.

5
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,938
You want a baby
more than you want me.

6
00:00:10,023 --> 00:00:12,492
I want you, but I also
want a family one day.

7
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:14,445
So what are you saying, then?

8
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:17,023
This is it?

9
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:18,703
Yeah.

10
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:20,171
Job well done.

11
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:21,335
Call me when you're off.

12
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,096
I'll meet you here this evening.

13
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:24,593
FBI?

14
00:00:24,794 --> 00:00:26,364
As long as I decide
to stay at Chastain,

15
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:27,485
they're giving me
an armed escort.

16
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,187
Good. You need that protection.

17
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:36,953
I used to have an extra room,
but now it's Gigi's.

18
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,575
Thanks for letting me
crash here last-minute.

19
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:45,348
I don't get it, man.

20
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:47,390
You guys always seemed
really happy together.

21
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:51,898
I guess there was
a problem all along.

22
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:54,671
Something big we never
talked about, and...

23
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:57,507
when we started talking...

24
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:08,924
Hey, you mind
if I use the bathroom?

25
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:11,149
Shower is all yours.
The whole place is yours.

26
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:13,414
I'm gonna take Gigi
to preschool.

27
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:17,093
Hey.

28
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,398
...if there's any way
I can help.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,367
You already have.

30
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:46,870
You know where Devon is?
I keep texting him,

31
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:49,094
- he's not responding.
- He's probably on his way.

32
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,391
He slept on my couch.

33
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:51,892
What, you don't spend
enough time together?

34
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:53,710
I think he just needed a place
to crash for the night.

35
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:56,796
Well, I need him now.
We lost another ER doctor.

36
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:58,891
- What do you mean?
- Sad day.

37
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:01,757
Cade gave notice.
Just up and quit.

38
00:02:01,842 --> 00:02:03,453
You mean she's gone?

39
00:02:03,538 --> 00:02:05,289
Clearing out her locker.

40
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,344
Were you gonna say goodbye?

41
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,242
Of course I was.

42
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:26,578
I took your advice, slept on it,

43
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:28,233
made a decision.

44
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:30,093
Maybe it was the right one.

45
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,554
I certainly don't want you
to be in danger.

46
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:36,815
No more Go Team, huh?

47
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:40,945
No more torturing Irving.
That's what I'll miss the most.

48
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:43,171
And Hundley. She's awesome.

49
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:45,289
I'll miss you.

50
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,895
We never really
had a chance, did we?

51
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,437
I thought we had a chance.

52
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:55,179
I hoped to break through
the limits I've put on myself

53
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:56,457
about getting close to people.

54
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,851
I wanted it to be different.

55
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,717
We did everything right.

56
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:03,894
We went straight to the FBI,
played by the rules,

57
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:06,164
it just still wasn't enough.

58
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:09,906
You still need to leave.

59
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,139
Look, I stay,

60
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:15,914
the moment I let my guard down
is when they'll get me.

61
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:24,882
Where will you go?

62
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,565
If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

63
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:44,078
I tried to warn you, Hawkins.

64
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:47,546
I always disappear.

65
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:49,839
Always.

66
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,633
<i>Nurse Allen to
Residential Services.</i>

67
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:00,401
<i>Nurse Allen to
Residential Services, please.</i>

68
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:01,844
Bye.

69
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,248
Bring it in here.

70
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,320
Ugh, I'm gonna miss you.

71
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,398
- Oh.
- There. It's always too perfect.

72
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:10,697
What's going on?

73
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:13,187
- I'm out of here, friend.
- No way.

74
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:15,109
Way.

75
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:17,671
You guys are the best.

76
00:04:18,114 --> 00:04:19,031
I mean that.

77
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:20,867
Then don't leave us.

78
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:23,521
Ugh, I should have
just snuck out.

79
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,000
This is too hard.

80
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:28,631
I love you all.

81
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:32,109
I'll walk you out.

82
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:33,461
Just this once.

83
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:36,179
This will be twice now.
You're getting soft.

84
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:45,472
Oh, and now
I'm letting you open

85
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:47,292
car doors for me?
This is new.

86
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:49,236
Could have learned to like it.

87
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,070
I'd say "let me know
where you are," but...

88
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:54,554
Yeah.

89
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,731
We were a good team.

90
00:04:57,995 --> 00:04:59,750
Yes, we were.

91
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,087
I'll be thinking of you.

92
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,507
Stay safe.

93
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:14,671
Yeah, that's the idea.

94
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,604
Get down! Get down!

95
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,810
You're okay. I got you.

96
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,624
- Tell the ER to prep a trauma bay.
- Got it.

97
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:33,055
Multiple gunshot wounds,
thready pulse!

98
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:40,347
Am I dying?

99
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,090
You're not gonna die.

100
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:43,727
I'm not gonna allow it.

101
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,531
Just hold my hand.

102
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:48,395
I don't want to die alone.

103
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:51,266
Open your eyes.

104
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:54,227
Open your eyes. Open your eyes!

105
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,699
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE RESIDENT*</font>

107
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:13,288
Okay, deep breath.

108
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:15,865
Wait, Doc, let me guess.
My lungs sound like

109
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,715
Rice Krispies or Velcro...
It's always one of the two.

110
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:19,959
It's hard to tell

111
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,896
if you keep talking, but yes,

112
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:25,225
Those are both key findings of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

113
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:26,589
I should have
an honorary medical degree

114
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:28,228
after these past two years.

115
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:30,288
I've seen every kind
of doctor there is.

116
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:31,881
Well, except for a gynecologist.

117
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:36,570
He refused to believe
the diagnosis for ages.

118
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:39,388
Well, I didn't feel like a man
with a terminal disease.

119
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:41,224
Except for this cough.

120
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:43,662
- They told us he was...
- What, finished?

121
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:44,933
- Yeah.
- Yeah, not a chance.

122
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:47,436
I am far too mean to die.

123
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:50,607
So, Doc, is it finally time
for a transplant?

124
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:53,276
I think so, Mr. Miller.
I've looked through your records

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,583
and besides IPF,
you are a young and healthy guy.

126
00:07:57,668 --> 00:07:59,606
You got a strong support system
here from Lola.

127
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:02,676
So, as far as I can see,
you are an excellent candidate

128
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,421
for a lung transplant,
and I think we should do

129
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:06,406
everything we can to get you on
that list as soon as possible.

130
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,255
"Young and healthy"?
Did you hear that, Lola?

131
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,809
I like this man.

132
00:08:10,894 --> 00:08:12,473
He should be a guest
on my podcast.

133
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,221
How about it, Dr. Pravesh?

134
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:16,817
You get me new lungs
and I will make you a star.

135
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:18,817
The next, uh, Dr. Oz.

136
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:21,192
That'll be a pass for me.

137
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:22,770
You a fan of my show?

138
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:25,306
You know, sadly,
I just don't have much time

139
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:26,482
for entertainment these days.

140
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:28,792
Well, my podcast
isn't entertainment.

141
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:31,556
I'm sure it's great...

142
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,879
<i>Attention, please.</i>

143
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:35,139
<i>Active shooter alert.</i>

144
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,809
<i>Please remain where you are
and await further instructions.</i>

145
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:41,341
<i>- Repeat...</i>
- I-Is this a drill, Doctor?

146
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:44,344
<i>Please remain where you are
and await further instructions.</i>

147
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:45,778
<i>Thank you.</i>

148
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:47,582
There was a shooting
outside the hospital.

149
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:50,144
The ER is closing, but
you're gonna be safe up here.

150
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:52,244
I'll keep you updated,
but in the meantime,

151
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:54,762
a transplant surgeon's
gonna come by to evaluate you

152
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,044
and discuss next steps
to get you on that list, okay?

153
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,188
Yeah.

154
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:04,277
Weak carotid.

155
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:05,774
She's in hemorrhagic shock.

156
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:07,776
I want every unit
of uncrossmatched blood

157
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,702
we have in the hospital now.

158
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:10,786
On it. Go.

159
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,870
Blood.

160
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:16,166
We got you.

161
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:18,786
Irving.

162
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,612
Can you get central access?
Generous with the lido.

163
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,948
Subclavian it is.

164
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,284
What happened?

165
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:26,450
Was it random
or a patient or what?

166
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,381
Definitely not random.

167
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,567
Conrad, I don't think
she's protecting her airway.

168
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:36,846
We're gonna have to put in
a breathing tube.

169
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:38,256
It's temporary.

170
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:40,667
I need to tell you, blood...

171
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:43,020
We've got transfusions coming.
Don't worry.

172
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:44,580
We've got you.

173
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,580
She's out.
Are you sure you're good?

174
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:51,201
Good.

175
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:56,639
- E.T. Tube.
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,184
Advancing through the cords.

177
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:10,430
Let's get the vent on her.

178
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:12,264
I got it.

179
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:15,036
No chest rise on the left.

180
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,826
I don't hear any breath sounds
on that side, either.

181
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:24,833
I got the page.

182
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:26,411
What do you need?

183
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:28,132
Penetrating bullet wound
to the left chest,

184
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:29,248
another two in the abdomen.

185
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:31,833
- She needs a chest tube.
- I'm on it.

186
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:34,168
Tell me how I can help.

187
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,069
Units of O neg are waiting.
Grab them.

188
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:40,127
<i>Doctor, are we safe in here?</i>

189
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:41,628
<i>- Sandwich! I'm hungry!</i>
<i>- I heard a doctor was shot.</i>

190
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:43,112
- Oh, my God.
- Special Agent Garcia, FBI.

191
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:45,132
I've come to put
the Chastain ER under lockdown.

192
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:47,375
Nobody comes through
these doors for any reason.

193
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,136
Atlanta PD will be here in five.

194
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,863
All doctors and nurses
are to show ID.

195
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:54,049
And I want all of these
people out of here.

196
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,543
But these are patients.
That's our waiting room.

197
00:10:56,628 --> 00:10:57,869
Not anymore.

198
00:10:57,953 --> 00:10:59,551
- Come on, everybody.
- Let's go.

199
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,706
<i>Hospital security to the ER.</i>

200
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,558
<i>Hospital security
to the ER.</i>

201
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:05,152
Line's in.

202
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:07,045
All right, I've got
three units and a bag

203
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,113
- of platelets and plasma.
- You got 'em?

204
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:15,253
She's got free fluid in the
right and left upper quadrant.

205
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:17,260
She's bleeding into her belly.

206
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:26,255
Simple pneumothorax.
Minimal blood in the chest.

207
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,941
All right, some good news.

208
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:30,159
No pericardial effusion,
looks like

209
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:31,607
the bullet just missed
her heart and vessels.

210
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,110
But the other two hit her
abdomen, shattered her spleen.

211
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,087
I just heard. Any head trauma?

212
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:38,757
I don't know.
She needs a baseline neuro exam.

213
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:41,170
Just heard from Bell. He's pulling up.

214
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:43,026
All right, OR I will be ready

215
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:43,899
in 15 minutes.

216
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:46,892
- Anesthesia will be waiting for you.
- Billie?

217
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:54,016
I need to know.

218
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,910
- What?
- Is her neuro exam okay?

219
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:01,449
It's not like Nic.

220
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,951
You fix the rest of her,

221
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:05,027
that brain will be just fine.

222
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:07,813
All right, let's prep her for surgery.

223
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,966
Let me know
how I can help, please.

224
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,877
Hospital's on lockdown.
Go to the ER at Atlanta General.

225
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:23,121
- I'm the CEO.
- Surgeon.

226
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:24,730
Go.

227
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:33,419
How's she doing?

228
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:39,203
We stabilized her enough
to go to the OR, but it's bad.

229
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:44,251
This is related
to the Medicare fraud ring.

230
00:12:44,335 --> 00:12:46,076
Yes.

231
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:49,296
Are we still keeping
that a secret?

232
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:52,092
No.

233
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:54,407
There's no need
for secrets anymore.

234
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:59,599
Cade was a whistleblower.
She was working with the FBI.

235
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:02,509
Blew open a mob operation.

236
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:05,864
And they came for her.

237
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:07,736
Okay, then.

238
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:16,634
We were just about to take her

239
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,285
to the OR when her pressure
and sats dropped.

240
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:20,369
We're behind on resuscitating
her with blood products.

241
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:22,745
Well, let's get a pressure bag
on that blood.

242
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:28,110
All right,
another unit going in.

243
00:13:28,194 --> 00:13:29,779
There's no increase
in abdominal free fluid.

244
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:32,040
She must be bleeding
somewhere else.

245
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:33,692
No blood in the chest tube.

246
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,879
She's desatting.

247
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:40,305
Raise it to 100% on the vent.

248
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:51,441
Temp?

249
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:55,380
102.4.

250
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:56,731
She wasn't febrile before.

251
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:59,050
Stop the blood.

252
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:00,385
Hawkins, she'll bleed out.

253
00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:02,283
No, she's not just losing blood.

254
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:04,830
- Her body's also destroying it.
- Transfusion reaction.

255
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:07,244
Yes, she tried to tell me
something about blood.

256
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:08,243
She must have a rare type.

257
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:10,729
And we can't take her
to the OR like this.

258
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,564
Any more blood could kill her.

259
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:25,345
- Okay, thanks.
- Talk to me.

260
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,737
The blood bank confirmed it.
Severe hemolytic

261
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:29,769
- transfusion reaction.
- Didn't she get O negative?

262
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,789
Yes, and that would be fine
for most everyone else,

263
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:33,515
but Cade reacted to it
because she has

264
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,459
a very rare blood type: Rh null.

265
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,703
Well, I hope they're prepping
Rh null for the OR.

266
00:14:37,787 --> 00:14:38,945
I mean, that's where
she needs to go now.

267
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:40,706
We don't have any,
and I bet that no one else

268
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,449
- in Georgia does, either.
- If you operate

269
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:43,801
and can't transfuse her,
odds are, she won't

270
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:45,878
- make it off the table.
- Yeah, but she's losing blood

271
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:47,787
from her spleen and who knows
where else as we speak.

272
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,715
If I sit on that,
she'll die, for sure.

273
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,849
It's a risk we have to take.

274
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,720
All right, here's the plan.

275
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:56,647
You take her to the OR,
remove her spleen.

276
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:58,557
Get in and out
as quick as possible.

277
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:00,260
- Damage control.
- Yeah, I'll take out her spleen

278
00:15:00,344 --> 00:15:01,573
and fix whatever else
could kill her,

279
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,133
but this is
a temporary solution.

280
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:05,499
And then bring her back to
the ICU, keep her abdomen open.

281
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:06,993
Uh, so we're ready to get back

282
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:08,354
into the OR as quickly
as possible.

283
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:10,630
Once we get compatible blood.

284
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,742
- You want me in there?
- No, there's no need.

285
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:18,243
What we're doing right now
is just a Band-Aid.

286
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:19,336
It's quick and dirty.

287
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,838
But there will be
a much larger surgery

288
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:22,731
to put all this back together
as soon as we get the blood.

289
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:23,899
- I will need you then.
- All right.

290
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,068
Let's get Dr. Devi to assist.
Is she here?

291
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:27,678
- I wouldn't know.
- I'll page her.

292
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,588
And I'll ask Billie to start
the hunt for compatible blood.

293
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:31,348
Well, tell her
to pull out all the stops.

294
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:32,591
I mean, I'll do
what I can in there,

295
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:34,809
but that blood
is what's gonna save her.

296
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:38,213
Bell's on deck.

297
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:39,457
I need you in Cade's OR.

298
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:40,960
I'll be there. Will she be okay?

299
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:43,221
Don't ask questions. Just focus.

300
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:45,512
The world doesn't stop.
I've got a patient.

301
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,013
He's kicking up a fuss.

302
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:49,775
He needs an expedited
lung transplant eval.

303
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:51,518
- Can you do it?
- Well, I'm all yours

304
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,900
until they find blood for Cade.

305
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,597
Pulmonary fibrosis.

306
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:57,957
Meets BMI criteria,
otherwise healthy.

307
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:01,462
Jimmy Miller. The podcast host?

308
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:04,864
- You've heard of him?
- Yeah. He's a nitwit.

309
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:08,110
He's a performance artist.
Says anything to get attention.

310
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:10,779
Anti-government, anti-gluten,
whatever sells at the moment.

311
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:13,632
- Presently, he's anti-vax.
<i>- Look,</i>

312
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:15,709
all transplant recipients
need to be vaccinated.

313
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:16,876
For the flu, hepatitis...

314
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,972
Hepatitis, shingles,
polio, pneumonia,

315
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:21,957
COVID, diphtheria,
pertussis, yada yada.

316
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:25,143
After a transplant,
the meds we give you

317
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:26,720
to keep you from rejecting
your new lungs

318
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:29,314
also make it hard for your body
to fight off infections.

319
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:30,741
Leaving you vulnerable

320
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,392
to any number of things
that could destroy

321
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:34,411
the precious lungs we give you.

322
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,897
These are my risks
to reject or accept.

323
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:39,157
I will take my chances.

324
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:41,252
You can hold on to your position,

325
00:16:41,336 --> 00:16:42,978
but the cost
is we can't list you.

326
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:44,237
Transplant programs

327
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:45,647
simply can't give
an organ to someone

328
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:47,073
who refuses
the necessary vaccines.

329
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:49,927
Look, there's got to be an
exception for a guy like Jimmy.

330
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:52,763
- No exceptions.
- We can explain the science, right?

331
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:54,414
There is no reason
to fear vaccines.

332
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:58,010
They are the single greatest
success story in medicine.

333
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:01,105
Prevention beats any treatment
by light-years.

334
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:02,831
Yeah, this is about
my principles.

335
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:04,441
Really? Is it
about your principles

336
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,593
or is it about
remaining a hot topic?

337
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,186
Hey, don't talk
like that to Jimmy.

338
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,855
We're not
forcing him to do anything,

339
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,857
but the bottom line is
you don't get a rare resource

340
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,451
like new lungs
if you're not vaccinated.

341
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,454
The risk of infection and death
are too high.

342
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,681
Donated organs cannot
be wasted on patients

343
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:21,792
- who will not live to enjoy them.
- Hey.

344
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:24,424
My mind is made up.

345
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:27,868
I will never get vaccinated.

346
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,991
I came as quickly as I could.

347
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:40,064
OR 1.
Cade's already on the table.

348
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:42,704
Bell needs
an extra set of hands.

349
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:44,148
Look, I know this is not the
right time, but I'm guessing

350
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:45,983
you heard about me
and Devon and I just,

351
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,560
- I hope you're not angry.
- I'm not angry, I'm stressed.

352
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:50,470
- We all are.
- It's not something I wanted.

353
00:17:50,554 --> 00:17:53,179
Leela, it's your business.

354
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,349
And right now,
I'm focused on Cade.

355
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:58,335
Of course.
That's where my focus is, too.

356
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:02,741
Sorry for the delay.
I couldn't believe when I heard.

357
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:05,561
Well, she has
lost a lot of blood already,

358
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:06,895
we have none to transfuse

359
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:08,897
and when we open,
she will bleed more.

360
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:11,796
Of course, we would
all prefer that Dr. Sullivan

361
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,315
not bleed to death
on this table.

362
00:18:15,154 --> 00:18:19,557
So our goal is to keep
blood loss to a minimum.

363
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,562
We have no reserve.

364
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,191
All right, then.
10 blade to me.

365
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:36,515
Damn it. No.

366
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:42,669
Dr. Devi, uh, take your hand

367
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:45,295
and plunge it toward her back
to find her spleen.

368
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,398
When you take it out,
the bleeding will slow.

369
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:53,050
I'm-I'm where her
spleen should be. I can't find it.

370
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:54,766
- Dr. Bell, take over.
- It's o-it's okay.

371
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,808
Take the retractor.

372
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:02,076
I got it.

373
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:03,734
Okay, now clamp it.

374
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:09,883
This is personal for all of us.

375
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,258
That's all the more reason
not to panic.

376
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:12,859
You've got this.

377
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:17,406
Now staple it off.

378
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:22,735
- Good.
- Okay, spleen's out.

379
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:24,397
The bleeding is slowing.

380
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:25,749
But the pressure's still dropping.

381
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,660
She had multiple gunshot wounds.
Run the bowel.

382
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:30,162
- There might be a perf.
- Already on that.

383
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:31,327
I see one.

384
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:33,671
Okay, we'll cut out
the damaged bowel.

385
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:43,175
We're getting cold here.
She's hypothermic.

386
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:45,160
Okay, that's all we can do.
We're out of time.

387
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:46,495
There's no time
to repair the bowel.

388
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,762
So we'll staple it off
on both sides.

389
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:51,775
We're going to leave her bowel
in discontinuity?

390
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,852
We will reconnect it
when we come back later.

391
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:55,929
Jessica, give me
all the lap pads you've got.

392
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:58,364
Let's jam them in there.

393
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:03,697
We have to stop the bleeding.

394
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:16,708
No, I said Rh null.
Okay, I understand.

395
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:19,044
Call me back
if you find any matches.

396
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:20,787
- How is she?
- Out of surgery.

397
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:23,474
Alive, but barely.
Where are we with the blood?

398
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,124
I called up and down
the East Coast. Nothing.

399
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,627
Rh null is one of the rarest
blood types in existence.

400
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:30,205
And even if we find blood,
who knows how far away it'll be.

401
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:31,556
Seattle.

402
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,195
I just got off the phone
with Cade's emergency contact...

403
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,288
Her father...
He is a peds surgeon

404
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:37,974
at Seattle Children's.

405
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:39,222
He has the same blood type.

406
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:42,384
- When can he get here?
- He's taking the red-eye,

407
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:43,735
and he's gonna land at 6:50 a.m.

408
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:45,403
That means
she'll be without blood

409
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:47,313
for the next 16 hours at least?

410
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:49,649
Cade knew she had
a rare blood type.

411
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,168
Wouldn't she have
banked some of it?

412
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:52,577
Yeah, but not here. I checked.

413
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:53,937
She wasn't planning

414
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:55,215
on staying here long.

415
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:57,030
Where's the last place
she worked?

416
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:59,248
Atlanta General.

417
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,543
How is she?

418
00:21:05,658 --> 00:21:07,425
We managed a splenectomy

419
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:09,094
and removed the per fed section
of the bowel,

420
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:12,189
but she's lost too much blood
to do a definitive operation.

421
00:21:12,273 --> 00:21:14,416
So until then, her bowel
has to be disconnected.

422
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,251
Her abdomen has to remain open.

423
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:18,491
We're doing our best
to find blood.

424
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:27,020
We have to figure out a way
to work in the same hospital.

425
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:30,189
It's been less than 24 hours.

426
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:31,542
It's gonna be hard,

427
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:34,335
but we just have to stay focused
on being civil.

428
00:21:35,646 --> 00:21:37,396
I know we can do that.

429
00:21:48,712 --> 00:21:50,721
- How's she doing?
- She's a bloody mess.

430
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:53,397
- They find the shooter?
- The FBI is still looking.

431
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:55,214
Has your phone
been ringing off the hook?

432
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:56,458
I'm trying to head that off.

433
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,068
I have a press conference
in 20 minutes.

434
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:03,648
I am so glad you were here

435
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:05,742
to be the one
to handle Cade's surgery.

436
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,952
Bullet wounds, FBI,
a doctor shot in the street?

437
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:11,397
Life is fragile.

438
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:14,958
- I'm so grateful for you.
- Oh, me too.

439
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:21,908
You know, poor Cade. As far
as I can tell, she's got no one.

440
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:24,677
Conrad's there for her.

441
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:35,254
- I can handle this.
- Well, we'll handle it together.

442
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:37,682
All I'm saying
is I can run point

443
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:40,018
if you want me to.

444
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:42,177
I know this is nothing like Nic,

445
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:43,521
but she is a friend
and a colleague

446
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:45,190
that we want to save.

447
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:47,784
- The situation's got to be a trigger.
- No.

448
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,769
Not even close.

449
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:51,513
We can save Cade.

450
00:22:51,597 --> 00:22:53,698
- Okay. How?
- Billie was right.

451
00:22:53,782 --> 00:22:55,942
Cade did bank her own blood.
She moved it

452
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:58,370
with her every time
she switched cities. There are

453
00:22:58,454 --> 00:23:00,613
two units at Atlanta General.
They're on the way now.

454
00:23:00,697 --> 00:23:02,540
Great news. Did you tell Bell

455
00:23:02,624 --> 00:23:04,359
to get the OR ready
for when it gets here?

456
00:23:04,443 --> 00:23:05,952
On my way to do it.

457
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:08,880
All right. I'll stay here
and keep an eye on her vitals.

458
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:12,550
Great. Remember, we have
to watch her drainage, too.

459
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,127
Tells us what's going on
in her abdomen.

460
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:17,730
- If it starts filling up with blood...
- I know all this.

461
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,041
I got it.

462
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:34,162
The lockdown of Chastain's ER

463
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:37,558
created tremendous stress
on the Atlanta hospital system.

464
00:23:37,643 --> 00:23:39,819
I'm relieved to say
that we are now open.

465
00:23:40,164 --> 00:23:43,244
But our ER doctor who was shot
is in critical condition.

466
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:45,734
Dr. Voss, since you're refusing
to save Jimmy Miller's life,

467
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:47,919
would you consider transferring
him to another hospital?

468
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:49,495
- Jimmy Miller? I...
- What if someone

469
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:50,681
made a directed donation?

470
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:52,015
How does Chastain respond

471
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,184
to the accusation
that you are punishing Miller

472
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:55,167
for being anti-vax?

473
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:57,011
Are you denying a patient
life-saving organs

474
00:23:57,096 --> 00:23:59,129
- because you don't like his politics?
- Are you?

475
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:03,197
I'm here to discuss
an act of violence

476
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:05,263
against
a health care professional,

477
00:24:05,348 --> 00:24:07,248
not Chastain's policy,
which is consistent

478
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:09,366
with policy
throughout the country,

479
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,852
requiring vaccination
for transplant listing.

480
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:14,687
- Is this a UNOS requirement?
- Jimmy Miller is

481
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:17,690
the father of a young child.
Would you let him die?

482
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:26,979
- Who the hell is Jimmy Miller?
- He's a podcast host followed

483
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:28,136
- by millions.
- Who apparently

484
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,011
has been podcasting
from his room,

485
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:31,628
painting himself as the victim

486
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:33,399
of the deep state's
vaccine requirements

487
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:34,417
for transplantation.

488
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:36,904
He needs new lungs,
but he's anti-vax.

489
00:24:36,988 --> 00:24:38,514
Since we can't list him here
for a transplant,

490
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:40,591
- I'd like to transfer him someplace else.
- Well,

491
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:42,185
I called Atlanta General.
And, as with most hospitals,

492
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:44,002
their rules
are the same as ours.

493
00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:46,097
What a circus.
On a day when we don't need

494
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:47,431
any more chaos.
Look at this.

495
00:24:47,515 --> 00:24:49,100
<i>I'm in my hospital room</i>

496
00:24:49,184 --> 00:24:50,434
<i>at Chastain Memorial
here in Atlanta,</i>

497
00:24:50,518 --> 00:24:52,587
<i>where doctors
are refusing to list me</i>

498
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:53,938
<i>- for a lung transplant.
- Oh, sorry.</i>

499
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:56,515
<i>Why? Because I won't
get vaccinated.</i>

500
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,987
<i>Now, they say that
I'm the perfect candidate.</i>

501
00:24:59,072 --> 00:25:00,768
<i>They say that
I'm running out of time.</i>

502
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:03,097
<i>And yet they're
going to let me die</i>

503
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:04,932
<i>because I will not give up</i>

504
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:06,100
<i>control...</i>

505
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:07,451
<i>...of my own body.</i>

506
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:12,718
<i>Nurse, help! Someone!</i>

507
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:16,949
I can't breathe.

508
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:20,223
He had a coughing fit
and couldn't recover.

509
00:25:23,196 --> 00:25:25,346
He needs a stat
portable chest X-ray. Call RT

510
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:26,591
and get him on a noninvasive.

511
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:28,307
And give him 40 of furosemide.

512
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:30,141
Drying him out
a little bit won't hurt.

513
00:25:30,225 --> 00:25:31,459
Help him!

514
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:33,127
Just wait outside the room.
We will update you

515
00:25:33,211 --> 00:25:36,279
as soon as we
get things settled, all right?

516
00:25:37,824 --> 00:25:39,115
I love you.

517
00:25:46,224 --> 00:25:47,583
All right, Jimmy.

518
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,401
- Just take some deep breaths.
- And this is

519
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:50,569
gonna do some of the work
for you.

520
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:52,086
It's gonna help you breathe.

521
00:25:52,696 --> 00:25:54,037
I lied before.

522
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,508
Get me lungs.

523
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:59,135
I'm vaccinated.

524
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:05,497
Cade's banked blood is here.

525
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:07,582
Just in time.

526
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:10,347
There's one unit
in each of these.

527
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:12,431
Help me open them up. Quick.

528
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:15,320
They're frozen shut.

529
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:19,006
Cade must have banked them

530
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,657
a long time ago.

531
00:26:23,703 --> 00:26:25,245
Got it.

532
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:31,709
All right.
Now let's warm 'em up.

533
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:49,644
The bags are leaking.

534
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:57,153
We were careful.
How did that happen?

535
00:26:57,237 --> 00:27:00,697
Plastic must have cracked
when it thawed.

536
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:05,143
Blood was frozen too long,

537
00:27:05,227 --> 00:27:06,996
and now all of it
is contaminated.

538
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,455
Are we out of options?

539
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:14,711
Both units lost? Okay,
just let me know what I can do.

540
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:16,839
- He was lying.
- Who?

541
00:27:16,923 --> 00:27:18,733
Jimmy Miller. Podcast host.

542
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:20,492
He's fully vaccinated.

543
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:22,403
He blurted it out
when he couldn't breathe

544
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:24,329
and felt what it's like
to be dying.

545
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:26,741
Which means he technically
meets our transplant criteria.

546
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,242
I even have
his vaccination records.

547
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:29,852
That was his only barrier.

548
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:31,187
We need to list him.

549
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:33,414
We cure saints and sinners both.
Given the choice,

550
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:34,857
we err on the side
of second chances.

551
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:37,268
Yeah, but since we can't
reveal to anyone

552
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:39,529
that he's vaccinated,
even his wife...

553
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:40,771
The public is going to think

554
00:27:40,855 --> 00:27:42,365
that we're violating
our own rules.

555
00:27:42,449 --> 00:27:44,867
It doesn't change the fact
that he's now in compliance

556
00:27:44,951 --> 00:27:46,685
with our requirements.

557
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,020
I'll deal
with the fallout later.

558
00:27:48,104 --> 00:27:49,872
We have far bigger problems.

559
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:51,824
Cade's banked blood is unusable.

560
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:53,838
- Oh, no.
- And the Red Cross

561
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,221
is coming up empty-handed.

562
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,604
They're broadening their search,

563
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:58,963
but we all know
how long that takes.

564
00:28:00,116 --> 00:28:02,610
What if we don't
give her blood at all?

565
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:03,886
<i>Devon is proposing</i>

566
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,388
we use Hemoglobin 2.0.

567
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:07,615
Yes. It is a blood substitute
synthesized

568
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:10,229
from cow hemoglobin
that can carry oxygen

569
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,236
- all around the body.
- Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

570
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,274
Supposed to save soldiers
in combat

571
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,760
who didn't have access
to transfusion.

572
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:15,759
- Key words, "supposed to."
- Yeah,

573
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:18,009
exactly. I mean,
blood substitutes can be toxic.

574
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:20,383
Kidney damage,
heart failure, death.

575
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:21,667
And they're not approved
by the FDA.

576
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:24,670
I'm not crazy about the idea,

577
00:28:24,754 --> 00:28:26,488
but Cade will die
if we don't do something.

578
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:28,232
The anecdotal evidence
is promising.

579
00:28:28,316 --> 00:28:31,493
The Cleveland Clinic recently
used a similar blood substitute

580
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,995
on a patient
with hemorrhagic shock.

581
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,514
Saved her life.

582
00:28:35,598 --> 00:28:37,424
I can connect you
with the head of the company.

583
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,168
We're gonna need the FDA to get us expanded access and fast.

584
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,763
Slow down. Let's just take
a beat and talk this out,

585
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:43,783
'cause the risks
are considerable.

586
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:45,468
Her lactate's climbing to five.

587
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:47,470
Crit is still falling,
and creatinine's up

588
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:49,651
to two. I mean, what are we
waiting for, for her to code?

589
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:51,136
Well, let's say
we give it to her

590
00:28:51,237 --> 00:28:53,744
and she dies
and the Red Cross comes through

591
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:56,189
moments later
or her father arrives in time

592
00:28:56,344 --> 00:28:57,745
- to give blood.
- Every moment

593
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:59,429
with a blood count this low
is another moment

594
00:28:59,513 --> 00:29:01,518
her organs aren't perfused.
Brain included.

595
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:02,807
I'm with Conrad.

596
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:03,975
It's a temporary solution,

597
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,070
but we can't
just sit on our hands and wait.

598
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,850
All right.

599
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:09,710
Let's get the process started.

600
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,358
Okay.

601
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:22,806
Hey.

602
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:24,173
What's the good word?

603
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:26,381
We're gonna list you for lungs.

604
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,733
Oh! Thank you, doctors.

605
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:30,276
Jimmy, you were right.
They changed their minds.

606
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:33,964
- Our policy hasn't changed.
- We only list patients for transplant

607
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:35,299
if they've been vaccinated.

608
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:36,760
But you made an exception.

609
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:38,525
Of course
they made an exception.

610
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,090
- They felt the public pressure and...
- No exceptions.

611
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,881
But if you didn't change
your policy

612
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:46,483
or make an exception, then...

613
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:51,868
Are you-are you
saying Jimmy's vaccinated?

614
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:53,924
- We did not say that.
- HIPAA privacy rules

615
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,109
prohibit the release

616
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:56,520
of protected
health care information

617
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:58,622
without consent.

618
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:06,646
- Oh, my God.
- Uh, Lola, take it easy.

619
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:08,760
I knew you lied
about a lot of things.

620
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:11,260
It's like a game to you.
But you lied to other people,

621
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:14,188
not to me.
At least, that's what I thought.

622
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:17,354
Tell me the truth right now.

623
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,250
Have you been vaccinated
all along?

624
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:27,571
Jimmy Jr. got the measles

625
00:30:27,656 --> 00:30:29,080
because of you!

626
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:32,026
No shots for your own son?

627
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:35,180
He nearly died because
it turned into pneumonia.

628
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:37,349
And I had a blood clot
from COVID,

629
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:39,223
and I was in the hospital
for weeks,

630
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:40,984
and you were vaccinated
the whole time,

631
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,890
you son of a bitch!

632
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:44,862
HIPPA doesn't apply to me.

633
00:30:44,947 --> 00:30:47,244
So the whole world will now know

634
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,091
what a liar you are.

635
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,002
Lawyer up.

636
00:30:51,087 --> 00:30:53,692
I'm divorcing you.

637
00:31:05,726 --> 00:31:09,296
Bet it'll be extra sore
with this many jabs.

638
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:11,983
One vaccine down, five to go.

639
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:13,488
Well, you're making
the right choice.

640
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,070
Oh, I regret
I didn't make it sooner.

641
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:16,937
At least
I can do my part to help.

642
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:18,866
Stop some of the damage
he caused.

643
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:21,847
"Vaccines: Guess who got them?

644
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:24,574
Begins with 'J' and ends with 'immy.'"

645
00:31:24,658 --> 00:31:27,335
Plenty more to come.
I'm gonna get back at that man

646
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,837
using the only language
he cares about.

647
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,014
All right, hit me again.

648
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:34,842
- Dr. Conrad Hawkins?
- Yeah.

649
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,844
I got your HB 2.0.
Just need to see your ID.

650
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,939
Thank you
for getting here so quickly.

651
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,700
You caught a break.
I was at Emory today.

652
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:43,351
You're a first-time user, yes?

653
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,119
Yeah, but I've read up on it.
Start slow.

654
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,373
- Monitor her heart rate, blood pressure.
- Pressure will shoot up quick.

655
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:50,191
You don't want her
to stroke out.

656
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,769
Once you give it, your lab
may refuse to run the samples.

657
00:31:52,853 --> 00:31:55,622
They'll say they're hemolyzed.
Tell them to do it anyway.

658
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,032
Uh, ignore the crit.
Trust your hemoglobin.

659
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,201
Don't look at her sat, either.
That's gonna drop.

660
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,369
It's not real.

661
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:02,779
Get a blood gas.

662
00:32:02,863 --> 00:32:04,723
- Text me with any questions.
- All right, will do.

663
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:07,714
And, uh, don't forget to snap
a photo when she's better.

664
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,191
I collect them.

665
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,412
Thank you.

666
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:14,215
She's maxed out

667
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,142
on nor epinephrine
and vasopressin.

668
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,294
I'll hang an epi drip.

669
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:18,737
All the pressors in the world

670
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:20,297
aren't gonna do anything
if she hasn't got any blood.

671
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:21,465
I'm gonna hang
another bolus of albumin.

672
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:24,243
Maybe buy us some time.

673
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:25,918
It's here.

674
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:28,012
All right.

675
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:30,657
Time to make a miracle, gents.

676
00:32:34,438 --> 00:32:35,979
All right.

677
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:45,688
Damn it.

678
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:47,007
Her sats are dropping.

679
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,432
It's not a real reading.

680
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:51,678
The HB 2.0 interferes
with the probe's ability

681
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:53,513
to measure her oxygen level.

682
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,864
She's okay.

683
00:32:54,948 --> 00:32:56,874
Just wait.

684
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,299
That's the best pressure
we've seen

685
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:05,950
- all day.
- Okay, this is her window.

686
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,861
I'll get the team
to meet me in the OR.

687
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,910
They've got her, Conrad.

688
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,528
I hope so.

689
00:33:30,553 --> 00:33:32,770
What are you most worried about?

690
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:35,066
That I decided on the HB 2.0

691
00:33:35,236 --> 00:33:36,603
too soon and she'll have
some complication.

692
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:39,438
You didn't have any other
choice. We both know that.

693
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:43,128
I'm very worried about Cade.

694
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:47,233
But I'm also worried about you.

695
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,660
Devon already covered
that territory.

696
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:51,905
I'm okay.

697
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:53,931
Are you really?

698
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,594
I think the question
everyone's thinking

699
00:33:57,678 --> 00:34:00,145
and no one is saying is...

700
00:34:01,014 --> 00:34:03,358
How personal is this, Conrad?

701
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:07,235
- It's personal for all of us.
- That's not what I'm asking.

702
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:12,240
Are you in love with Cade?

703
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,037
No.

704
00:34:17,698 --> 00:34:19,581
Are you sure?

705
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:24,002
No.

706
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:27,422
What do you mean?

707
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:32,536
She knew she had to leave,

708
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,639
so we didn't go there.

709
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,727
She put up barriers
to protect herself.

710
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:40,602
So did I.

711
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,549
What are your barriers?

712
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:48,219
Ah, it's obvious.

713
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:51,481
It always comes back to Nic.

714
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:54,817
Something stops me,
and it's not just with Cade.

715
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:57,395
It's with...

716
00:34:57,479 --> 00:35:01,415
It's with others, too.

717
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:06,312
What stops you?

718
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,739
I'm not sure.

719
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:11,550
Am I protecting myself, maybe?

720
00:35:14,588 --> 00:35:16,839
'Cause I can't face
another loss like that.

721
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:18,749
And-and...

722
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,584
do I feel like
I'm cheating on Nic?

723
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:22,561
I don't know. Um...

724
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:27,517
All I know
is that whatever I feel

725
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:29,568
only goes so far.

726
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,281
And then the walls come up.

727
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:40,912
Maybe you just need
a little push.

728
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:48,528
How's it going?

729
00:35:49,878 --> 00:35:51,874
They're prepping her
as carefully

730
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,861
as they can.

731
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:56,263
But I think they're ready now.

732
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:03,386
Those laps pads are all
that's staunching the bleeding.

733
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,814
Pulling them out
could unleash a torrent.

734
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:08,940
If it does, her survival
depends on that team.

735
00:36:11,886 --> 00:36:13,304
Okay, on three.

736
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:16,865
- Let's do it.
- One, two, three.

737
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,554
I need suction in here.

738
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:22,813
2-0 stick tie to me now.

739
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:25,999
Stitch. Suction. More suction.

740
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:29,838
All right, bleeding is coming
from the lesser sac.

741
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:33,341
I need better retraction.

742
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:34,676
Our pressure isn't pretty, team.

743
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,918
I'm giving
more blood substitute.

744
00:36:36,002 --> 00:36:37,570
Damn it, the bowel's
more injured

745
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,013
than anticipated.
I'm gonna try and save it.

746
00:36:38,097 --> 00:36:39,654
Stapler.

747
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:42,025
We got a bleeder
at the head of the pancreas.

748
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:44,202
And at the stump of
the splenic artery. I need to tie it off.

749
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,317
I'm dangerously close

750
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:46,840
to the SMA. More suction.

751
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:48,621
Come on, I need help here.

752
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:15,106
She made it through the night?

753
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,258
Yeah.

754
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:21,318
Do you think she'll live?

755
00:37:21,402 --> 00:37:23,171
I don't know.

756
00:37:23,255 --> 00:37:25,732
But if she does,

757
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:26,832
the question is

758
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:29,601
is she gonna have
permanent brain damage?

759
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:34,427
We're going to extubate her now.
We're gonna know more soon.

760
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,852
I want to be hopeful,

761
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:40,770
but she lost so much blood.

762
00:37:43,016 --> 00:37:47,253
That's a sickening thought,
given how Nic died.

763
00:37:47,337 --> 00:37:48,445
It's like he wants to

764
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:52,073
relive what happened to Nic
and rewrite the ending.

765
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:57,996
I wish we could rewrite
our ending.

766
00:38:06,356 --> 00:38:08,882
I never saw it coming.

767
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:18,451
I want us to find ground
we can stand on somehow

768
00:38:18,535 --> 00:38:20,810
so we can work together.

769
00:38:23,798 --> 00:38:26,550
I can't imagine that right now.

770
00:38:26,634 --> 00:38:28,443
I guess we're both...

771
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,988
...hurting.

772
00:38:45,395 --> 00:38:48,906
"Liar, liar,
super-vaxxed pants on fire."

773
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,667
"How many people died
because he lied?"

774
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:54,411
- It's a temporary reaction.
- Yeah,

775
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:58,324
well, dishonesty
is a self-inflicted wound.

776
00:38:58,408 --> 00:39:00,993
Sure, it brought you fame,
but the truth always comes out,

777
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:03,663
and now you have to deal
with the reactions.

778
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:05,681
They're talking about me.

779
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:07,424
There's no such thing
as bad press.

780
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:08,425
And I know
how to deal with this.

781
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:09,944
They need a new villain.

782
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:11,279
Lola will fill that bill.

783
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:13,281
Ah, let me guess.

784
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:15,341
Because she went public online

785
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:17,193
and called you out
as vaccinated,

786
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:19,621
- you're going to say she's lying.
- You know how many people

787
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:22,439
who say they're anti-vax
are really vaccinated?

788
00:39:22,523 --> 00:39:24,274
Do they all lie to their wives?

789
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:25,852
I didn't lie to her.

790
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:28,037
She's the liar, looking
for a big divorce settlement.

791
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:29,822
Hell, she cheated on me.

792
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:31,448
And that's what
you're gonna tell your audience.

793
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:34,026
Yeah. And they'll believe me.

794
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,303
Because they want to.

795
00:39:35,387 --> 00:39:36,611
Look, nobody cares anymore

796
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:38,973
if you lie. They're happy
to believe pure fiction.

797
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:40,032
Well,

798
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:41,959
good doctors care, Mr. Miller.

799
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:46,130
If we didn't, our patients
would die. Including you.

800
00:39:46,214 --> 00:39:48,541
There would be no such thing
as organ transplants.

801
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:49,651
Blah, blah, blah.

802
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:52,302
All you doctors want to do
is bully people.

803
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:53,461
Do you always resort

804
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:55,231
to personal attacks
when you lose an argument?

805
00:39:55,315 --> 00:39:57,641
You bet I do. Because it works.

806
00:39:57,725 --> 00:39:59,327
Well, I'm not here
to debate you.

807
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:00,644
I have other patients
to tend to.

808
00:40:00,728 --> 00:40:03,072
I'm just here to let you know
that you cannot

809
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:05,833
have a transplant at Chastain.

810
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:08,728
Vaccines are not the only thing
you need to be listed.

811
00:40:08,812 --> 00:40:10,229
You also have to have someone

812
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:11,731
who's willing to be
your caregiver

813
00:40:11,815 --> 00:40:14,658
for a year after the transplant.

814
00:40:14,742 --> 00:40:18,495
That would have been your wife.

815
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:19,906
Well, I'll find someone else.

816
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:23,259
Well, the thing is
it can't be someone you pay.

817
00:40:23,343 --> 00:40:25,077
That's what the rules say.

818
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:28,338
It has to be someone
who actually cares about you.

819
00:40:28,422 --> 00:40:30,750
You think I don't have that?

820
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:32,942
You tell me.

821
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,347
You know what?
I am done with you.

822
00:40:37,431 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm gonna get myself
to another hospital.

823
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:42,186
Yeah. Good luck with that,
Mr. Miller.

824
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,496
Yeah. Mm.

825
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:10,021
Hey, partner.

826
00:41:17,656 --> 00:41:21,866
I can't tell you how happy I am
to hear those two words.

827
00:41:25,313 --> 00:41:28,540
You must have had some drama.

828
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,404
Any pain?

829
00:41:34,488 --> 00:41:36,714
Not too much.

830
00:41:37,584 --> 00:41:40,152
I must be on some fine drugs.

831
00:41:40,236 --> 00:41:43,012
Well, I made sure of that.

832
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:54,774
Thank you.

833
00:42:14,104 --> 00:42:16,546
It's good news.

834
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:27,836
Your neuro exam is pristine,
Dr. Sullivan.

835
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,672
And it makes me very happy
to say that.

836
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,990
It'll be a long recovery,
but you're on your way.

837
00:42:32,074 --> 00:42:33,992
And we have more good news.

838
00:42:34,076 --> 00:42:36,253
More blood, your type,
just arrived downstairs.

839
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:38,088
Your father's here.

840
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:41,382
Just flew in from Seattle.
Came straight from the airport.
