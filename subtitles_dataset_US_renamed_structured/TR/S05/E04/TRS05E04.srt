<i>Don't miss the new
season of "The Resident."</i>

00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:06,722
This is life or
death right now.

7
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:19,569
Why are you here?

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,871
- I'm not here to see you.
- I know this is hard,

9
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,540
but I can't have you
in my life right now.

10
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,175
What's your beef
with Dr. Sutton?

11
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,377
She's my mother.
She gave birth to me

12
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,679
and then wanted nothing
to do with me.

13
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,882
The defining experience
in your life is abandonment.

14
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,085
<i>Conrad Hawkins,
there's been an accident.</i>

15
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,721
<i>Nicolette Nevin.
Single-car collision.</i>

16
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:40,057
<i>Significant intrusion
on the driver's side.</i>

17
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:41,291
Her brain is herniating.

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,213
Nic won't recover
from this, Conrad.

19
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,251
<i>Open the tunnel.</i>

20
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,695
Open the tunnel. Oh, there it is.

21
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:14,391
Hey.

22
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,177
Hold still.

23
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,931
You know, you've been visiting
the crash site

24
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,834
every morning
for the past two weeks.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,772
You never come home
feeling better or...

26
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:31,241
more informed
than when you left.

27
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,676
I'm just wondering

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,812
if this might be doing you
more harm than good.

29
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,232
Just something
I need to do, Dad.

30
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,752
There had to have been a
medical cause for the accident.

31
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,855
Cops believe she was alone
on the road.

32
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,957
It wasn't dark.

33
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,294
No skid marks.

34
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:53,197
She could have fallen asleep.

35
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,466
Nah, unlikely.
When she was driving,

36
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,368
she always had a thermos
of coffee with her.

37
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,370
It was her thing.

38
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,273
Maybe she was texting.

39
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,842
She wouldn't do that.

40
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,512
The car could have caused her
to swerve.

41
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,980
Kid on a bike.

42
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,782
Deer. Raccoon. Who knows?

43
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,652
Whenever we went on trips,
she always wanted to drive.

44
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,105
She hated the way I drove.

45
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,558
She was a great driver.

46
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,660
Just doesn't make sense.

47
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,862
I know the answer's
in her medical records.

48
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,465
I know.

49
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,885
I, uh, think I'm gonna take GiGi
to the park.

50
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,420
Let ball, please.

51
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,088
Let's take a minute?

52
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,828
You know, Dr. Devi showed me
a real slick way

53
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,030
to tack down hernia mesh
laparoscopically.

54
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,317
The intern Devi?

55
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,770
Have you managed to get Kit Voss
into bed yet?

56
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,672
Next question, Dr. Kranepool.

57
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:11,608
You're taking instruction
from children, for God's sakes.

58
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,777
You can't close on the boss.

59
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,412
I showed you how to be

60
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,113
an unrelenting master
of the universe.

61
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,184
- The hell happened?
- Serve the ball, tough guy.

62
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:22,452
They see your confidence
is gone, it's over.

63
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,121
Yeah, well, my universe is a
little smaller than it once was,

64
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,923
but my confidence...

65
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,392
is fine.

66
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,203
Eh...

67
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,770
Yeah, I'm needed in the OR.

68
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,039
We'll finish this up tonight,

69
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,859
if you're not too bushed.

70
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,984
Now, with all
the fibrous tissue removed,

71
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,321
what is
the critical anatomical region

72
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,822
we're looking at, Dr. Devi?

73
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,758
- The hepatocystic triangle.
- Good.

74
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,744
Now, zoom in with the camera.

75
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:05,913
More.

76
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:12,185
Until I tell you to stop,
Doctor.

77
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,022
Yes. Finally.

78
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,725
That's good.

79
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,477
Could you talk me
through the advantages

80
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,580
of operating at such a high
magnification, Dr. Kranepool?

81
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,515
I've only read
that the field of view

82
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,150
should be kept at a wide angle.

83
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,118
Well, if you're lucky, you'll
reach a point in your career

84
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,754
where you don't need books
to remind you

85
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:33,022
of basic anatomy...
Though I have my doubts.

86
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,858
I know the location
of every structure

87
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,779
in and out
of my field of vision.

88
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,165
Blood keeps pooling,
and the source is outside

89
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,933
- of our field of vision.
I'm zooming out, Doctor.

90
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:48,505
- Do not zoom out!
- Point the camera inferior

91
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,139
More.

92
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,841
Now to the right.

93
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:55,763
- I'm losing orientation, Doctor.
- Then suction faster.

94
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,384
I have to pull
back. I can't see anything.

95
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:03,019
My way or
the highway, Dr. Snowflake.

96
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,138
BP's falling.

97
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,302
Good save, Dr. Devi.

98
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:19,903
If you'd still like
to widen your view, Doctor,

99
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,089
feel free to watch
from the hallway.

100
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,848
Hey, thanks for meeting me.

101
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,318
- Why did you call me?
- Something you said to me

102
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,819
keeps coming back.

103
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,254
- Yeah? What?
- I'm not interested

104
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,256
in that clichÃ©-filled lecture
you're itching to deliver

105
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,527
about bad choices
and unmet potential served up...

106
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:44,928
You are dangerously close

107
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,247
to putting me off of
my favorite breakfast burrito.

108
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:52,268
The defining experience
of my life is abandonment.

109
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,270
That's what you said.

110
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,905
You disagree?

111
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,841
I don't think that's true.

112
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,109
Let me help you out.

113
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,079
Do you surround yourself
with lower companions?

114
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:06,115
Huh? Half-bright stoners
who won't ever leave

115
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,419
because you make them
feel special by association?

116
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,598
Do you gravitate toward
emotionally withholding women

117
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:18,301
who reflect your false sense
of your own worthlessness?

118
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,599
When you can't draw ego
sustenance from your acolytes,

119
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:26,135
do you have grandiose fantasies
about who you might become

120
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,389
to show your bio mom Billie
what a mistake she's made?

121
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,977
If you've answered yes
to any of those questions,

122
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:38,899
the defining experience
in your life is abandonment.

123
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,321
So, Trevor, what do you know
about your birth father?

124
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,365
All she told me
about my biological father

125
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,393
was that he was
three years older than her,

126
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,260
teenage ladies' man,

127
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,546
- football stud.
- Mm.

128
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,500
So, two careless
high school kids, huh?

129
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,510
- No, no, put that back.
- Are you kidding?

130
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,479
- We got to record what happens.
- Trevor, listen to me. Stop.

131
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,481
Okay, this is how it's gonna go.

132
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,182
You only speak when spoken to.

133
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,984
It's only "Yes, sir"
or "No, sir,"

134
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,353
and keep your hands
in plain sight at all times.

135
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,839
This is not a request.

136
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,357
Morning, Officer.

137
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,193
Sir, are you aware that
your right taillight is out?

138
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,496
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about that, Officer.

139
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,656
I ordered the part from Germany.

140
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,682
It should be here tomorrow.
You know, it's kind of hard

141
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:36,440
to track down European
vintage car parts locally.

142
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:39,042
License and registration, please
Sure.

143
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,644
And then I'm gonna need you both

144
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,930
to step out of the car,
gentlemen.

145
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,454
Easy, all right?

146
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,606
Just easy.

147
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,063
Keep your hands on the car
where I can see 'em, gentlemen.

148
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:05,134
Oh, I cannot wait
till your pasty ass finds out

149
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,671
- what he does for a living.
- Hey, Trevor, chill.

150
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,138
What was that?

151
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,374
I mean, all you see is
two Black men in a car

152
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,977
that's a little too nice,
so it must be stolen, right?

153
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,379
Or we must be
into something illegal.

154
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,129
- Trevor, easy. Trevor...
- And once you run the plates,

155
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:20,517
- Trevor! Trevor!
- And they're clean, suddenly you'll remember that we fit

156
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,151
the description
of a wanted Black man

157
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,887
wearing a shirt and pants,

158
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,322
- between five-one and six-eight.
- You might want to calm down, son.

159
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,925
- Oh, I'm not your son.
- Son, put your hands on that vehicle.

160
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,694
- Stop calling me "son." - Officer...
- Get your hands on the car!

161
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:31,778
Trevor, back up!

162
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,350
Call 911.

163
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,008
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

164
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,743
A cop got hit by a scooter.

165
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,762
We're on Rose,
just west of Nelson Boulevard.

166
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:52,418
- Ambulance is five minutes out.
- He won't make it that long.

167
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,751
His airway's flooded with blood.

168
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,854
In my glove box, there's a black
bag with a scalpel and pen.

169
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,539
Grab it.

170
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,240
You just helped save
a man's life.

171
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:54,693
I've been able to rule out a lot
of things based on these labs.

172
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,813
- They're, they're all normal.
- Okay. That's progress.

173
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,102
Yeah, but a problem
with her heart

174
00:09:58,186 --> 00:09:59,847
is still a distinct possibility.

175
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:03,787
Well, what exactly
are you looking for?

176
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,488
I need to know why she crashed.

177
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,357
Telemetry strip
gives me a window

178
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,994
into her cardiac rhythm while
she was in the hospital, but...

179
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,264
maybe we missed
an underlying arrhythmia.

180
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,768
- Sure, that is a possibility, but...
- But...

181
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:19,969
what?

182
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,272
But it is unlikely, right?

183
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,625
"Unlikely" is not definitive.

184
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,445
We'll have a better sense
of things

185
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,815
if I measure
every peak and valley

186
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,116
on this damn strip.

187
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,869
We find a run of PVCs,
we're onto something.

188
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:42,158
I have another pair of calipers
in the box.

189
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,377
You want to grab a strip?

190
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:48,782
Sure. Yeah.

191
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,805
Conrad said
he wants everything in here.

192
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,474
Yeah, I'll bring it to him
when I do my check-in.

193
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:02,245
Well, he is deep down
a rabbit hole right now.

194
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,180
A medical mystery tour.

195
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,315
I'm not sure I like it.

196
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,402
Nic's dead.
Nothing's gonna change that.

197
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,756
So let him tilt at windmills.

198
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,358
It's not hurting you.

199
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,845
If he doesn't find
what he wants, then what?

200
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,564
You'll be there for him.

201
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,950
We all will.

202
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,789
Are we absolutely sure
that Nic couldn't have...

203
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:43,286
Are we absolutely sure that Nic
couldn't have had a seizure

204
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,588
or an ischemic stroke?

205
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,590
I know by the time
we did the scan,

206
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,860
her brain was swollen, so...

207
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,596
it might have been hard
to see something like that.

208
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,699
You know, we've been through all
of her labs and her tox screen.

209
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,466
Nothing suggests
she was predisposed

210
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,235
to a seizure or a stroke.

211
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,454
You're absolutely certain?

212
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,778
Having a hard time
connecting the dots here.

213
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,580
Yeah, I get that.

214
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,117
And you are a very formidable
diagnostician...

215
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,219
Oh, don't humor me, Billie.

216
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,121
Listen, but whatever
you're looking for,

217
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,407
it didn't happen in Nic's brain.

218
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,476
I'm sorry.

219
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,063
Nic was mine.

220
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,898
I was hers. It was us.

221
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,517
There was no me.

222
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,070
Now the only thing I recognize
about myself

223
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,656
is that I'm a doctor.

224
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,109
After my mom died,

225
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,079
my dad was finally able
to remember to hang up his towel

226
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,948
instead of tossing it
on the bed,

227
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:47,416
which drove her crazy.

228
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,837
I just kept telling him
how proud she'd be.

229
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,874
And I'll say the same to you.

230
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,528
Did Nic ever feel faint
or pass out as a kid,

231
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,882
like when you guys were playing
sports or something?

232
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,187
Not that I can remember.

233
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,373
Sorry.

234
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,775
<i>- e could have lost the patient.
- H</i>

235
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,442
<i>He would have lost the patient</i>

236
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,695
if it weren't for Dr. Devi.

237
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,883
And then he told me to go stand
in the hallway.

238
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,869
What would you do?

239
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,388
You know that Kranepool and Bell
are super tight, right?

240
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,991
They've been besties
since we used leeches.

241
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,292
I'm aware of that.

242
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:33,629
Also, the Hippocratic oath is:
"Do no harm."

243
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:36,632
Not: "Stop an old white guy
who could destroy your career

244
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,534
from maybe doing harm."

245
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,969
I'm also aware of that.

246
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,906
But if his skills are diminished
and he wrecks a patient,

247
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,875
I would never forgive myself
for doing nothing.

248
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,911
I get that.

249
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,814
If you do decide
to make your concerns known,

250
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,582
just find a way to do it
without leaving a paper trail

251
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,052
or saying anything
that could be quoted, all right?

252
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,354
What am I supposed to do?

253
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,157
Communicate them
with an interpretive dance?

254
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,360
I would pay to see that.

255
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,230
You're not being helpful.

256
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,265
All right, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

257
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,919
I'm just too tired to think
right now.

258
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,071
Well, maybe Conrad
will be back soon,

259
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,206
and you won't have
to keep covering his shifts.

260
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,592
He is on his own schedule.

261
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,046
But I miss you.

262
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,764
I miss you, too.

263
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,683
I'm gonna have
to force myself to eat

264
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,686
before my next surgery
with Kranepool.

265
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,023
40-ish male versus
scooter high speed.

266
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,625
Airway secured during the field.
Level-1 trauma now.

267
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,978
Bay Ten.

268
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,881
Let's go, fellas.

269
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,971
All right, on my count.

270
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,058
One, two, three.

271
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,694
All right,
I'm starting the primary survey.

272
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,746
Crackles bilaterally.

273
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,382
He's tachy to the 150s.
Let's get him on a vent.

274
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,417
Let's get a vent in here!

275
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,386
The field cric
is perfectly done.

276
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,073
- This your work?
- Me and the kid.

277
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,163
Aortic regurgitation due
to severely damaged valve.

278
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,899
He's in rapid heart failure.

279
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:19,586
Call to the OR.
Book an emergency sternotomy.

280
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,007
- Hey, AJ.
- Yeah?

281
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,809
- Were you at the scene of the accident?
- Oh, yeah.

282
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,145
Officer Winnaker pulled us over
and out of the car

283
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,580
for driving-while-Black,
then he pulled his gun out

284
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,917
and he got hit by the scooter.

285
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,251
- His gun?
- Yeah.

286
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,487
Are you sure you're in the right
headspace to work on him?

287
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,789
Pravesh, I saved
the guy's life once already.

288
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,692
I am not gonna lower
my batting average to .500,

289
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,546
patient's bad intentions
notwithstanding.

290
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,121
Thank you.

291
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,970
Hello, Dr. Devi.

292
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,656
I have cried twice this morning

293
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,576
trying to choose
a replacement for Nic.

294
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,632
Are you all right?

295
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,002
Say something, dear.

296
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,291
There's something
you need to communicate to me?

297
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,131
Oh... you wish
to remain anonymous.

298
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,817
Clever girl.

299
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,487
So, uh, does this concern
another doctor at the hospital?

300
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,025
A surgeon you've worked with?

301
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:54,330
Someone in whose OR
you've recently been?

302
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,652
Dr. Kranepool?

303
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,439
Oh.

304
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,574
Crunch no more.
I'll look into it.

305
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,576
Oh, one more question.

306
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,762
Can I have one of those?

307
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,376
<i>Aaron Kranepool?</i>

308
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:15,350
- That's ridiculous.
- I've poked around.

309
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,586
- His stats are declining precipitously.
- Oh, come on, Kit,

310
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,887
the guy's a machine.

311
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,923
He's only a couple of years
older than me...

312
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,126
- He still beats me at squash.
- You told me he cheats.

313
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,196
Well, no, I think what I said
was he's highly competitive.

314
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,865
I understand he's a good friend
and he's important to you.

315
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,200
No, it's-it's more than that.

316
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,069
He was a resident
when I was an intern,

317
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,870
and an attending
when I was a resident,

318
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,906
and he was... he was my example.

319
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,409
I'm sure he was a damn good one,

320
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,378
but it appears
things have changed.

321
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,447
Now, wasn't he
just down at Hopkins

322
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,449
for their
in-depth skills assessment?

323
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,884
You know self-reporting
poor results

324
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,319
for the Hopkins assessment
is optional.

325
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,488
The only person who sees it
is the doctor being tested.

326
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,990
Yeah, okay, okay.
So somebody reported him.

327
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,460
I don't need to know who,
just...

328
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:00,813
what exactly was said.

329
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:05,968
I couldn't possibly repeat
verbatim what was told to me.

330
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,436
Why not?

331
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,772
You are an exemplary surgeon.

332
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,775
I know you can't imagine
entering an OR

333
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,344
without being in perfect mental
and physical shape.

334
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,746
It would be anathema to you.

335
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,651
Uh... well, exemplary,
I don't know.

336
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,820
I need to know

337
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,189
if there's even a small chance

338
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,491
that Kranepool
could injure a patient.

339
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,925
What do you need me to do?

340
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,760
He has a surgery this afternoon.

341
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,129
I'd like you to observe.

342
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:36,765
Fine. I'm-I'm sure
whatever was said is overblown.

343
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,385
Let's hope so.

344
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,138
<i>And you're absolutely
sure your hands were visible</i>

345
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,106
the entire time?

346
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,941
Oh, my God,
for the third time, yes...

347
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,210
sir.

348
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,178
We just want to make sure
we have an accurate account.

349
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,813
Now, it's a natural reaction
to be angry

350
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:51,907
when you're pulled over.

351
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:53,845
Maybe you raised your voice,
took a step

352
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:56,552
- towards Officer Winnaker...
- How do you guys do this with a straight face, huh?

353
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,122
I mean, if we were white,
we'd never be hands on the hood

354
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:01,490
- for a damn taillight.
- Easy, now. That's a serious accusation.

355
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,692
Okay, I'm done answering
your transparent,

356
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,129
- insulting questions.
- Excuse me, officers.

357
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,664
I'm pretty sure
you have all you need.

358
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:09,965
You have our phone numbers.

359
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,667
If you need
any more information,

360
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,736
you know how to contact us.

361
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,037
We'll be in touch.

362
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,224
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:26,933
You want to watch me operate
on Officer Winnaker?

364
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,319
Yeah, I'm a little busy, so...

365
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,554
I'll pass.

366
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,322
Oh, yeah?

367
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:36,243
What, you got to go home
and cook up some Molly?

368
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,662
Go to the admin office
on the second floor.

369
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,415
You have to fill out
some paperwork.

370
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,293
What is going on
with you and Trevor?

371
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,945
He called me this morning
and we had breakfast.

372
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,914
Okay, I told you,
this is very complicated for me.

373
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,883
And with Nic gone,
I'm already pretty ragged.

374
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,719
- I don't need this, AJ.
- I get it, I get it. I'm sorry.

375
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,054
Bringing him here
was not part of the plan.

376
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,258
But then there seemed to be
a lesson in there

377
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,694
- that the kid could learn...
- Wait, who asked you to give life lessons

378
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,180
to the kid I gave up?

379
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,885
Why are you so angry with him?

380
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,770
Huh?

381
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,472
He's curious about his genes.

382
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,642
He has a suspicion that nature
has a bigger hand in who he is

383
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,711
than nurture,
and those kind of questions

384
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,813
can torture a kid.

385
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,481
They tortured me.

386
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,483
You're overstepping,

387
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,336
and you need to stop.

388
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,063
What did I tell you?

389
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,983
Look at this run of PVCs.

390
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,502
Yeah, but it's...

391
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,804
I know she had a significant
brain injury at the time,

392
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:59,007
but before you say
anything else, look at this.

393
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,744
From when Nic got stabbed.
Her EKGs.

394
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:03,279
Okay.

395
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,281
Multiple PVCs.

396
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:09,017
This could be the answer
to something, but...

397
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,819
I don't know what.

398
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:14,022
Uh, she could have had
a genetic heart condition.

399
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,924
Her mother died young... maybe
that's what happened to Nic.

400
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,261
Did GiGi inherit it?

401
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,413
If I know, I can address it.

402
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,171
When my father died, you
let me do what I needed to do,

403
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,691
and I want to repay
that kindness to you.

404
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,876
But what you found

405
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,178
are a few premature
ventricular contractions,

406
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,180
all when Nic was sick,
post-stabbing,

407
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:41,100
or with, ultimately,
a fatal brain injury.

408
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,489
Do you honestly...

409
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,941
find this significant?

410
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,295
Because...

411
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,229
I know it's not meaningful,
and I know that

412
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,115
because of what you taught me.

413
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,395
<i>Bearing the Unbearable.</i>

414
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,080
<i>The Other Side of Sadness.</i>

415
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:18,253
<i>How to Go On Living
When Someone You Love Dies.</i>

416
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,324
Those books
don't have the answer I need

417
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:23,843
when GiGi asks me
how her mother died.

418
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,070
The heart is exposed.

419
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,156
Prepare the bypass catheters.

420
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,775
Oh.

421
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,445
- Well, that could be a problem.
- Dr. Austin?

422
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:45,914
The proximal aorta was damaged
in the trauma.

423
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,784
People, we have to work quickly
if we don't want...

424
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:54,022
Ruptured aorta.

425
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,392
All right, everybody, listen up,
there's a new plan.

426
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,260
All eyes on me.

427
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,262
We're gonna have to crash
on pump.

428
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,964
You two cannulate
the femoral artery.

429
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,733
I will cannulate the IVC
through the right atrium.

430
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,735
Be ready to start bypass
on my order.

431
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,704
We are against the clock,
people,

432
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,523
so let's move fast.

433
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,237
All right, clamp number one.

434
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,010
Scalpel.

435
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,052
Catheter.

436
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,809
BP 87/48 and dropping.

437
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:50,497
Let's start the bypass. Cool
the blood to 18 degrees Celsius.

438
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:54,517
Did we do it, Dr. Austin?

439
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,351
You did great.
But don't get too excited.

440
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,455
That was just step one
in keeping this man alive.

441
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,957
Once his temperature cools
to 18 degrees,

442
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,993
we will drain all the blood
out of his body.

443
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,095
- The hell?
- And then we will perform

444
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,799
a two-hour repair in 20 minutes
to give him his blood back

445
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,419
before he goes brain-dead.

446
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,506
Devi, where you headed?

447
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,007
OR One, Kranepool.

448
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,476
Hear he's a disaster.

449
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,445
It's our second dance
of the day.

450
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,947
He almost killed a patient
and then threatened to exile me.

451
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,281
I've been anxious all morning

452
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,183
at the thought of returning
to his OR.

453
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,218
I'm about to do battle
with a wicked spinal GBM.

454
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,220
- Love to have you with me.
- I wish I could.

455
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,156
Now let's hope I don't pass out
from the stress.

456
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,533
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

457
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:46,802
You asked me if Nic
ever passed out playing sports...

458
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:50,172
And she didn't... but she
did faint a few times at school.

459
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,240
Mm, when and what were
the circumstances?

460
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,309
<i>Like, right before a big test.</i>

461
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,178
<i>You know, midterm or a final.</i>

462
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,246
It's probably nothing,
but I thought you should know.

463
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,716
<i>- Can you do me a favor?</i>
- Name it.

464
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,751
<i>I-I need you to call Kyle.</i>

465
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,252
He's-he's not speaking to me.

466
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,254
Just, you can make up some
excuse why you're calling him,

467
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,524
and then,
I don't know, I just...

468
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,994
I need you to ask him if Nic's
mom had a history of fainting.

469
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,746
Will do.

470
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,945
Did your med school teach you
to assist the attending

471
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,164
or get in his way?

472
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,701
To assist, Dr. Kranepool.

473
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,558
Are you deaf and blind?

474
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,760
No. I don't have
either of those disabilities.

475
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:46,929
I've had
enough. You need to scrub out,

476
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,531
get your eyes and ears checked.
Now.

477
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:50,566
- I'm sorry, Dr. Kranepool.
- Get out!

478
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,118
Now.

479
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,293
Patient is tachy to the 170s.

480
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,365
I need suction over here.

481
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:12,821
Gloves, please.

482
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,256
Thank you.

483
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,792
Randolph, what the hell?

484
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:17,893
I was watching upstairs.

485
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,261
Just looked like
you could use a hand.

486
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,463
You were babysitting me?

487
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,665
Suction.

488
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:23,999
Lap pad.

489
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,174
And clamp.

490
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:41,016
- You crossed a line.
- Look, you shouldn't even have been in the neighborhood

491
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,517
of the right hepatic,
then you blew through it

492
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,186
and you couldn't find it while
your patient was bleeding out.

493
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,510
You didn't leave me any choice.

494
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,705
You've got a set of balls
on you.

495
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,040
Hey, we need to have
an honest conversation

496
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,859
about your fitness for surgery.

497
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,145
- Are you for real?
- Oh, come on, Aaron,

498
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,114
what happened in there was
very problematic.

499
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:13,982
Oh, please.
You put on your cape

500
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,884
and flew in for a minor miscue.

501
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,820
You're a nervous Nellie.

502
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:19,806
You should be embarrassed.

503
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:25,277
Will you show me the
results of your Hopkins tests?

504
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,230
When did you become
so sanctimonious?

505
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,564
Surgery is rarely flawless.

506
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,299
- There are always complications.
- You used to be

507
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,401
the closest thing to flawless
I've ever seen.

508
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:38,841
I recall an appendectomy
you performed a few years back.

509
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:40,308
Your patient died on your table.

510
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,210
I didn't come knocking
on your door, did I?

511
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,412
But you should have.

512
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,915
I'm not the same man I was
four years ago.

513
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,583
- You got that right.
- It's the greatest regret of my life,

514
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,152
putting my own self-interest
ahead of my patients'.

515
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:51,687
And if you want
to hold me accountable

516
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:53,521
for the appendectomy,
I will take what comes.

517
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,342
Good God, you've lost your way.

518
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,327
For the sake of our friendship,

519
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,596
don't mention
my surgical skills again.

520
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,899
I'll see you
on the squash court tonight.

521
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,433
A good, old-fashioned drubbing

522
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:09,021
will put your feet back
on the ground where they belong.

523
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,112
Right now
he's an enormous liability.

524
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,547
I wish I could fire him,
but we both know

525
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,050
- how difficult that is.
- That's like firing a tenured professor.

526
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:24,419
Plus, he's an icon.

527
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:27,255
And he's entitled
to due process.

528
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,623
Well, it's a moot point.

529
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,893
We don't have
the necessary documentation

530
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:33,528
- to prove he's dangerous.
- True.

531
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,297
And most
of his patients' complications

532
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,565
fall under "acceptable" risks
of surgery.

533
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,952
Oh, the system doesn't work.

534
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,205
Yeah, well...

535
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,307
we've been allowed to build
too high a wall

536
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,209
to protect ourselves.

537
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:50,378
Bottom line,
Kranepool is a time bomb,

538
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,732
and I don't want him exploding
on my watch.

539
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,219
<i>Yeah.</i>

540
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:59,254
We're getting close, kiddo.

541
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:02,257
Grandpa Kyle told Aunt Billie

542
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:05,894
that Mama and her mama
both fainted

543
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,230
a few times over the years.

544
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,833
Yeah. Yeah.

545
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,485
Always in the summer.

546
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,971
I know.

547
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,906
Always in the summer,
when it's hot

548
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,842
and they were dehydrated.

549
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,610
They didn't think
it was significant back then,

550
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,146
but now...

551
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,149
I think... it is very...

552
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,752
very significant.

553
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:33,856
We got a couple more things
we need to do.

554
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,958
Okay? Oh?

555
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,592
Yeah, you like that?

556
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,996
Couple more pieces
to complete our puzzle.

557
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,998
But I promise you,

558
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:46,418
I promise you I won't stop until
we have all the answers we need.

559
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:54,342
Hey, Conrad.

560
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,378
- Listen, about today...
- Ah, forget it.

561
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,280
I think I've figured it out.

562
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:01,649
- Okay.
- Nic has a family history of early death,

563
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,151
starting with her mom.

564
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,153
They both had fainting spells.

565
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,122
Nic had PVCs on the monitor.

566
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:10,292
- Yes, but she had a normal echo and a normal EKG.
- Which proves my point.

567
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,027
Everything we're talking about
is characteristic

568
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,196
of catecholaminergic
polymorphic VT.

569
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:17,565
Listen.

570
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,068
Are you serious?

571
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,904
Do you know how rare that is?

572
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,738
But it makes perfect sense.

573
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,458
A genetic form
of sudden cardiac failure.

574
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,895
Conrad...

575
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:32,564
You can have
a normal resting heart function.

576
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:38,020
But stress and physical exertion
can cause serious arrhythmia.

577
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:40,355
You can pass out, even die.

578
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,357
Fine. I mean, that is possible.

579
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,392
All the panic attacks Nic had,

580
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,394
everything that we thought
was the thyroid,

581
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,514
that could have been CPVT.

582
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:51,366
Yes, it's a compelling theory...

583
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,201
She's stressed out
on the drive home,

584
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,602
rushing to get back to us.

585
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,371
That could have sparked
the arrhythmia.

586
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,190
Wait a second.

587
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,611
But it is a theory
without evidence.

588
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,780
That's why I brought GiGi in.

589
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,968
I'm gonna have her tested
for the CPVT gene.

590
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,638
Then I'll know.

591
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:23,631
So, um, how many times did
that cop almost die in there?

592
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,801
- Mm, by my count, three.
- Right, right.

593
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,937
So, um,
why'd you go above and beyond

594
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,139
and give this guy
the chance to destroy

595
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,941
a few more brothers
down the road?

596
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:35,310
Look, the best I can do

597
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,779
in the face of ignorance
is be better.

598
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:40,448
My excellence is
the best revenge.

599
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,986
So you think this guy
is gonna change his worldview

600
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,390
because a Black doctor saved
his life with his "excellence"?

601
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,392
Come on, man, that's naive.

602
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,078
Whoa, hold up, slow your roll.

603
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,998
It's not about the cop,
Sherlock.

604
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,166
It's about me.

605
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,002
Saint or sinner,

606
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,404
they all get treated the same
underneath my knife.

607
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,572
In the sanctity of my OR,

608
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,892
there is no place
for moral relativism.

609
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:10,645
When the world around me
is irredeemable,

610
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,999
I am a righteous man.

611
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,703
What kind of man
do you want to be?

612
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:32,634
I have an early surgery
tomorrow, so let's not dawdle.

613
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:34,002
I believe it's my serve.

614
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:35,537
You served the ball
out of bounds this morning,

615
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:36,804
so it's actually my serve.

616
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:37,872
No.

617
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,474
If we're gonna settle this
on the court,

618
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,376
we got to play
by the same rules.

619
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,262
The hell
is that supposed to mean?

620
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,383
One-zero.

621
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,409
Seven-nothing.

622
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,798
I've been letting you win
for the past year.

623
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:56,084
You're not good enough.

624
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,120
Look, you taught me
how to play the game.

625
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:00,055
I could see how unbearable
it was for you to lose,

626
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,623
so I've just been ignoring
the bad calls.

627
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,375
Serve the damn ball.

628
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:16,688
No, I'm all right... fine.

629
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,697
It's your peripheral vision.
We both know that.

630
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:29,968
I can put the ball where
you can't find it every time.

631
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,239
Serve the ball.

632
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,728
I take no joy in this, A.K.

633
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,014
People are getting hurt.

634
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,150
This is your exit ramp.
Just-just take it.

635
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:05,437
Rest on your laurels
before you destroy them.

636
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,324
I have no hobbies
and three alimonies.

637
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,993
What the hell am I supposed
to do with the rest of my life?

638
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:14,028
I don't know.

639
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,782
But you got to find a new game.

640
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,382
To answer your question,

641
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:09,217
I'm not angry at him.

642
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,153
I'm trying to protect him.

643
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,420
From you?

644
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,356
He's not the product
of first love.

645
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,023
I was raped.

646
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,659
By our neighbor.

647
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:20,011
I was 13. He was a grown man.

648
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:21,863
Billie...

649
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:25,233
Trevor wants to know
who his father is.

650
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:27,853
Is that an answer anyone needs?

651
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,490
Damn.

652
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:35,577
I can't even...

653
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:39,965
begin to understand
that kind of pain.

654
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:46,120
And I can only imagine how hard
it is to even say those words.

655
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,890
So I'm honored
that you shared that with me.

656
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,892
- And, Billie, I am so...
- AJ,

657
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:53,395
don't say you're sorry.

658
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,563
You're a good man.

659
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,549
Just stay in your lane.

660
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,503
You get the results?

661
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:22,490
Uh...

662
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,259
negative.

663
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:25,660
She doesn't have it.

664
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,562
And...

665
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,548
Nic probably didn't, either.

666
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:34,402
A million things happen
every second

667
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,888
to every single person
on the planet.

668
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:43,845
Some are joyful,

669
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,780
most are inconsequential,

670
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,515
and a few...

671
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,268
are unbearable.

672
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:55,441
Those are the hardest ones
to explain.

673
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,382
Can you make peace with that?

674
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,978
You've been talking at me
nonstop all day.

675
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:20,382
What happened, you, uh, you
run out of words or something?

676
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,285
Not possible.

677
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:26,304
Yeah, I didn't think so.

678
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,525
Hey, so would it be cool
if I come back to watch

679
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:32,026
some more of your surgeries?

680
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,212
Look, Trevor, um...

681
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,399
Look, we can keep meeting up,
right?

682
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,534
You know, grab something to eat,
chop it up.

683
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,569
- Yeah.
- But, um...

684
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,223
we're gonna have to steer clear
of Chastain.

685
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,545
She, uh, she told you
not to bring me around?

686
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:52,431
Yeah.

687
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,757
What the hell
did I ever do to her?

688
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,091
Nothing.

689
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,993
Now, this is not on you.

690
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,596
This is no reflection
of your worth, Trevor.

691
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,433
This is about Billie.

692
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,735
All right?
You haven't done anything wrong.

693
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:15,603
Yeah, it doesn't feel
like that, man.

694
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,739
I know. I know, man.

695
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:22,444
And I know in the moment
you may feel... disposable.

696
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:24,211
But you are not.

697
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,581
Billie's got her own story, man.

698
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:29,535
She... she's got her own damage.

699
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,271
You're just caught up
in the crossfire.

700
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,124
You hear me?

701
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,926
Yeah.

702
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,112
Yeah, I hear you.

703
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:44,215
All right.

704
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:54,308
I'm embarrassed to admit it,
but I'm still not even sure

705
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,128
I did the right thing
reporting Kranepool.

706
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,647
Look, Kranepool
almost killed someone

707
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,315
after he banned you from his OR.

708
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,885
If you hadn't told Kit,
Bell wouldn't have been in there

709
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:05,537
to save the patient's life.

710
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,491
Thank you.

711
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,393
For what?

712
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:13,828
For confirming what I believe.

713
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,930
That people deserve the truth,

714
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:19,250
no matter how complicated
or painful it can be.

715
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:22,420
To friends, old and new.

716
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:30,028
Everything hurts.

717
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:35,349
Well, not to minimize
your discomfort...

718
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,019
but it was worth it.

719
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,788
Aaron Kranepool has retired.

720
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,597
Well...

721
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,867
I'm relieved, but...

722
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,702
maybe a little heartbroken.

723
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,639
You've saved
who knows how many lives.

724
00:40:57,723 --> 00:41:00,475
I lost an old friend
in the bargain.

725
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,209
You've done him
a great service as well.

726
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,178
Perhaps one day
he'll figure that out.

727
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,147
Oh, come on, look,

728
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:08,767
your posture cannot be helping
your discomfort. Scooch down.

729
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,855
Wait, wait, wait.

730
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,725
- How does that feel?
- Good, really...

731
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,561
That's good.

732
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,328
Just promise me

733
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,031
when it's time for me to hang up
my squash racket, you'll...

734
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,567
just-just tell me

735
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:27,735
- in no uncertain terms.
- Oh, you know I will.

736
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,203
No, I do know that.

737
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,389
It gives me great comfort.

738
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,346
Should we have that dinner
we've been trying to have?

739
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,332
I'd like that.

740
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:48,690
You know, Kit,
apropos of so many things,

741
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:51,643
there's-there's no one's opinion
of me that matters more...

742
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,061
than yours.
