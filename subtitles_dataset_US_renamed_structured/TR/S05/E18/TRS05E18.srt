<font color="#fffc00">"The Resident"...</font>

2
00:00:02,264 --> 00:00:03,757
The leg issue is a little
MS flair-up.

3
00:00:03,842 --> 00:00:05,515
Take the pressure
off the leg with this.

4
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:08,253
No, it's a concession to the disease,
and I won't make it.

5
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:11,539
Look, man, I'm preparing
for my mother's passing,

6
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,765
and when she does,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

7
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:16,055
163 anti-psychotic prescriptions

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,445
written in your name
at six different clinics.

9
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:19,790
No, I didn't do this.

10
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:22,319
The Mafia is often involved
in Medicare fraud.

11
00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:24,148
<i>And we now have
mob levels of violence.</i>

12
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,905
Doctors who assist
in our investigations

13
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,177
have been murdered.

14
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:39,653
- I can't believe this.
- Believe it.

15
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:42,758
26-year-old male found down
at Piedmont Park,

16
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,675
overdosed on olanzapine.

17
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:46,326
We were able
to bring him back,

18
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,382
but found this on him.

19
00:00:49,022 --> 00:00:50,726
It has your name on it,
but records show

20
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:53,257
- you never treated him.
- Because I didn't,

21
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:56,007
just like the overdose
from a few weeks ago.

22
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:59,774
This prescription is from the
same pharmacy as the last one.

23
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,155
Think it's a coincidence?

24
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:04,491
No.

25
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,187
We're just closing.

26
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:20,711
I'm a doctor at Chastain.
A patient came into our ER,

27
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:23,196
overdosed from a drug
he got at this pharmacy.

28
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:26,202
It lists me as the prescriber,
but I didn't write it.

29
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:28,913
I'm so sorry to hear that,

30
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:31,741
but I'm not sure
how I can help you, Doctor...?

31
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:34,874
Hawkins.
This isn't the first time.

32
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:37,671
Do you know
who's prescribing these?

33
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:44,945
I honestly thought
they were yours.

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,647
I didn't realize
patients were overdosing.

35
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:51,717
I just fill the prescriptions
that come in.

36
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:57,913
Phoebe?

37
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,734
If more fraudulent prescriptions
are being written,

38
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,186
more people could get hurt.

39
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,233
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

40
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:14,016
Wait here.

41
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:16,163
Let me go pull some records.

42
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:33,155
Who was that?

43
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,187
What are you still doing here?

44
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:38,122
Was he asking questions?

45
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,532
No. He was nobody.

46
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,710
Just a patient wanting a refill.

47
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:05,741
His credit card didn't run,
so I'm pulling his records.

48
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:15,244
- Hello?
<i>- Your pager was off.</i>

49
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,661
<i>Go Team's been activated.</i>

50
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:19,085
<i>Multi-casualty incident,
Abernathy and Lowry.</i>

51
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:20,481
Well, I'll have
to meet you there.

52
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:22,569
<i>Hurry. We need you. Now.</i>

53
00:03:44,673 --> 00:03:47,017
- Where were you?
- I'll tell you later.

54
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:48,734
Two cars were street racing.

55
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,769
One lost control,
crashed into this mini-mart.

56
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,437
Two are critical.
One is the driver.

57
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,258
- The other is the store owner.
- All right, let's split up.

58
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:55,850
I'll take this one.

59
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:59,907
We've tried everything
to move him, but a metal piece

60
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:01,462
from the door has pierced
his abdomen.

61
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:02,856
It hurts.

62
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,449
Penetrating abdominal injury.

63
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,086
Moving him could
cause more damage.

64
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:10,002
And he's got an open
femur fracture.

65
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,252
- EMTs applied a tourniquet.
- He's still bleeding out.

66
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,177
Let's give him some blood,
but we can't wait any longer.

67
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,594
We got to free him.

68
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:17,688
Grab the buzz saw.

69
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:19,532
She's still in refractory V-fib.

70
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:21,672
I'm gonna get an ultrasound.

71
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:26,736
You have to save my mother.

72
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:28,510
The car came through the window,

73
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:30,375
and she pushed me
out of the way.

74
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:35,329
She has a cardiac contusion.
Her heart's been damaged.

75
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,024
We need to start ECPR
and create a makeshift OR.

76
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:42,563
Got it.

77
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:46,056
We're gonna cut
this piece of metal

78
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:48,258
that's lodged
in your abdomen, okay?

79
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,912
I'll do it.
I got the better angle.

80
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:52,311
Hold him still.

81
00:05:00,326 --> 00:05:03,537
All right, let's get him out
and send him to Chastain.

82
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:05,420
Get a backboard over here.

83
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,170
We need a backboard!

84
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,686
Let's create a sterile field.

85
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:12,456
We're putting her on ECMO.

86
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:13,757
Can you give us an assist?

87
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,076
You sure about that?

88
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,601
She won't make it
to the hospital.

89
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:17,734
You don't know that.

90
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:19,117
We just need
to support her heart.

91
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:20,405
Let's continue compressions,
give her amio

92
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:22,086
- and get her to the ER.
- ECMO will work.

93
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,397
It's been done
in the field before.

94
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:25,170
Yeah, rarely.
In this situation,

95
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:26,624
ECMO could make things worse.

96
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,827
She could die in seconds
or end up brain-dead.

97
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:29,787
Or she lives.

98
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,216
And then you're looking
at a potential cascade

99
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,374
of complications.

100
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,529
Do it. Please.

101
00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:45,513
I don't like it.

102
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:01,272
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE RESIDENT*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 05  Episode 18</font>

Episode Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"Ride or Die"</font>
Aired on: <font color="#00ffff">April 12 2022.</font>

104
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:08,898
- Thought you left.
- Hawkins paged me. He wanted me back.

105
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:11,010
Dr. Austin, what an honor to be
on this night shift with you.

106
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:13,109
Whatever you need, I am your man.
You just tell me what to do.

107
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:14,444
Don't do anything stupid.

108
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:16,056
Which means don't do anything.

109
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:20,772
Auto versus pedestrian.

110
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:23,450
Found down in refractory V-fib
with cardiac contusion.

111
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,772
- Mom!
- This is her daughter Alicia.

112
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:26,960
Hey, let's get her out of here.

113
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:28,897
Hey, Zach, take her
to the waiting room.

114
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:31,142
We cannulated at the
scene. Briefly achieved ROSC,

115
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:32,936
but she's still
in and out of V-fib.

116
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,326
- Bay 11 is ready.
- Wait, ECPR?

117
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:37,051
You guys went rogue on this.

118
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:39,493
Never in my illustrious
surgical career

119
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:40,951
have I seen this done
in the field.

120
00:06:41,036 --> 00:06:42,647
We had a bit
of a debate on that.

121
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,283
It was a risk we had to take.

122
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:46,733
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

123
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:49,490
Maybe you both should
get on the same page.

124
00:06:51,397 --> 00:06:53,748
BP's dropped to 70/50.
Going up on norepi.

125
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,382
The daughter wants to know
when she can see her mom.

126
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:57,015
On, that's a great idea.
Why don't you bring her in

127
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:58,686
right now?

128
00:06:58,771 --> 00:06:59,962
Wait, that noise,
that can't be good.

129
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,448
Her IVC's collapsing
around the cannula.

130
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:03,382
Bolusing a liter of fluids.

131
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,154
She's hypovolemic.

132
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,319
She's failing ECMO.

133
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:07,951
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

134
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,881
Go Team didn't follow protocols.

135
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:12,076
And now we're expected
to work miracles to fix

136
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:13,725
all the complications
ECMO caused.

137
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:16,483
We lost all pressures.

138
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:17,951
I'm dropping RPMs.

139
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:23,061
We're flying blind without
continuous BP monitoring.

140
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:29,796
This the kid
who was driving the car?

141
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,694
Yes. He's broken both legs.

142
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,187
Penetrating abdominal injury.

143
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:35,490
Likely has a splenic lac
as well.

144
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,233
He's losing too much blood.

145
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:42,718
No, his sats are plummeting.

146
00:07:42,803 --> 00:07:44,077
He's gonna need to be intubated.

147
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,740
Dicey with his
hemorrhagic shock.

148
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:47,800
He could arrest
the moment he's induced.

149
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,423
Step aside.

150
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:51,944
Hey. Ring that Bell.

151
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:54,430
Make yourself useful,
push these meds.

152
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,240
It's okay.

153
00:07:56,755 --> 00:07:58,225
I got this, Boss Voss,

154
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:06,761
Oh, man, there go my snow bunnies.
They're brand-new.

155
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:09,678
This is Jayci Lee, our new

156
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:11,233
nocturnal anesthesiologist.

157
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:13,392
I'll be here all night
every night from now on.

158
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:15,942
So, most people don't like
working nights.

159
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:18,897
Oh, I come alive
when the sun goes down.

160
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:21,467
That's when I come out
of my coffin.

161
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:24,197
Could it be I'm a vampire?

162
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:27,912
Well, can we, uh, maybe discuss
your thirst for blood

163
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:29,990
at another time?

164
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:31,842
Sats coming back up.

165
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:34,826
BP is stable as well.

166
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:38,157
Okay, let's get Max to imaging.

167
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:40,334
I'll see you in the OR later.

168
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,435
Mm, party.

169
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:44,459
I'll bring the drugs.

170
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,842
Snatched her
from Atlanta General.

171
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,233
She's a superstar. Big get.

172
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:52,592
Yeah. Keep telling
yourself that.

173
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:56,522
Watch and learn. Mr. Zhou?

174
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:58,498
How is my wife?

175
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,303
We are working to stabilize her

176
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:01,928
so we can transfer her
to the ICU.

177
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:04,889
- Is she going to be okay?
- Touch and go at the moment, but she...

178
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:09,084
Your mom sustained serious
injuries to her heart.

179
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:11,819
Our doctors had to aggressively
treat her in the field,

180
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:15,006
and there are complications
we're managing right now.

181
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:17,162
- No. No, Mom.
- Don't worry.

182
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:18,850
She has a fighting chance.

183
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:22,454
We left China with nothing,
built a life here.

184
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,447
The store was her idea.

185
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:26,951
She's beat long odds before.

186
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:28,122
She will again.

187
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,100
We'll keep you updated.

188
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:32,564
<i>Man speaking Spanish nearby...</i>

189
00:09:32,737 --> 00:09:34,085
- Thank you, Doctor.
<i>- Esto es tu culpa.</i>

190
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:35,358
<i>¿Y como es esto mi culpa?</i>

191
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:36,647
Where's my son?

192
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,569
My wife got a call
saying that he was here.

193
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:40,804
Our son was in a car accident.

194
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:42,311
Excuse me.

195
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:43,404
What's his name?

196
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:45,081
Uh, Maximo Camacho.

197
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,923
Dad, those are the parents

198
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:48,935
of the street racer
that did this to Mom.

199
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:50,607
He is on his way to CT.

200
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,892
He's not staying here.
We have a VIP room

201
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:54,054
waiting for him
at Atlanta General.

202
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:56,217
What kind of father
gives a child that fast a car?

203
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:59,670
Your son ran his car into
our store. My mother may die.

204
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,943
Let's all calm down.

205
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:03,349
I have to go,
but Dr. Brooks here

206
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:05,370
will get you settled
in separate waiting rooms.

207
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,132
Great.

208
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:08,904
So just, uh,
come with me and, uh,

209
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:10,623
I'll be back
with you guys in a second.

210
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:16,919
Did you hear her?

211
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:20,271
Maximo hit someone.
That girl's mother.

212
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:23,084
He's hurt and he hurt others.

213
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:25,006
This is your fault.

214
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:39,857
Female, 30s, tachy to 140,

215
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,527
found unresponsive
at the bottom of the stairs

216
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:43,553
- to her apartment.
- Bay 10.

217
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:45,459
The neighbor
who called it in said

218
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,857
she was acting drunk
and hysterical.

219
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:54,506
Let's move her.

220
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Grab her C-spine.

221
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,560
Hawkins, what's your problem?

222
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:06,263
This is the pharmacist who
filled the fake prescriptions.

223
00:11:07,873 --> 00:11:10,555
On my count. One, two, three.

224
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:13,498
What are you talking about?

225
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,227
I went to see her
a few hours ago.

226
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:17,140
That's where I was
when you called me for Go Team.

227
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:19,115
And you confronted her?

228
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:20,925
Why the hell would you do that?

229
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,452
There was another overdose.
More pills with my name on them.

230
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:26,063
You realize this could be
blow back from your visit?

231
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:29,740
Yes. I'm aware.

232
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:33,553
Phoebe, can you hear me?

233
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:38,123
She's not waking up,
but her airway is secure.

234
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,874
No rebound tenderness.

235
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:43,209
How did she seem
when you saw her earlier?

236
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:47,018
Calm, ready to help.

237
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,029
Someone could have pushed her
down the stairs.

238
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,687
I hear you.

239
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:53,935
Or the EMT said she was drunk.
Maybe she fell.

240
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,990
Everything's on the table.
Including an accident.

241
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:01,662
Normal S1 and S2.

242
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:05,245
FAST is negative.
Let's get a tox panel.

243
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:09,056
Blown pupil.

244
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:10,413
She could have
an intracranial hemorrhage.

245
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,588
Page Billie and Leela.

246
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,568
Let's get her to CT now.

247
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:19,225
Intracranial pressures
rising fast.

248
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,975
Must've been a really bad fall.

249
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,607
We have to drill now.

250
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:41,092
How's our pharmacist doing?

251
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,482
Brain bleed is worse
than we thought.

252
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:52,631
I hear your prehospital ECMO
on the mom got complicated.

253
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:54,717
Dr. Austin is handling it.

254
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:59,154
The pharmacist's labs came back.
Blood alcohol was negative.

255
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:01,741
She wasn't drunk
when I saw her, so...

256
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:05,279
still could be a suicide attempt
or maybe she slipped.

257
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:07,571
Or again, she was pushed.

258
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,818
Could someone have seen you
at the pharmacy?

259
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:11,644
No. We were alone.

260
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,178
She left me to find
some records,

261
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:16,520
was taking forever,
I got your call, left.

262
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:18,271
Why did you go
without telling me?

263
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:20,505
- I need your permission?
- You need my help.

264
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,165
Prescription drug scams
are favored by the mob.

265
00:13:23,274 --> 00:13:25,692
They kill people who threaten
their revenue stream.

266
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:27,685
That's why we handed this
over to the FBI.

267
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,781
I can't have my name on bottles
of drugs that kill people.

268
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:35,334
That pharmacist knew something.

269
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:37,011
Maybe everything. And if
someone saw you with her...

270
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:39,076
All right, you made your point.

271
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:48,232
If it turns out that I caused
this, will I feel guilty? Yes.

272
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:52,075
Can I undo it? No.

273
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:54,333
So now we have to save her.

274
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:57,170
And contact the FBI
in the morning.

275
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:08,045
Hi, Carol.

276
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,490
Sorry to keep you waiting.

277
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,224
Thank you for making the time.

278
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,764
I feel like I've been
such a bother

279
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:17,575
to everyone for so long.

280
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,568
- Mom...
- No. No, you have been

281
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:21,013
no trouble at all.

282
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:22,952
So, AJ tells me that
you're having

283
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,952
some issues with pain.
What's going on?

284
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:29,006
My bad days are
getting worse.

285
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:31,717
My good days are, too.

286
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:33,107
She's having pain

287
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:35,859
across her chest, and it-it's
wrapping around her back.

288
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:39,139
Sometimes, when I move,

289
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:43,060
the pain is so sharp
I feel like I can't breathe.

290
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:45,404
It started a couple of days ago.

291
00:14:45,607 --> 00:14:48,441
Before that,
I was doing so well.

292
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:50,455
Yeah. Yeah, she was.

293
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:54,287
Last week, she made the most
exquisite seafood paella.

294
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:56,857
And I beat him in chess.

295
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:59,451
- Indeed you did.
- Or you let me win.

296
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:02,269
No, not at all, Mom.
That was a legit thrashing.

297
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,116
I played the King's Indian,

298
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:06,950
and she overwhelmed
my bishop pawn.

299
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:08,584
Well done.

300
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:11,542
So, are the pain meds helping?

301
00:15:11,874 --> 00:15:13,373
Some.

302
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:16,990
But they make me sleepy
and confused.

303
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:19,348
Pravesh.

304
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:22,223
We have to find out
what the cause of this is.

305
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,443
Maybe there's something
we can do.

306
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:51,763
I-I knew the cancer
was advancing, but...

307
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:55,303
Wow.

308
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:58,513
I'm so sorry, AJ.

309
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:03,224
No wonder she's in so much pain.

310
00:16:05,553 --> 00:16:08,404
The cancer has progressed
to her chest walls...

311
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,568
and her brain.

312
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:16,652
An intercostal nerve block
could help her with the pain.

313
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:20,209
All right,
let's get it done tonight.

314
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,532
And I'll take her home.

315
00:16:24,353 --> 00:16:25,593
You understand the prognosis...

316
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:28,068
Yes, I understand
the prognosis, Pravesh!

317
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,787
I'm a doctor!

318
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,568
Do you want me
to talk to her with you?

319
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,638
No.

320
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:44,818
This is on me.

321
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:55,608
Look, I'm sorry, man.

322
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:17,482
So, it's something
called a nerve block.

323
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,157
It's a minimally
invasive procedure

324
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:22,419
that treats the source
of the pain.

325
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,956
So you should
feel relief right away.

326
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:30,685
If I can just go back
to where I was before this.

327
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:37,779
What?

328
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:41,991
Um...

329
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:46,710
Well, the scans show
that the cancer is progressing.

330
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:51,013
And it's-it's now in your brain

331
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:54,292
and in the bones on your chest,

332
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:57,316
which is why it-it hurts
so much to breathe.

333
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:01,744
But the, um,
the-the met in your brain

334
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:03,824
is what's of most concern.

335
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:12,246
How long?

336
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,850
Son.

337
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:24,563
- Son, tell me.
- Uh...

338
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:28,472
Maybe a couple of months.

339
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,214
Okay.

340
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:49,824
Next steps.

341
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:53,940
We knew this was coming.

342
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:58,855
Okay, um...

343
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:03,520
Well, I-I'm going to have
to ask some questions

344
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:06,239
just to make sure
you get everything you need.

345
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:12,301
Um, what would you say are
your most important goals now?

346
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:16,207
Leaving here.

347
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,066
Staying home.

348
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,261
With you.

349
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:24,548
Okay.

350
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:29,992
And what are your
biggest fears?

351
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:34,558
I don't want to spend
any more time in a hospital.

352
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:38,566
Okay.

353
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:42,400
So that means we're gonna
have to talk about hospice.

354
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,777
Don't.

355
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,651
Not yet.

356
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:47,707
The word scares me.

357
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:49,957
That's for the...

358
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,591
That's just for the very end.

359
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:55,547
No, no, Mom, it's-it's not.
It's not.

360
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,964
No, you can have
hospice for months.

361
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,311
It's a great service that most
people wait too long to use.

362
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:05,184
You know, hospice nurses
are better

363
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:07,613
at managing pain
than most doctors.

364
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:11,244
Okay, we'll-we'll
get you equipment

365
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:14,027
to make you more comfortable,

366
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:18,352
and there will be a visiting
nurse to check on you.

367
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:22,099
And I promise you,
you will never

368
00:20:22,457 --> 00:20:25,651
have to set foot
in this hospital again.

369
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,019
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive.

370
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:35,465
Heart sounds normal.

371
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,074
Brain bleed was evacuated
without complication.

372
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:43,449
She should wake up any time now.

373
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,963
We'll ask her what happened.

374
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:47,465
Any luck with her family?

375
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:49,592
We haven't been able
to reach them.

376
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,387
Hey.

377
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:58,867
Hello, there.

378
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:03,898
Phoebe, how do you feel?

379
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,893
Where am I?

380
00:21:06,988 --> 00:21:09,613
You're at the hospital.
At Chastain.

381
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:10,896
You had a fall.

382
00:21:10,981 --> 00:21:13,121
Do you remember what happened?

383
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,245
You.

384
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:19,081
Yes, I remember.

385
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:20,490
I have to...

386
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,112
Phoebe?

387
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:31,157
She's in respiratory distress.

388
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:32,856
Her chest imaging was clear.

389
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:34,942
This looks like
Kussmaul respirations.

390
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,722
We need to get a blood gas
and get her on oxygen.

391
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:40,712
No. Where am I?

392
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:43,472
She's altered. Let's intubate.

393
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:46,222
We need a crash cart!

394
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:51,254
- She hasn't regained consciousness since?
- No.

395
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:52,903
Not since she went
into distress.

396
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:54,123
She was altered and confused.

397
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:55,942
Her blood gas shows
a severe metabolic acidosis

398
00:21:56,026 --> 00:21:57,981
that she couldn't
compensate for.

399
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,538
Well, her images just came in.

400
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:03,416
X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates.
That's new.

401
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:04,708
That could be ARDS.

402
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:07,441
Or pulmonary edema
from heart failure.

403
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,675
This is more than just
trauma from the fall.

404
00:22:09,987 --> 00:22:11,589
Something else is going on.

405
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:13,301
Well, her head CT looks good.

406
00:22:13,386 --> 00:22:14,864
She hasn't rebled.

407
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:16,341
I mean, this isn't
centrally driven.

408
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:17,691
Nor a post-op complication.

409
00:22:17,824 --> 00:22:19,216
All right,
we'll send out more labs,

410
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,802
check lactate and ketones,
get an echo.

411
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,394
Let's figure out why she's
getting worse and save her.

412
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:29,418
They said he was doing twice
the speed limit.

413
00:22:29,503 --> 00:22:31,389
Drag racing in the middle
of a busy city.

414
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:32,544
What the hell was he thinking?

415
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:34,723
What would his parents
expect him to do with a Porsche?

416
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:37,734
Oh, the usual.
Pick up milk at the market,

417
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:39,427
help out with carpool.

418
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:41,790
Oh.

419
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:45,519
Open fracture
of the right femur,

420
00:22:45,604 --> 00:22:48,714
and bilateral comminuted
tib/fib fractures.

421
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,714
I'll have to rod the femur,
ex-fix the rest.

422
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:55,084
So, grade IV splenic lac
as expected.

423
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:56,630
I will do a splenectomy
and penetrating

424
00:22:56,714 --> 00:22:57,687
foreign body removal.

425
00:22:57,772 --> 00:22:59,298
All right, let's go.

426
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:03,597
You know, we can call another
surgeon to operate with me.

427
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:06,269
Meaning?

428
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:08,681
You've had a massive
surgery earlier today,

429
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:10,333
and now another
in the middle of the night.

430
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:12,207
It would be a long day
for anyone.

431
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:14,535
The steroids are working,
the MS is under control.

432
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,470
- I haven't even needed the cane.
- Randolph,

433
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:21,277
I love you, but you can be
a stubborn old... so-and-so.

434
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:25,269
I am allowed to worry,
and notice when you're exhausted

435
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:27,925
and holding yourself upright
on a desk.

436
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:29,346
Yeah... Okay.

437
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:30,731
Yeah, am I sore? Yeah.

438
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:35,621
But... if I need relief,
I'll tell you.

439
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:45,831
All right. Eileen's labs are all
trending in the right direction.

440
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:46,878
She didn't have any other
injuries.

441
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:48,527
Just the cardiac contusion.

442
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:50,316
She still needs ECMO support,
we don't know

443
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:53,961
when she's gonna wake up,
but overall, I'm hopeful.

444
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:56,166
Can we tell her family?
They could use some good news.

445
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,497
- Let's get her up to the ICU first.
- Okay,

446
00:23:58,582 --> 00:24:01,498
let's prep for transfer, people.
This is no small feat.

447
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:04,222
Get her on the portable monitor.
Disconnect the vent.

448
00:24:04,307 --> 00:24:05,581
Start bagging.

449
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,170
Put the ECMO machine on the bed.

450
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,925
Watch the cannulas, hon.

451
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,682
Put pressure now!
Stop the bleeding.

452
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:23,643
Starting compressions.

453
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,634
You tore her artery.

454
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:26,916
I didn't mean to.

455
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:28,900
Hundley, page Austin.

456
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,002
We have to recannulate here,
then get her to surgery

457
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:32,439
so we can repair the artery.

458
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,368
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Well, I was...

459
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:47,752
Wrong.
You weren't thinking.

460
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:49,587
No, sir.
I mean, uh, yes, sir.

461
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:55,182
Uh, Dr. Austin,

462
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:56,945
that other stretcher
doesn't seem to be slowing down.

463
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,512
Your finger in her femoral
artery is the only thing

464
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:01,189
keeping her alive.
Figure it out.

465
00:25:01,274 --> 00:25:04,783
- Heads up! Move, move, move.
- On your right!

466
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:10,346
- That was...
- The bare minimum.

467
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:11,614
Now, listen, I have no time

468
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:13,416
for the stupidity
for which you are prone,

469
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:16,768
so from here on out,
you do not talk, you do not move

470
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:17,888
and you do not breathe

471
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,995
- unless I give you express permission.
- Yes, sir.

472
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,221
I'll step it up.

473
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:24,225
That was not me
giving you permission.

474
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,644
<i>♪ Have wanted it this way ♪</i>

475
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:28,153

<i>♪ I do believe I'm feeling

477
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,441
Who put that there?

478
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:45,011
Borrowed it
from the ophthalmic surgeons.

479
00:25:45,096 --> 00:25:46,611
They rarely work nights.

480
00:25:46,696 --> 00:25:48,707
Your throne, Dr. Bell.

481
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:50,939

<i>♪ I do believe I'm feeling

486
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,758
This doesn't make sense.

487
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,703
Phoebe's osmolar gap
is decreasing

488
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:20,306
while her anion gap
is increasing.

489
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:21,553
But her lactate is normal.

490
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:23,001
Along with most
of her other labs.

491
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:25,156
But she's starting
to go into renal failure.

492
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:26,881
We're running out of time.

493
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,563
Whatever is making Phoebe worse
is literally undetectable.

494
00:26:37,624 --> 00:26:40,125
What if it's because
you can't actually see it?

495
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,852
Is there a Wood's lamp here?

496
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:49,524
No, but we can use my phone,

497
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:52,289
some tape
and blue and purple markers.

498
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:54,641
Nice.

499
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:58,625
- Here's tape.
- Place it over the light.

500
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,144
Two more.

501
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:15,071
And there's our makeshift
black light.

502
00:27:15,155 --> 00:27:16,844
Used it once at an escape room.

503
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,828
An escape room, huh?
Let's give it a try.

504
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,797
Turn off the lights.

505
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:26,531
Moment of truth.

506
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,336
There, around her mouth.

507
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:32,617
Fluorescein.

508
00:27:38,343 --> 00:27:40,078
Some more around her fingers,

509
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:43,085
which means if she consumed
something, we'd expect to see...

510
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,553
Fluorescent urine.

511
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:46,297
We can confirm
what this is at the lab.

512
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,461
Yeah, but there's no doubt,
she was poisoned.

513
00:27:48,996 --> 00:27:50,829
You were right.

514
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:53,024
Someone tried to kill her.

515
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:57,890
Intramedullary rod in place.

516
00:27:57,984 --> 00:28:00,393
Ligating the splenic artery
and vein near the hilum.

517
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:02,353
Not good. Max is desatting fast

518
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:03,871
and becoming hypotensive.

519
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:13,640
- It's not a bowel perf.
- No torn vessels here.

520
00:28:15,147 --> 00:28:16,313
Pressures dropping fast.

521
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,156
- What do you got, Dr. Lee?
- It's auto-PEEP.

522
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,338
Air is trapped inside his lungs,

523
00:28:19,422 --> 00:28:21,165
- compressing his heart.
- And the vent's not letting it out.

524
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:23,416
- So you'll change the settings?
- It won't be enough.

525
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,635
His cardiac output is dropping.
I'll disconnect the vent

526
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,048
- and readjust the setting.
- He won't be breathing

527
00:28:27,132 --> 00:28:29,781
- or getting any air.
- It's dangerous and unorthodox.

528
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:31,656
Yeah, it might work
if you move fast.

529
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:33,660
We can help by, uh, pushing down

530
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,595
on his chest and getting out
some of the air.

531
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,997
All right, team.

532
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,492
Disconnecting the vent.

533
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:40,670
Okay, push.

534
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:42,767
Lowering respiratory rate
and tidal volume.

535
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:44,656
Increasing I: E ratio.

536
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:47,225
And boom, we're done.

537
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,683
He's stabilizing.

538
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,710
That's a brilliant save.

539
00:28:57,876 --> 00:29:00,586
He's coming around to me.
Inevitable.

540
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:03,934
There's another surgery.
Dr. Lee,

541
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:05,900
you're the only anesthesiology
attending on call.

542
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:08,032
I'll get a CRNA to cover here.

543
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:10,102
All right... Go ahead.
They need you.

544
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:11,883
Of course they do.

545
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:18,409
Hey, thanks for the assist.

546
00:29:18,494 --> 00:29:19,836
Yeah. Who was the klutz?

547
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:22,298
- My money's on the med student.
- Intern, actually.

548
00:29:22,383 --> 00:29:23,802
Huh, and you might
need a new career.

549
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:26,086
You know, comments like that
can cause long-term damage.

550
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,622
Toughen up, snowflake, or you'll
never get through residency.

551
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,159
I'm gonna scrub in.

552
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,167
Keep an eye on this one.

553
00:29:41,903 --> 00:29:43,492
Good save. Uh...

554
00:29:43,577 --> 00:29:46,359
I guess I'll get
scrubbed in, too.

555
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:48,742
You will do nothing of the sort.

556
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:52,254
You had one job and you blew it!

557
00:29:52,609 --> 00:29:54,758
Get out of my sight, now.

558
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:56,342
No, in fact...

559
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:58,586
I want you to go
to the waiting room,

560
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,493
and you explain
to this woman's family

561
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:02,211
why she's even in the OR.

562
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:05,828
And you give them
every last detail.

563
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:26,280
Any news on our son?

564
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:27,799
Uh, he's still in the OR.

565
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,617
Our-our surgeons are doing their
best to repair his injuries,

566
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:33,656
but his leg is shattered
in multiple places.

567
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,665
W-Will he walk again?

568
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,759
Please, he's only 17.

569
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,126
Teenage boys are stupid,

570
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:42,367
but don't let him
be crippled for life.

571
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:44,563
At least he has a life.

572
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:46,563
My family may not be so lucky.

573
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:47,695
Let's go somewhere else.

574
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,438
- So they don't have to face us?
- No.

575
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:52,699
Look at us.

576
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,602
See our pain.

577
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:57,513
How's my mother?

578
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:03,016
There's been an accident
with Eileen.

579
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:05,837
What do you
mean? What accident?

580
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:07,380
Uh, she was getting better,

581
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,953
and now there's a hole
in her artery.

582
00:31:11,894 --> 00:31:13,244
It was my fault.

583
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:16,741
I tripped on the cannula,
it tore and she's in surgery.

584
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:19,174
I am really sorry.

585
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:22,586
Please, go ahead, yell at me.

586
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:25,969
I deserve it.
I feel just terrible.

587
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:28,703
The fault is ours.

588
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:31,906
I bought him that car.

589
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:36,625
It should have been me
who got hurt at the store.

590
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:42,883
Mom wanted me
to work the register.

591
00:31:43,773 --> 00:31:45,381
I refused.

592
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:51,258
We started fighting.
I said something awful.

593
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,718
Turned to go.

594
00:31:56,078 --> 00:31:59,055
Mom pushed me out of the way
right when the car...

595
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:04,555
It was Max's birthday.

596
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:06,557
Miranda warned me.

597
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:09,692
I begged you not to buy
that stupid car.

598
00:32:11,444 --> 00:32:13,294
I-I grew up poor.

599
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:18,242
I wanted him to have
everything I never had.

600
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:23,524
We came from Colombia
two decades ago.

601
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:29,477
I-I know how hard it is to build
a life from the ground up.

602
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,258
When this is over,

603
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,289
and, God willing,
everyone is okay,

604
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:41,313
we'll help rebuild yours.

605
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,695
Thank you.

606
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,430
But I'll believe it
when I see it.

607
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:09,750
You'll feel a tiny pinch.

608
00:33:10,977 --> 00:33:12,939
Is that the numbing medicine?

609
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:15,384
That's right.

610
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,142
I'm at the inferior aspect
of the rib.

611
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,811
Ready for contrast and phenol.

612
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,664
How long will it last?

613
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:32,844
Several months.

614
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,218
But if this pain recurs,
we can discuss next steps.

615
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,767
It'll be enough.

616
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:53,406
Uh, listen, um...

617
00:33:54,063 --> 00:33:56,141
my mother and I
want to thank you

618
00:33:56,226 --> 00:34:01,633
for the exceptional care
that you have provided.

619
00:34:02,468 --> 00:34:06,164
You've been nothing short
of remarkable.

620
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:11,258
You've helped with some
really tough decisions

621
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:17,930
and you have shown me the power
of compassionate comfort care,

622
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,562
and-and I just want you
to know that it means... a lot.

623
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,206
It makes all the difference
in the world.

624
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:33,336
And I know my mother will
hold all of you in her heart

625
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,992
with the time that she has left.

626
00:34:45,695 --> 00:34:47,555
It's Eileen.

627
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:57,649
Mom.

628
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:02,071
I love you,

629
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:03,317
and I'm sorry for everything.

630
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,814
I shouldn't have
fought with you,

631
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:05,801
I should have been the one...

632
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:08,944
No. You are the light
of my life.

633
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:10,805
I'm happy you're okay.

634
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:14,841
Darling, we were so scared.

635
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:16,735
We thought we might lose you.

636
00:35:18,764 --> 00:35:20,773
How long will she need
this machine?

637
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:23,657
Well, that depends
on how her heart heals.

638
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:25,181
But we're already
seeing improvement.

639
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:27,682
And the store?

640
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:29,141
- Damaged.
- Oh...

641
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:30,892
But we will rebuild.

642
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,172
It'll be even better.

643
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:35,582
This time, can we get
the shaved-ice machines?

644
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,366
Dr. Austin, please, I just
wanted to apologize again...

645
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,202
Have I mentioned
that you are quite possibly

646
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:48,414
the least promising intern

647
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,688
to ever sully
the halls of Chastain?

648
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:52,016
Don't say that.
I really want

649
00:35:52,101 --> 00:35:53,541
- to be better.
- Don't interrupt me.

650
00:35:54,227 --> 00:35:56,931
Now, I happen to know there
have been far worse interns

651
00:35:57,016 --> 00:36:00,102
who have gone on
to become fine doctors.

652
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,156
You owned up to your mistake.

653
00:36:02,304 --> 00:36:04,720
That's a rare,
almost extinct virtue,

654
00:36:04,805 --> 00:36:08,714
and for that, I will not
kick you to the curb yet.

655
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:11,532
Thank you, oh, thank you.

656
00:36:11,617 --> 00:36:13,649
Does this mean, uh,
could it be that you'll...

657
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:14,899
let me back in your OR?

658
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:17,039
I promise not to do
anything stupid.

659
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,636
Yeah, well, don't make
promises you can't keep,

660
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:23,220
and I won't, either.

661
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:26,063
So the answer is maybe.

662
00:36:31,843 --> 00:36:33,509
We were able to repair

663
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:36,149
your lacerated spleen
and your broken legs.

664
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:38,204
In a few weeks,
you should be able to start

665
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:40,375
working on getting
on your feet again.

666
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,249
Thank you.

667
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:44,249
Do you remember what happened?

668
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:48,047
I drove too fast.

669
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:49,890
I lost control.

670
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:53,642
On a city street,
putting other lives in jeopardy.

671
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:59,264
I'm ashamed.

672
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:01,399
Is that what you needed to hear?

673
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:03,938
We will need to hear
a lot more than that.

674
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:07,573
You won't be driving
anything again for a long time.

675
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,537
But I-I'm ashamed, too.

676
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,852
For putting you behind
the wheel of that car.

677
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,475
We love you.

678
00:37:26,302 --> 00:37:27,860
Always.

679
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:32,064
But you and I both share
a responsibility for this.

680
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:36,609
And we'll be helping the family
that you harmed to rebuild.

681
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:41,491
Both of us.

682
00:37:54,883 --> 00:37:56,635
Octahedral
and needle-shaped crystals

683
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,728
in the urine, characteristic of
poisoning with ethylene glycol.

684
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:02,173
Commonly found in antifreeze,
it has an additive

685
00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:03,728
that fluoresces under UV light.

686
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:05,352
It's a perfect murder weapon.

687
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,797
Odorless, colorless, sweet,
masks as alcohol.

688
00:38:07,914 --> 00:38:10,266
- Someone made her drink it.
- She tried to get away...

689
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,995
Yeah, and she fell down
the stairs.

690
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,985
There is an antidote.

691
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,696
We can save her with fomepizole.

692
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:17,826
And we have proof
for an attempted homicide.

693
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,164
Let's get security
to guard her room immediately.

694
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:26,735
It's room 3350.

695
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:31,777
Hey.

696
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:34,630
What are you doing?

697
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:44,235
He disconnected the vent and
turned off the heart monitor.

698
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,719
No pulse. She's not breathing.

699
00:38:50,803 --> 00:38:53,098
- I'll start bagging.
- Call a code now!

700
00:38:54,062 --> 00:38:55,787
Starting compressions.

701
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,416
<i>Code Blue, room 3350.</i>

702
00:39:00,728 --> 00:39:03,973
<i>Code Blue, room 3350.</i>

703
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:18,430
She was gone
by the time we got there.

704
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:22,158
She wasn't breathing.

705
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:25,176
And her heart had stopped.

706
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:27,896
We tried...

707
00:39:28,528 --> 00:39:30,403
But we couldn't bring her back.

708
00:39:33,098 --> 00:39:35,078
I caused this.

709
00:39:35,163 --> 00:39:36,506
You didn't.

710
00:39:36,762 --> 00:39:39,145
She wasn't killed 'cause
you walked in asking questions.

711
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:40,926
She was being blackmailed.

712
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:43,294
Forced to not check
prescriptions.

713
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:46,973
So, Phoebe agreed
to wear a wire for us.

714
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:50,418
Someone must have found out.

715
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:53,910
The Mafia always
takes retribution.

716
00:39:57,056 --> 00:39:59,199
That's why they killed her.

717
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,317
This is even bigger
than we feared.

718
00:40:06,146 --> 00:40:08,396
We got a good look
at the killer.

719
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,448
And he got a good look at you.

720
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,744
You'll have to make a decision.

721
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:22,504
Are you gonna leave Chastain?

722
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:29,013
I don't want to.

723
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,458
We don't want to lose you,

724
00:40:31,543 --> 00:40:33,208
but if you're in danger...

725
00:40:33,293 --> 00:40:34,797
"We"?

726
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,198
Chastain.

727
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:39,874
All of us.

728
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:44,005
We got into it a bit today.

729
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,523
Yes, we did.

730
00:40:46,426 --> 00:40:47,993
Friends again?

731
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,570
Always.

732
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:54,591
I love working with colleagues
who have strong opinions.

733
00:40:54,676 --> 00:40:56,093
Me, too.

734
00:40:56,658 --> 00:40:58,217
To a point.

735
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:01,407
Ditto.

736
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,067
You made a questionable call
in the field; I did, too.

737
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:10,185
From this point forward,
we have each other's backs.

738
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,723
Whatever comes of this,
we fight this together.

739
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:35,426
I want to thank you for
agreeing to hospice, Mom.

740
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,239
I think you're going to like it.

741
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,216
And this here is Jana ya Purcell.

742
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:41,161
She's your hospice nurse,

743
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,496
and I think you're going
to like her, too.

744
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:47,012
Lovely to meet you, Jana ya.
Call me Carol.

745
00:41:47,228 --> 00:41:49,378
Let me help you with that.

746
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:55,457
So, your son had me set up
everything for your return.

747
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:57,755
- Mm.
- And...

748
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,661
this is your new bed.

749
00:41:59,746 --> 00:42:01,740
The head and foot
both go up and down,

750
00:42:01,825 --> 00:42:04,247
and there is a railing
on one side

751
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:07,161
that you can use to help you
get out of bed.

752
00:42:07,246 --> 00:42:10,278
But it's out here?
Not a bedroom?

753
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,466
Yes, your son wants
to have you near,

754
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:14,755
and it's closer
to the bathroom and kitchen.

755
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,005
I put it by the window
to the garden

756
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,333
- so you can watch the birds.
- Ah.

757
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:23,892
And this is your chair.

758
00:42:25,192 --> 00:42:29,271
One button and it tips up
so you can get up.

759
00:42:29,996 --> 00:42:31,671
It's really a beautiful home.

760
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:35,646
Yes, I'm very happy here.

761
