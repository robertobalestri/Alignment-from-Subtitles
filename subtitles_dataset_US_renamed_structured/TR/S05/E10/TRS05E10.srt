<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:03,715
Dr. Bell?
Here's the clamp.

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:06,246
Something's wrong with me,
and I'm not quite sure what,

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,890
- but I think it may be serious.
- Want me to examine you?

5
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:11,005
The results all under the radar.

6
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:13,044
We're gonna need
to set some rules.

7
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:15,646
No one here needs to know
that we're related,

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,262
or that
you're my biological son.

9
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:18,908
- Agreed. It's none of their business.
- Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:20,651
I talked to your boy.

11
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:22,956
He thinks I recommended him
to Chastain.

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,105
- I did no such thing.
- I did.

13
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,622
You didn't just break protocol.

14
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:29,125
You broke every rule
of medicine.

15
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:31,755
Are your patients just pawns
to prove how smart you are?

16
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,380
Now that
you're spending more time

17
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:36,606
on research and clinical trials,
we need a new ER doctor.

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,078
All I know is that Nic wouldn't
want you to be alone forever.

19
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:42,090
<i>For your sake and for Gigi's,
you deserve to be happy.</i>

20
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:43,441
Hey, Marion!

21
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:45,176
We are gonna go get
some ice cream

22
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,412
- if you would like to join us.
- I would love to.

23
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:53,996
Marion, I just want
to say it again.

24
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,048
I know.

25
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:57,802
Boundaries clear.

26
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:00,445
- We both had fun.
- Yes, we did.

27
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:06,624
Conrad, it's okay. Truth?

28
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:09,528
You're not my type.

29
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:12,425
Well, okay.

30
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:16,813
Besides, I've got a mad crush
on someone else.

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,304
- Someone much younger.
- Oh, ouch.

32
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:23,335
And...

33
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,358
shorter.

34
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,031
Like your daughter.

35
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:29,139
- Daddy?
- And there she is.

36
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,217
She never gets up this early.

37
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,538
I'll be quiet.
See you later.

38
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,247
Daddy, you need a shirt.

39
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,866
Yes, I do.

40
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:42,492
You're up so early.

41
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:45,100
I wanted to pick out
the perfect outfit for my trip

42
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,163
to the aquarium.

43
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:50,241
Oh, look at that.

44
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:52,577
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah, definitely thumbs up.

45
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:54,851
Get this sucker on you, okay?

46
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:57,057
What are you gonna color
over here?

47
00:01:57,372 --> 00:01:59,417
- I don't know.
- Huh? You don't know?

48
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:01,177
Hmm. Let me think.

49
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:03,087
What is that?
What if I color that in there

50
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:04,848
like that, with that blue?

51
00:02:04,932 --> 00:02:06,574
Oh, my gosh, who is that?

52
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:09,562
My favorite babysitter!

53
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:19,356
Hey, my love. Are you ready
to go see the fish?

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,408
Yes!

55
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,976
I will bring her back
tonight, Dr. Hawkins.

56
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:28,300
Thanks for this.
Your purse, sweetheart.

57
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:37,251
There's some mad money in there
for both of your tickets

58
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:40,062
and a nice lunch.

59
00:02:40,146 --> 00:02:42,385
Make sure you pick up the check.

60
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,288
Mwah.

61
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,406
Have fun.

62
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,133
Thanks.

63
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:51,294
- Come on.
- Bye-bye.

64
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:53,320

But?

72
00:03:18,712 --> 00:03:20,185
I'll see you later,
and we'll talk.

73
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,905
No. Talk here. Let's go.

74
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:25,261
Lots of the tests aren't in
yet. I'm not gonna speculate.

75
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:28,723
You have a differential.
I know you do.

76
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:31,659
Cancer? Stroke?

77
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:33,643
ALS? I thought of that one, too.
I just...

78
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,385
And I'm reassured because the
lack of muscle fasciculations,

79
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:38,813
- but... just perhaps?
- No.

80
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:41,112
Your exam isn't consistent
with ALS.

81
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:42,956
This could be something simple
and treatable.

82
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,452
- You know it's not.
- I don't know anything yet.

83
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,422
I'll have more information
at the end of the day.

84
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:52,862
- But in the meantime...
- Yeah. No, I know. I know.

85
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:54,471
Don't operate. Trust me,
I don't want a repeat

86
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,250
of what happened in the OR.

leaving Dr. Devi,

00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:09,720
I got to go.
Kit's new Flight Go Team

90
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:12,204
just got activated
for the first time.

91
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:13,884
Yeah, that's a big step forward

92
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:16,430
for any hospital
with a level-1 trauma center.

93
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:20,533
Doctors flying to emergencies
EMTs can't handle.

94
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,586
Okay, go. We're finished here.

95
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,969
- Till later today, all right?
- Yup. Yup. Yup.

96
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:26,946

123
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,935
The passengers
in the car died instantly.

124
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,648
We got everyone out
of the bus except one.

125
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,789
She's critical, and if we tried
to move her, she won't make it.

126
00:06:24,873 --> 00:06:27,189
She's pinned down with
a penetrating abdominal injury.

127
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,946
The firefighters are trying
to cut her out, but

128
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,993
- they're running out of time.
- Top windows the only access?

129
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:33,454
Yeah, it's the front of the bus.
The door's jammed shut.

130
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:34,755
We're working
on opening something else up,

131
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,696
but no luck yet.

132
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,056
Ah, so it's like that, huh?

133
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:53,204
Pass me the stuff.

134
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:10,532
It's a good thing they
called in the Go Team,

135
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:12,891
'cause this is definitely
something EMTs couldn't handle.

136
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,422
I know what you're thinking,
but the first rule

137
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:16,281
of penetrating trauma...
Never pull it out.

138
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:18,067
If we pulled that out of her,
and it lacerated

139
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:19,751
any vessels,
she could bleed out in seconds.

140
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:21,228
I'm well aware.

141
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:25,048
Pulling it out is a risk,
but we can manage that risk.

142
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:27,946
Okay, what's your plan? Go on.

143
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,501
You get the meds,
I'll get ready to intubate.

144
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:35,071
Let's push 100 of ketamine
and 150 of roc.

145
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:37,289
Keep her paralyzed and sedated
so she doesn't move an inch.

146
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,365
Then we get her unpinned.
Okay, we got a good plan.

147
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:43,448
Help me.

148
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,689
We got you.

149
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:52,071
Push the meds now.

150
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:06,618
Now for the tough part.

151
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:13,187
Let's pack that with wet gauze.

152
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:15,048
And tape it. I'm on it.

153
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:29,087
I'm here.

154
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,571
Give me the bag.

155
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:36,016
On my count. Three...

156
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,235
Two, one.

157
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:40,485
Okay.

158
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,749
Perfect timing.

159
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:49,421
Wait.

160
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:52,366
There's someone else in here.

161
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,819
There's a gas leak
under this thing.

162
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:56,452
Smoke means there's fire, too.
It's gonna blow.

163
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,412
Keep going. We'll catch up.

164
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,038
Come on, guys.

165
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:01,741
- What's your name?
- Jill.

166
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,599
Jill, you're gonna
be okay, all right?

167
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:06,428
Oh, God. Oh, God.

168
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,208
Posterior elbow dislocation,

169
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:17,826
possible fracture, with
brachial artery compromise.

170
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,209
This is gonna hurt.

171
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:21,530
Take a deep breath.

172
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:23,650
Got it.

173
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:49,024
Hey, you,
get out of the bus, now.

174
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:50,881
I thought I heard a noise.

175
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,570
It's a cat.
It must be the team mascot.

176
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,249
- Not exactly a bobcat.
- Run!

177
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,645
At least you saved the cat.

178
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:12,809
Okay, that was kick-ass.

179
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:14,780
Yeah, it was all right.

180
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:24,659
- Uh, Dr. Pravesh.
- Hey.

181
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:25,833
Look, I know I gave you
some trouble

182
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,033
the last time I worked with you,

183
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,064
and I just want
to let you know that...

184
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:29,845
Apology accepted,
but you have one strike

185
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,611
and a lot to prove,
so don't forget it.

186
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:33,197
Now, I hope you have
your big boy pants on

187
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:35,682
because we have
a very difficult case.

188
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:37,998
Hi, there. How we doing?

189
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:41,339
Temp 102. BP 170/100.

190
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:42,587
We gave Mr. Parker

191
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:45,252
meds 40 minutes ago,
and his fever hasn't budged.

192
00:10:45,336 --> 00:10:47,591
Mr. Parker is my dad.

193
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:49,065
Call me Jerome.

194
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,604
Uh, I've had the fever
for ten days.

195
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:55,498
Oh, um...

196
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:58,910
That's the, that's the call bell.
We're here.

197
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:02,877
I wanted to make sure it works.

198
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:07,197
Um, preliminary test results

199
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,174
came back inconclusive.

200
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,248
Your chest X-ray and urine tests

201
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:13,608
did not show
any sign of infection.

202
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:15,369
No headache, diarrhea,

203
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:17,760
stiff neck, nausea, sore throat.

204
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,393
Which means we can consider this
a fever of unknown origin.

205
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:23,210
Unknown origin?

206
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:24,978
Wait, so you have no idea
what's wrong with me?

207
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:27,839
Well, it's a mystery for now,
but you have

208
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:30,166
two motivated detectives
on the case.

209
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:32,665
What we need is more
information, so we're gonna

210
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:34,306
run some more tests
and a thorough history,

211
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,940
and... that should be

212
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:38,058
the key to figuring
this out, okay?

213
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:39,709
Oh, God.

214
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:41,666
Where's BooBooBear?

215
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:46,205
- That's his service dog.
- I have panic attacks.

216
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:47,986
Boo is the only thread that, um,

217
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,579
keeps me from unraveling.

218
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:52,345
Your dog is tied up outside.
We don't allow

219
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:53,635
animals in the ER.

220
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:56,726
No, no, wait, no. Um, please,
you don't understand.

221
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,796
I... I need her.

222
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,837
- I'm beginning to freak out.
- O-Okay.

223
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,446
Okay. Okay, um,

224
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,148
I might be able to clear
the dog through social work.

225
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,791
I'll call Winston.

226
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:12,575
<i>Three, two,</i>

227
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:14,627
one, mark.

228
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,049
Two patients. That's the limit.

229
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,197
We'll hitch a ride
on an ambulance.

230
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,595
You okay? You got pretty cut up.

231
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,627
- Let me take a look.
- I'm fine.

232
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:41,471
That needs to be cleaned up.

233
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,166
Might need a stitch or two.

234
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:47,330
Are you two headed back
to Chastain?

235
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:49,479
I got space
in the back of my rig.

236
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:57,228
Thank you for getting me
off that bus.

237
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:58,848
I almost went up in flames.

238
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:00,760
I was worried about the cat.

239
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,994
That you didn't know existed.

240
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,189
Good point.

241
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:08,386
Truth is,
I'm more of a dog person.

242
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:10,785
I'm a chicken guy.

243
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:12,572
- No way.
- Oh, yeah.

244
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:14,791
I'll have to hit you up
for some eggs.

245
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:31,345
Oh, man.

246
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,841
Is that little fluff nugget here
to comfort stressed out doctors?

247
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:36,002
Because I am in need.

248
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,420
That little fluff nugget
is an infection risk.

249
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:40,986
Service dogs are allowed
in hospitals, Nurse Hundley.

250
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,611
Some areas are off-limits,
but this isn't one.

251
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:45,360
Hmm.

252
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:51,064
- BooBooBear.
- Hey, hold on.

253
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:54,033
Lyme disease is on
the differential.

254
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:56,407
Uh, Boo has no parasites, ever.

255
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:57,352
She's groomed,

256
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,968
gets a monthly topical
tick repellant, and her paws

257
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:00,134
barely touch the ground.
See?

258
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:02,033
I-I carry her in this pup pack.

259
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,631
We'll run a Lyme test anyway.

260
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:13,288
Preliminary history
is unremarkable.

261
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:15,180
No contact with anyone else
who was sick.

262
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:18,877
No recent travel
or relevant medical issues.

263
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:21,744
Jerome is a computer programmer

264
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,330
who works from home.

265
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:27,392
- Okay. What next?
- You build the differential

266
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:29,947
using the latest test results,
but be patient.

267
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:31,697
Fever of unknown origin

268
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,838
can stump the most
experienced doctors.

269
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:51,595
- What do we got?
- Two adult females.

270
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,564
Young 20s. Traumatic
penetrating abdominal injury,

271
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:56,189
evisceration.
Intubated at the scene.

272
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:56,946
And the other one?

273
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,430
Posterior elbow dislocation
with vascular compromise.

274
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:01,374
Dr. Hawkins
reduced in the field.

275
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,945
She's C.S. 13.

276
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,039
Repetitive questioning,
possible head injury.

277
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:06,725
Is Mindy going to be okay?

278
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,139
Easy. We'll take care of her.

279
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:10,601
We need to page
Sutton and Voss now.

280
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:22,882
Okay...

281
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:25,703
Hey.

282
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:29,405
Good work.

283
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:30,678
I only have a few minutes.

284
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,231
We have traumas
from the crash site coming in.

285
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:34,756
What can we rule out?

286
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,807
Jerome took an HIV test a week ago.
That came back negative.

287
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:40,335
Plus, he has an elevated
white blood count.

288
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:42,526
So?

289
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,417
That means we cross off
all AIDS-defining illnesses,

290
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:47,468
fungal infections like, uh, PJP.

291
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:53,695
What else?

292
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:56,421
Lupus, R.A., probably out.

293
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:02,468
I mean, the list
is brutally long.

294
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:04,015
He could have almost anything.

295
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:06,663
- Go talk to him again.
- Okay.

296
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:07,990
- About what?
- Anything.

297
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:10,517
What did he have for breakfast
two days ago?

298
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:12,002
Do his parents
have heart trouble?

299
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:13,261
Does he kiss his pet salamander?

300
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:14,084
Wait.

301
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:15,445
What does a salamander
have to do with it?

302
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,373
Well, salamanders
carry salmonella,

303
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:19,008
specifically osteomyelitis,

304
00:16:19,092 --> 00:16:20,812
which can cause a fever.

305
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,205
My point is,
the answer is almost always

306
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,898
in the patient history.

307
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:27,382
I'll tag in when I can.

308
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:38,431
You aren't on the Go Team.

309
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:41,857
Where'd the chopper pick you up?
Atlanta General?

310
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:43,611
Yeah.

311
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:45,400
They're not level-1 trauma.

312
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:48,587
Where'd you learn
your field medicine?

313
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:53,009
A lot of places.

314
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:54,704
How about you?

315
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:59,017
Afghanistan.
Yeah, Navy corpsman. Two tours.

316
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:00,947
Back to you.

317
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,291
Are you an ER doc?

318
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:05,773
Trauma surgeon?

319
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,650
I'm double board certified.
Emergency med and...

320
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:10,273
We're picking up
a patient en route.

321
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:11,446
Female, 35,

322
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,876
pregnant and in active labor.

323
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,947
Who doesn't love babies?

324
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,884
Looks like we're in
for more fun.

325
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:25,032
We're stacked up
and more are incoming.

326
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:26,798
Medivac just landed.

327
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,094
We need a bay.
Severe abdominal lac.

328
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,397
She needs to be top of the list.

329
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:34,079
I saved you a trauma bay.
Follow me.

330
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:40,188
Looks like Conrad
repacked the bowel on-site.

331
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:42,751
- Team did a good job.
- Free fluid in the abdomen.

332
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:45,618
Her intestines may have been
lacerated by the impalement.

333
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,306
Mindy.

334
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,462
Mindy.
My name is Dr. Devi.

335
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:53,548
You've been in an accident,

336
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:54,962
but we're gonna
take care of you, okay?

337
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,048
Hundley, start her

338
00:17:56,132 --> 00:17:59,040
on her propofol drip.
I'll get someone to book an OR.

339
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:03,150
Gonna get you down to X-ray.

340
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:06,216
Ortho and neuro page?

341
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,180
Uh, Bay Two. Jill Rhinehart.
Dislocated elbow

342
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:09,344
and an epidural hematoma.

343
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:10,766
I thought you could use
an extra hand.

344
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,993
Nolan.

345
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,145
Hi, Jill. I'm Dr. Voss.

346
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:19,900
And I'm Dr. Sutton.

347
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:22,710
I'm just gonna do a quick exam.

348
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:24,436
How's the arm feel?

349
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:26,868
It hurts bad, really bad.

350
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:28,712
We'll get you something
for the pain.

351
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:30,883
Let's get her 25 mikes
of fentanyl.

352
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:34,728
Can you follow my finger?

353
00:18:39,343 --> 00:18:40,556
She needs an OR.

354
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,149
I'll join you.
Compartment syndrome.

355
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,246
We'll likely need to take that
down with a fasciotomy.

356
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,939
- I'll prep her.
- Thanks.

357
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,415
Jill, I'm gonna need
your consent for surgery.

358
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,587
You're in good hands
with Dr. Nolan.

359
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:59,804
- What a mess.
- And more coming.

360
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:04,632
- Who are you operating on?
- I'm not.

361
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:06,703
It's-it's better if I stay here.

362
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:08,763
If they need a trauma surgeon,
they'll page me.

363
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:10,570
All right.

364
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:13,240
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Mm-hmm.

365
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:25,383
Ten times out of ten,

366
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,898
a person with injuries like this
dies in the field.

367
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:29,359
Genius work by the Go Team.

368
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:31,352
Well, she has gross
contamination of her abdomen,

369
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,485
and she's in septic shock.

370
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,563
Okay, so we get in and out fast.
What's first?

371
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:36,610
Identify the ligament of Treitz,
run the bowel,

372
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:37,799
look for vascular injuries,

373
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:39,059
and cut out anything
that's not viable.

374
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:41,079
Very good.
We cannot miss anything.

375
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:43,164
- If we leave contaminants...
- She dies.

376
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,861
So, we're fast,
but we're meticulous.

377
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:49,860
We need to avoid
ICP elevating meds

378
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,272
and prep her for a right-sided
decompressive craniotomy.

379
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:53,914
The arm looks terrible.

380
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:55,976
Life and limb, literally.

381
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:07,579
Thank you.

382
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:09,314
Thank you.

383
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,394
Ma'am, how far apart
are your contractions?

384
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,655
<i>Speaking Creole...</i>

385
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:19,450
<i>Speaking Creole...</i>

386
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:34,798
Creole. She's Haitian.

387
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:36,714
Guess I know where you learned
your field medicine.

388
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,495
It's her third child.

389
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:41,907
Which means it can come
very quickly.

390
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,978
Uh, no exotic foods?

391
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:52,649
Raw fish? Wild mushrooms?

392
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,276
I have a...

393
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:56,438
a delicate stomach.

394
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:59,556
Okay. Um...

395
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,516
Any sexual encounters recently?

396
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,634
I need my dog

397
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:07,197
just to leave the apartment.

398
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:09,212
Definitely not

399
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:11,954
hooking up with some rando.

400
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:17,979
Jerome?

401
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:23,153
Uh... Uh...

402
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,087
Hey, I-I need help in here.

403
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:31,221
Here.

404
00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:35,978
He's burning up.

405
00:21:37,002 --> 00:21:39,493
Fever 104.2.

406
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:42,032
We're heading into the red zone.
Orders, doctor?

407
00:21:44,332 --> 00:21:45,487
Dr. Daniels.

408
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:48,596
Uh, let's push 30 ketorolac,

409
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,373
get a cooling blanket on him.

410
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:52,793
- Okay.
- I'll call Dr. Pravesh.

411
00:22:18,393 --> 00:22:20,889
Significant hemorrhage
and ecchymosis,

412
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:23,271
but the compression on the brain
should be much less.

413
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,630
Now, I have to find the source.

414
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:28,078
100% compartment syndrome.

415
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:30,799
Thank goodness Conrad
reduced it on-site.

416
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:36,213
Found the bleeders.

417
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,448
Middle meningeal artery.

418
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:40,865
Cauterizing now.

419
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,830
Good job, Dr. Sutton.
Now, if I

420
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:46,580
can just try
not to nick an artery.

421
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,132
Won't be pretty,

422
00:22:49,296 --> 00:22:52,302
but when the swelling goes down,
she'll have a functional arm.

423
00:22:52,677 --> 00:22:54,796
Banner day for the Go Team.

424
00:22:55,823 --> 00:22:59,578
Quick question. Is Bell okay?

425
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:02,412
What do you mean?

426
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:05,615
He's a surgeon, not emergency.

427
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:08,892
Pulled himself from
the board for the entire day.

428
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:11,665
Austin's taking a case
for him in OR One.

429
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:14,252
I did not know that.

430
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:17,252
I'm not one to tattle.

431
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,755
Something's up.

432
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:42,767
Uh, pink bowel is healthy.

433
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:44,445
Gray we resect.

434
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:47,025
BP's dropping to the 70s.
Heart rate's 130.

435
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:50,720
Cranking pressors. She's already
had four liters of fluid.

436
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,587
We got a bit of luck here.
Looks like the blood vessels

437
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:55,148
escaped getting torn apart.

438
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:57,720
I've got eyes on the duodenum.

439
00:23:58,132 --> 00:23:59,901
First part of jejunum
looks good.

440
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:02,180
Oh, no.

441
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:04,708
Bowels are leaking
into the abdomen.

442
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:06,564
All right,
find the healthy margins

443
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:08,555
and staple them, both sides.

444
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:11,009
We're at 100 centimeters.

445
00:24:11,565 --> 00:24:13,743
Now 125.150's the limit.

446
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,094
She's gonna be at risk
for short gut syndrome.

447
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:18,580
I'm about to
clip the next segment.

448
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,439
<i>Uh, s-slow down.</i>

449
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:23,103
<i>You can adjust to make the</i>

450
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:25,329
<i>viable tissue a little more
visible in the field.</i>

451
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:28,117
<i>Clip, and then you can staple,
and... toss.</i>

452
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:31,353
<i>This is my OR,
thank you very much.</i>

453
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:35,353
However,
good advice is good advice.

454
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,228
Adjusting to get a better view.

455
00:24:40,484 --> 00:24:42,829
Just under
150 centimeters total.

456
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:44,081
BP's coming up.

457
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:45,482
Backing off pressors.

458
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:46,852
Right.

459
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,871
Good call, Bell.

460
00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:15,970
How far are we from Chastain?

461
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:17,457
20 minutes.

462
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:19,491
Ever delivered a baby before?

463
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:20,759
A few.

464
00:25:20,843 --> 00:25:22,642
Ever delivered one
in a moving ambulance?

465
00:25:22,726 --> 00:25:25,196
This day just keeps getting
more and more interesting.

466
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,556
It's one for the record books.

467
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,642
<i>Speaking Creole...</i>

468
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:41,095
Hey. That was
good work with your

469
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:43,138
hematoma and compartment
syndrome patient.

470
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:45,715
It'll be a tough recovery,
but she should make it.

471
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:48,119
You checked in on us
during surgery?

472
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:51,317
N-No. I-I got the report
from Jessica.

473
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:54,424
Oh, by the way,
is Conrad back yet?

474
00:25:54,508 --> 00:25:56,043
No.

475
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:59,426
- What do you want with Conrad?
- He wanted to see me.

476
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,641
AJ mentioned that you were

477
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:05,379
in his bowel trauma
in OR Two.

478
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:08,692
It is my area of expertise.

479
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,196
Thought I could be there
if they ran into the weeds.

480
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,051
He said you made a good call.

481
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:15,426
Uh, it was nothing.

482
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:18,520
Really. I was superfluous.

483
00:26:19,901 --> 00:26:23,453
No other procedures that need
your experienced hands?

484
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:27,695
I understand you've canceled
your surgeries.

485
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,688
Yeah, I felt
some flu-like symptoms,

486
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:36,258
just a touch...
It's an abundance of caution.

487
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:37,745
Of course.

488
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,695
No fever.

489
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:52,320
Perhaps, when you feel up to it,

490
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,086
you'll tell me
what's really going on.

491
00:27:11,857 --> 00:27:13,895
How's it going?

492
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:16,022
Fever spiked to 105,
and he's hypotensive.

493
00:27:16,106 --> 00:27:17,288
We broadened his antibiotics,

494
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:20,460
got cool saline, ice packs,
acetaminophen, ketorolac.

495
00:27:20,544 --> 00:27:22,101
We finally found a
cooling blanket, but he's so...

496
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:24,314
- It's not doing a thing.
- Give me the service dog.

497
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:25,381
I'll take care of her.

498
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:27,381
- Come on.
- I think this is beyond

499
00:27:27,465 --> 00:27:29,610
BooBooBear's expertise.

500
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,374
Okay. Okay. Good girl.

501
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:35,991
How'd he get this bad
this quickly?

502
00:27:36,075 --> 00:27:38,351
Whatever it is has been
building in his system for days.

503
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:39,853
I don't like where it's going.

504
00:27:39,937 --> 00:27:41,639
He was just talking to me
a bit ago, but he's so...

505
00:27:41,723 --> 00:27:42,958
altered. I...

506
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:45,257
Well, he might need
to be intubated.

507
00:27:45,494 --> 00:27:46,687
Let's get an ABG.

508
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:47,906
Yeah.

509
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:01,305
- Hold on, hold on.
- Here.

510
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:04,750
Your patient. You do it.

511
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:07,181
Okay.

512
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:19,085
Okay.

513
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:24,874
Oh, come on. He-he won't settle.
This is awful.

514
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,382
- I can't do this.
- I'll hold him.

515
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:27,863
Got it.

516
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:31,827
Okay.

517
00:28:35,286 --> 00:28:36,771
I'm in.

518
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:51,906
- Oh!
- Uh...

519
00:28:52,162 --> 00:28:54,647
- Hold pressure, quick. Come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

520
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:56,094
Hold pressure.

521
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:00,743
- Did you check his platelets and INR?
- Of course.

522
00:29:00,827 --> 00:29:03,506
160 and 1.8. Not normal,
but not catastrophic.

523
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,584
Well, they must be getting worse.
He's not clotting.

524
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:09,186
Possibly in DIC or liver
failure. He's decompensating.

525
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,841
I don't understand
what's happening. Explain.

526
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:13,132
I can't.

527
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:15,311
We can't fix him if we
don't know what's wrong,

528
00:29:15,395 --> 00:29:17,519
and we're running out of time.

529
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:19,095
Wait.
You mean he could die?

530
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:20,803
- I...
- Hundley.

531
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:22,842
35-year-old woman,

532
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:24,442
BP steady, pulse in the 70s,

533
00:29:24,526 --> 00:29:26,043
but also we have a newborn male,

534
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:27,611
healthy, Apgar off the charts.

535
00:29:27,763 --> 00:29:29,957
Who could use labor and delivery
and an OB-GYN.

536
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,736
She gave birth in the ambulance.

537
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,069
Peachtree and Seventh.

538
00:29:33,153 --> 00:29:34,752
Perfect corner
to come into the world.

539
00:29:34,836 --> 00:29:36,332
Great deli there, too.

540
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,551
<i>Speaking Creole...</i>

541
00:29:37,883 --> 00:29:41,135
<i>Mèsi.</i>

542
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:42,609
Hey, Conrad, listen.

543
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:45,697
We've got a 30-year-old male
who came in with a week of fever.

544
00:29:45,781 --> 00:29:47,532
No clear source,
and he's going downhill

545
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:49,368
fast, and we're
nowhere closer to a diagnosis

546
00:29:49,452 --> 00:29:50,804
than when he first came in.

547
00:29:50,888 --> 00:29:52,233
We need all the help we can get.

548
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:53,886
The antipyretics,
cooling blankets,

549
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,671
antibiotics,
none of it's making him better.

550
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:57,203
He's going into shock.

551
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:58,874
We're gonna get started
on norepinephrine.

552
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:00,170
Let's get him to the ICU.

553
00:30:00,254 --> 00:30:03,234
Still waiting on a bed.
ICU is short-handed today.

554
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:05,475
Well, we can't keep him
down here indefinitely.

555
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,148
I'm double board certified.

556
00:30:07,232 --> 00:30:08,920
Emergency med
and intensive care.

557
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:10,373
If there's anything
I can do to help.

558
00:30:10,457 --> 00:30:11,498
This is my patient.

559
00:30:11,582 --> 00:30:12,742
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

560
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:14,493
Do you have privileges here?

561
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,179
He has a point.

562
00:30:16,263 --> 00:30:18,243
I'm vouching for her.

563
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:21,323
I'll get Kit
to meet us in the ICU.

564
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:22,843
Sounds good.

565
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:24,828
Let's grab you some scrubs.

566
00:30:46,437 --> 00:30:49,507
Hi. I'm Chastain's CEO,
Kit Voss.

567
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:52,185
Thanks for pitching in.
I know we're desperately

568
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,716
short-staffed here in the unit,
but I have to clear you.

569
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,109
Understood.
My name is Kincaid Sullivan.

570
00:30:57,193 --> 00:30:57,997
I'm an ER doctor,

571
00:30:58,081 --> 00:31:00,139
and I also cover the ICU
at Atlanta General.

572
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:01,747
You can call them
for recommendations.

573
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:04,207
- And the state board, of course.
- Hey, Go Team.

574
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:06,136
You with us?

575
00:31:07,057 --> 00:31:10,223
I'm issuing you privileges
on an emergency basis.

576
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:11,784
Come to my office
when you have a moment,

577
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,598
and we'll do the paperwork.

578
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:17,919
Ejection fraction's at 15%.

579
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,792
His heart is failing, too.
Damn it.

580
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:23,787
She's the ICU doctor.
She should run the room.

581
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:26,809
Go.

582
00:31:27,474 --> 00:31:29,153
Okay, as far as I can tell,

583
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:31,613
we've got a 30-year-old man,
otherwise healthy,

584
00:31:31,697 --> 00:31:32,610
febrile,

585
00:31:32,694 --> 00:31:34,189
now in multisystem
organ failure,

586
00:31:34,273 --> 00:31:35,731
with undifferentiated shock,

587
00:31:35,815 --> 00:31:38,582
respiratory failure,
liver failure,

588
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:39,985
all complicated by disseminated

589
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:42,627
intravascular coagulopathy?

590
00:31:42,711 --> 00:31:44,035
That cover it?

591
00:31:44,314 --> 00:31:46,738
No urine output
in the last three hours.

592
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:49,160
Add renal failure to the list.

593
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:52,027
He's nearly maxed out
on norepi and vaso.

594
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,917
I think we should start
epi next.

595
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,464
Agreed, but he needs
more access.

596
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:59,003
We'll need to place four lines,
minimum, a central,

597
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:02,418
- a dialysis catheter.
- An arterial, and a PA-line.

598
00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:07,764
All right, team.
Let's keep this man alive

599
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:10,051
long enough to find out
what's wrong with him.

600
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,449
What should I do?

601
00:32:13,603 --> 00:32:14,746
Go back to the white board

602
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,957
and go over
every detail we know.

603
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:18,285
Find answers,

604
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,481
and be ready to report back.

605
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:32,280
My sixth surgery of the day
starts in ten minutes.

606
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:34,250
Please tell me
this coffee is hot.

607
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:35,769
That's why God made microwaves.

608
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,353
Oh, bless you.

609
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:41,981
Ooh. I smell panic.

610
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:44,051
I'd rather smell a warm muffin.

611
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:45,319
What's going on?

612
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:46,777
We have a patient
who started out

613
00:32:46,861 --> 00:32:47,838
with a fever of unknown origin,

614
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:49,730
and is now
the sickest guy in the unit,

615
00:32:49,814 --> 00:32:52,254
and if we don't get a diagnosis
soon, he's gonna die.

616
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:55,917
- And this is the differential?
- Uh-huh.

617
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,728
Good luck.

618
00:33:00,877 --> 00:33:02,996
I mean, how do they expect me
to figure this out?

619
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,753
I'm supposed to see what
Hawkins and Pravesh don't?

620
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:07,426
Wild guess,
they're teaching you to look.

621
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,552
And you may never get an answer.

622
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:11,222
You know, by some estimates,

623
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:13,754
one in four patients
who die in the ICU

624
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,566
never get properly diagnosed.

625
00:33:15,736 --> 00:33:17,667
Despite our best efforts,
the human body is a mystery

626
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,706
that keeps its secrets
more than a quarter of the time.

627
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,156
- Okay, that's-that's so...
- Imperfect.

628
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,478
Remarkable.

629
00:33:23,642 --> 00:33:25,254
Human.

630
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:27,050
What have you got?

631
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:28,678
Well...

632
00:33:28,762 --> 00:33:30,488
everything on that board

633
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:33,399
and nothing at all.

634
00:33:34,243 --> 00:33:35,699
It's okay.

635
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:37,037
It happens.

636
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:38,520
We'll keep looking.

637
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:41,682
But there is something
you can do for your patient.

638
00:33:43,644 --> 00:33:45,154
What?

639
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:54,203
What's going on?

640
00:33:54,287 --> 00:33:56,611
A kid came in, drowning victim.

641
00:33:56,695 --> 00:33:59,166
They couldn't save her.
They tried over an hour.

642
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,861
Okay.
I need BooBooBear.

643
00:34:01,945 --> 00:34:03,065
For Jerome.

644
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:06,408
Aw. I was wrong
about this little pup.

645
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:08,510
She's really good at her job.

646
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:10,404
Wait.

647
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:13,455
- Don't forget this.
- Thanks.

648
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:33,135
His bacterial cultures
all came back negative.

649
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:35,087
We have him on
broad-spectrum antibiotics

650
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:36,485
and added antifungals.

651
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:39,690
Looks like the labs are negative
for vasculitis and autoimmune.

652
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,393
What if it's something
more insidious?

653
00:34:42,477 --> 00:34:44,996
Like an underlying
malignancy leading to HLH?

654
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,393
It's a good thought, but
the ferritin isn't consistent.

655
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:49,057
- Ingestions?
- Tox screen, negative.

656
00:34:49,141 --> 00:34:50,185
Extended panel, negative.

657
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:51,953
This was in the dog's backpack.

658
00:34:52,512 --> 00:34:54,114
- A map?
- Uh-huh.

659
00:34:54,198 --> 00:34:57,205
A trail map to a state park.

660
00:34:57,367 --> 00:34:58,846
We've already established
the dog's feet

661
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,178
never touch the ground,
and we've already

662
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:01,437
- tested for Lyme.
- No, no, no.

663
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:03,425
Boo's feet
didn't touch the ground,

664
00:35:03,906 --> 00:35:05,652
but Jerome's have.

665
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,128
In a Georgia state park,
where there are other

666
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:09,787
tick-borne diseases,
not just Lyme.

667
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:11,214
I looked it up.

668
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,684
It could be babesiosis.

669
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,409
Babesiosis is rare.

670
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:21,457
So rare we never considered it.

671
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,096
But the symptoms fit.

672
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,721
It's an incredible long shot.

673
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:26,512
But possible.

674
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,541
So we start him on clindamycin

675
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,871
and quinine, stat,
and if the smear is positive,

676
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:32,666
we start pheresis.

677
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:39,198
No matter if this is wrong
or right, good work, Trevor.

678
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,234
Hello.

679
00:35:56,318 --> 00:35:57,588
Hi.

680
00:35:58,405 --> 00:35:59,862
How's Jerome?

681
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,385
Blood test confirmed babesiosis.

682
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,812
- Wow.
- Yeah, he's responding to the meds.

683
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:10,405
His fever is still high,
but it's coming down.

684
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:12,484
Incredible save.

685
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:14,608
Who was that kid?
An intern?

686
00:36:14,692 --> 00:36:16,398
He's gonna be one of our best.

687
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:18,771
All credit to him.

688
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,976
And to the team.
You...

689
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,351
You ran the room.

690
00:36:25,192 --> 00:36:27,405
Does every day on the job
with you go like this one?

691
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:28,749
Just one surprise

692
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,171
- after another?
- No, thank God.

693
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,757
Today was particularly intense.

694
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:36,882
And I still don't know
your name.

695
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:39,312
I don't know yours, either.

696
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:40,404
Although, "Hey, you"

697
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:43,319
- worked surprisingly well.
- Conrad Hawkins.

698
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:45,444
Kincaid Sullivan.

699
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:47,835
Cade to friend and foe alike.

700
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:50,265
I'd like to have a word
with your foes.

701
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,078
No, you wouldn't.
Believe me.

702
00:36:58,998 --> 00:37:02,054
I'm gonna guess you were in
Haiti doing earthquake relief.

703
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:03,779
Twice.

704
00:37:03,863 --> 00:37:05,897
How long you been
at Atlanta General?

705
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:09,684
Not long.

706
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:11,523
What's with the third degree?

707
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:15,431
Dr. Pravesh, Jerome's doctor,

708
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:18,244
is gonna be spending more time
doing clinical trials,

709
00:37:18,328 --> 00:37:21,306
and we need somebody to fill
his slot in the ER, so...

710
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,510
He's having a hard time
finding good people.

711
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:25,685
You seem
like good people.

712
00:37:26,206 --> 00:37:28,471
- Is that a job offer?
- No.

713
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,822
That's up to Dr. Voss, our CEO.

714
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,666
But Pravesh
already talked to her.

715
00:37:36,032 --> 00:37:38,346
She's making a few calls.
She'd like to talk to you.

716
00:37:43,723 --> 00:37:45,322
Thanks.

717
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:53,218
I don't remember much.

718
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:56,314
I guess it got bad.

719
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:58,244
It did.

720
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:00,226
Don't go hiking
in the woods again

721
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,822
without buttoning up your shirt,
tucking your pants

722
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,399
into your socks,
and wearing a hat, okay?

723
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,025
Trust me, I won't.

724
00:38:06,945 --> 00:38:08,913
I might not ever leave
my apartment again.

725
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:16,533
I'll be back to check
on you later, okay?

726
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,713
How does it feel?

727
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:26,978
Making a diagnosis
no one else could make?

728
00:38:28,217 --> 00:38:29,794
Feels good.

729
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,400
It was one of the good days.
We live for these.

730
00:38:34,108 --> 00:38:35,697
You were the hero.

731
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:39,705
And I'm proud of
what you did.

732
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,502
Thanks.

733
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:48,852
We have to care
about our patients, Trevor,

734
00:38:48,936 --> 00:38:50,736
but this could've gone
the other way.

735
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,103
If it had,

736
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:55,181
it would not have been
your fault.

737
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:06,805
That was odd.

738
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,024
What's that?

739
00:39:08,648 --> 00:39:10,572
She keeps on
being nice to me.

740
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,548
Possible she has a heart?

741
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:20,970
She does have a heart, Trevor.

742
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:23,877
Bigger than you know.

743
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:27,131
Fever's still high,

744
00:39:27,215 --> 00:39:29,231
- but he's starting to feel better.
- Hey, guys.

745
00:39:29,373 --> 00:39:31,337
Dr. Sullivan checks out.

746
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:33,743
The folks at Atlanta General
sang her praises.

747
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:35,971
Though, she's only
been there a few months.

748
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:37,686
Well, where was she before that?

749
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,516
An ER in Chicago, also briefly.

750
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,008
Before that, there's
a two-year gap in her record.

751
00:39:43,092 --> 00:39:45,219
Yeah, she said she spent
some time in Haiti

752
00:39:45,303 --> 00:39:47,837
- doing earthquake relief.
- She told me that as well.

753
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:49,446
Well, how'd she do
on her interview?

754
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,735
We didn't talk for long,

755
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:53,622
but she's obviously
smart and capable.

756
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:57,166
I could see her ICU
leadership was top notch.

757
00:39:57,304 --> 00:39:58,244
But?

758
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:01,190
She was a bit evasive, frankly.

759
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,986
Like she was hiding something.

760
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,643
Did you hire her temporarily?
We need someone now.

761
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:06,744
Yes,

762
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:09,501
but if we're going to make her
a permanent hire,

763
00:40:09,585 --> 00:40:11,445
I'll need more information,

764
00:40:11,529 --> 00:40:13,220
considerably more.

765
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:17,882
That's odd.

766
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:19,791
Eh, she wasn't real talkative

767
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,236
about her past with me, either,

768
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,533
but she's a hell of a doctor.
I'd hate to lose her.

769
00:40:23,649 --> 00:40:26,631
Well, you'd be amazed at what
a five-minute Internet search

770
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,517
can dig up on a person.

771
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:30,712
That's worth a look.

772
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,798
So, one in two people

773
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:36,540
leave their social media
open to the public.

774
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:37,685
Pay attention

775
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,385
and you can find out
somebody's favorite color

776
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:40,720
and who they dated
in high school.

777
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:42,813
All right.

778
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:44,541
Kincaid.

779
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:45,808
Sullivan.

780
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:48,181
M.D. Atlanta, Georgia.

781
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:50,587
Huh.

782
00:40:51,054 --> 00:40:53,244
No Facebook. No Insta.

783
00:40:54,343 --> 00:40:57,439
Okay, um, I'll try
broadening the search.

784
00:40:57,523 --> 00:41:01,330
I'll add her work history
and education.

785
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,306
No results.

786
00:41:07,179 --> 00:41:10,111
Try changing the spelling
of her name.

787
00:41:11,361 --> 00:41:13,621
Add that she's an ER doc.

788
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:18,893
Nothing.

789
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:20,478
Not a single hit.

790
00:41:25,273 --> 00:41:27,075
That's weird.

791
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:29,009
Given that she's not
an 80-year-old

792
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:30,555
with a flip phone, yeah.

793
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:33,741
It's like someone scrubbed
her entire Internet presence.

794
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,478
Test results.

795
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,594
Patient's been waiting
for them all day.

796
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:45,233
Go.

797
00:41:45,317 --> 00:41:46,900
I'll keep digging.

798
00:41:48,878 --> 00:41:50,331
Yeah, thanks.

799
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:51,962
Yeah.

800
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:07,958
I've got what we need now.

801
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,184
I think
I know what's going on.

802
00:42:16,844 --> 00:42:18,080
Let's sit down.
