"We, Jake and Gregg,
solemnly swear to treat

00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:12,702
Sammie as our natural child."

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:14,307
Dr. Pravesh

7
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:17,368
is gonna be spending more time
doing clinical trials,

8
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:18,885
and we need somebody
to fill his slot

9
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,722
- in the ER.
- Is that a job offer?

10
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:22,373
I need a photo

11
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,106
of my son.

12
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:25,809
Mom!

13
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:28,062
Perhaps when you feel up to it,

14
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:30,480
you'll tell me
what's really going on.

15
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:31,973
This could be something simple,
treatable.

16
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:34,033
You know it's not.

17
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,108
And?

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,194
Would you like to talk
in your office?

19
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:14,240
Let's just talk here.

20
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:24,209
It's multiple sclerosis.

21
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,287
Mixed white and gray matter

22
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:30,373
with black holes consistent
with worsening damage.

23
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,776
It's hard to know how long
it's been going on.

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,120
Months, at least. Years, maybe.

25
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:40,049
But the science is advancing
in this field,

26
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,562
and there are
some amazing treatments.

27
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:44,146
There's no cure.

28
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:47,524
We will find ways
to help you get through this.

29
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:50,393
A specialist

30
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:54,656
- can tell you more.
- Okay. Thanks, Conrad.

31
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:57,400
Not now.
Let's talk about it later.

32
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,828
Thanks.

33
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:02,079
Of course.

It's a tie.

00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:57,126
On a doctor-turned-scientist

43
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,805
who's basically
going to cure cancer

44
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:00,305
with his new clinical trial.

You are the one that is crushing

00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:12,292
And you're changing the subject.

50
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:14,811
Starting today,
we get to finally enroll

51
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:15,989
our first patients.

52
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:18,631
This is the beginning
of a new journey.

53
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:20,074
One which will end with you

54
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:22,026
receiving a Nobel Prize.

55
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:23,986
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

56
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,990
But you did forget
one of the best parts

57
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,974
of running a clinical trial.

58
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:31,811
- More than winning a Nobel?
- Oh, yeah.

59
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,903
Fewer hours at work

60
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:35,814

We both have.

67
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:54,683
- Will there be drums and firecrackers?
- So many.

68
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:58,262
And a lion dance
from local performers, darling.

69
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,782
But tonight is
more than just a party.

70
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:04,100
Celebrating Lunar New Year
is just one of the ways

71
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,871
we hope to look out
for the well-being

72
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,622
of our Asian American community.

73
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:09,198
Yeah, well, I'm all for that.

74
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:12,109
And I'm happy to help out
with the free hep B screenings.

75
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:15,170
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:16,994

77
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:18,949
- Hey!
- Grandpa!

78
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:21,468
Hi.

79
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,891
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey. Good to see you.

80
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:26,259
I'm so glad
you guys could make it.

81
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:28,286
We love
celebrating Lunar New Year

82
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,384
with Sammie,

83
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:31,379
and when she heard
about what you were doing,

84
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:33,798
she practically booked
the whole trip herself.

85
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:36,058
Where's Gregg?

86
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:38,944
He had to work last-minute,
but he sends his love.

87
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:43,066
Uh, the three of us
need to talk.

88
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:46,319
Okay. What-What's this about?

89
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:48,396
Well, let's get
Sammie settled first.

90
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,497
How would you like to help
the preschoolers

91
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,401
- make some decorations, honey? How's that sound?
- Yes.

92
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:56,314
Yeah? Wonderful.
All right, come on. Let's do it.

93
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:58,005
Bay Two, drop an NG tube

94
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,000
for a gastric lavage
to identify if it's an upper

95
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:01,427
or lower GI bleed.

96
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,278
Bay Three, grab some sugar
packets from the breakroom.

97
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:05,588
Sprinkle them on the
prolapsed stoma, then reduce it.

98
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:07,007
- On it.
- Bay Four,

99
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,250
avoid sutures
for that poor girl's head lac.

100
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:10,601
Just use her hair
and some Dermabond.

101
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:16,108
Dr. Sullivan,
I see why Kit hired you.

102
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,761
- Bet you put the "go" in "go, team."
- If I'm not ordering

103
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:23,773
- new sneakers every other month, I'm not doing my job.
- Me, too.

104
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:26,259
So, how's your first week been?

105
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,494
Fine.

106
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,699
A bunch of us are gonna hit
the Lunar New Year party

107
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:33,098
after work. You should join.

108
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:36,284
- Free food.
- Yeah, tonight's not gonna work.

109
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:39,464
Dr. Sullivan, I'm starting
to think you don't like us.

110
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,216
I don't know you well enough
to like you or not, Dr. Feldman.

111
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:45,805
Exactly. So maybe come hang
and, you know, find out.

112
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:47,889
Unfortunately, I have plans.

113
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,891
I don't think

114
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,718
she really has plans.

115
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:53,394
So, what do we say to everyone

116
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:56,880
who keeps asking us
who the new ER doctor is?

117
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:59,307
Tell them I believe in the soul.

118
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:02,478
The hanging curveball.
High fiber. Good Scotch.

119
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:05,565
That the novels of Susan Sontag
are self-indulgent crap.

120
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,649
I believe
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

121
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,134
And I believe there ought to be

122
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:10,978
a constitutional amendment
outlawing Astroturf

123
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:12,855
and the designated hitter.
I believe in opening

124
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,725
- your presents...
- ...in opening your presents Christmas morning

125
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,002
rather than Christmas Eve.

126
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:18,170
Crash Davis's speech
from<i> Bull Durham.</i>

127
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:20,154
- Great movie.
- It's the best.

128
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:22,916
Evidence suggests you and I
could be friends, Feldman.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm impossible not to like,
Sullivan.

130
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:26,829
So, you aren't on social media.

131
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:29,072
I tried to find you to make sure
you weren't a psychopath.

132
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,824
Well, I'm not an exhibitionist

133
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,269
- or a narcissist.
- Harsh.

134
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,521
- But a picture is emerging.
- Love to get back

135
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,766
- to my patients now. If you don't mind.
- Mm.

136
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,274
Do your thing.

137
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:43,278
I so agree with everything
you just said, by the way.

138
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,095
I, too, am tired
of the humblebrags

139
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:46,940
and the... You're
just gonna keep wa... Okay.

140
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:48,274
Thanks, Dr. Sullivan.

141
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,860
Another successful interaction,
Zach.

142
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:52,694
You paged?

143
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,680
29-year-old female.

144
00:06:54,774 --> 00:06:56,774
Had a syncopal episode
during spinning class.

145
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,043
She had a heart transplant,

146
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,944
so figured
you should take a look.

147
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:01,195
What do we have here?
Initial EKG,

148
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,382
chest X-ray
and head CT negative.

149
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:06,550
Vitals are stable.
She's awake and orientated.

150
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:11,047
Call Hawkins.

151
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:14,141
- For a consult?
- Just call him.

152
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:20,206
- What's up?
- Hey.

153
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,649
- Is it your mom?
- No. No, no,

154
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:24,903
this is about a young lady
here in the ER

155
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,464
with a syncopal episode
and a cardiac history.

156
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,822
They called me to do a consult

157
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,468
because she had
a heart transplant.

158
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:32,494
- Okay. Let's have a look.
- It's...

159
00:07:32,644 --> 00:07:34,913
a little more complicated
than that.

160
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,250
The transplant was performed
by a former colleague of mine

161
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:40,459
at Redman Hospital
three years ago.

162
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:43,730
Three years ago.

163
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:46,749
- In September.
- When in September?

164
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:49,302
September 17th.

165
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,096
Yeah, there's no doubt about it.

166
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,308
She has Nic's heart.

167
00:08:05,603 --> 00:08:08,196
Gigi, this is Sammie,
and she'd like to help you

168
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,507
- with some decorations. Is that okay?
- Okay.

169
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:13,776
Hi, Sammie.
I'm not very good with scissors.

170
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,927
I can help. I'll show you how.

171
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:17,612
You're a great dad, Jake.

172
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,206
She's a sweetheart.

173
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:21,375
It's all Sammie.
I think she was born this way.

174
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,547
So, what's this all about?

175
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:27,048
Let's get a coffee,

176
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,802
- find a quiet place to talk.
- Okay.

177
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:43,063
Don't say anything to her.

178
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,899
There's no reason
she has to know.

179
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:47,235
And I don't want to talk
about it. At least

180
00:08:47,385 --> 00:08:50,386
- not until we know what's wrong and fix it.
- Understood.

181
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,056
Hannah.

182
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,328
Hey. I'm Dr. Austin,

183
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:58,164
- and this is my colleague Dr. Hawkins.
- Hello.

184
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:00,333
- Nice to meet you both.
- So, we heard you had a bad fall.

185
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:03,083
Yeah. I started
taking a spin class.

186
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:05,338
Been getting in good shape,
and I love it.

187
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:07,321
So, you think maybe
you pushed yourself too hard?

188
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:10,091
That's what's weird.
I mean, I don't think so.

189
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:12,920
I forgot my spin shoes at home,
so I had to come back.

190
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:14,905
And I remember I'd just joined

191
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,764
the class
when "Nonstop" came on.

192
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,850
Ah, I love that song.

193
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,353
Uh,

194
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:22,762
and all of a sudden,
I couldn't catch my breath

195
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:24,931
and just collapsed on the bike.

196
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:28,275
Paramedics had to unclip me,
and I came to in here.

197
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:31,070
Well, let's take a listen
to your heart, shall we?

198
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:36,517
Your turn.

199
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,494
Hmm?

200
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,560
Heart sounds normal.

201
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:03,702
All right, let's
lie you down for an echo.

202
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:05,355
Okay.

203
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:09,310
We saw that you had

204
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:11,152
a heart transplant
a few years ago.

205
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:14,147
Yeah. I'm one of the lucky ones.

206
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:16,983
Well, aside from
the shortness of breath

207
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,067
in class,
you have any leg swelling?

208
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,827
Wake up with trouble breathing?

209
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,247
No, um,

210
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,831
not since my transplant.

211
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:26,908
It was like a miracle.

212
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,077
I was born with a bad heart.

213
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,078
I mean, I suffered

214
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:32,757
with every symptom
of heart failure

215
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:36,085
for so long, it felt
like I was dying every day.

216
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,179
And then
after I got my new heart,

217
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:40,266
I was alive again.

218
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,676
Any other symptoms?
Anything at all?

219
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,519
I have headaches occasionally.

220
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,683
Well, the echo shows

221
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:52,985
that your heart's
ejection fraction is low.

222
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:58,090
Meaning it's-it's not pumping
as well as we'd like,

223
00:10:58,183 --> 00:11:00,609
which is probably the cause
of your collapse.

224
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,289
Uh, Hannah,

225
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:04,779
I'm sorry to tell you this,

226
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:07,542
but you are
in early heart failure.

227
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:09,962
No. No, no.

228
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:13,880
Um, I prayed that I'd never hear
those words again.

229
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,709
This heart can't fail.

230
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:18,461
It can't.

231
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,698
After my transplant,
I did everything

232
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:24,558
the doctors told me to do.
I-I never missed an appointment.

233
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,893
I mean, I...

234
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:27,628
- How could this happen?
- Don't worry.

235
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:30,032
We're gonna run some labs,
and we're gonna figure this out.

236
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:33,567
Relax.

237
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,235
Take a deep breath.

238
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:43,161
- Okay?
- Okay.

239
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:44,986
There you go.

240
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,748
It's gonna be okay.

241
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:49,250
- What's the story there?
- Hmm?

242
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,044
Why do you ask?

243
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:55,965
Why the urgent page?

244
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,426
Now Hawkins seems concerned.

245
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:02,846
So, are we sharing
personal tidbits now?

246
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,265
Okay. All right. I deserve that.

247
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:08,853
That young woman
was the recipient of a donor heart,

248
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,597
and it belonged
to Conrad's wife,

249
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:14,066
who died in an auto accident
three years ago.

250
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:16,193
Damn.

251
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:19,772
She was a
legendary nurse practitioner.

252
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:21,199
One of us.

253
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:24,025
And Nic and Conrad
were a great couple.

254
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,780
A true love story.

255
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:28,614
That's tragic.

256
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,850
It's taken him years to recover.

257
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:32,851
He's finally starting
to live again.

258
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:34,454
And...

259
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,047
if that woman
has something seriously wrong

260
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,125
and should happen to die...

261
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:41,302
- Who knows how he's gonna react.
- Yeah.

262
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:46,132
A few weeks ago,
I started feeling... off.

263
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:50,137
Numbness in my hands
and a loss of dexterity.

264
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:52,388
That's why I pulled myself

265
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,222
out of surgery. I just wanted

266
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,734
to make sure
I knew what it was first

267
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,725
before-before I worried you.

268
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:59,394
So I waited.

269
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,655
But I got
the final results today.

270
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,742
And I...

271
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,651
I don't want to spoil
this visit.

272
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:08,644
I've been so looking forward
to it. But you're here,

273
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:09,973
- so...
- What is it?

274
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,499
P-Please, just tell us.

275
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:15,001
I have multiple sclerosis.

276
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,913
Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.

277
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,067
- We're-we're here for you.
- And I...

278
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,835
I know. You know,
I just learned this morning,

279
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,919
so I'm...

280
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,472
still kind of processing.

281
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:29,718
A-And to be honest,

282
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:31,351
I'm just... I'm just reeling.

283
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,229
Of course.

284
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,097
But there's hope.

285
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,260
Whatever you've been experiencing

286
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:40,861
- can be treated with meds.
- Yeah.

287
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,204
W-We need to jump into this
right away.

288
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,840
We need to find
the best place for you

289
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,617
- to get treatment.
- I, you know, I have to round

290
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,277
on some patients that I've been
asked to consult on, so...

291
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,205
Of course. Go.
We'll get more information,

292
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:53,615
and come find us
in my office when you're done.

293
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,334
Yeah. Okay.

294
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,783
Now the decompression.

295
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:16,230
Placing the needle
into the subdural hematoma.

296
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,407
Nicely done.

297
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:30,054
I can see why AJ is courting you
for cardiothoracic.

298
00:14:30,138 --> 00:14:32,580
Choosing a specialty
is gonna be so hard.

299
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:33,914
I wish I could do it all.

300
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:35,990
I think
being a heart surgeon's great.

301
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:38,144
If you want to be a plumber.

302
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,174
Do not let Dr. Austin hear you say that.

303
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:45,259
No shade to Dr. Austin,
but the heart is just a pump.

304
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:48,745
The brain is more complex
than the universe

305
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,823
and the source of everything
that makes us human.

306
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:56,662
It's the source of my dyslexia
and the key to overcoming it.

307
00:14:56,754 --> 00:14:58,330
See, it's personal to you.

308
00:14:58,423 --> 00:15:00,607
That's how passion
for a field is born.

309
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:02,684
You think I could do this?

310
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:06,113
We could always use more women
in neurosurgery.

311
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,506
We are overloaded
with arrogant men.

312
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:12,285
But I would never try
to recruit you.

313
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:13,178
Why?

314
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:15,114
Well, Devon would kill me,

315
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:16,849
- for one thing.
- Oh. He...

316
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:19,534
- He'll support whatever I choose to do.
- I know.

317
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:22,289
But as a neurosurgeon,
your life becomes the hospital.

318
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:24,123
To be truly excellent
requires total commitment,

319
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,292
and the pressure is intense.

320
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:27,386
If you ever want

321
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,787
- to have kids...
- That's far in the future.

322
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,057
If ever.

323
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:36,302
I really want to consider this.

324
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:37,885
All right.

325
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,140
Well, we can talk about it.

326
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:42,309
You have both the brains
and the guts.

327
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,738
Okay, you ready to try it blind?

328
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:49,548
Oh, hell yeah.

329
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:53,827
Lunar New Year was your father's
favorite holiday.

330
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:55,155
And I also remember as a kid,

331
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:56,581
he would give me
those little red envelopes.

332
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,824
And I thought today,

333
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:02,168
perhaps you could use one.

334
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,750
Can always use a little luck.

335
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,854
Do you really think
this drug trial

336
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:22,004
could beat my cancer?

337
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:26,693
Most success rates are low,
generally, in clinical trials,

338
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:28,028
but this one's different.

339
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,772
I mean,
they're thinking this could be

340
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,847
the next big thing
in lung cancer.

341
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:33,200
But one step at a time, Mom.

342
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:36,620
First, we have to get you
enrolled in the trial.

343
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:42,710
So, my mother's cancer
is spreading.

344
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:43,869
Her lung masses are growing,

345
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:45,689
and there's a new met
in her liver,

346
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:49,635
and if it continues to spread...

347
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:52,302
The next step will be hospice.

348
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,663
Yeah.

349
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:56,049
We're not there yet,

350
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,966
but I do want to give her
the best chance to live,

351
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,387
and-and right now,
it's your trial.

352
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:03,556
But have you looked
at the side effects

353
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,961
- of this trial?
- Yeah.

354
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,308
She can do this, Pravesh.

355
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,730
I'll need to assess that
for myself

356
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:12,146
- very carefully.
- Yeah.

357
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,157
Yeah, please do.

358
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,737
But...

359
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:20,163
This is our last hope.

360
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:30,816
- Hey. I heard.
- How?

361
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:32,011
The gossip mill at Chastain

362
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:33,160
is alive and well.

363
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:35,261
We're all pulling for her.

364
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,683
- Do you know what's wrong?
- Heart failure.

365
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,760
We're seeing what we can do.

366
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:41,509
How are you holding up?

367
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,271
I'm keeping perspective.
The heart is a muscle.

368
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:50,611
Hey.

369
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,947
This is me, Conrad.

370
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:55,825
Inside this woman
who walked into our ER

371
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:58,852
is a part
of someone we both loved.

372
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:01,079
That means something.

373
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,365
After Nic died,
I kept seeing things

374
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,302
that made me feel
like she was near me.

375
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:09,538
A song we loved would
suddenly come on the radio.

376
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,539
A woman in the park
with her laugh.

377
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:14,219
I'd find an old note
she left for me in the drawer.

378
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,594
That type of thing.

379
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,122
Then eventually, it faded.

380
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,049
But now a small part of her,

381
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,886
a real part of her, is here.

382
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,721
Alive.

383
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:32,211
Hannah, talk to me.

384
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:33,988
I can't... I can't breathe.

385
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:36,230
- I can't breathe.
- She's hypotensive,

386
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,049
tachycardic,
and her sats are dropping.

387
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:39,985
This looks
like cardiogenic shock.

388
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:43,580
- I need a norepinephrine drip.
- And page Austin.

389
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:50,913
Her ejection fraction
is only 15%.

390
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,423
We need to get her
to the cath lab now.

391
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,182
Inserting

392
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,017
the pump into the aorta.

393
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:06,761
That should help her heart
pump a little easier.

394
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,506
But it's only a
stopgap. Her heart failure

395
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,599
- is getting worse.
- She must be rejecting

396
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,085
the transplanted heart.

397
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:15,446
I wish there
were some other explanation.

398
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,365
Well, she
stabilized enough to tolerate

399
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:20,942
the biopsy.
That should tell us more.

400
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,412
Biopsy catheter to me.

401
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:34,214
So, AJ told me
you've discussed how, um,

402
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:37,718
brutal and, uh, dangerous
this trial would be.

403
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,454
And you're sure
you'd want to do it?

404
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,223
I'm sorry to ask you again,
but given the risks,

405
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,726
I need to hear it
from you directly.

406
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:48,103
Yes.

407
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:52,398
And...

408
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,878
do you have any concerns that
you want to discuss with me?

409
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,980
I'm not just doing this
for myself

410
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,733
but for others.

411
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,327
I mean,

412
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:05,237
it will help advance
the science, right?

413
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:06,321
Yeah.

414
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,575
That's the point
of the clinical trials.

415
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,335
They're experiments.

416
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,810
Okay. I'm in.

417
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:14,755
I admire that enormously.

418
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:17,917
But we still have to determine
if you meet the criteria,

419
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:21,595
which means one more test.

420
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,138
- Okay?
- Okay.

421
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,594
So,

422
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:31,020
I'm gonna put this
over your nose.

423
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:36,101
Now I want you to put your mouth

424
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:38,278
around this mouthpiece
and breathe in normally.

425
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:44,368
All right, Carol. I want you

426
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,453
to pant. In and out.

427
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:48,622
Good.

428
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,366
Now take a deep breath in.

429
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:54,713
Now breathe all of the air out.

430
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:57,372
Keep going.

431
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,383
Come on.

432
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,863
And we're done.

433
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:07,307
Let me try that again.

434
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:10,310
Okay. One more time.

435
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,722
<i>The rules of the trial
are clear.</i>

436
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,152
We need an FEV1 of 50% or more.

437
00:21:19,063 --> 00:21:22,155
Hers were 45 both times.

438
00:21:23,808 --> 00:21:25,652
I'm so sorry.

439
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,368
She didn't pass.

440
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:32,157
So, you're telling me that
she doesn't meet the criteria

441
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:34,310
based on what's essentially
a rounding error?

442
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,002
No, it's more
than a rounding error.

443
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,395
There are other issues.

444
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:38,756
I reviewed Carol's chart.

445
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,592
Her echo and performance status
were borderline, AJ.

446
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:44,010
A-Are you cherry-picking

447
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:46,846
only healthy patients to protect

448
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:48,099
your numbers?

449
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,759
I'm not protecting my data.

450
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm protecting Carol.

451
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,170
And given her condition,

452
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:55,514
I'm not sure how likely it is

453
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:56,924
this incredibly
difficult regimen

454
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:58,400
would even help her.

455
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,854
"Not sure"

456
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:03,680
doesn't cut it when we're
talking about my mother's life.

457
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:05,515
I'm sorry,

458
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:07,802
but these criteria exist

459
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:10,037
for a reason.

460
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,265
Who are you?

461
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:16,859
No, really,
is-is this who you are?

462
00:22:16,953 --> 00:22:18,769
A numbers dude

463
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:23,008
who blocks
a desperate woman's last hope?

464
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,823
Wh-What happened?

465
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:48,616
Your heart failure is worsening.

466
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:51,663
We're waiting
for tests to confirm,

467
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:53,896
but we're worried that...

468
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:58,067
your body is rejecting
your transplanted heart.

469
00:22:58,903 --> 00:23:01,580
You have to fix it.

470
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:03,589
Please.

471
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,651
We're trying.

472
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:09,422
I'll let you know as soon as we
get the results of the biopsy.

473
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:11,006
Okay.

474
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:12,925
If you need anything

475
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:14,101
or you feel any discomfort,

476
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,678
I want you to push
this red button, okay?

477
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,565
I trust you.

478
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:23,752
I know you'll help me.

479
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,070
I will.

480
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,111
Hey.

481
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:33,361
I'm doing a split shift,

482
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:35,513
so I'll be taking care
of Hannah in the ICU.

483
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:38,775
- Want me to catch you up?
- No. Already did that myself.

484
00:23:38,902 --> 00:23:40,270
I'll keep a close eye.

485
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:43,172
Page you if anything comes up.

486
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,615
Conrad?

487
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,093
Yeah?

488
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:52,597
I'm sorry about your wife.

489
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:55,894
Thanks,
but this isn't about Nic.

490
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:57,719
It's about Hannah, okay?

491
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:15,119
Open. Ah. Open...

492
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,071
It's good. It's okay.

493
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:19,374
It's okay.

494
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:26,798
Oh!

495
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:35,163
Dr. Bell, are you okay?

496
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:38,352
Yeah, fine. Thanks.

497
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,881
We have great news.

498
00:25:08,032 --> 00:25:09,192
Kit and I have been calling in

499
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:10,359
every favor.
We're really excited

500
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,443
to tell you
what we've come up with.

501
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:13,961
Sit down.

502
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:18,115
It's all right. I'm not
completely incapacitated yet.

503
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:20,394
Uh, n-no, I know. I just...

504
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:24,223
The landscape around MS
is always evolving.

505
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:27,884
New immunomodulator therapies
reduce relapses

506
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:29,395
and progression.

507
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:30,655
If you experience a relapse

508
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:31,904
after, uh, starting

509
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:33,716
one treatment,
many patients try another,

510
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,310
and-and they keep trying
until they're symptom-free.

511
00:25:36,394 --> 00:25:38,738
Finding the right specialist
is paramount,

512
00:25:38,822 --> 00:25:40,563
so Jake pulled some strings

513
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:44,326
and got you a neuro consult
at the Mayo Clinic on Tuesday.

514
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:46,420
The chair of
the department's a friend.

515
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,980
I did his nephew's cleft palate
surgery a few years ago.

516
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:50,648
He's already been filled in.

517
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:52,925
Thank you. Both of you.

518
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:54,178
So you'll go?

519
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,089
Yeah, of course.

520
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:58,080
And I'm-I'm grateful.

521
00:25:58,249 --> 00:25:59,591
I'm so encouraged.

522
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:02,521
- Jake, I need a couple minutes alone with Kit.
- Yeah.

523
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:06,064
I'll, uh, let Mayo know
you're confirmed.

524
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,608
Kit, I'm leaving Chastain.

525
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:18,192
A leave of absence.

526
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:20,769
- Of course. To heal...
- No. Permanently.

527
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:22,180
What?

528
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:24,124
I'll-I'll try the treatments,

529
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:26,776
and I'm grateful for the help,

530
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,104
but I'll never operate again,

531
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:30,463
- even if I get markedly better.
- Why not?

532
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:33,717
You at 95% is better
than anyone at 100.

533
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,876
It's more complicated than that.

534
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,389
Then, please, explain it to me.

535
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:42,509
- Optic neuritis. You familiar?
- Of course.

536
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:43,792
Eye pain, vision loss.

537
00:26:43,886 --> 00:26:45,369
Are you experiencing any?

538
00:26:45,462 --> 00:26:48,233
I just had an episode.
It cleared up.

539
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:51,317
But it's a sign the disease
is progressing rapidly.

540
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:54,488
I'll lose my strength,
then the ability to walk

541
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:57,149
and speak and eat.

542
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:58,659
And at some point,

543
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:01,154
- I'll end up paralyzed in a hospital bed...
- Okay, stop.

544
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:03,329
- ...unable to feed myself.
- Stop.

545
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:05,207
Stop.

546
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:16,093
See, you fell in love with
the man that I wanted to be.

547
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:22,807
And I became him because of you.

548
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:27,854
What are you saying?

549
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:30,315
I love you.

550
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:35,510
And I will not saddle you
with this.

551
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:41,194
I have a welcome speech to give,
but don't leave.

552
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,496
- We have to talk about this.
- No, we don't.

553
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,333
I have an office to pack.

554
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:40,551
Kit!

555
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:45,265
Hey, Kit!

556
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:48,518
Kit!

557
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:51,480
What'd he say?

558
00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:57,234
What happened?

559
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:16,789
Gigi, wait! Sammie, wait!

560
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:19,340
Sammie!

561
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:27,382
She's seizing.
Two milligrams of lorazepam now.

562
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:30,059
I'm gonna get her on her side
before she aspirates.

563
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:39,311
So, she came in with heart failure,

564
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:40,739
rapidly developed
cardiogenic shock.

565
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:43,223
- And now seizures?
- Despite everything

566
00:29:43,307 --> 00:29:44,390
we're throwing at her,
she continues trending

567
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:46,319
- in the wrong direction.
- She has a bleed.

568
00:29:46,403 --> 00:29:48,303
Likely caused by the
blood thinners we put her on

569
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,644
for the balloon pump.

570
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:51,916
I mean, thankfully, it's small,
so we can just monitor.

571
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,917
But look at the meninges
lining her brain.

572
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,060
Usually they're smooth,
but here they're bumpy.

573
00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:58,078
Something more serious
is happening here.

574
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,506
Infection.

575
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,091
An infection while
we're blasting her with meds

576
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,985
to suppress her immune system
would be deadly.

577
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:05,821
- Devi and I will do a spinal tap.
- I'll get her a full body scan.

578
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,098
I'll send off autoimmune labs
and talk to pathology,

579
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,982
see if the biopsy results
are back.

580
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:13,437
- So what did I miss?
- Hannah's labs came back normal.

581
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:17,022
Spinal tap was negative.
No cancer on the full body scan.

582
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,098
Pathology told me
her biopsy proves

583
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,290
she's rejecting her heart.

584
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:21,102
Tacro levels
are in the basement.

585
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,839
So her heart's failing because
she's probably not taking

586
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,948
- her immunosuppressants.
- I don't think she would do that.

587
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,192
Not based on everything
she told us.

588
00:30:26,276 --> 00:30:27,942
Well, we don't
really know her, do we?

589
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:30,369
You know,
people can surprise you.

590
00:30:33,023 --> 00:30:34,867
I got to check on a patient.

591
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:36,792
I'll be back in five.

592
00:30:39,864 --> 00:30:41,047
You all right?

593
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:44,791
My mom's not getting
into Devon's trial.

594
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:47,386
He said she missed the cut.

595
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:49,290
Why don't you talk to Hannah
about those meds?

596
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:50,765
I'll talk to Devon.

597
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:05,404
Carol was outside the FEV1
entry criteria by five percent?

598
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:09,742
Those are the rules.
My hands are tied.

599
00:31:09,894 --> 00:31:11,162
Protocol exists for a reason.

600
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,413
I taught you to break
the rules for the patients.

601
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,982
You taught me to also follow
the science.

602
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,818
And what you're saying now
is to ignore it.

603
00:31:17,902 --> 00:31:18,982
Yeah, we both know her odds

604
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:20,562
are long
and this is your first trial,

605
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:24,648
but to turn her down because
she'd skew your statistics?

606
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:26,024
Do you think it was easy for me

607
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:28,428
to tell AJ that she wasn't
a candidate?

608
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:30,923
But I know it was
the right thing to do.

609
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:32,339
The right thing to do for who?

610
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,842
The patient, the pharma company
or for you?

611
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:38,395
For everyone.

612
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:42,424
If your father were still alive,

613
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:47,089
and you had a chance to save
him with this trial,

614
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:49,925
but he didn't fit the criteria
by a small number,

615
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:52,130
would you make the same call
you did for Carol?

616
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:55,180
I have spent all day
trying to convince myself

617
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:57,416
it is okay to let her
into this trial.

618
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,034
But I know that if I do,
she will likely end up

619
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,954
on dialysis
when her kidneys fail.

620
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,040
Fluid in her lungs will make her
feel like she is drowning.

621
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,060
But what if she
makes it through?

622
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:12,954
I don't see that happening.

623
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:15,059
Carol is brave.

624
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,292
She wants to help the science.

625
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:19,813
But if I bend the rules
to let her in,

626
00:32:19,963 --> 00:32:23,400
her sacrifice,
it won't even do that.

627
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,570
I am not going to torture

628
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:28,546
an older immunocompromised
woman.

629
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:32,784
She's already been through
enough. I won't do it.

630
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:44,923
- You talk to Devon?
- I did.

631
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:46,424
- And?
- I'll explain later.

632
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:49,233
But we will do what's right
for Carol, I promise.

633
00:32:49,326 --> 00:32:51,078
We're out of time.
She's getting worse.

634
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:52,920
What about
the immunosuppressants?

635
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:55,340
She insists she's been taking
them. She has from the start.

636
00:32:55,424 --> 00:32:58,666
She told us she had headaches
off and on.

637
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:00,846
She had seizures.

638
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,837
Maybe she thinks
she's taking the meds.

639
00:33:02,932 --> 00:33:05,692
She could be forgetting
to take them,

640
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:09,237
because of an underlying
neurological problem.

641
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:15,593
How long has she been
tapping like that?

642
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,869
For hours.

643
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,163
It's the same consistent tempo.

644
00:33:24,788 --> 00:33:28,589
Her tapping matches the beat
of her heart on the monitor.

645
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:33,010
Maybe she's hearing
her heartbeat in her ears.

646
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:40,144
You're right. I can hear it.

647
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,228
Must be a dural
arteriovenous fistula.

648
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,878
An abnormal connection

649
00:33:44,015 --> 00:33:45,898
of blood vessels in the brain.

650
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,152
Explaining all her symptoms.

651
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:49,895
From the headaches
to the seizures

652
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:54,233
to forgetting to take her meds,
resulting in the heart failure.

653
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:57,634
So, her heart problem
is really a brain problem.

654
00:33:57,728 --> 00:34:00,038
And that can be fixed
through surgery.

655
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:04,125
One second.

656
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:10,481
Unequal pupils.

657
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:11,843
Her brain bleed
is getting worse.

658
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:15,010
I'll page Billie now.

659
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:18,097
Dr. Austin?

660
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:20,081
If you don't mind,
I'd like to monitor

661
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:24,010
our patient's intraoperative
cardiac function.

662
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:26,271
Of course.

663
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:30,275
This one's for Nic.

664
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,946
- Sammie?
- Gigi?

665
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,456
- Sammie, Gigi!
- Gigi?

666
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:45,958
- Sammie!
- Gigi?

667
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,503
Sammie!

668
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,507
- Girls?
- Sammie!

669
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:57,555
Once there was a little bunny

670
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,045
who wanted to run away.

671
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:02,635
So he said to his mother,
"I'm running away."

672
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,534
"If you run away,"
said his mother,

673
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:08,389
"I'll run after you,
for you are my little bunny."

674
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:11,224
"If you run after me,"
said the little bunny,

675
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:13,894
"I'll become a fish
in a trout stream,

676
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:15,981
and I will swim away from you."

677
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:18,382
So the mommy keeps him safe?

678
00:35:18,476 --> 00:35:21,827
Yes, you see? No matter
what the little bunny does,

679
00:35:21,978 --> 00:35:23,387
he's always protected.

680
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:27,417
Like you protected me
from the dragon?

681
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,168
That's right, Gigi.

682
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:35,507
Pickups and
dural scissors to me.

683
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,594
Opening the dura now.

684
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:46,518
It was unavoidable.

685
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,856
Two large bore suctions.

686
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,750
Sutures. We have
to repair the sinus.

687
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:55,195
Cardiac doppler to me.

688
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,440
We got an air embolism.

689
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,618
If air in the
blood hits the heart,

690
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,036
it could be fatal.

691
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:05,784
Chu, drop the head of the bed.

692
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:09,266
Devi, flood the field
with irrigation.

693
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,338
I need a central
line to aspirate the embolism.

694
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:22,947
Heartrate's stable.

695
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,124
All good, man.

696
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,977
All right.

697
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,561
All right, let's keep it going.

698
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:57,416
You can run, but you can't hide.

699
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,342
I will find you.

700
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,222
Wherever you go, I will follow.

701
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:07,916
We will go to the Mayo Clinic
together.

702
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,745
And wherever the road
leads after that.

703
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:12,713
But it will lead back here,
to Chastain.

704
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,016
Because you will get better.

705
00:37:15,168 --> 00:37:17,501
You will operate again.

706
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:21,429
And you will save lives
as you have before.

707
00:37:21,523 --> 00:37:23,365
Well, you don't know that.

708
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,291
I do know

709
00:37:31,442 --> 00:37:35,120
that whatever complications
may be ahead,

710
00:37:35,204 --> 00:37:37,521
we will face them together.

711
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:41,358
Because you are the great love
of my life,

712
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:46,139
and I'm pretty sure
I'm the great love of yours.

713
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:51,793
It's gonna be okay.

714
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:54,271
It's okay.

715
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:08,486
So?

716
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,204
Is my mother in your trial
or what?

717
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,585
No. I'm sorry, AJ.

718
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:20,091
I agree with the decision.

719
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,248
What?

720
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:23,918
Wow.

721
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:27,304
Wow. I really expected more
from you.

722
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:31,684
When Nic came into this hospital
gravely injured,

723
00:38:31,835 --> 00:38:33,754
I would have died to save her,
but I couldn't.

724
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:35,021
No one could.

725
00:38:35,248 --> 00:38:37,356
I know better than anyone
there is nothing harder

726
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:40,175
than not being able
to deliver a miracle.

727
00:38:40,344 --> 00:38:42,687
This trial
would not help your mom.

728
00:38:42,771 --> 00:38:44,197
It would harm her.

729
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:46,841
But that doesn't mean
there's nothing we can do

730
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,492
for your mother.

731
00:38:49,778 --> 00:38:50,945
I'm...

732
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:54,456
actually a little relieved.

733
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,535
If I'd qualified for the trial,

734
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,713
I'd have given it
everything I've got.

735
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,257
But...

736
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:06,970
I'm tired.

737
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:11,306
Part of me was doing it for you.

738
00:39:16,806 --> 00:39:18,139
Wow. Mom, I'm sorry.

739
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:20,807
I-I didn't mean
to push this on you.

740
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,986
Hush. Hush, son.

741
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,114
You've been an angel.

742
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:30,251
Carol, I'm
gonna call your oncologist

743
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,969
about starting you
on palliative care right away.

744
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,489
It's not hospice.

745
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:36,916
You don't need that yet.

746
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:40,338
No, no. Palliative care doctors
will treat your symptoms

747
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:44,090
and make sure you live
your best life without pain.

748
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,158
It's something
we should've started

749
00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:47,668
the day you were diagnosed.

750
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,682
Studies have shown that people
with metastatic lung cancer

751
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:53,266
can actually live longer...

752
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:54,926
- And better.
- ...than those who continue

753
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,844
aggressive
and sometimes harmful treatment.

754
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:01,014
And this will give us more time
to do the things that we love.

755
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,108
Together.

756
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:06,737
AJ, honey, I would love that.

757
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,192
That should heal in a few weeks.

758
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:14,205
And your neurologic symptoms
should start resolving soon.

759
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,846
The fistula in your brain

760
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,948
didn't just cause headaches.

761
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:18,532
It affected your memory.

762
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,867
That made you forget
to take the meds,

763
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,287
which led to the rejection.

764
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:24,789
- And my heart?
- We've begun treatment,

765
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:28,050
and your heart is already
showing signs of recovery.

766
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:32,346
Dr. Hawkins made the diagnosis.

767
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:35,391
Dr. Hawkins.

768
00:40:36,052 --> 00:40:38,436
How can I thank you?

769
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,106
All of you.

770
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:45,233
Get some rest.

771
00:40:56,164 --> 00:41:00,041
I wasn't sure if I
was gonna tell you this, but...

772
00:41:05,414 --> 00:41:08,007
My wife was an organ donor.

773
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:11,635
And she saved a lot of lives.

774
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:16,474
