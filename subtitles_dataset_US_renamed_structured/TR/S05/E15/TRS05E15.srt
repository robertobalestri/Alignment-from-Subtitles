00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:03,911
<i>-Previously on</i> The Resident...
-Palliative care doctors will

2
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:05,229
treat your symptoms

3
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:06,672
and make sure
you live your best life.

4
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:08,841
And this will give us
more time to do the things

5
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:10,084
that we love together.

6
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:12,753
I've been short-listed
for a seat

7
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:13,921
at the state medical board.

8
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:15,515
That's wonderful, Randolph.

9
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:18,576
I want this baby to be 100% me.

10
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:21,503
And since we're identical twins,
I was wondering,

11
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:23,523
would you give me one
of your eggs?

12
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,583
-Are you in trouble?
-No.

13
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:28,010
I'm fully in control
of my past, present,

14
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,196
and to some extent my future.

15
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,681
First...

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,776
we sterilize the tweezers.

17
00:00:35,928 --> 00:00:37,428
Don't burn yourself,
Mr. Soriano.

18
00:00:37,446 --> 00:00:40,614
Ever inspired by
your confidence, Jordan.

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,937
Now we use our sterilized
tweezer to place four

20
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:50,383
different antibiotics.

21
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:52,126
Bingo.

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,129
It'll take at least 24 hours
for us to see

23
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:58,966
which antibiotics fights off
the bacteria.

24
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:01,727
And that is just like
a real clinical trial.

25
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,046
Progress is incremental.

26
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,898
But that's the only way
for us to figure out

27
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,383
which treatments work
to heal people.

28
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:10,385
Like me.

29
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:13,573
So you're the petri dish?

30
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,482
-Ew. Gross.
-No, no,

31
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:18,411
Jordan is right,
isn't he, Dr. Pravesh?

32
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:22,582
Well, we have more
scientific terms for it,

33
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:26,644
but, yeah, your teacher is
a straight-up petri dish.

34
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,590
But a very brave one.

35
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,832
The risks are high,

36
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,742
but just think of
the potential rewards.

37
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:36,262
Scurvy, polio, diabetes.

38
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:39,932
All of those are treatable,
even curable

39
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:43,085
because of clinical trials.

40
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:47,348
So today, class, please listen
to your sub,

41
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:48,608
read chapter four

42
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,445
while I will go to
Chastain Memorial Hospital

43
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:55,189
so Dr. Pravesh can give me

44
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:58,266
my first infusion
of a potentially

45
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:01,621
life-saving drug
for my lung cancer.

46
00:02:01,848 --> 00:02:06,200
It could be a cure
or it could be something else.

47
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:09,036
That is the beauty
of experimentation.

48
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,298
We only know once
we've taken a chance.

49
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:17,711
All right, let's chase
that last dose of epi

50
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,171
with another amp of bicarb.

51
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:22,124
Pushing bicarb now.

52
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:23,643
How long have we been
coding him?

53
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,219
30 minutes by my watch.

54
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,663
But since EMS found him
at the scene,

55
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:28,981
it's probably closer to an hour.

56
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,650
He's been asystolic
the last three pulse checks,

57
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:33,043
maxed out on meds.

58
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:36,197
Fixed and dilated.

59
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,162
All right, it's time.
Stop compressions.

60
00:02:49,228 --> 00:02:51,061
Time of death 9:34 a.m.

61
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:56,734
He's too young.

62
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:58,160
And alone.

63
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,738
EMS couldn't find a wallet
or phone on him.

64
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:04,608
Olanzapine.

65
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:05,576
Aripiprazole.

66
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:08,837
Antipsychotics?
Unusual.

67
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,172
Explains why the Narcan
didn't work.

68
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:12,632
If you take enough of this,
you can still get high.

69
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:15,361
These doses are...

70
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:18,531
What?

71
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,160
These doses are what?

72
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,783
Then the unicorns have a party,

73
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:31,377
but the kitty has disappeared.

74
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:35,289
They have to save her, so they
call in Happy the bloodhound,

75
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,275
'cause he has a great nose
and he's a famous detective.

76
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:40,127
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't tell me any more,

77
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:41,887
you'll ruin it for me.
Hi, Tisha.

78
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,556
Can we read together, Daddy,

79
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:46,300
- and you do all the funny voices
the way you do?

80
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:51,021
Yes, of course.
Right after work, okay?

81
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:55,050
What is it, Daddy?

82
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,569
Have a great day
at school, Bubble.

83
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:59,129
Love you.

84
00:03:59,148 --> 00:04:02,074
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye.

85
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,008
Where you going?

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,161
To the pharmacy that filled
these prescriptions.

87
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,663
I've never heard
of this patient

88
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:33,755
and I didn't prescribe these.

89
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,090
That's not what you do.

90
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,525
You have to go straight
to the FBI.

91
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:41,188
Okay. And how do you know that?

92
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,523
I just do.

93
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:44,450
There's an office downtown.
I can give you a name.

94
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,343
Oh, perfect.
You can give me the name

95
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:47,787
of an FBI agent.
That's-that's great.

96
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:49,346
His name is Todd Barker.

97
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,015
I'll call him and let him know
that someone is using

98
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:52,533
your name and NPI number
to prescribe drugs,

99
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,185
-and he'll take it from there.
-Whoa, whoa, slow your roll.

100
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,462
What?!

101
00:04:56,705 --> 00:05:00,357
- Irving is paging me.
I got to go.

102
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:01,342
Hold on.

103
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,303
Hey.

104
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:12,219
Dr. Hawkins told me
that Grace likes

105
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,054
the comfy chairs
from the fourth floor,

106
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:17,391
so I got you one.
And by "got" I mean stole.

107
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:19,527
-Just don't tell.
-Thank you.

108
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:21,879
Where is Dr. Hawkins,
by the way?

109
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:23,305
He was with us
through all the chemo.

110
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,383
Yeah, he'll still check in
on you, I promise.

111
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:28,810
Dr. Pravesh is our doctor now.

112
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,055
He's the clinical trial
specialist.

113
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:33,057
So, it doesn't look like much,

114
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:34,149
-but...
-My TILs.

115
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,668
This is Albert's first dose

116
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:37,319
of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes.

117
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,397
The cells that we harvested
last month from your lung biopsy

118
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,175
are now primed to target
your specific cancer.

119
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,236
-Pretty amazing, right?
-It's awesome.

120
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:49,181
As in the true meaning
of the word, inspiring awe.

121
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,533
Like the way I feel
about black holes

122
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:52,910
and atomic vibration.

123
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,669
You two are such nerds.

124
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:56,246
Damn right.

125
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,415
So you will get one dose
every few hours,

126
00:05:58,434 --> 00:05:59,750
six in total.

127
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:02,936
It'll be some time before
we know if you respond.

128
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,756
But this is the first step.

129
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:08,075
Science never sounded so easy.

130
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:10,518
So I want you to be realistic.

131
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,596
This will likely make you
feel sicker

132
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:13,447
before you get better.

133
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,432
So expect flu-like symptoms,

134
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:16,709
maybe worse.

135
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:17,784
How much worse?

136
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,620
Hey, don't worry.

137
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:21,863
I could handle whatever comes.

138
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,299
This is my lifeline.

139
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:26,218
My last best chance.

140
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,266
All right, then, here we go.

141
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:44,144
Oh, Dr. Feldman, wait.

142
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:45,646
Can you cover for me
for a few hours?

143
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:47,965
No. My shift is over.
You're taking over for me

144
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:49,149
so I can have a life
outside these walls.

145
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,984
Yeah, totally.
So you can cover for me?

146
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,078
-No.
-Thank you.

147
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,805
I suppose I can't ask you
where you're going,

148
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,974
but where are you going?

149
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,475
12 hours on my feet,

150
00:06:58,568 --> 00:06:59,734
what's another 12 to 13?

151
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:01,145
This is doctor abuse.

152
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:03,571
Mariana, 36 years old,
respiratory distress.

153
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,240
No breath sounds on the right.

154
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,984
Likely a collapsed lung.
Where do you want us?

155
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:08,743
Bay 11.
Do you have a set of vitals?

156
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,989
Heart rate 120. BP 80/palp.
90%, 92% on oxygen.

157
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,248
All right. Page Dr. Austin.

158
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,750
Dr. Austin
is on his way out of here,

159
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,161
but feel free to page Dr. Devi.

160
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:19,212
-You're leaving, too? Unfair.
-Yes, sir.

161
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:20,664
If I have to stay,
everyone else should stay!

162
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,167
-I'm here. You leaving?
-I have to visit my mother.

163
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,427
And Irving is whining
like a puppy dog in pain.

164
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,354
- You go. I got this.
- On my count.

165
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,115
-One, two, three.
-What do you need?

166
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:31,842
How do you feel
about a pneumothorax?

167
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,860
- Psyched.
- This is Mariana.

168
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,937
You live in my ER now, Devi.

169
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:38,682
Mariana, we're first gonna take
a listen to your lungs,

170
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:41,293
okay? Hundley, can I get
a chest tube kit, please?

171
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,378
Mm-hmm.

172
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:47,949
Your right lung has collapsed.
I need to do a decompression

173
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,260
to help you breathe better,
okay?

174
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,316
We're gonna numb you first.

175
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,122
This may hurt a bit.

176
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:26,897
Chest tube to me.

177
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:29,133
Mm-hmm.

178
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,752
Take a deep breath in.

179
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,018
All right, we're in place.

180
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,911
Pleur-evac.

181
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:52,439
I felt like I was about to die.

182
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,681
Well, you were, dear.

183
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,868
But Dr. Devi just saved you

184
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,536
like the boss she is.

185
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:02,291
Thank you.

186
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,937
Here we go, milady.
Back to its rightful owner.

187
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:08,714
You were only CEO
for a few days.

188
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:09,956
Wait, did you move my plant?

189
00:09:10,109 --> 00:09:11,108
Yeah,
it has better light over there.

190
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,442
I have my first meeting

191
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:14,945
as a member of the state
medical board today,

192
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:18,282
so I can start a chapter
in my new life

193
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,968
and I can hand you
a smoothly running hospital.

194
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,729
Huh.
Looks like Trevor Daniels

195
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,306
-didn't show up
for work again today.
-He's been

196
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,900
AWOL since speaking out
on Billie's behalf.

197
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,425
She's trying to find him.

198
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:33,721
And Dr. Hawkins called to say
he's on his way to the FBI.

199
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:34,907
The FBI?

200
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,225
Oh. And our new ER doc

201
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:39,060
just took off
in the middle of her shift.

202
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:42,081
What were you saying about
a smoothly running hospital?

203
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,750
That in your capable hands,
it'll soon be silk.

204
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:48,378
-You look very sharp
in that suit, by the way.
-I know.

205
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:55,152
Okay, um, your own sister

206
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,596
being the biological mother

207
00:09:57,823 --> 00:09:59,264
of your child is...

208
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,675
It's a little weird, right?
Am I allowed to say that?

209
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,936
Lots of women donate their eggs
to their sisters.

210
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:07,606
True, but Devon has a point.
Giving you

211
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:08,849
one of my eggs is complicated.

212
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,425
We have to be honest
about this, right?

213
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,945
You both would be
the baby's mother, technically.

214
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:15,355
No.<i> I'd</i> be the baby's mother.

215
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,674
I will give birth
and raise my child.

216
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:21,269
Leela's responsibility ends
with the donation of the egg.

217
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:24,957
Yes, but you are identical twins
with identical DNA.

218
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,868
If I could have a child
with my own egg

219
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,686
that's identical to hers,

220
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:31,130
you wouldn't think of my baby
as Leela's,

221
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:33,523
-would you?
-But who will be the father?

222
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,050
A sperm donor.

223
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,377
Okay, but who?

224
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,363
That's my call.

225
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:42,432
Just give me some time
to think about it.

226
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:45,644
I know I don't really
have a say here,

227
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,646
-but I...
-No, you don't, sweets.

228
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:50,274
My body. My sister.

229
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,443
My egg.

230
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,820
- Dr. Hawkins.
- We spoke on the phone.

231
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,231
Agent Barker.

232
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:15,916
Sorry for the delay.

233
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,468
We were waiting on someone.
Follow me.

234
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:27,168
Dr. Sullivan.

235
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,095
Agent Barker. Always a pleasure.

236
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:31,339
- Glad you could make it.
- Things go smoother

237
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,358
when you're around.

238
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:37,087
I realized I shouldn't leave
you alone to navigate this.

239
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,449
And what exactly
are we navigating?

240
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,878
- Mom?
- In the kitchen!

241
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:55,121
Ah.

242
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,549
I know that smell.

243
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,051
That brings me back

244
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:01,278
to sixth grade, after school,

245
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:03,871
racing home
so I could get my hands

246
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:08,060
on double banana nut muffins.
Yes.

247
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:09,619
With the streusel.

248
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:13,881
Well, my store-bought scones are
ashamed to be in your presence.

249
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,385
Nonsense. We need something
to feed the birds.

250
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:22,983
Honestly, Mom, when was
the last time you baked?

251
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:26,970
Chemo Carol is history.
- Mm.

252
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:30,140
Palliative care Carol is rocking

253
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,417
-this kitchen.
-Yeah, I can see that.

254
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:36,738
I have the incentive
now that I can enjoy food again.

255
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,814
Mm.

256
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,332
Doreen and I are visiting

257
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,151
the botanical gardens
this afternoon,

258
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,746
so what can I do for you,
baby boy?

259
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Nothing.

260
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:50,010
Just seeing you like this
is all I need.

261
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:53,272
Thank you.

262
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:55,107
AJ.

263
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,686
I want you to know

264
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,281
I understand
my days are numbered,

265
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:06,860
but I'm truly living them.

266
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:09,103
I can see that, Mom.

267
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:13,125
And that makes me so happy.

268
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:16,545
Mmm.

269
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:21,875
Albert.

270
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,951
Talk to me, man.
What's going on?

271
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,713
It's just, um, some chills.

272
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:29,866
He's complaining of nausea
and muscle aches, as well.

273
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:31,701
Yeah,
it's just like the flu, right?

274
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,538
Okay, you're spiking a fever.
I'll order you some meds

275
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:37,057
-and a cooling blanket,
all right?
-It's hard to...

276
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,543
...breathe.

277
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:43,405
-What's happening?
-Probably has some fluid
in his lungs.

278
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,382
I'll put him on oxygen.

279
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,492
This isn't like the flu.

280
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:51,721
It's getting harder really fast,
Dr. Pravesh.

281
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,540
It's quicker than I expected.

282
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:58,228
This is the only hope
to get you better, right?

283
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:00,672
I'm here for you
every step of the way.

284
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:02,466
You still with me?

285
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:07,095
Okay.

286
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:11,224
Just breathe.

287
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:19,416
163 antipsychotic prescriptions
written in your name

288
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,193
in the last two months
at six different clinics

289
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:23,010
in addition
to high-priced asthma meds

290
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:24,588
and antihypertensives.

291
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:26,681
Well, I didn't do this.

292
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,108
No one's breaking out
the handcuffs, Dr. Hawkins.

293
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,776
We think you're a small part

294
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:32,537
of a much bigger case
we've been tracking for a year.

295
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:34,948
These are all brand-name drugs.

296
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,267
Highly reimbursed medications.

297
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,101
Medicare fraud.

298
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,028
Yes. Kickbacks. Drug diversion.

299
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:42,381
We think it's a pill mill.

300
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:44,716
A big one.
At least six clinics involved.

301
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:46,776
Probably busing people in.

302
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:47,869
You have a pole camera up yet?

303
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:49,462
A warrant just came through.

304
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,973
Classic mob operation.

305
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:57,287
The Mafia is often involved
in Medicare fraud.

306
00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:58,379
There's little oversight,

307
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,123
scant punishment
and big rewards.

308
00:15:00,142 --> 00:15:02,142
And we now have
mob levels of violence.

309
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,069
Federal investigators,
informants,

310
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:05,812
even doctors who assist
in our investigations

311
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:07,088
have been murdered.

312
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:08,815
Which is
why we're keeping an eye

313
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,909
on Dr. Sullivan as best we can.

314
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:14,246
Nice to know you've been working
with the FBI.

315
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:15,972
How did they get

316
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:18,158
- Dr. Hawkins' name and numbers?
- Few years ago,

317
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,234
there was a ransomware attack
on Chastain.

318
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,920
They were just idiots
in some basement.

319
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:24,256
Yeah, well,
typically these idiots

320
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:27,426
sell your identities,
DEA, NPI numbers

321
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:29,744
to larger
criminal organizations.

322
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,097
So, what do I do about it?

323
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:35,416
You go back to Chastain,
leave this to us.

324
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:38,845
If you don't,
it could be your life in danger.

325
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:41,273
I think we've heard enough
to understand.

326
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,499
Not nearly.

327
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:44,017
That's all I can tell you
right now.

328
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,760
And we have to get back to work.

329
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,405
Great seeing you again.
Talk soon.

330
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:50,264
Dr. Hawkins.

331
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:53,743
You and I need
to have a little chat.

332
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,775
Mariana, how are you feeling?

333
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:02,610
Better. Very well, actually.

334
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:03,795
Oh, glad to hear it.

335
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,705
I can't believe
this happened again.

336
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,707
Wait,
your lung's collapsed before?

337
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,043
Yes.
My doctor wasn't too worried.

338
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:12,028
He said I was young, healthy.

339
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:14,789
Is it possible
this is just a coincidence?

340
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,308
It's unlikely.

341
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:18,643
We're going to have to keep you
here to figure this out.

342
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,554
-No, I have an important meeting
with a client later.
-Cancel it.

343
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:23,273
Can you elaborate?

344
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,725
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,819
I did not mean
to sound so blunt.

346
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:29,470
I'm a surgeon,

347
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,973
so most of the patients
I deal with are unconscious.

348
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,900
My bedside manner
gets a little rusty.

349
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:35,719
But that's no excuse.

350
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:38,145
I'd be more concerned
if your scalpel was rusty.

351
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,815
And you do not need
to apologize.

352
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,409
Would a male surgeon apologize?

353
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:45,152
It's unlikely.

354
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:47,672
I've told my team to shoot me

355
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,749
if I ever apologize to a client.

356
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:51,659
Makes them trust you less.

357
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,570
What do you do?

358
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:54,754
I'm an architect.

359
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,848
My uncle's an architect.

360
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:59,075
He's never apologized
for anything.

361
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:02,521
Frank Lloyd Wright said,
"Early in life, I had to choose

362
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:06,583
"between honest arrogance
and hypocritical humility.

363
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:07,859
I chose honest arrogance."

364
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:09,811
Well,

365
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,156
I vote for honest humility.

366
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:14,941
And on that note,

367
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,184
your lung should not
collapse twice.

368
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,779
We'll have to consult
a specialist, okay?

369
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,250
I'll be back to check
on you later.

370
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,865
-Breathing better?
-Mm-hmm.

371
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:35,111
See? Everything's fine.

372
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,614
If he's this bad
after a first dose,

373
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:38,782
what will happen next?

374
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,750
He's got five more to go.

375
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,895
Everybody reacts differently.

376
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:45,789
We won't know until we proceed.

377
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,357
That's just how it works.

378
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,293
Grace, you haven't eaten
all day.

379
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:53,888
Why don't you go
to the cafeteria for a bit?

380
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,890
I'll be fine.

381
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,535
Okay.

382
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:08,086
I've tried to talk her through
this, explain the science.

383
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,422
I gave her a book
on Marie Curie.

384
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:14,092
Big mistake, since Curie
died experimenting on herself.

385
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,744
Yeah, still walking
that one back.

386
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,267
Albert, it's time
for your second dose.

387
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:24,010
I figured.

388
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,479
That's why I asked her
to step out.

389
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:30,500
You sure?

390
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:32,360
Yes.

391
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:35,196
I'll be back.

392
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,041
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want...

393
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:53,189
Well, I don't think we've seen
anything too concerning today.

394
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,707
Certainly nothing
requiring punitive action.

395
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,192
Uh, actually, there is one case

396
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:58,194
we haven't discussed
that's alarming.

397
00:18:58,213 --> 00:18:59,954
Emily Benesch, 32 years old.

398
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,808
Ms. Benesch had, uh, an anterior
cervical discectomy and fusion.

399
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,809
Dr. Elkins,
you're a neurosurgeon.

400
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:05,977
Did you see this complaint?

401
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:07,294
I did. As I recall,

402
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:09,038
the patient had
complications post-op.

403
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:10,982
The surgeon damaged
her spinal cord.

404
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:12,967
Now Ms. Benesch is a paraplegic.

405
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:14,969
Spinal surgery always has risks.

406
00:19:15,063 --> 00:19:16,321
Well, uh,

407
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:19,565
after the operation,
she felt something was wrong,

408
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:23,662
she asked her surgeon Dr. Keith
Bosley for a follow-up,

409
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:26,239
and he "brushed her off."

410
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:29,668
I know Dr. Bosley personally.
I-I doubt he brushed her off.

411
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:31,744
Well, I found several
other complaints against him.

412
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:34,731
So wouldn't, uh,
multiple complaints

413
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:36,299
be a red flag?

414
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,906
I think we should dig into
Dr. Bosley's patient outcomes

415
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:47,268
and... give Ms. Benesch
a fair hearing.

416
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:55,919
Stories like this
flood our office.

417
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:58,738
Patients get emotional
when complications occur

418
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,514
and look to place blame.

419
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,443
This patient isn't emotional,
she's a paraplegic.

420
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:05,853
We can't fix
every patient's problem

421
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,872
or guarantee everyone
a perfect outcome.

422
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:09,782
No, I understand that.

423
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:13,360
But isn't it the job
of this board

424
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,213
to hear our patients' problems,

425
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,125
particularly when there are
repeat complaints?

426
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,793
Dr. Elkins, will you delve
into this more deeply?

427
00:20:20,946 --> 00:20:22,278
Should a close friend

428
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:26,224
of Dr. Bosley's be the one
to lead his investigation?

429
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:29,877
State medical boards
are staffed by doctors

430
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,230
precisely because we are
the best people

431
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,123
to judge our own colleagues.

432
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:37,068
So let's just simmer down.

433
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:40,221
Just watch,
and learn how we operate.

434
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:41,798
Oh, I-I think I'm getting
a pretty good sense

435
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:43,324
of how you operate.

436
00:20:56,498 --> 00:20:58,572
When you wouldn't answer
questions about your past,

437
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,908
I didn't push.

438
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:06,347
I respected your privacy,
but that's off the table now.

439
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:11,144
Talk to me.

440
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:20,336
It started with a phone call
back when I was a resident.

441
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:23,764
I was employed by a big
hospital system in Chicago

442
00:21:23,858 --> 00:21:25,508
that took a lot
of Medicare patients.

443
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:29,862
They were overtreating,
doing unnecessary surgeries,

444
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,365
and ripping off Medicare
for millions of dollars.

445
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,775
That's almost standard
operational procedure

446
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,853
in some hospitals these days.

447
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:39,522
I couldn't let it stand.

448
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:43,784
I see a problem...
I try to fix it.

449
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:45,970
I get that.

450
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:50,958
So I called a Medicare
fraud tip line,

451
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:54,128
and the DOJ got involved.

452
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:56,222
Long story short,
I ended up wearing a wire

453
00:21:56,391 --> 00:21:59,876
and collecting documents to help
them get the proof they needed.

454
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,402
You were hooked.

455
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:04,397
Yeah.

456
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:08,326
So when the FBI approached me
to keep working with them...

457
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,887
...I was all in.

458
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,330
They need doctors
to understand medically

459
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:16,167
what's fraud and what isn't,
and to work undercover.

460
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,730
Soon, we went after
the biggest fish.

461
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:22,415
The Mafia.

462
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,512
It was a much tougher world.
Lot of risk.

463
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:33,393
Eventually, I was identified
as an FBI operative, and...

464
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:37,413
...there was an attempt
on my life.

465
00:22:37,432 --> 00:22:40,099
-Are you safe now?
-It's been two years.

466
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:44,028
But the Mafia makes a practice
of punishing its enemies.

467
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:47,940
I never know who I can trust,

468
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:51,185
so I say as little as possible
about my past,

469
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:54,998
and I don't stay long
in one place.

470
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:57,750
You should have told me.

471
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:06,259
I get that
you're in a tough spot.

472
00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:12,223
Here's the thing.

473
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,452
I like you.

474
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,730
And I like you.

475
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,125
But it ends there.

476
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:24,977
I don't get involved
with anyone, Conrad.

477
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,630
And no one should
get involved with me,

478
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,965
for a number of reasons,

479
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:34,320
but the main one
is that I will disappear.

480
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:38,157
Well, maybe you should
stop running.

481
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:41,419
Trust me on this.

482
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,648
You take care of people.

483
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:48,575
You want to take care of me.

484
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,928
But you can't.

485
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,139
I take care of myself.

486
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:58,978
I'll see you at Chastain.

487
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:19,290
Dr. Pravesh, what's going on?

488
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,608
His pressure is plummeting
and he's spiking a fever again.

489
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:22,868
He still has three doses left.

490
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,537
More fluids should
bring up the pressure.

491
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,856
I-I don't think
he can handle the trial.

492
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:28,132
I don't think I can, either.

493
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:30,042
-I want it to stop.
-When Albert is stable,

494
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,618
we will discuss it,
but right now

495
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,379
we don't even know
if the trial is to blame.

496
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:35,956
It could be an infection,
and I don't want to deprive him

497
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,034
of a cure for the wrong reasons.

498
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:39,626
How are you gonna figure it out?

499
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,128
Grace.

500
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:42,963
You have to trust me
and this process.

501
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,816
You two and your
scientific method.

502
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,542
I don't trust this "process."

503
00:24:46,561 --> 00:24:47,968
Look at him.

504
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:49,803
Whatever you're doing
is making him worse.

505
00:24:49,897 --> 00:24:52,231
If this protocol's gonna work,
it's gonna take time.

506
00:24:52,383 --> 00:24:53,307
Let's get him to the ICU

507
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:55,568
so we can stabilize him
and monitor him,

508
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,220
and I promise you

509
00:24:57,238 --> 00:24:59,405
that all options will be
available to the both of you.

510
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,866
Fine, and thank you,
but I'd like to call in

511
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:03,501
Dr. Hawkins
for a second opinion.

512
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:06,320
I've already paged him
for a consult. He's on his way.

513
00:25:06,414 --> 00:25:07,413
Albert?

514
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,232
I am right here.

515
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,175
It's gonna be okay.

516
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:24,413
I'm fine. Yes. Yes.

517
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:28,008
Don't worry.
Uh-- The doctor's walking in.

518
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:31,087
I love you, too. Bye.

519
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,347
My husband. Also an architect.

520
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,866
Which is why he isn't here.

521
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:37,368
He's on-site of a new project
in Memphis.

522
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:40,705
Dual-career marriage.
I know all about that.

523
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,615
And the people who do it
with children?

524
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:43,949
Boggles the mind.

525
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:45,117
Agreed.

526
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,544
My career is all-consuming.

527
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:50,773
And I'm a perfectionist.
It's a compulsion.

528
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,778
Cough sounds bad.

529
00:25:55,797 --> 00:25:58,014
Let me take a listen.

530
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,392
Hey, what's going on?

531
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:04,120
Hemoptysis
in our pneumothorax patient.

532
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:05,879
Her lungs sounded clear,
but now...

533
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:07,473
There's still an air leak.

534
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,308
And there's no blood
in the chest tube.

535
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,403
Mariana, we're gonna confer
for a minute, okay?

536
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,074
Okay, so something
more serious is going on.

537
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:18,576
All right, well,
give me the differential.

538
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:22,246
It could be an abscess,
bronchiectasis or even cancer.

539
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:24,248
-A CT should help.
-All right.

540
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,542
Well, let's get her
in the magic box right now.

541
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,147
And then this Dr. Abernathy

542
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,241
dismisses the case
as though it was nothing.

543
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,168
Do you think the neurosurgeon's
really culpable?

544
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,430
Well, I'm not gonna condemn him
without solid consideration,

545
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:42,517
but they refused
to give it any air.

546
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:49,607
What?

547
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:52,259
-Does any of this
really surprise you?
-No.

548
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,780
This is why I wanted the job
in the first place.

549
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,449
So what will you do?

550
00:27:05,867 --> 00:27:08,534
<i>Hello?</i>

551
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,019
Hello, is this Ms. Benesch?

552
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:11,687
<i>Yes, who's calling?</i>

553
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,206
This is Dr. Randolph Bell
from the state medical board.

554
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,027
I'd like to talk with you
about Dr. Bosley.

555
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:21,430
<i>Finally. I'd given up hope.</i>

556
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:26,644
Got your page.

557
00:27:26,871 --> 00:27:28,704
I came as quickly as I could.

558
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:30,148
Is your emergency handled?

559
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,559
Hard to tell.
How's Albert doing?

560
00:27:33,711 --> 00:27:35,044
Well, we're four doses in.

561
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,545
I've had to give him
broad-spectrum antibiotics

562
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:39,323
and three liters of fluids,
and he's getting sicker.

563
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:41,217
I had to start him on norepi.

564
00:27:41,235 --> 00:27:43,995
-You think it's the trial drug?
-I do.

565
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:45,738
His blood cultures
came back negative,

566
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,573
there's no sign of infection.

567
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,058
And it's time for his next dose.

568
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,501
Ah, that's a tough call.

569
00:27:50,653 --> 00:27:53,913
He's already on a non-rebreather
with a borderline blood gas.

570
00:27:54,065 --> 00:27:55,931
With another dose,
you may have to intubate.

571
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,991
Which could be fatal for Albert.

572
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,677
A ventilator-associated
pneumonia,

573
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:00,903
with his immune system?

574
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:03,406
God, and his poor wife.

575
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:05,183
And the trial?

576
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:09,336
An intubation would be
an unexpected adverse event,

577
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,356
which could get the trial paused
or stopped altogether.

578
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:14,099
But if he doesn't
finish the protocol,

579
00:28:14,252 --> 00:28:15,359
and his cancer
only gets worse...

580
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:18,421
So if I give him the dose,
it could kill him.

581
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:21,199
And if I hold it, then
everything he's gone through

582
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:23,534
up until this point
would be completely useless.

583
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:24,851
There's no good answer.

584
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:34,045
And Albert's wife, she doesn't
trust me, she trusts you.

585
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:38,716
Yeah, I'll talk to her,
but let's be clear:

586
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:39,866
you make the call.

587
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:42,428
No. Neither of us will.

588
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:45,598
Albert should decide.

589
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,291
So, your CT was clear.

590
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:58,218
Which means it's not an abscess,
inflammation or cancer.

591
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,313
Okay, so what's next?

592
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:02,798
It's good to rule things out.

593
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:04,967
I am going to circle back
with Dr. Austin, and I...

594
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:09,446
Are you still in pain?

595
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,581
Is it your chest?

596
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:12,808
It's just, it's just cramps.

597
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:14,143
The same every month.

598
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:16,645
Ooh, they're excruciating
sometimes.

599
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:18,071
Have they always been this bad?

600
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,649
As long as I can remember.

601
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:22,760
Sometimes I even
get a nosebleed.

602
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:25,680
It's a real thrill,
being a woman.

603
00:29:27,325 --> 00:29:28,824
The last time
your lung collapsed,

604
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:30,509
were you also on your period?

605
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:33,604
Uh, a-as a matter of fact I was.

606
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:35,347
I... Yeah.

607
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,426
I-I remember I had to ask
for pain meds while I was here.

608
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,669
Why?

609
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:42,596
Sit tight, I will be right back.

610
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,189
I promise.

611
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:46,951
<i>Endometriosis? Really?</i>

612
00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:48,286
Her pneumothorax coincides
with her periods,

613
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,012
which are abnormally painful.

614
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:52,123
Isn't it possible
that aberrant endometrial tissue

615
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:53,624
from her pelvis traveled
through tiny defects

616
00:29:53,701 --> 00:29:56,127
in her diaphragm up
into her chest, where...

617
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:58,296
Where it continues to respond
to the hormones

618
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:00,523
of her menstrual cycle,
thus wreaking havoc.

619
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:03,526
Yeah, it's definitely possible,
but, Devi, that's...

620
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:05,452
-extremely rare.
-So is having repeated episodes

621
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,805
of pneumothorax with
no discernible cause on imaging.

622
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:09,198
What if these aren't random?

623
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:11,291
What if this is evidence
of a problem

624
00:30:11,385 --> 00:30:13,369
her body's been trying
to hide this entire time?

625
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:16,797
Well, we could get
an MRI for a better look,

626
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:18,891
but ultimately
the only way to confirm

627
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:21,043
a catamenial pneumo
is with surgery.

628
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:23,045
That's thoracic and abdominal.

629
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:24,638
And if we find
what you think we will,

630
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:28,159
-that could be a hell
of a procedure.
-That can cure her.

631
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,885
I'm ready for this.

632
00:30:29,904 --> 00:30:31,512
Oh, I know you are.

633
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:36,075
Devi, you just pulled off a
Conrad Hawkins-level diagnosis.

634
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:39,128
Let's get your patient ready
and scrub in.

635
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,490
Tell him we can stop,

636
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,734
Dr. Hawkins, please.

637
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:47,086
Of course we can.

638
00:30:47,238 --> 00:30:50,072
- I've always said that.
- We can't quit

639
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:52,908
an experiment halfway through.

640
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:56,062
I tell my students all the time.

641
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:59,005
This is your life.

642
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,524
You get to be selfish.

643
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:03,486
You don't have to think
about the greater good.

644
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:06,530
I am being selfish.

645
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,533
Without the trial, I die.

646
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:16,481
But you may die sooner with it.

647
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,767
I can't lose you.

648
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:21,253
Do you think I'm not scared?

649
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:25,866
I am.

650
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:29,035
But this is what I want to do.

651
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,765
I'm willing to suffer
for the science,

652
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:36,376
just for a chance, however slim,
to survive this cancer.

653
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,397
I just need you
to support me, please.

654
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:42,316
-But, Albert...
-Listen, listen.

655
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,153
We're a team, right?

656
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:48,889
Don't fight Dr. Pravesh.

657
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:51,391
Just trust him.

658
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,077
And trust me

659
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:56,497
and honor
what I want and believe.

660
00:31:57,566 --> 00:31:58,958
Okay.

661
00:32:00,995 --> 00:32:03,328
I've decided, Dr. Pravesh.

662
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:07,550
Please give me the next dose.

663
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:43,944
<i>I hope this isn't an imposition.</i>

664
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,021
More like a surprise.

665
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,189
I thought the state
medical board

666
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:49,208
had lost all interest
in my case.

667
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:50,801
My lawyer certainly has.

668
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:52,803
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

669
00:32:52,955 --> 00:32:54,472
Thank you.

670
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:57,457
I don't blame her.
She took me on pro bono.

671
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,810
When we couldn't get
any traction with the board,

672
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:01,979
there wasn't any way forward.

673
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:05,040
Are you looking
for a financial settlement?

674
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:06,817
No, I'm looking
for accountability.

675
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:08,877
He nicked the artery
in my spine.

676
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:10,045
There was massive bleeding.

677
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:11,655
My spinal cord was damaged.

678
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:13,732
I did not have to end up
like this.

679
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:16,902
I don't want future patients
of Dr. Bosley to, either.

680
00:33:17,054 --> 00:33:19,238
Hey, your case file
says that you received

681
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,815
a second and third opinion
about your outcome.

682
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,560
And that a post-op MRI
would have caught the damage,

683
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:27,988
and then a second emergency
surgery could have repaired it.

684
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:30,065
Yes. I might
still be walking today

685
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:31,509
if Dr. Bosley had
listened to me.

686
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:34,011
He didn't.

687
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:40,743
So he says you pushed hard
for the surgery,

688
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:43,245
That's not the point.

689
00:33:43,264 --> 00:33:45,022
The harm I suffered
during the operation

690
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:47,107
could have been prevented.

691
00:33:48,085 --> 00:33:51,603
I want the board
to do something.

692
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,280
Will they?

693
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,452
Honestly? Probably not.

694
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:03,165
But I will do something.

695
00:34:09,364 --> 00:34:11,715
I'm maxed out on norepi,
adding vasopressin.

696
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:13,551
I hear crackles halfway up,

697
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:14,718
and he's losing consciousness.

698
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,536
Albert.

699
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:18,280
Can you hear me?

700
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:21,133
-We're gonna need to intubate.
-No, not intubation.

701
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:22,968
He's struggling to breathe,
Grace.

702
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,303
It may be the only thing
to help keep him alive.

703
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:25,378
I'll grab an intubation tray.

704
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:27,898
I knew we should have stopped.

705
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,901
My husband, him I understand.

706
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:32,236
He'll never quit. But you?

707
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:33,962
You're doctors. You know.

708
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:35,647
You're supposed to know better.

709
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,316
Why couldn't you stop him?

710
00:34:37,468 --> 00:34:39,468
Grace, you know I respect you
and your husband.

711
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:42,137
He didn't want to stop,
we have to honor that.

712
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,489
And Dr. Pravesh
has my total support.

713
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:46,083
I'll be right back.

714
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:49,962
Add a dialysis line.
His kidneys are shutting down.

715
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:02,266
Yeah. Just let me know, please.

716
00:35:03,994 --> 00:35:06,437
Albert's stable for now.

717
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:09,607
Yeah, well, it doesn't
change the fact

718
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:14,686
that he walked in here
in decent shape and...

719
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,673
now he's on dialysis
and he's being intubated.

720
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:18,949
Did you call the study sponsors?

721
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:21,176
I had to notify them
of the toxicity of the drug,

722
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:22,694
and now they're deciding
if they're gonna put

723
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:24,246
the trial on hold.

724
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:27,607
Grace was right,

725
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:29,076
I knew the dangers,

726
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,869
I knew the odds for Albert
were getting longer

727
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:34,114
every single hour.

728
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,281
I shouldn't have
listened to him,

729
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:36,967
except I know
that I should have.

730
00:35:37,194 --> 00:35:38,710
You followed
the patient's wishes.

731
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:40,220
It was the right move.

732
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:44,366
Albert knew exactly
what he was doing.

733
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,144
I feel like a general
who's sending my soldiers

734
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:49,521
out into the battlefield
to face a line of machine guns

735
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:51,556
while I stand in safety.

736
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:52,724
All wars have casualties.

737
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:55,152
And they also have triumphs.

738
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:58,030
It's the same
with clinical trials.

739
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:03,977
I want Albert to survive.

740
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:07,647
I want him to teach his kids
for years to come.

741
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:10,575
So they can visit him
in his happy retirement.

742
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:12,503
He deserves that.

743
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,655
This isn't over.

744
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,416
The intubation bought him time.

745
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,011
So... next steps.

746
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,907
All right, what we know now
is that he's battling

747
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:27,184
massive inflammation
from the trial drug.

748
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:28,911
So, if we treat
the inflammation...

749
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:30,020
I hesitated to give him steroids

750
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:32,672
because I thought
he was infected, but...

751
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:34,007
We should go for it-- plus toci.

752
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:36,009
If all his cultures
have been negative, yeah.

753
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:38,153
It could help more
than it could hurt him.

754
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,406
Let's do it.

755
00:36:43,018 --> 00:36:44,593
Endometriosis fits
your symptoms.

756
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:45,944
You check all the boxes.

757
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:48,021
You know, most doctors
don't ask women

758
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,207
the right question
to make these connections.

759
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:52,042
That's why it can
take years to diagnose.

760
00:36:52,194 --> 00:36:54,527
But if we're right,
we can fix this.

761
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:57,214
But we do need to be clear
about what this means for you.

762
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,532
This condition can
affect your fertility.

763
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,944
Now, with surgery,
you should end up pain-free,

764
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:03,612
but if we find extensive damage,

765
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:07,725
you are aware that you may not
be able to have children, right?

766
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:09,301
I discussed it with my husband.

767
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:11,286
He's flying in to be with me.

768
00:37:11,455 --> 00:37:14,547
He's okay with never
having children.

769
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:15,882
And you?

770
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,067
W-We're on the same page.

771
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:19,962
We're focused on each other,
and our careers.

772
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,980
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

773
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,366
You're absolutely right.

774
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:28,061
His MAPs are solid.

775
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,472
I'm gonna titrate down
the norepi.

776
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,293
-That's an improvement.
-Not enough.

777
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:37,171
What do the labs say?

778
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:40,649
Just tell me.

779
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:43,177
Look for yourself.

780
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:49,082
His blood gas looks good.

781
00:37:49,176 --> 00:37:51,417
We can turn down
his oxygen to 40%.

782
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:55,497
And his liver function
is normalizing.

783
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:56,940
He's turning around.

784
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,152
He's gonna be okay.

785
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:04,597
Yes. Yes.

786
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:07,009
Albert will make it
through this trial.

787
00:38:07,177 --> 00:38:09,528
You have given him
a chance to survive.

788
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,497
You did it.

789
00:38:23,193 --> 00:38:25,210
He's looking better, right?

790
00:38:25,362 --> 00:38:28,864
He already wants to send
a video to his students.

791
00:38:28,957 --> 00:38:30,549
I tell them every day,

792
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:35,220
record even the most incremental
progress in your experiments.

793
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:38,440
This is more than incremental.

794
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,044
When you're ready,
I'll set up a transfer

795
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:44,321
back to the room
with the comfy chair.

796
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:53,313
Albert, I owe you an apology.
Grace, you, too.

797
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:56,575
I just had no idea
it was gonna get this bad.

798
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:59,002
You were doing your job.

799
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:01,396
I'm sorry I got so angry.

800
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:04,583
Oh, stop, both of you. I was
a willing guinea pig, remember?

801
00:39:04,735 --> 00:39:07,069
A human petri dish.

802
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:10,088
Besides, it worked.

803
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,740
Well, we know you can get
through the doses.

804
00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:14,409
But we don't actually know if
it's gonna help your cancer yet.

805
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:17,896
But I have a chance.
More than I had before.

806
00:39:19,007 --> 00:39:22,918
See? I told you
to trust Dr. Pravesh.

807
00:39:23,011 --> 00:39:24,269
-You were right.
-Mm.

808
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:27,513
Like two peas in a pod,
you science nerds.

809
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:29,366
That's right.

810
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:31,017
Now, here's the real question.

811
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,020
Who can recite
the periodic table faster?

812
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,614
-Did you just challenge me?
-Yes, I did.

813
00:39:35,782 --> 00:39:37,875
No-- Actually, no,
y-you need to get some rest.

814
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,769
Hydrogen, helium, lithium...

815
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:42,546
Okay, okay, okay. You win.

816
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:43,939
You win.

817
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:45,107
<i>Imaging,</i>

818
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,550
<i>please dial 2732...</i>

819
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:50,779
Oh, well, well, well, if
it isn't the queen of Chastain.

820
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:53,056
Hey.

821
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,058
Ah...

822
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,543
-Oh. Nice.
-You like that, right?

823
00:39:57,638 --> 00:39:59,730
Hey, man, I heard
Devon's clinical trial

824
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:01,214
passed the first test.

825
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,457
Yeah, barely.

826
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,310
The protocol was worse
than anyone imagined.

827
00:40:05,462 --> 00:40:07,812
Your mom wouldn't
have survived it, AJ.

828
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:10,815
Well, we have no regrets.

829
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:12,075
You know what she did today?

830
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:13,802
She made three different
kind of muffins

831
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,729
and she took a walk
through the botanical gardens.

832
00:40:16,823 --> 00:40:20,809
Telling you, brother,
palliative care was a good call.

833
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:21,977
So, uh...

834
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:26,481
do we need to talk
about the new ER doc?

835
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,999
-Okay.
-Yeah.

836
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:30,502
Look, I'm just saying,
I like her.

837
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,170
No BS, no sugarcoating.

838
00:40:32,322 --> 00:40:34,247
Uh, she's definitely
an interesting case.

839
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,992
"Interesting."
That sounds mysterious.

840
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,511
Come on, man.
Give up the backstory.

841
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:41,163
No, do not go there.

842
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:43,181
You know something I don't?

843
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,108
I thought you two might have
something going on.

844
00:40:45,335 --> 00:40:47,335
-Just colleagues.
-Yeah, for now.

845
00:40:47,354 --> 00:40:51,615
No. I already have
one lady in my life.

846
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,266
Me.

847
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,010
-I'll catch you tomorrow.
-All right.

848
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:56,528
See you later, cutie-pie.

849
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,104
Bye.

850
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,290
The unicorn book, you promised.

851
00:41:00,517 --> 00:41:01,850
What?

852
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:04,294
Unicorn book? I don't know
what you're talking about.

853
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:08,039
- Daddy.
- I didn't forget, sweetheart.

854
00:41:08,192 --> 00:41:12,094
Happy the Bloodhound
is coming right up.

855
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,033
I'm so proud of you.

856
00:41:18,051 --> 00:41:20,719
And I'm proud of you.

857
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:25,040
You made a tough diagnosis
most doctors would miss.

858
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:27,542
And you got your patient

859
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:31,046
through a very rough surgery,
Leela.

860
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:34,307
Well, I really admire Mariana.

861
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,476
And I'm really glad
I got to know her a bit.

862
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,144
She's a successful
businesswoman,

863
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:42,057
and an unapologetic
control freak,

864
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,836
with a very successful husband
in the same business.

865
00:41:46,063 --> 00:41:47,229
Sounds familiar.

866
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:49,655
And she wasn't at all afraid
of a condition

867
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,674
that could make her infertile,

868
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,175
because she doesn't want kids.

869
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:54,736
I mean, there are people
like that.

870
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:56,346
I'm just not one of them.

871
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:01,476
I want to have a family one day.

872
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,521
With you.

873
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:08,933
We need to talk about this.

874
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:11,511
I don't know if I want kids.

875
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,104
At least not right now.

876
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:17,259
I could not manage
surgical residency and a family.

877
00:42:17,261 --> 00:42:19,519
Yeah, I get that.

878
00:42:19,687 --> 00:42:20,779
And it can wait.
We have plenty of time.

879
00:42:20,931 --> 00:42:23,415
Devon, it could be a long while.

880
00:42:24,935 --> 00:42:27,952
Leela, all kinds of doctors
manage it.

881
00:42:28,105 --> 00:42:30,605
I mean, there are work-arounds.

882
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:33,458
I believe that, I just...

883
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:38,180
I don't know if it'll ever be
the right thing for me.

884
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,285
Which is why I-I realized

885
00:42:43,303 --> 00:42:45,970
that what Padma wants
can help us both.

886
00:42:46,123 --> 00:42:48,139
I can give her the egg
she so desperately wants,

887
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,433
so she can have a baby,
and at the same time,

888
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,196
I can freeze some for me.
For us.

889
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:56,798
For the future.

890
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:59,317
Yes.

891
00:42:59,469 --> 00:43:03,246
Just to give me time
to think about it.

892
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:07,992
But that's all I can promise
right now.

893
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:10,420
Can you live with that?
