1
00:00:02,728 --> 00:00:05,088
- Previously on The Resident...
- I have multiple sclerosis.

2
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:06,063
Darling, I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:07,232
We're here for you.

4
00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:08,674
The doctors at the Mayo said

5
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:09,991
you could return to surgery.

6
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:11,488
I'm hopeful and I'm reassured.

7
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,586
Promise me one thing...

8
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:14,513
You won't give up on the OR
just yet.

9
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:15,906
Do Billie and AJ know

10
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:17,552
that you want to be
double board-certified

11
00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:19,334
in the hardest field
of medicine,

12
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:21,428
neuro and cardiothoracic surgery?

13
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,764
I've mentioned
that I want to do this.

14
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,340
Bob Porter.

15
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:26,594
University Hospital, Augusta.

16
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:28,171
So you must be the other name

17
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,248
on the governor's short list
for a seat on the medical board.

18
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:31,530
So we are competitors.

19
00:00:31,757 --> 00:00:34,091
You mind if I ask you
why you want a seat?

20
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,587
Just want to give back.

21
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,703
No, I need a letter of recommendation

22
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,330
for the Georgia State
Medical Board.

23
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,356
I'm competing with
another doctor for the spot.

24
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,357
Who is he?

25
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:43,451
This is him.

26
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:44,746
Robert Porter is angling

27
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,211
for a seat on the board.

28
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:48,433
He raped me
when I was 13 years old.

29
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:50,624
You want to go before the board
and tell them?

30
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,509
I want to make a statement.

31
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,847
Yes, a chronic back,
elbow, knee issue

32
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,887
might not be a terminal disease,
but

33
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,635
it can feel like one

34
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:20,746
due to the impact it has
on your life.

35
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:22,392
But

36
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,491
with 3D printing, soon,

37
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:29,329
we will be able to create
patient-specific implants.

38
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,310
Customized. Targeted. Personal.

39
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:34,818
This will be revolutionary.

40
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:46,605
"Advancements in medicine have inspired

41
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,440
"promising new treatments,

42
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:51,777
empowering patients and giving
them more say in their care."

43
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:54,354
Thank you.
"And clinical research

44
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:55,930
"can advance it even further,

45
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:58,002
resulting in progress
that can change..."

46
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:01,269
Oh, my God.
Could this be any more boring?

47
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:03,104
Doubtful.

48
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:04,865
But never underestimate the draw

49
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,792
of your geeky
clinical trial sexiness.

50
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:12,183
I wish you were coming with me.

51
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:13,298
Me, too.

52
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,187
But this conference
might be more enticing

53
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:18,211
than gender reveal festivities.

54
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:24,125
About you doing both
cardiothoracic and neurosurgery,

55
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,512
obviously, it is entirely,
100% your decision.

56
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:31,294
But, I mean, this is going to be

57
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,226
a massive,

58
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,987
massive challenge, Leela.

59
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:37,381
I know. I won't make a decision

60
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:40,159
until I have a real conversation
with Billie about it.

61
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,142
Okay?

62
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,995
Okay.

63
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,142
And that's Jessica.

64
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,574
Good luck
with your presentation.

65
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:02,431
This is the best macaron
I've ever tasted.

66
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,167
Your sister is so elegant.

67
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:08,670
She is. Beautiful and rich.

68
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:10,263
We've always been so different.

69
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:12,098
Just look at her.
Look how skinny she is,

70
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,579
and she's
three months' pregnant.

71
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:17,174
It must be nice that you
and Padma are so similar.

72
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,009
You get to avoid comparisons.

73
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,200
Oh, no, there are comparisons.

74
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,017
One of us is fun
and spontaneous,

75
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:25,612
the other serious, rigid.
I'm sure

76
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:27,166
- you can guess who's who.
- No.

77
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,542
Way to stick to
the pink and blue theme, Jess.

78
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:32,856
There's a theme?

79
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,098
I didn't know.

80
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:36,440
Funny, lady.

81
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,602
You look lovely,

82
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:39,196
even if you're dressed
for a funeral,

83
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,702
not a gender reveal party.

84
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:43,366
Considering that gender is
a social construct...

85
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,109
It's an amazing party.

86
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:46,892
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

87
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,187
And thank you for coming, Leela.

88
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:50,281
And the real fun
is about to begin.

89
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:53,357
Have we got a surprise for you.

90
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,141
She's so funny.

91
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,069
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

92
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,124
Oh, photo op.

93
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:02,074
And that photo will be online

94
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,221
in three, two,

95
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,661
one.

96
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,490
They're so cute.

97
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,251
How did they meet?

98
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:13,682
Scarlett was bartending,

99
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:15,473
doing some modeling on the side.

100
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:18,643
Will came in for a drink and he
couldn't take his eyes off her.

101
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,737
She went from being behind
in car payments

102
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,744
to flying on private jets.

103
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:25,133
All right, boys and girls,

104
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:26,673
let's gather round!

105
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,606
Thank you all for being here.

106
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:37,200
Let's find out if our firstborn

107
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,089
is a lad or lassie.

108
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,596
Our OB and the guys

109
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,033
who built this
are the only ones who know.

110
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:52,269
Is that a cannon?

111
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,533
Wait, like a cannon-cannon?

112
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,036
With these two,
it's go big or go gigantic.

113
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:58,108
On the count of three.

114
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,373
One!

115
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,208
Two!

116
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,521
Three!

117
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,792
Is this thing broken?

118
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:20,635
- Babe!
- Oh, my God.

119
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,137
Someone call 911!

120
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:24,231
See if he's okay.

121
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,846
I'm thinking we'll pick up pasta
from Luigi's or...

122
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:50,757
Yes! I love their "carbon-ye-ara."

123
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:53,000
Carbonara works.

124
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:54,335
With ice cream on top?

125
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:55,929
No, Daddy.

126
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:57,414
Just parmesan.

127
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:58,910
But I thought you liked
ice cream on top.

128
00:05:58,934 --> 00:05:59,934
Bye, Daddy!

129
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,695
Okay, well,
I'm having ice cream.

130
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:13,372
She's already reading?
That's amazing.

131
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:16,375
Way sooner than I ever did.

132
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:19,461
She must've got that
from her mom.

133
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,772
- I'll be back in a sec.
- Thank you.

134
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:28,962
You working in the ER today?

135
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,533
Yeah, yeah,
I'm covering for Devon.

136
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,077
He's at that clinical
trial conference.

137
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,558
Ah, right. Yeah.

138
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,446
For some, being
an ER doc isn't enough.

139
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,787
He's got to be
a fancy scientist, too.

140
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:38,950
Well, our patients are lucky

141
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:41,048
to have you here, too,
my friend.

142
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:42,120
Help!

143
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:43,621
My passenger is dying.

144
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:44,736
What happened?

145
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:46,323
I picked her up
from her apartment,

146
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:47,589
she got in all pale and shaky,

147
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:50,795
asking for a hospital,
and slumped onto the seat.

148
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:51,888
I'm Dr. Hawkins.

149
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,304
You're at Chastain
Memorial Hospital.

150
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:58,302
Can you tell us what's going on?

151
00:06:58,326 --> 00:07:00,460
Okay, how about your name?

152
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:06,144
Finger stick 104.

153
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,737
Will get these to the lab stat.

154
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,595
Blood pressure low. O2 sat 89.

155
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:13,932
Her son, I'm guessing?

156
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,562
Hmm, she works at Only A Dollar.

157
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,017
Oh, here we go. Uh,
Charli April Martinez.

158
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:25,610
Born January 15, 1997.

159
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:27,424
I see a subtle

160
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,522
petechial rash
to her neck and arms.

161
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,950
We're calling her emergency contact.

162
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:35,028
She's 25 years old,
ear infection in 2004,

163
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,955
vaccinations up to date.

164
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,440
Charli's popular.

165
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:40,959
Turn the ringer on

166
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,036
in case someone calls
who can tell us something.

167
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:44,423
Her emergency contact's
not answering.

168
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:45,705
I'll try again later.

169
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,610
Looks like she had a laparoscope
placed there recently,

170
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,281
but abdominal surgery
needs more than one port.

171
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,213
O2 sat's 98% on nasal cannula.

172
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:55,974
- BP's 104/60.
- Seems like

173
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,367
she's protecting her airway.

174
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,680
Let's use this opportunity
to get more info.

175
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:01,554
Trevor, page Raptor,
have him meet you at CT.

176
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,483
I'm gonna make a quick stop.
I'll catch up with you there.

177
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:25,578
Hey.

178
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:29,043
Thanks again for writing
that letter of recommendation.

179
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,468
Well, I hope it helps.

180
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,663
And Porter?

181
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:37,974
Is he still in the running
for the same seat?

182
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:40,093
Why wouldn't he be?

183
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:41,669
Well, I've heard
there are multiple

184
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:42,963
ethics complaints against him.

185
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:44,167
I thought that might
get him disqualified.

186
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:48,568
Let me know if you hear
anything more about him.

187
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:58,036
You're smiling.

188
00:08:58,187 --> 00:08:59,996
That's good news, right?

189
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:05,285
- This my latest MRI?
- Yep.

190
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:07,932
Your neuro exam is excellent.

191
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:10,456
No new lesions.

192
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,001
Since you started taking
the meds,

193
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:15,387
your MS is not progressing.

194
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:17,964
How you feeling?

195
00:09:18,116 --> 00:09:21,726
Overall, good.

196
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:26,064
Better now.

197
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,111
It means you're cleared
for surgery.

198
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:37,409
- Are you sure?
- You passed all the necessary tests.

199
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:40,873
I could have another
flare-up while I'm operating.

200
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:44,583
True, but it's unlikely,
and you know what to expect now.

201
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,971
Worse comes to worst,
you head off any symptoms

202
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:48,881
- with a steroid pulse.
- What about my patients?

203
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:50,738
Is this a risk
they should take, too?

204
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:53,499
There are surgeons with MS
safely operating

205
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:56,720
thanks to good meds,
and you will have backup.

206
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:01,007
The OR needs you.

207
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,602
And you need the OR.

208
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,583
I'm so sorry.

209
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,423
This was a terrible idea.
They said it was safe.

210
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:13,164
- I can't hear her!
- The explosion ruptured your eardrum, Will.

211
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:15,614
- It'll get better soon.
- He's gonna be okay, right?

212
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,242
Yep, Irving will make sure of it.

213
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:19,837
Am I glad to see you,
brother-in-law.

214
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:22,362
You got any painkillers?
Strong ones?

215
00:10:22,514 --> 00:10:24,605
Yeah, let's get you
off the stretcher first.

216
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:28,001
On my count. One, two, three.

217
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:31,849
He can't hear.
His eardrum might have ruptured.

218
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:32,850
What happened?

219
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:34,777
The cannon exploded.

220
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,209
Right. Did you say "cannon"?

221
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,544
It was supposed
to fire blue or pink smoke.

222
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:40,363
I'm the one
who talked him into it.

223
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,715
Okay, easy. Let's just focus
on getting him better.

224
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:44,454
Go get Will checked in, and
we'll take care of him, okay?

225
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,364
Whoa, looks like

226
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:47,957
it hurts.

227
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,205
Let's get 75 mics of fentanyl.

228
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:50,609
Okay. Try holding still, hon.

229
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:53,296
You'll be feeling better
in a few seconds.

230
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,539
Will, I'm gonna send you
for a scan to get

231
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:56,988
a clear picture
of what's going on.

232
00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:58,731
Okay?

233
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,995
I don't hear any breath
on the right.

234
00:11:04,147 --> 00:11:06,239
My chest, it hurts.

235
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:09,036
His sats are starting to drop.

236
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,317
No lung sliding.

237
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:11,630
Looks like the shrapnel
collapsed the lung.

238
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,589
We need a chest tube now.

239
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,759
The doctor said
his lung collapsed

240
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:28,239
and he could have
internal injuries.

241
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:30,188
Yeah, I can't believe it either.

242
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:32,691
Oh, I'll call you
when I know more, okay?

243
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,006
We got his lung re-expanded,
he's breathing much better,

244
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,176
- and he's on the way to CT.
- Okay.

245
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,752
- His parents?
- Yeah.

246
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:44,369
They said I should have
talked him out of the cannon,

247
00:11:44,596 --> 00:11:48,164
but it was my stupid idea
in the first place.

248
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:53,431
Oh, my God, I mean,
what a disaster.

249
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,439
One of his coworkers posted it.

250
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:03,704
And it's already been reposted

251
00:12:03,782 --> 00:12:06,299
175 times.

252
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,871
What? A-As if this
wasn't awful enough.

253
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,562
Maybe put your phone away?

254
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:12,880
"Latest addition
to the cesspool

255
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:14,618
of gender reveal idiocy."

256
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:17,271
"Stop blowing things up to tell
people your kid's got a penis."

257
00:12:17,295 --> 00:12:19,904
Scarlett, your friends love you.

258
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:22,465
Who cares what a bunch
of strangers think?

259
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:23,816
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

260
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:25,468
Yeah.

261
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:27,370
Thank you.

262
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:32,492
Troponin and BNP are both elevated.

263
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:34,327
She has leukocytosis
but no fever.

264
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:38,142
Nothing is adding up.
We need answers.

265
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,461
Her sats are drifting down.

266
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:43,410
She's getting sicker
by the minute.

267
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:45,575
Considering all those
TikTok notifications,

268
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,577
she must have an account.

269
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,351
Let's see if it can
tell us anything.

270
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:09,603
Scans taking that long?

271
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:12,101
She's our patient,

272
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,661
we still don't know
what's wrong with her,

273
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:14,937
so we're looking for clues
and Irving is trying

274
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,369
to reach the family.

275
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:19,609
180,000 followers.
Wow, that's impressive.

276
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,966
Yeah, but it's not helping.

277
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,469
Maybe this will.

278
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:26,805
Trevor, take it from the top

279
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:29,193
and walk us through it.

280
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:31,384
Well...

281
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,478
The apices of the lungs
look clear.

282
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:36,564
There's some scattered
focal ground-glass.

283
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,317
Hold on, is that a, uh...

284
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,204
- A filling defect.
- Yeah.

285
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:43,470
Consistent with a huge clot
in her right pulmonary artery.

286
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,605
Yeah, and smaller clots
in the distal arteries, too.

287
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,212
Maybe they aren't blood clots.

288
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:50,031
Then what are they?

289
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:51,145
This pattern plus the rash,

290
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,384
I'm thinking
fat embolism syndrome.

291
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:57,555
Yeah, globules of fat
clogging up the vessels.

292
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,987
That happens after fractures
or burns, right?

293
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:02,489
But she didn't have those.

294
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:03,583
Or pancreatitis.

295
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:05,396
But liposuction would
explain all of it.

296
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,399
The fat embolism,
the surgical port we saw.

297
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:11,257
O2's in the 80s.

298
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:12,976
149 heart rate. She's tanking.

299
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:21,601
Hemoptysis.
We need to secure her airway

300
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,010
before she aspirates.

301
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:24,081
What the hell is going on?

302
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:25,438
Let's intubate and find out.

303
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,200
Gail, I need you to look
for two small injection sites

304
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:31,369
on the patient's backside.

305
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:34,330
Do you see them?

306
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:36,352
Yes, I do.

307
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,784
Prepare the intubation meds now.

308
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,296
It's okay.

309
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,396
All right, sats are coming back up.

310
00:14:58,623 --> 00:15:01,457
Looks like Charli here got
herself a Brazilian butt lift.

311
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,644
Aren't BBLs the most dangerous
procedure there is?

312
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,739
Yeah, but I doubt they advertise
the high fatality rates.

313
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:09,276
Right. They sell you
on the prospect

314
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,569
of getting a curvier backside

315
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:13,136
while losing inches
in the middle.

316
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:14,412
Let's get her to ICU.

317
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:16,003
I need to ultrasound
her heart to see

318
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:19,542
where that runaway fat
is now calling home.

319
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,644
That does not look pretty.

320
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:29,146
The tiniest bowel perf and
he could end up in septic shock.

321
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,836
Jessica's brother-in-law?

322
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:32,241
Yeah.

323
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,651
We've admitted him
and I booked an OR,

324
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:35,302
and as soon as it's ready,
we'll take him in.

325
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:38,102
And what happened?

326
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:41,439
A gender reveal party
gone very wrong.

327
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,483
A cannon was involved.

328
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:47,998
Probably best if I don't know
the details.

329
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,839
So, this could go south
really fast.

330
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:53,025
He's gonna need
exploratory laparotomy.

331
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:55,689
Well, I'm glad you're on deck.

332
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:58,935
Uh, you're on deck. I'm a maybe.

333
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,459
We need to talk.

334
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:16,015
What's going on?

335
00:16:18,203 --> 00:16:19,960
Remember the last time
we operated together?

336
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,365
I had some issues.

337
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:25,294
And I contacted Conrad,
we had some tests run.

338
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,726
And?

339
00:16:26,878 --> 00:16:29,404
I have MS.

340
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,365
Multiple sclerosis?

341
00:16:35,236 --> 00:16:37,737
- I am so sorry, Dr. Bell.
- Thank you.

342
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,734
I'm adjusting to the new
reality, with Kit's help.

343
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:44,485
And on-on meds, I have
no symptoms, at least for now,

344
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:48,464
and Conrad has cleared me
for surgery. However

345
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:50,341
if you would prefer

346
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:53,428
to work with another doctor...

347
00:16:54,663 --> 00:16:56,431
Absolutely not.

348
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,425
This is a physical challenge.

349
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:02,072
That's it.

350
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:03,407
I have one, too.

351
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:06,006
If you hadn't told me,
I'd never, uh, guess

352
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,504
- that you have dyslexia.
- Thank you.

353
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:13,417
But when I chose surgery,
my family, friends, advisors,

354
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:15,177
everyone thought it would
make me dangerous.

355
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,515
But with my work-arounds,
I believe I've...

356
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,206
- You are one of the best.
- I don't know about that.

357
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:26,127
But I do not let dyslexia
stand in my way.

358
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:30,359
This is just
a new challenge to overcome.

359
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,958
Well, thank you, Dr. Devi.

360
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:34,635
Was a good pep talk.

361
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:39,432
I'll see you in the OR.

362
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:56,126
Man, when I was in my 20s,
the worst things

363
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,611
we did to ourselves were
tattoos and piercings.

364
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:59,037
- Guilty of the former.
- Latter for me.

365
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:02,997
I got a gnarly infection
from my eyebrow ring.

366
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,394
Oh, trust me, it was dope.

367
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,805
Until it wasn't.

368
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,164
Oh, this is no good.

369
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,092
Charli's in trouble.

370
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,168
Is that fat
sitting in her heart?

371
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:17,481
Not just sitting,
it's in transit,

372
00:18:17,505 --> 00:18:19,483
from her right atrium
to her left.

373
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:21,485
So she has a congenital hole
in her heart?

374
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:23,267
Probably undetected before,

375
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:25,177
but blew open
when she had the P.E.s.

376
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,012
Maybe even acted
as a pop-off valve,

377
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,273
- saving her life, but now...
- It's a bomb.

378
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:32,351
- Primed and ready to go off at any moment.
- Yeah.

379
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,612
If it makes its way
into her arterial circulation...

380
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:37,340
- She'll stroke out.
- AUSTIN: I'll text Dr. Sutton.

381
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,300
If that fat embolizes
to her brain,

382
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,505
we'll have minutes to intervene.

383
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,775
Hopefully, it's her family.

384
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,537
Charli, hon, this is Cassie

385
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,964
calling from Enhanced Dreams.

386
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:54,259
How you feeling
after your procedure?

387
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:55,466
Actually, Cassie,

388
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:57,042
you're speaking
with three doctors

389
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:58,263
at Chastain Memorial Hospital

390
00:18:58,287 --> 00:18:59,506
who are trying
to save Charli's life.

391
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,030
So if I had to guess, I'd say

392
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:02,176
she's feeling pretty damn
miserable right now.

393
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,884
Cassie, this is Dr. Hawkins.

394
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,371
Did Charli get a Brazilian butt
lift at Enhanced Dreams?

395
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:10,389
We're gonna take that as a yes.

396
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,983
It's led to fat
embolism syndrome.

397
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:15,319
We need to talk to her surgeon.

398
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,882
Did she seriously just hang up?

399
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:21,244
She's not getting rid of us
that easy.

400
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:22,713
Trevor, Google Enhanced Dreams.

401
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:24,412
We're calling Cassie back.

402
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,143
All right, here we go.

403
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,960
"Enhanced Dreams
Plastic Surgery."

404
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:43,181
Great. Great, they're probably
busy hiding the evidence.

405
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,144
I doubt they'll have time
to pack up and run

406
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:48,911
- before my shift's over.
- Okay, that's not happening.

407
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:51,063
But let's keep calling.

408
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:59,750
Are you really calling me for
a stroke that hasn't happened?

409
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:02,533
- Can't you just give her TPA?
- She's had a recent surgery.

410
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,368
If we give her TPA,
she could bleed out.

411
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,371
If that fat goes to her
brain, you will only have minutes

412
00:20:07,448 --> 00:20:09,765
to perform
an interventional thrombectomy.

413
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:11,670
Well, sucking clots out
of the brain through the groin

414
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:13,026
is not my specialty.

415
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,195
I haven't done that procedure
since residency.

416
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:17,026
- Just page IR.
- Come on, Sutton,

417
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,677
you know those guys
don't work over the weekend.

418
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,421
And if we page them,
they would not get here in time.

419
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:23,721
And our only endovascular
neurosurgeon's on vacation.

420
00:20:23,948 --> 00:20:25,275
Sutton, we wouldn't be asking you this

421
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,725
if there was another option.

422
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,638
Then I'll have to.

423
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:37,109
I'd better go review
my head-neck vascular anatomy.

424
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:45,462
They're here.

425
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:49,154
Dr. Bell, this is Will
and my sister Scarlett.

426
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,414
- Such a pleasure.
- Dr. Bell

427
00:20:50,566 --> 00:20:52,825
is a nationally-recognized
trauma surgeon.

428
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:54,493
Jess has told me
so much about you.

429
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:56,754
- She's your biggest fan.
- Well, and I'm hers.

430
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:00,816
We don't know what we would do
without her here at Chastain.

431
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:04,428
So, the scans show that there
are multiple metal fragments

432
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:06,984
peppered throughout
your abdomen.

433
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:10,417
And in surgery,
we'll remove every fragment

434
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,270
and we'll ensure
that the explosion

435
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,901
didn't cause any other injuries
that we can't see on the scans.

436
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:17,016
He's gonna be okay, right?

437
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,255
He's in the right place,
but of course you should know

438
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,665
surgery carries risks.

439
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:23,781
And, Jessica,
I know it's your day off,

440
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:25,410
but I would like you
to scrub in with me.

441
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:28,786
'Cause, after all,
you are my right hand.

442
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:30,454
You couldn't keep me out.

443
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,957
Great.

444
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:34,850
Just gonna get this.

445
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:36,627
- Okay.
- Yeah?

446
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,046
Ready?

447
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:45,786
Promise me he'll be okay, Jess.

448
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,139
Try not to worry. We're gonna
take great care of him.

449
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,141
Okay.

450
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,723
I love you so much,
and I am so, so sorry

451
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,300
I talked you into that cannon.

452
00:22:00,469 --> 00:22:02,111
I love you.

453
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,748
It's okay.

454
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:19,628
Are you sure you're up
for this, Dr. Bell?

455
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,134
It's just, the last time
we worked together,

456
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:25,992
you didn't feel well
and you abandoned the surgery.

457
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:28,012
You haven't been in the OR
since then.

458
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:29,363
Yeah, no, I haven't been well.

459
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:30,967
And I can explain
all that to you later,

460
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:34,163
but the important thing is,
we figured out the problem,

461
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,002
and I've been cleared
for surgery

462
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:38,105
by both Kit and Conrad, so.

463
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:41,842
I think we're okay.

464
00:22:53,781 --> 00:22:57,041
Okay, through the fascia.

465
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,212
It looks like a little oozing
from the liver.

466
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:04,623
I'll get better exposure now.

467
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,134
How are you doing, Dr. Bell?

468
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:09,553
All good.

469
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:18,979
Okay, one piece of shrapnel: Gone.

470
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,813
And another.

471
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,481
I'm having trouble getting it.

472
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:31,450
I got it.

473
00:23:33,137 --> 00:23:35,454
It's such delicate work.

474
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:38,416
Nice going.

475
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:41,902
- Now, what is that?
- Oh, that

476
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:44,307
looks like another
piece of shrapnel.

477
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:48,092
This time it's wedged
into the liver.

478
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:50,594
Removing the foreign body now.

479
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:53,338
Suction.

480
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,598
Lap pads.

481
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:57,268
Looks like this went
into the liver and hit a vessel.

482
00:23:57,495 --> 00:23:58,936
You guys got into something big.

483
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:00,253
I'm maxing my pressors.

484
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:01,583
It's gonna be okay.

485
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,828
Initiating massive
transfusion protocol.

486
00:24:04,852 --> 00:24:08,187
Okay, Dr. Devi, I need you
to help me get down to the aorta

487
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:10,364
to cross-clamp,

488
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:12,594
and get control of this.

489
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,004
I'm transfusing the second unit

490
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:15,338
of blood, four liters
of crystalloid,

491
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:17,029
two of albumin,
and still losing.

492
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,176
- Blood pressure isn't budging.
- Okay, we're gonna need

493
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,624
supraceliac control.

494
00:24:20,851 --> 00:24:23,202
Page AJ stat for a thoracotomy.

495
00:24:23,354 --> 00:24:25,015
He's on deck in the OR suite.

496
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,112
I'm calling him now.

497
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,372
Good, thank you.

498
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,874
No blood pressure detected,

499
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,004
but HR reading 160.

500
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:32,948
All right, somebody talk to me.

501
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,546
Thank you for coming so fast.

502
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,366
Unavoidable bleeding
after shrapnel removal.

503
00:24:37,535 --> 00:24:38,367
We need better control
from above

504
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,126
to be able to repair the defect.

505
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,273
- That's why we called you.
- All right, let's get to it.

506
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:44,023
Scalpel me.

507
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,030
Spreaders.

508
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,332
Clamp.

509
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:07,838
All right.
Voilà, that should do it.

510
00:25:09,366 --> 00:25:11,175
We've got a blood pressure back.

511
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:13,719
All right.

512
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:16,492
Glad you're in the house.

513
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,391
Hey, man, glad to be here.

514
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:32,512
Any available resident to ICU Three.

515
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:33,842
Available resident to ICU Three.

516
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,274
Hey, look,
if you're gonna ask me

517
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,034
to back off surgery again,
that's okay,

518
00:25:37,261 --> 00:25:38,594
but I want
to say I called in AJ

519
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:40,757
because we needed him,
not because of the MS.

520
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:44,208
I know, and Will is alive
because you made that call.

521
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:47,523
I just wanted to say
welcome back.

522
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,525
Thanks.

523
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,757
It's good to be back.

524
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,134
Dr. Sutton?

525
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,727
Do you have a moment?

526
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,972
Sure.

527
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:08,618
It's been a while since
I've approached the brain

528
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:10,309
from this direction.
I could use a break.

529
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:13,623
Just trying to get
my muscle memory to kick in.

530
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:15,981
I wanted to chat with you
some more about the idea

531
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:18,534
of double-boarding
with cardio and neuro.

532
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:20,560
Go on.

533
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:24,323
I know you think I'm crazy...
And so does Devon...

534
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:26,900
But people said the same thing
to me when I decided

535
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:28,288
to become a surgeon
with dyslexia.

536
00:26:28,312 --> 00:26:30,807
Yes, but it's not
the same thing.

537
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:33,665
Maintaining excellence in both
specialties is impossible.

538
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:37,739
Expertise comes from repetition,
which is why this IR procedure

539
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:38,912
is so tough.

540
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:40,634
And trying to maintain
competency in both,

541
00:26:40,658 --> 00:26:41,765
it isn't enough.

542
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:43,342
Okay, but I...

543
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:45,603
Listen, I have
to get back to this.

544
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:48,105
Let's talk about it later, okay?

545
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,566
Okay.

546
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:01,193
You're not gonna believe this.

547
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:02,602
What am I looking at?

548
00:27:02,696 --> 00:27:04,863
The Enhanced Dreams
Instagram page.

549
00:27:05,015 --> 00:27:07,102
This surgery was live
this morning.

550
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,959
And that might even be Charli.

551
00:27:09,111 --> 00:27:11,795
At Enhanced Dreams,
dreams really do come true,

552
00:27:11,947 --> 00:27:14,873
as we give you nothing
but the hottest transformation.

553
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:16,041
Right, Doc?

554
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,655
- Oh, yeah.
- Look at all that

555
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:19,970
beautiful liquid gold
the doctor's harvesting.

556
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:21,675
That's human fat,
which will be used

557
00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:25,120
to sculpt a gorgeous
new rear end.

558
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,394
Let me hear you say "thicc."

559
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,055
They need to be stopped.

560
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:32,224
Patient was awake?

561
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:34,371
She likely gave permission
to film it.

562
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:38,133
Maybe, but Enhanced Dreams
is run by a dermatologist,

563
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,157
not a plastic surgeon.

564
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:40,824
It's got to be illegal.

565
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:42,826
Eh, you would think,
but it's not.

566
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:45,237
Anyone with a medical license
can perform

567
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:46,830
cosmetic surgery in Georgia.

568
00:27:46,982 --> 00:27:50,501
Chalk it up to ridiculous things
that are legal in medicine.

569
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,250
We got you, Charli.
We got you, we got you.

570
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,655
We got you.

571
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,178
She's stroking out.

572
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:02,883
- Page Billie!
- Shouldn't we get a CT

573
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:04,142
with contrast
to figure out where?

574
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,074
No time. It's localized

575
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:07,404
to the left middle
cerebral artery.

576
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:08,997
That's the best we can give
Billie right now.

577
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,729
Let's get her to IR.

578
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,255
Nice to hear from you.

579
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,257
So, you have news
about the board seats?

580
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:29,259
I do.

581
00:28:29,283 --> 00:28:31,950
Dr. Bell, we received
an accusation from, uh,

582
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:34,431
your hospital about one
of our top candidates.

583
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:36,288
Well, if you're talking
about Porter,

584
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,790
I gather there were some
ethics complaints against him,

585
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,103
but I

586
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:41,863
assumed you were aware.

587
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,278
No, this is new.

588
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:48,445
The credibility of the source
is the issue.

589
00:28:48,469 --> 00:28:51,540
It came from the same person
who wrote your recommendation

590
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,480
at Chastain.

591
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,141
Dr. Sutton?

592
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:57,960
Conflict of interest here is

593
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:01,480
obvious. And it's

594
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,633
not a stretch to imagine
you helped motivate this.

595
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:07,244
Well, I assure you, I did not.

596
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:09,154
Sadly, that's hard to believe.

597
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:10,914
So we can no longer offer you
a position

598
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,824
on the state medical board.

599
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:14,637
The optics

600
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:16,306
could not be worse.

601
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:20,716
Thanks for the call.

602
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:26,575
I reached the mom.

603
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,076
She took Charli's son
to Disney World

604
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,578
while she had surgery.

605
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,511
Apparently, Charli's desperate
for more followers.

606
00:29:32,663 --> 00:29:33,663
If she hits 200K,

607
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:35,330
she can make cash, quit her job,

608
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:36,810
and get a place
for her son and her.

609
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:38,683
So she decided to get
a Brazilian butt lift?

610
00:29:38,852 --> 00:29:41,594
Her mom said she's always coming
up with ideas to look better.

611
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:43,407
She thinks that's how
she'll get more followers.

612
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:45,598
No one could talk her out of it.

613
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,025
Do they know how sick she is?

614
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:48,510
Her mom does.

615
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:50,265
Hasn't told the kid.

616
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,581
Hopefully she won't have to.

617
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,702
Hey, Billie, can we talk?

618
00:29:57,855 --> 00:29:59,521
Can it wait? I'm due in IR.

619
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:01,592
No, it can't. I got a call from
the lieutenant governor saying

620
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:04,384
you filed a complaint
against Robert Porter.

621
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:06,970
That was supposed
to be anonymous.

622
00:30:07,122 --> 00:30:09,139
Well, what was?
What the hell's going on?

623
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:11,366
I can't think

624
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:12,362
- about this right now...
- Well, look, look,

625
00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:13,530
whatever this is,

626
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:15,198
I mean, they think
that I put you up to it,

627
00:30:15,222 --> 00:30:16,866
because you signed
my letter of recommendation.

628
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,148
And now the state medical board

629
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,370
is siding with Porter and...

630
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:21,543
Cutting me.

631
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:24,822
Billie, we have a patient
waiting. Let's go.

632
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:25,823
So?

633
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:28,325
I've got to go.

634
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:39,628
How'd your IR practice go?

635
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:42,756
We'll find out.

636
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,175
Well, don't worry.

637
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,594
I know this anatomy well.

638
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,837
It's heartbreaking that this
young woman put her life at risk

639
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,268
for more followers.

640
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,103
It was also to give her son
a better life.

641
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:08,115
It's sad she believed this was
her best option to do that.

642
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:15,747
Just at the takeoff to
the left middle cerebral artery.

643
00:31:19,603 --> 00:31:21,211
Come on, Billie.

644
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:23,358
Dr. Sutton,
you're turned around.

645
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,340
You're in
the right-sided circulation.

646
00:31:26,534 --> 00:31:27,792
I know where I am.

647
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:29,345
The patient has
left-sided weakness.

648
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:30,532
We need to get to the right side

649
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,625
- of the brain.
- She's confusing

650
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:34,536
- the patient's symptoms.
- All of the patient's deficits

651
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,613
were on the right,
which means the embolism

652
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:38,395
has to be on the left.

653
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:42,878
Neuroanatomy 101.

654
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,029
Damn it. Where am I?

655
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,314
What's happening?

656
00:31:49,466 --> 00:31:50,982
Looks like she's freezing up.

657
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,077
She never loses focus like this.

658
00:31:54,896 --> 00:31:55,913
It's all right.

659
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:58,290
We're almost there.

660
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:03,587
Right here is the left anterior
cerebral artery.

661
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:08,592
And here is the takeoff
to the middle cerebral artery.

662
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:13,430
There you go, Billie.

663
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,266
She found the embolism.

664
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:19,419
And now they pull it out?

665
00:32:19,513 --> 00:32:20,345
Yeah.

666
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,439
It's safer than breaking it up.

667
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,586
She's gonna be okay now, right?

668
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,653
If they got there in time.

669
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,675
Thanks for having my back.

670
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,749
Anytime.

671
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,138
You okay?

672
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:58,620
No.

673
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,061
I'm furious with myself.

674
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,373
Do you want to talk about it?

675
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:07,442
Not really.

676
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,823
But this is a clear example
of why you can't double-board

677
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:14,408
in these two fields.

678
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,735
I don't understand.

679
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:19,496
My mind was
a million miles away.

680
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,832
Dr. Austin juggles
multiple specialties.

681
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:23,558
He's triple-boarded.

682
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:25,076
Not in neurosurgery.

683
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,339
This is as high-risk and complex
as any surgery gets.

684
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:31,341
If you try and do this
and anything else,

685
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:33,068
the result will be catastrophic.

686
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:35,512
I rise to challenges.

687
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:36,829
Okay? It's who I am.

688
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:38,181
A challenge is good.

689
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,995
A suicide mission is not.

690
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,667
And in this case,
the person you'd kill

691
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:42,962
would be the one on the table.

692
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,907
- But you haven't even g...
- Leela,

693
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:48,525
you may need to ask yourself
why you are putting up mountains

694
00:33:48,752 --> 00:33:51,361
too big for anyone to climb.

695
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,532
Is that your final answer?

696
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:00,412
Honestly, it would be anyone's.

697
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:12,132
Thanks again for your help.

698
00:34:27,307 --> 00:34:31,902
I had to tell Randolph
after what Beaumont said.

699
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:33,381
I'm so sorry, Billie.

700
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,072
I should have realized
this could happen.

701
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:36,481
But it shouldn't have.

702
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:38,241
You were promised
confidentiality.

703
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:39,612
And the lieutenant governor
broke

704
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:42,704
that promise.
It's just outrageous.

705
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,640
So what do I do now?

706
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:49,711
You said you could prove
your charges against Porter.

707
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:53,197
I can.

708
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:56,738
But it means devastating
emotional repercussions

709
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:57,906
for the other person involved.

710
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,913
Oh, Billie, I understand.

711
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:02,507
But if you don't,

712
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:05,580
I fear the repercussions for you
could be far worse.

713
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,163
Accusers destroy
the person accusing them.

714
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:11,024
That's how it works.

715
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,616
Jess.

716
00:35:20,527 --> 00:35:21,952
Thank you.

717
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:23,027
Thank you so much.

718
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,433
I am just so happy

719
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,531
that he's okay.

720
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,033
That was really stressful.

721
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,627
Oh, God, you would not believe

722
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,463
things that people are saying
about me and Will.

723
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,518
"Let's just hope the husband
is shooting blanks now

724
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:38,354
so these two nitwits can't bring
a second child into the world."

725
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:41,045
Will is fine. You'll have
plenty more children,

726
00:35:41,198 --> 00:35:42,213
if you want them.

727
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,048
In a couple of days,
these vultures

728
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,809
will be attacking someone else.

729
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,477
I'm thinking of making T-shirts

730
00:35:47,704 --> 00:35:49,813
with the worst comments
printed on them.

731
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,127
Truth is,

732
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,376
I feel like I kinda deserve it.

733
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:56,394
You don't.

734
00:35:56,563 --> 00:35:57,970
Well, it's just...

735
00:35:58,732 --> 00:36:03,326
The only opinion of me that
really matters, besides Will's,

736
00:36:03,553 --> 00:36:04,553
is yours.

737
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:07,200
- And I just hope that you're not...
- Scarlett,

738
00:36:07,224 --> 00:36:09,051
you are my sister.

739
00:36:09,075 --> 00:36:11,501
I love you, no matter what.

740
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,392
I feel like there's always
a "no matter what" with me.

741
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:19,654
You were great at anything
you put your mind to.

742
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:23,087
The only thing I put my mind to
were boys and parties.

743
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:25,401
And you never needed
anyone's approval but your own.

744
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:28,329
And Mom told me I wouldn't need
so much attention

745
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,072
if I just took a page out
of your book.

746
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:32,074
Oh, Scarlett.

747
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:33,857
You are a ray of sunshine.

748
00:36:33,934 --> 00:36:36,918
And you bring it to Will,
and he loves you for it.

749
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:39,103
But?

750
00:36:39,256 --> 00:36:41,214
But maybe nix the T-shirt idea.

751
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:43,678
No sense in feeding the trolls.

752
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,347
And definitely a hard no
on backyard explosives.

753
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,930
That's sound advice.

754
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:52,375
We still don't know
if it's a boy or a girl.

755
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:55,212
Well, if you must know

756
00:36:55,363 --> 00:36:57,288
he's a little boy.

757
00:36:57,441 --> 00:36:59,123
I saw the weenie
on the ultrasound.

758
00:36:59,276 --> 00:37:00,383
What?

759
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,034
- Scarlett.
- What?

760
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:04,054
So why the party?

761
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,964
Is that a serious question?

762
00:37:06,116 --> 00:37:07,443
Do you not know your sister?

763
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:13,063
Hiya, honey.

764
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,070
Hey.

765
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,615
Can you squeeze my hands?

766
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:28,227
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

767
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:30,558
Good.

768
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,823
All right.

769
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,302
What happened?

770
00:37:33,326 --> 00:37:34,659
Well, in a nutshell, the fat

771
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,570
from your Brazilian butt lift
swam to your brain

772
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,475
and it almost paralyzed you.

773
00:37:39,499 --> 00:37:42,008
Oh, my God.

774
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,152
Oh, God.

775
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:45,285
I feel like such an idiot.

776
00:37:45,322 --> 00:37:46,337
I shouldn't have done it.

777
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:48,243
I just... I saw this thing
on Instagram

778
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,599
- and...
- Oh, we know it.

779
00:37:49,826 --> 00:37:51,601
Frustratingly legal and yet

780
00:37:51,828 --> 00:37:53,436
criminally unqualified.

781
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:58,349
They had these glamour shots,
and I just thought that

782
00:37:58,502 --> 00:38:00,329
damn, if I could look like that

783
00:38:00,353 --> 00:38:03,113
You could get more followers?

784
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,781
We spoke to your mom.

785
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:05,927
She knows?

786
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,284
Yep.

787
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:10,172
But she also knows
that you're gonna be okay.

788
00:38:10,196 --> 00:38:12,341
And Daniel? My-my son.

789
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:14,102
He's probably so scared right now.

790
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,584
It's up to you what you tell him.

791
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:19,337
Thank you.

792
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:24,426
So, how does it look?

793
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:28,722
Sorry, how does what look?

794
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:34,728
I hope it looks dope,
like, after all that.

795
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,632
Well, when you are up
and around,

796
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:42,360
you can decide for yourself.

797
00:38:43,396 --> 00:38:45,374
Oh, can I have my phone, please?

798
00:38:45,398 --> 00:38:47,157
Yeah.

799
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:49,159
People need to know about this.

800
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,745
I got to grab Gigi.
I'll catch you guys later.

801
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,497
Thank you.

802
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:02,150
People, I almost died, y'all.

803
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:03,247
But I didn't. I didn't.

804
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,008
Okay, so I'm here to tell you,

805
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,010
if you are going to get a BBL

806
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:08,747
or any other procedure,

807
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:12,090
make sure your doc knows what
the hell they're doing. Okay?

808
00:39:12,242 --> 00:39:14,258
So, sit back, relax

809
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:18,407
and let me tell you
my crazy story, okay?

810
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:20,576
Now, I am an optimist by nature,

811
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,360
but I'm beginning to think
we are screwed as a species.

812
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:26,341
Social media
is gonna be our meteor.

813
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,939
Wow.

814
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:29,331
You sound like an angry old man

815
00:39:29,426 --> 00:39:30,736
on the wrong side
of the generation gap.

816
00:39:32,262 --> 00:39:34,779
Angry, yes. Old, no.

817
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:36,206
Mm, come on, Dr. Austin.

818
00:39:36,282 --> 00:39:37,615
Disco didn't destroy society.

819
00:39:37,784 --> 00:39:40,377
Without social media,
there would be no, uh,

820
00:39:40,604 --> 00:39:41,764
Arab Spring.

821
00:39:41,788 --> 00:39:43,508
Systemic racism
might've never been exposed.

822
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:45,957
What about that girl
that saved herself by learning

823
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:46,958
the "help me" gesture

824
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,270
- on TikTok?
- Oh. Right.

825
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:50,198
And all the swag you get

826
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,389
when your followers leap up.

827
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,632
Who follows you?

828
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,059
And why?

829
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,968
Man's got moves.

830
00:40:14,103 --> 00:40:16,183
50,000 views?

831
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,993
They just seem to be climbing
by the second.

832
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,403
Have you no shame?

833
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,094
Whatever you do, Nolan,

834
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,720
just do not get a BBL.

835
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:41,729
Why would I?

836
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:50,429
Hey.

837
00:40:50,523 --> 00:40:52,356
Thanks for collecting her.

838
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,170
my pleasure.

839
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:56,338
It's amazing how well she plays.

840
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:58,604
I swear, most kids
are so hooked on devices,

841
00:40:58,698 --> 00:40:59,772
they never learn how.

842
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:00,986
Well, she won't be using any

843
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:02,252
until at least college.

844
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:03,868
Good luck with that.

845
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,186
Daddy, look.

846
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:08,039
Oh, what's Mr. Giraffe
doing now?

847
00:41:08,191 --> 00:41:09,351
Can't you tell?

848
00:41:11,027 --> 00:41:14,523
He didn't pick up his toys,
so you sent him to his room.

849
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:15,305
Zoo.

850
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:17,526
Mr. Giraffe lives in the zoo.

851
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,883
Right.

852
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:22,887
Let's spring him from his cage
and go get your "carbon-ye-ara."

853
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,481
Yes.

854
00:41:27,043 --> 00:41:28,318
Bye.

855
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:30,044
- Bye, Gigi.
- Bye.

856
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:50,715
I won't hurt you.

857
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:55,011
I'm here to warn you.

858
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:57,347
Withdraw the complaint,
say you lied for Dr. Bell,

859
00:41:57,498 --> 00:41:59,724
and you'll never hear
from me again.

860
00:42:01,836 --> 00:42:03,002
You're scared.

861
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:05,188
Withdraw it

862
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:08,066
or I will destroy you.

863
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,919
You can't destroy me.

864
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:16,090
You killed a part of me
I can never get back.

865
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:18,012
You can never hurt me again.

866
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,428
Don't count on it.

867
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:22,446
I'm fully aware
of your mistakes.

868
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,115
I'll expose all of them.

869
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:27,935
And I will take away the
very thing you love the most,

870
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:29,420
your career.
