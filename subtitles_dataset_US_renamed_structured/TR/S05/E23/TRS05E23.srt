<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color="#fffc00">"The Resident"...</font>

2
00:00:02,405 --> 00:00:04,516
We want to make you
the director of our program,

3
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:06,039
<i>but we need to know
by next week.</i>

4
00:00:06,124 --> 00:00:08,547
- So, are you gonna take it?
- Is there anything left of us?

5
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:09,952
You're the one who made it clear

6
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:11,767
that not having kids was
a deal-breaker.

7
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,494
Kit Voss offered me a job.

8
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:15,493
Why would you leave
Seattle Children's?

9
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:17,172
So that I can be closer to you.

10
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:19,883
<i>You're a good man, Dr. Austin.</i>

11
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,003
I think our child should
witness that firsthand.

12
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:23,855
- Our child?
- If you're still willing.

13
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,430
I've gone and fallen
for someone.

14
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:27,149
You're afraid
the guy's gonna say no?

15
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:28,852
Reinforcements are here
to cheer you up.

16
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:30,790
<i>I'm as afraid
he'll say yes as I am</i>

17
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,835
<i>- he'll say no.
- Go tell the man how you feel.</i>

18
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:43,804
Hope I'm not too early.

19
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:45,290
Not at all. Come on in.

20
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:47,305
- Beautiful evening.
- It is.

21
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,727
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

22
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:51,782
Thank you so much
for offering to babysit.

23
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:54,126
Are you kidding?
I'm so excited.

24
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,195
I can't wait to meet Gigi.

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,958
Well, she's asleep now, but, um,

26
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,540
she'll be up
in the next couple of hours.

27
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:00,892
And if we're not back by then...

28
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:03,210
We're not gonna be back.
We're gonna live it up, Nic.

29
00:01:04,303 --> 00:01:06,304
It's our first night out
since Gigi was born,

30
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:08,232
so someone has
a little separation anxiety.

31
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:10,296
You have nothing to worry about.

32
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:11,994
I took CPR training for infants,

33
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,688
and I have
three younger siblings.

34
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,882
Emergency contacts,
just in case.

35
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:21,054
There's pumped breast milk
in the fridge.

36
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:24,150
- We heat it up in the...
- The bottle warmer. I've got this.

37
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:27,219
And I will test it just
to make sure it's not too hot.

38
00:01:27,304 --> 00:01:29,383
Great, and don't forget to
burp her and change her after.

39
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:30,477
Of course.

40
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:32,415
I'm more worried about Nic
than I am Gigi.

41
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,890
- I'm right here.
- You're gonna be fine.

42
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:37,578
Nice new jacket, Dr. Hawkins.

43
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,505
Ah, you like? Thanks.

44
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,765
Have a great time.

45
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,268
Just call if there's anything,
okay?

46
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:45,754
Bye.

47
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:50,670
Somebody has a little crush.

48
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:52,586
Don't be ridiculous.

49
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,204
"Nice new jacket, Dr. Hawkins."

50
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:55,789

The illustrious doctor scientist
graces us peons

for the last time.

61
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:33,511
Oh, come on. You know,
I think I liked it better

62
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:36,189
when you just ignored me
when I showed up for my shift.

63
00:02:36,293 --> 00:02:37,636
Better get into your scrubs.

64
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:39,443
You're a bit too big
for those britches.

65
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,503
Poor guy's gonna hate
Baltimore Hospital

66
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:42,688
for Advanced Science.

67
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:45,283
Do you know how cold
Baltimore gets in January?

68
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,526
And he's
a fragile flower.

69
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,620
Oh, you don't fool me.
I know you're all crying inside.

70
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:54,826
I'm gonna miss you, a lot.

71
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:58,377
We're well aware
what this exit is about,

72
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:00,776
and it ain't science,
or money,

73
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:03,134
because Dr. Voss would match
any offer.

74
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:05,580
Talk to Leela.

75
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:06,665
Fix this.

76
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:09,017
I wish I could.

77
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,625
Help! We need help
over here, please.

78
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,010
Can't... breathe.

79
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,386
All right, this way.

80
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:20,737
What's going on?

81
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:22,668
She-she was a little short of
breath last night.

82
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,635
We thought it was the baby
pressing on her lungs,

83
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,028
but she woke up like this.

84
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:27,158
How far along is she?

85
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,345
Five months.

86
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,865
Mommy, are you gonna be okay?

87
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,367
Of course, baby.

88
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:35,595
Hypoxemic. Elevated respiratory rate.

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,056
Rales up to the mid chest.

90
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:38,678
Sounds like pulmonary edema.

91
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:40,337
Let's get an EKG
and get her on O2.

92
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:41,673
- Mommy?
- It's okay.

93
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:43,284
Can someone... take him?

94
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:45,343
I'll call Winston
in social services.

95
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:47,134
He'll get someone
to look after him.

96
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:49,219
Come with me, sweetheart.

97
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,593
Fetal heart rate sounds good.

98
00:03:54,677 --> 00:03:56,502
Obvious movement.

99
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:58,171
The baby looks good.

100
00:03:59,704 --> 00:04:01,853
- Praise God.
- Thank you.

101
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,541
Let's get a stat chest X-ray.

102
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:10,080
Page Dr. Austin.

103
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,186
What's wrong?
What's happening?

104
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:18,767
Devon always kept the keys
in a bowl in the hallway.

105
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,330
Thank you so much
for reminding me.

106
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:22,432
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:24,272
I just really want to get going.

108
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:25,866
I can't wait for the ultrasound.

109
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,322
Although I already know I'm
pregnant because I can feel it.

110
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:29,992
My stomach is doing flip-flops.

111
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,132
And guess what,
I woke up nauseous this morning.

112
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:35,088
I told you to not have
that pizza last night.

113
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,447
It's not the pizza, Leela.
I feel...

114
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,338
- different, you know?
- Well, actually,

115
00:04:40,423 --> 00:04:43,666
since I've never been pregnant,
no, I don't know.

116
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:54,791
Today's his last day, isn't it?

117
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,832
You guys broke up way too fast.

118
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,384
It's a pattern with you.

119
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:10,554
You're kind of
a relationship wrecking ball.

120
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,079
Oh, come on. Do you remember
when you dumped Rick Stamos

121
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:15,248
right before prom?

122
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:17,393
He was ripped
and a quarterback,

123
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:18,769
and you had a killer dress.

124
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,134
- I caught him making out with a cheerleader.
- Hmm.

125
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:25,361
He can't wait to go.

126
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:27,377
He's leaving Atlanta tomorrow.

127
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:28,520
He's only sticking around
for Kit and

128
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:30,448
Bell's
engagement party tonight.

129
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:32,524
I know he still loves you. Okay?

130
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:34,861
Everyone knows
he still loves you.

131
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:41,298
And sometimes
you can't always see

132
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,265
what's right before your eyes.

133
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:45,759
There is still time.

134
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:55,364
Dr. Sullivan,
where's your walker?

135
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:56,657
I know you're feeling better,

136
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:58,301
but you shouldn't be
on your feet alone.

137
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,268
I am discharging myself
from the hospital.

138
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:03,706
- You-you can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

139
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:05,331
I'm a doctor.

140
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,875
You can't be your own doctor.

141
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,885
I know my own body,
and I feel fine.

142
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,643
Besides, work is
the best medicine.

143
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:12,582
If you're your own doctor,
does that also make you

144
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,229
your own worst patient?

145
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:16,361
- Ha ha.
- You only got shot three times.

146
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,422
Why don't you go run a 10K
while you're at it?

147
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:21,759
You know what? You are just
the person I was looking for.

148
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:27,955
Look what you left in my room
on your last visit.

149
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:32,435
Mr. Giraffe!

150
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:36,542
He must have been scared in that
dark drawer all by himself.

151
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:39,137
No, not in the least,
he was sleeping.

152
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:41,490
He's a sleepyhead,
but he did poke his head out

153
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:44,494
- to ask for some leaves for dinner.
- Silly.

154
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,997
He doesn't eat leaves,
he eats chocolate ice cream.

155
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,414
Oh, right.

156
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:54,397
I'll drop Gigi at preschool
and meet you in your dad's room.

157
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:56,629
His lab results are in.

158
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:07,728
How are you feeling, Dad?

159
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,447
Fine.

160
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,503
No lingering symptoms?

161
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:16,025
It's been a day and a half
since my little fall.

162
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:17,359
I'm much better.

163
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:20,420
Well, it was more than
just a fall. You passed out.

164
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:21,846
Why are you getting dressed?

165
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,822
- I'm discharging myself.
- You...

166
00:07:25,064 --> 00:07:26,632
You can't be your own doctor.

167
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:27,717
Oh, wow.

168
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:30,198
The apple fell
directly under the tree.

169
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:34,025
My father and I are both doctors
who also happen to be patients.

170
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:35,736
Other than that,
we are nothing alike.

171
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:38,362
Of course you're not.
Your labs.

172
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:41,108
You're profoundly anemic.

173
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:43,794
Your stomach pain is
getting worse, right?

174
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:45,377
Combine that
with your collapse...

175
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:46,939
Bleeding ulcer
is top of the list.

176
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:50,502
Ridiculous. No acid reflux.
No indigestion.

177
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:52,969
- Any blood in your stool?
- Okay.

178
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:56,314
Before we discuss my bowel
movements in greater detail,

179
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,002
can we clarify...

180
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:01,547
which of you is
my actual doctor?

181
00:08:05,422 --> 00:08:07,691
You need more tests.

182
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,345
There may be
a simple explanation

183
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,403
for what's going on here,

184
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:13,833
but until we find it,
you aren't going anywhere.

185
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:27,431
Your vision is fine, Randolph.

186
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:29,003
You had an MS flare.

187
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,250
Okay. Well, yeah,
it was kind of rough.

188
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:35,086
They're not unexpected,
especially near the optic nerve.

189
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,164
With an extra pulse of steroids,
you'll be back to normal.

190
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:38,800
This should be nothing
to worry about.

191
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,745
See? It's great news.

192
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,761
You're good to go back
in the OR.

193
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,669
I'm clearing you for surgery.

194
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,512
Great.

195
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:56,022
I know that look.
Talk to me.

196
00:08:56,991 --> 00:09:00,486
Every MS flare feels like
it's the beginning of the end.

197
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,903
The pain is excruciating,
and you're afraid

198
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:04,828
it's getting worse,
but you're catastrophizing.

199
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,566
- You heard the doctor.
- It is progressive.

200
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:09,283
Not necessarily.

201
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:11,460
You could go into
total remission.

202
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,566
I love your optimism.

203
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:18,683
I'm about to marry
Chastain's finest surgeon,

204
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:22,074
who will hold that title
for years to come.

205
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:26,804
Please,
tell me whatever is happening

206
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:29,214
isn't going to...
harm my baby.

207
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:32,324
Right now, let's focus on you,
Mom, all right?

208
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:34,120
Your echocardiogram is showing

209
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,324
that your heart isn't pumping
strong enough

210
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,434
to support you and the baby.

211
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,070
W-What does that mean?

212
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,966
It means that
your wife is in heart failure.

213
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:47,870
No, how-how can this
be happening?

214
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,465
Have you had
any health issues recently?

215
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:52,293
Flu... a few weeks ago.

216
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:53,864
I-It was pretty bad,

217
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:56,745
but she finally got better.

218
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:58,019
Help me!

219
00:09:58,104 --> 00:10:00,114
Step aside, please.
It's okay.

220
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,274
Acute hypoxemic
respiratory failure.

221
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,777
Pulmonary edema is worsening,

222
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,491
which means
her heart function is, too.

223
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:08,183
Pressure's dropping.
Hanging a norepi drip.

224
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,895
We're having a baby girl.

225
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,839
We've hoped for one
since Miguel was born.

226
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:12,934
We-we cannot lose this baby.

227
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:14,277
She's decompensating fast.

228
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:15,683
We need to intubate now.

229
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:17,452
Come here.

230
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:20,524
We are trying to save
your wife's life.

231
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:24,189
Let us work so can save
both mom and baby.

232
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:27,117
Okay.

233
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:42,123
Nic.

234
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,358
I forgot to tell Marion

235
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,951
to leave the night-light on
in Gigi's room.

236
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,436
I left it on.

237
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,738
How about we put all phones away
just for the next hour?

238
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:53,391
Well, your new girlfriend

239
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:54,985
has to be able to reach me.

240
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:56,728
Oh, she's on my speed dial.

244
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:07,011
Same song that was playing
right here on our first date.

245
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:09,543
You don't remember what song
was playing on our first date.

246
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,597
I do. It was "Neon Moon."

247
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:14,755
It's always playing on
a jukebox somewhere.

248
00:11:14,856 --> 00:11:16,253
Hmm.

249
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:19,417
How about we go right to

Yes.

258
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:55,605
The mom is critical,
but the dad is calmer now.

259
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:57,030
He wants his son with him.

260
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:58,644
- Okay.
- Come on, sweetie.

261
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,667
Let's go see your daddy.

262
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:05,567
Winston.

263
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:06,873
Dr. Hawkins.

264
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:08,667
Yeah. Do you have a minute?

265
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,486
I have two minutes.
Walk with me back to my office.

266
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,970
What's going on?

267
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:14,905
I have a personal question
for you.

268
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:18,718
- Hope you don't mind me asking.
- No, go on.

269
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:20,511
Well, you know I lost my wife.

270
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:22,348
Yes. I'm so sorry.

271
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,669
Devon told me
you lost someone, too.

272
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,985
A partner who died suddenly.

273
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:30,655
Yeah, we were together
almost 20 years.

274
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:33,541
He had a heart attack.
Was totally unexpected.

275
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,418
So you know about grief.

276
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:38,162
I do. It was overwhelming.

277
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:39,680
How did you cope?

278
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:45,214
For a while, quite badly.

279
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:49,191
I almost let what I'd lost
destroy me.

280
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:53,511
But eventually I realized
I had one life to live,

281
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,084
and I wanted it
to mean something.

282
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,141
I have my daughter,
and that saved me.

283
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:01,753
But no matter what I do,
for the last four years,

284
00:13:01,838 --> 00:13:03,396
I just can't let Nic go.

285
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:07,749
I keep remembering
this one specific evening.

286
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,081
First date after we had Gigi.

287
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:15,275
Maybe you shouldn't fight
these memories.

288
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,039
Maybe they're trying
to tell you something.

289
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,614
The past never goes away.

290
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:23,207
If you don't deny it,

291
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:25,876
you can learn from it.

292
00:13:27,554 --> 00:13:29,771
Mr. Alvarez.

293
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:36,231
How's my wife?

294
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,055
We managed to stabilize her.

295
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,378
Thank God.

296
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:42,393
And thank you both.

297
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:43,753
Her heart was damaged,

298
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:45,426
likely from the flu
she had recently.

299
00:13:45,511 --> 00:13:48,399
What she has is
post-viral myocarditis.

300
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:52,254
Her pregnancy makes this
even more life-threatening.

301
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:56,363
Her heart isn't strong enough
now to beat for two.

302
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:58,803
We're so sorry to say this,

303
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:02,042
but the only safe option
for Trini is to...

304
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:04,123
is to end the pregnancy.

305
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:07,613
What?

306
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:09,224
N-No.

307
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:11,200
No, that-that's impossible.

308
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:14,184
Y-You're talking about
killing the baby.

309
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:15,593
That would be murder.

310
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:17,567
We can't deliver
the baby at five months.

311
00:14:17,652 --> 00:14:19,127
It's not viable.

312
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,800
We understand
your pain is enormous.

313
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,995
But we believe your wife will
not survive if we don't do this.

314
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:31,278
Mr. Alvarez,
your son will lose his mother.

315
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:32,793
Honestly, it's not a choice.

316
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:34,688
We can only save one life.

317
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,310
- Hers.
- No.

318
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:37,782
I-I will not accept this.

319
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,263
There has to be another way.

320
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:40,302
There is no safe way.

321
00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:42,255
Please, there has to be!

322
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,044
Dr. Voss, we have a problem.

323
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,706
We have a patient who has to
terminate her pregnancy

324
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,207
to save her own life.

325
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,630
Her heart is failing.

326
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,685
- God, how awful.
- The husband is certain

327
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,213
there's more we can do
to save both mom and baby.

328
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,639
And is there?

329
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:04,209
All we can offer is
an incredible long shot,

330
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,482
almost certain to fail.

331
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:06,952
And what does the patient
want to do?

332
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:09,170
She can't make the decision.
She's intubated.

333
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:11,131
Her husband is
her health care proxy.

334
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:12,241
So the real question is,

335
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:14,469
do we even suggest
this alternative

336
00:15:14,553 --> 00:15:16,562
that we think is
far too dangerous?

337
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:18,288
Oh, this is a tough one.

338
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:22,477
But if he won't agree
to end the pregnancy

339
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:25,128
to save her life,
you have no choice.

340
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:29,592
Just make the consequences of
your plan crystal clear

341
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:32,011
so he knows
the risks he's taking.

342
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,519
Dad, do not
move. You know better.

343
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:49,777
I have an itch.

344
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:51,847
We're almost done.

345
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:53,457
I don't want him to be sick,

346
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:54,843
but please tell me
he can go home.

347
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:58,230
Let's figure out
what's wrong with him first,

348
00:15:58,587 --> 00:16:00,596
then plan next steps.

349
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:14,511
I'm so sorry.

350
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,003
He has pancreatic cancer.

351
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:28,426
I'm a doctor, a good one.

352
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,944
And I had no clue.

353
00:16:32,544 --> 00:16:34,988
Well, that's not unexpected,
Dad.

354
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:37,418
Pancreatic cancer,
it can often be asymptomatic

355
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:38,644
until it's too late.

356
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:39,996
Okay, thank you for clarifying.

357
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,995
I must have skipped the part

358
00:16:42,105 --> 00:16:44,458
about pancreatic cancer
at medical school.

359
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:47,089
I'm just trying to help.

360
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:48,587
Well, you can't help.

361
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:53,496
Look, I've just been handed
a death sentence.

362
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,850
All right, how long?

363
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:01,992
How long do I have?

364
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,856
Pancreatic cancer is
a terrifying diagnosis.

365
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,599
For most,

366
00:17:07,683 --> 00:17:10,752
five-year survival rate is
less than ten percent,

367
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:12,754
but your odds are different.

368
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,613
Look at the scans again.

369
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:23,373
The tumor appears...

370
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:25,817
localized at the head
of the pancreas.

371
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:28,119
Yes, which means it's operable.

372
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:32,365
Now, five-year survival rate
goes up dramatically to 25%.

373
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:34,198
A cure is possible?

374
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:36,925
It is. Yes.

375
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,604
Cade, you hear that?

376
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,676
If the cancer hasn't spread.

377
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:44,145
- You need a complicated procedure.
- The Whipple.

378
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,176
We have a world-renowned surgeon
right here at Chastain.

379
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:48,583
He's performed the Whipple
hundreds of times.

380
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,089
Dr. Randolph Bell.

381
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,706
Still a dangerous surgery

382
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,070
that could have
serious complications, but...

383
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:57,245
Okay, can you please
stop measuring me for a coffin?

384
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,683
Let's just be positive
for one minute.

385
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:02,944
Is it too much to ask?

386
00:18:03,163 --> 00:18:06,206
Dr. Hawkins just said
I can survive this.

387
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:09,160
Since it's obvious
I'm not helping,

388
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:11,461
I'm going to step out now.

389
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:21,738
You know, if anyone
can survive this, you can.

390
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:28,663
Well, that went well.

391
00:18:33,003 --> 00:18:36,111
You're under
unimaginable stress.

392
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:38,995
But...

393
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,598
I think you need to recognize

394
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:44,331
that this is hard
for your daughter also.

395
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,117
Can you take the young man
out to the waiting room

396
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:00,211
for a few minutes?

397
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:01,620
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

398
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:03,956
- No problem.
- Thank you.

399
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,811
Mr. Alvarez, we still recommend
you end the pregnancy,

400
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:09,128
today if possible.

401
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:12,964
It is by far the best chance
for Trini.

402
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:16,392
Although there is another option
that we can try.

403
00:19:16,477 --> 00:19:17,728
What is this option?

404
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:22,325
Well, we could put Trini
on a machine called an ECMO.

405
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,153
It would ease the stress
of her struggling heart,

406
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:28,389
and it might perhaps
buy us some time

407
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:30,262
and keep her alive
for a few more months

408
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:32,738
until she can deliver the baby
safely.

409
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,793
That sounds perfect.

410
00:19:34,878 --> 00:19:37,507
- Do it.
- No, it is far from perfect.

411
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:40,051
You have to understand
that ECMO is very dangerous.

412
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:42,828
There can be complications
like hemorrhage, stroke,

413
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:45,923
- infection.
- Brain damage is possible.

414
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,184
She could wind up paralyzed.

415
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:50,403
Unable to speak. Blind.

416
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:53,269
And she could die
from any of these complications.

417
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:55,464
Then the baby would die as well.

418
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,840
But there's a chance

419
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:59,792
that Trini and the baby could
both be fine with this ECMO?

420
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:02,273
That is a remote possibility,
Mr. Alvarez.

421
00:20:02,527 --> 00:20:04,918
So, let's be clear,
you are giving up

422
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,215
the absolute best chance
that we have

423
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,965
of saving your wife's life.

424
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,265
Listen.

425
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:12,399
If we end the pregnancy now,

426
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:15,879
down the road, she can safely
have another child.

427
00:20:26,803 --> 00:20:28,949
<i>My heart tells me
that you can save them both,</i>

428
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:32,695
<i>and I believe that
Trini would want you to try.</i>

429
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:35,412
Please.

430
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,736
Why does he lash out at me?

431
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,046
He's scared.

432
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,015
Obviously, things have not
been easy between you.

433
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:09,748
But now is the time
for patience and understanding.

434
00:21:09,832 --> 00:21:11,492
Of course.

435
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,678
I love him.

436
00:21:14,054 --> 00:21:15,579
Despite the fact
that I can't remember

437
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:17,923
the last time he said
he loved me.

438
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,415
When I was little,

439
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,929
all the other kids thought
I had the coolest dad.

440
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:25,598
Charmed them all.

441
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:27,828
Bought them all ice cream.

442
00:21:27,914 --> 00:21:31,012
Entertained them
at my birthday parties.

443
00:21:31,445 --> 00:21:33,266
It took a while to realize
that he lives

444
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:34,868
for the reflection he sees
of himself

445
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:36,184
in other people's eyes,

446
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,527
and I see him too clearly.

447
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:41,883
Forgiveness and acceptance is
a beautiful thing.

448
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,758
I didn't even talk to my father
for years.

449
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:47,286
I realized our problems were
a two-way street.

450
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:49,906
I wasn't as blameless
as I thought.

451
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:51,609
So...

452
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:54,969
I gave him a chance,
and he was capable of

453
00:21:55,053 --> 00:21:56,971
more than I ever
could've imagined.

454
00:21:57,055 --> 00:21:59,531
Now we couldn't be closer.

455
00:22:03,561 --> 00:22:05,571
You only get one father.

456
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:08,290
You can't change him,
and you may lose him.

457
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:11,918
Now's the time
to accept him as he is.

458
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,383

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,388
Cushing's reflex.
Classic sign of stroke.

526
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,748
It happened faster
than we imagined.

527
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,569
I'm going to adjust
her arterial support

528
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:52,654
to get her blood pressure
in a tighter range.

529
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:54,415
It might be too late.

530
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,086
Let's get her to CT, all right?

531
00:26:57,171 --> 00:26:59,046
And page Billie.

532
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:03,634
Images coming up.

533
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,373
Here's the problem.

534
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:09,716
Bleed, left side of the brain.

535
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:10,990
Hemorrhagic stroke?

536
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:12,248
- Mm-hmm.
- Definitely.

537
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:14,982
Damage may be extensive.

538
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:16,617
Potentially paralyzed.

539
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,787
I mean, she may have lost
the ability to speak forever.

540
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,514
And worse still, this could
just be the beginning.

541
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,292
I see more possible bleeds
near the dura.

542
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,632
I mean,
this could have been avoided.

543
00:27:26,716 --> 00:27:27,741
Did you make her husband
understand

544
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:28,771
this was likely to happen?

545
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,275
Come on, man,
don't you think we tried?

546
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,628
We advised against
it in the strongest terms,

547
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:34,113
but he is her health care proxy.

548
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,470
And we had no idea that
she would have complications

549
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:38,187
- this fast.
- Look, all we can do now

550
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:40,740
is double down
on trying to save Trini,

551
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,260
no matter what condition
she's in,

552
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,968
and hope we can keep her
on ECMO long enough

553
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:46,732
for her heart to recover

554
00:27:47,023 --> 00:27:50,568
or for the baby to mature
enough to be viable.

555
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:02,193
Can you guys give us a minute?

556
00:28:11,245 --> 00:28:15,815
Look, I am perfectly aware
of the risks of this surgery,

557
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:21,563
so I know that I may not
get off that OR table.

558
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:24,381
You got the best of me.

559
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,730
And none of the bad.

560
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:32,514
I am so proud of you,
and I always have been.

561
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:38,770
You are the child of my heart...

562
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,451
...and if I haven't
said it enough,

563
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,152
then I need to say it now.

564
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:48,193
I love you.

565
00:28:53,388 --> 00:28:54,823
All right.

566
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:58,915
Now go back to being a tough
bastard and beat this thing.

567
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:01,248
You got it.

568
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:21,550
Hi, baby.

569
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:26,943
Aw. Hi.

570
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:54,365
- Update me.
- We troubleshot everything,

571
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,451
but as you can see...

572
00:29:58,528 --> 00:29:59,919
Her heart's giving out.

573
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,240
She has a few minutes left,
maybe.

574
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:04,193
Excuse me, excuse me.
What's going on?

575
00:30:04,326 --> 00:30:05,716
What's happening to Trini?

576
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:09,615
Mr. Alvarez,
I am terribly sorry...

577
00:30:11,532 --> 00:30:13,191
...but your wife is dying.

578
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:15,709
Just keep her
on the machine, right?

579
00:30:15,943 --> 00:30:17,849
You said that it would
take over for her heart.

580
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:20,045
- Let it keep working.
- We can't.

581
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,904
Her heart is too badly damaged.

582
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:23,942
We tried to tell
you this was a long shot.

583
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:27,704
- It didn't work. I'm so sorry.
- No. Please.

584
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:28,912
No.

585
00:30:28,997 --> 00:30:31,214
Mommy?

586
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,625
Do something!
Please do something!

587
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,031
Please.

588
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,791
There's nothing more we can do.

589
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,869
We can't bring her back.

590
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:42,720
She's gone, Matias.

591
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:45,685
No.

592
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,341
Don't tell me that.
Don't tell me that.

593
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:14,272
And with that,

594
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:16,179
we dissect the pancreas.

595
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:20,060
Pancreas is mobilized.

596
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,591
Oh, wait. W...

597
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:26,021
What's the update?

598
00:31:26,106 --> 00:31:27,084
Well,

599
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:30,387
looks like the tumor
has adhered to the IVC.

600
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:34,389
Which means they have
to resect it.

601
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:37,033
- If they nick the IVC...
- That's not gonna happen.

602
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,928
Bell's done this
thousands of times.

603
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,760
Dr. Devi...

604
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:45,062
- ...all yours.
- What is he doing?

605
00:31:45,146 --> 00:31:47,053
He can't pass this off
to a resident.

606
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,553
- Leela has never done a Whipple.
- Which is why she has to learn.

607
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:52,310
Bell's there to back her up.

608
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:54,436
Satinsky clamp, 3.0 Prolene,

609
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,663
sponge stick and forceps.

610
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:57,405
Dr. Chu, do you have
Rh null blood up there?

611
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:58,648
- I do.
- Hang it, please.

612
00:31:58,732 --> 00:32:01,810
We're in for some turbulence.
Clamp on.

613
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:05,357
Dissecting the tumor off now.

614
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,936
Blood pressure's in the toilet.

615
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:10,124
Going up on pressors.

616
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,477
Okay, Dr. Devi
has finished the dissection.

617
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:14,128
She anticipated this.

618
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:16,453
I've identified the
defect, but I'm having a hard time

619
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:17,959
getting in position for repair.

620
00:32:18,044 --> 00:32:20,376
Well, remember your anatomy.

621
00:32:21,354 --> 00:32:23,105
This is Cade's father,

622
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,437
so maybe in this case,
you should...

623
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:26,091
The Whipple is the crucible

624
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:29,068
of a surgical residency,
it's the final test.

625
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:31,943
Just get in there and ace it.

626
00:32:32,673 --> 00:32:34,573
It's your OR, Dr. Devi.

627
00:32:34,657 --> 00:32:36,326
- Proceed.
- Right.

628
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:39,271
Dr. Chu, reverse positioning
of the patient, please.

629
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:41,967
Okay, that's excellent.

630
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:44,582
You have a clear path
to the defect.

631
00:32:44,826 --> 00:32:46,584
3.0 Prolene to you.

632
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:52,388
Closing and over sewing.

633
00:32:58,256 --> 00:33:00,357
Hemodynamics settling.

634
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:04,599
That's strong work, Dr. Devi.

635
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:11,019
She rose to the occasion.

636
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,107
Yes, she did.

637
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:15,935
He's gonna make it out
of the OR, isn't he?

638
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,435
Yeah.

639
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:22,301
Now we just have to make sure
the cancer hasn't spread.

640
00:33:22,386 --> 00:33:24,553

I wanted to tell you.

781

They have a child.

782
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:50,107

anything could happen.

about any of this right now.

800
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,564
- Just drop it.
- If something happens to me,

financially,

802

00:41:40,574 --> 00:41:42,085
I mean, don't bring
a date to my funeral.

- Conrad.
