00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:44,611
He's terrified.

176
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,482
Which is exactly

177
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,876
how I felt when we didn't know
what happened to you.

178
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,531
And Conrad was with you the
whole time I was unconscious.

179
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,838
I need to be there for him.

180
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:56,536
Just give him time.

181
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,582
If Nic doesn't turn
a corner soon,

182
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:02,280
there may not be much time.

183
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,648
Inserting the electrode
into the dura.

184
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,520
Tox screen negative.

185
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,391
She doesn't have a drop
of alcohol in her.

186
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:30,482
So her EKG
and her echo were normal.

187
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,659
There's no evidence
of any arrhythmia

188
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,225
that could have preceded this.

189
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,662
[rapid beeping]

190
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,186
[Conrad sighs]

191
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:40,536
BILLIE:
Swelling on the CT
wasn't an overcall.

192
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,843
Her intracranial pressure
is high.

193
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,105
Then we start her
on hypersaline...

194
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,281
Dr. Sutton?

195
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:49,414
Uh, we start her on hypertonic
saline, Lasix and mannitol.

196
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,852
- If that doesn't work...
- It has to work.

197
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,246
Let me talk to you for a second.

198
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:05,735
Billie is a strong neurosurgeon,
but if you would like

199
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,868
a second opinion, you just name
the doctor, and I'll deliver...

200
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,218
- I don't want another surgeon.
- No, I-I get... I know.

201
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:13,003
What you want is to direct
Nic's care, but you cannot.

202
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:17,268
Doing so would be a risk to Nic
that we can't let you take.

203
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:19,096
You can't expect me
to do nothing.

204
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,794
I'm not saying that,

205
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:24,362
but you must give
this team the chance.

206
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,901
[monitor beeping steadily]

207
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,600
You don't have to stay for this.

208
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,907
Oh, don't mind me, dear. There's
nowhere else I need to be.

209
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:49,387
Oh, no. Cherry's an old pro.

210
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,563
She sat beside Gabe
for the six months

211
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,827
he was in ICU
recovering from COVID.

212
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,959
Six months, one week, five days.

213
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,135
Is "bronchoscopy" two
Os or three?

214
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,572
- That's three.
- Ah.

215
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,618
I-I like
to write everything down.

216
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:05,969
I-I know you keep Gabe's records
in the clouds or whatever,

217
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,928
but I like to keep
my own account right here.

218
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:10,582
Hey, Devi,
park the scope right there.

219
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:13,542
See how his trachea collapses
every time he breathes?

220
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,718
That's what's causing
the wheezing.

221
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:19,591
It's the tracheomalacia again.

222
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,855
Okay, Devi, we're good.

223
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:25,423
He needed all that time on
the breathing tube for COVID,

224
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:28,252
but it made his trachea weak
and floppy.

225
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,602
And given his history,
I'm afraid we're gonna have

226
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:32,517
to go back
to the tracheostomy tube.

227
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,737
- Oh, he hated that so much.
- I know.

228
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,783
How long will he need it?

229
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,436
Indefinitely.

230
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,743
And he's most likely going

231
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:43,093
to need the ventilator at home,
as well.

232
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:46,314
I mean, the damage to
his own trachea is so extensive,

233
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:50,100
it's the only way we can
get Gabe to breathe safely.

234
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,104
Cherry, I know this is not
what any of us wanted,

235
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:57,717
but I promise you,
it is the best that we have.

236
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,814
No explanation from the police
on what caused the accident?

237
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,903
Not yet.

238
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:16,561
I texted my prayer group
to include Nic.

239
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,825
I hope that's okay.

240
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:32,708
How's she doing?

241
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,928
Listen, about earlier.
I should...

242
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,499
- What's this?
- Elaine Quinn,
patient from last winter.

243
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:44,024
40 years old? She had the dogs?

244
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,069
Two huskies.

245
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:50,465
I remember.
Her car got hit by a snowplow.

246
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:53,729
Worst TBI we'd seen,
but she recovered.

247
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,731
If I can figure out why
she made it through,

248
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,733
I can help Nic make it through.

249
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,867
Elaine Quinn's scans were
entirely different than Nic's.

250
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,956
She had a brain bleed.

251
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,132
We were able
to intervene on that.

252
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,965
I know that's not
what you want to hear.

253
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:14,054
You think I'm in denial?

254
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,406
I don't.

255
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:21,452
I don't pretend to know at all
what this is like for you.

256
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,108
I want to help you.

257
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,982
I just don't want
to say the wrong thing.

258
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,815
No. I want you
to be honest with me.

259
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,121
I know it's bad.

260
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,908
It is.

261
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,572
How you doing?

262
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:58,141
[sniffles]
Me? I'm fine.

263
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:00,317
Well, then you're made
of something much stronger

264
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,450
than the rest of us.
It's okay not to be okay

265
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,800
when your critical patient
is also your friend.

266
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,410
How are you, really?

267
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,676
This is one of the worst nights
of my life as a doctor.

268
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:14,375
And I want to cry and scream
and throw things

269
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,552
because my best friend
should not be in an ICU bed

270
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,859
fighting for her life.

271
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,167
And how's Nic's progress?

272
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,695
Her ICP is higher than
I would like, but it's stable.

273
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:34,961
Stable's not the same thing
as recovering. Right?

274
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,790
Which is why I think it's time

275
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,488
to put her
in a phenobarbital coma.

276
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,316
And you're worried
Conrad won't agree?

277
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,321
This is your call--
how you approach this.

278
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:50,715
You're the doctor.

279
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:59,811
If we put her in a coma,
she can't wake up

280
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,813
until the sedatives wear off.

281
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:04,164
How can I know she's improving

282
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,253
if she's being flooded
with sedatives?

283
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:09,560
- We rely
on monitoring parameters.
- Mm-mm.

284
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,128
[sniffles]

285
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,959
Listen, I have to do something
I don't want to do.

286
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,048
I have to talk to you the way

287
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:21,442
I would the spouse
of any other patient.

288
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,105
Unfortunately,
despite our meds,

289
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:34,672
the pressure in your
wife's brain is still too high.

290
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:36,979
If we don't put her
in a medically-induced coma,

291
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:40,461
we risk compromising any chance
she has at recovery.

292
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,556
[sighs]
Oh, Conrad.

293
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:54,779
Nic has been my best friend
since we were children.

294
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,914
I love her, too, and I will
do anything for her.

295
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,960
It doesn't compare
to what you're going through,

296
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,484
but you have to trust me.

297
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:06,966
I can't. I can't let go.

298
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:11,274
[sniffles]

299
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:14,930
What if we do this
and it's the end, and...

300
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,717
...and I-I can't ever talk
to her again?

301
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,289
This is her best chance,

302
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,857
maybe her only chance.

303
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,946
You know that.

304
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,866
What would Nic tell us to do
in this situation?

305
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:40,434
What would she say right now?

306
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,744
She would say, "Start the drip."

307
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,508
It's herbal.

308
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:14,685
Caffeine never does anyone
any good at this hour.

309
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,907
Thank you, Mrs. Sandoval.

310
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:20,996
How are you?

311
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,393
Is it Gabe?

312
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:29,613
Dr. Austin said
he needs another trach tube.

313
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:34,140
I have a feeling that's gonna
go over like a lead balloon.

314
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:38,274
You can't imagine
how relieved we were

315
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,668
when Nic got Gabe diagnosed.

316
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:45,673
Neither one of us had ever heard
of tracheomalacia.

317
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:50,069
She helped us understand what
long-haul COVID would mean

318
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,158
for Gabe, for both of us.

319
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:58,164
And she made us believe
that we could face it together.

320
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:00,166
Maybe it's silly at my age,

321
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,517
but Nic made me want to go back
to school and become a nurse.

322
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:07,042
She gave us hope.

323
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,961
I wish I could thank her again
for that.

324
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:16,399
You can... when she wakes up.

325
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:21,100
-[door opens]
- BELL: I hope to God
you won't have to.

326
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:27,802
- No updates?
- No, there's-there's
nothing yet, um,

327
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,195
but I brought you a visitor.

328
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:32,415
This is Santina Lopez
from Nexus Life.

329
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:33,938
Hello, Santina.

330
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,940
I'm sorry
you made the trip up here,

331
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,334
but I have no need of you
at this time.

332
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:43,209
I'm sorry.
Could you just give us a minute?

333
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,862
Of course.

334
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,435
You know, there's never
a good time to make this call,

335
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:54,220
and if this were

336
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,612
- any other patient...
- It isn't.

337
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:56,961
...with a severe TBI

338
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:59,268
and no trauma
to major organs...

339
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:04,012
Just given everything we know
at this moment,

340
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,841
we have to consider
every possible outcome.

341
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,669
There are tens of thousands
of people

342
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,627
in this country
waiting for organ transplants.

343
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:14,022
I know, I have patients
of my own on that list.

344
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,681
If the time comes
