What happened?

63
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,693
Police don't have a cause.
There were no other vehicles

64
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:38,174

weather. No idea where

65

she was coming from
or where she was headed.

66

Dr. Conrad Hawkins, right?

I've heard the other medics
mention you.

There. No lung sliding.

77
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:12,469
It's a tension pneumo.

78
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:13,949
We can decompress her here.

79
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,690
Pass me an angiocath.

80
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,604

[rapid beeping continues]

83
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,703
She didn't even flinch.
What did you sedate her with?

84
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:31,314
Nothing. She's not sedated
with anything.

85
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:35,710
Nic, wake up. Wake up.

86

87
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:42,107
On my count. Three, two.

88
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:43,239
- One.
- One.

89
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:53,293
At some point,
we will have to intervene.

90
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:57,166
He can't take control
of Nic's care.

91
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,561
I know, and we will once we know
what we're dealing with.

92
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:02,606
The pneumothorax
was easily resolved,

93
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,217
but Nic hasn't done
anything purposeful

94
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:07,176
since the paramedics found her.

95
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:08,917
KIT: Which could mean
a myriad of things.

96
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:13,487
Accidental ingestion,
electrolyte abnormality.

97
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,489
Sure, it's a possibility.

98
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:18,666
I mean, from the neck down,
Nic appears to be okay.

99
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,757
But the impact from the crash
may have damaged her brain.

100
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,715
Badly.

101
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:27,196
Let's not catastrophize
just yet.

102
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,506

Where's Nic?

103
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,943
Ooh, Dr. Pravesh,
you're not looking too good.

104
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:37,337
She's right, Devon. Slow down.
You're still recovering.

105
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,034
I'm fine.

106
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,601
Hey, where's Nic?

107
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,343
She's in CT.
Conrad is with her.

108
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,432
Kit's keeping me posted.

109
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:48,957
Whoa, buddy, hold on. Hey,
didn't I just discharge you?

110
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:51,481
It's Nic.
I'm not going home.

111
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:53,265
Okay, but you're also not going
to badge in.

112
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,745
Let's find you a place
to lie down.

113
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:55,877
I'll order you a neb. Come on.

114
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:58,183
No. It's fine.

115
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,229
[man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.]

116
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:04,755
It's subtle, but
there's some evidence of edema.

117
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:08,106
Yeah, but we're used to looking
at scans of older people.

118
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:10,500
A young brain is bound
to look full in contrast.

119
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,502
Well, these tiny
petechial hemorrhages in

120
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:14,199
the basal ganglia tell us
there's damage.

121
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,985
Well, the question is--
how will it evolve?

122
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,203
KIT:
Dr. Sutton, what's our plan?

123
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,248
CONRAD:
Place an ICP monitor

124
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:20,771
and treat her with meds

125
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:22,686
to lower her intracranial
pressure if it's high.

126
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,775
And repeat the CT in four hours.

127
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:27,212
Sooner. I want to know
if there's any changes.

128
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:29,476
Nic is strong. She's healthy.

129
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:33,393
I've had patients make it
through injuries like this.

130
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,134
We all have.

131
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:38,267
Got here as fast as I could.

132
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,622
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

133
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:49,017
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

134
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:50,714
Nic is gonna be fine.

135
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:54,283
Does everyone hear that?

136
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,461
Nic is gonna be fine.

137
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,507
Go home, Pravesh.
You shouldn't be here.

138

- It's not me. It's Gabe.

Hey, it's my favorite long-haul
COVID survivor. You missed us?

144
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:15,957
Not really.

145
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:18,263
- No offense.
-[laughs]

146
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:21,745

148
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:26,402
Only oxygen. No tubes.

149
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:29,840
Now you know I don't
make the rules, Mr. Sandoval.

150
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,321
Just try and relax.
We've got you.

151
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:35,150
He's been doing so well
since the surgery.

152
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,848
I wrote down
his pulse oximeter reading.

153
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:42,984
This is 94, 96, 93, 94.

154
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:45,203
My wife is paranoid.

155
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:46,988
She's thorough.

156
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,380
We like that.

157
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,644
CHERRY:
I try to keep him alive.

158
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:53,777
His health has never been
the same since he had COVID.

159
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,302
That's a lot of wheezing
I'm hearing.

160
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,479
How do you feel about checking
in to the Hotel de Chastain?

161
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,003
- Huh?
- I told you they'd admit me.

162
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,874
- Shh.
- IRVING: Page Dr. Austin.

163
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:06,137
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's get Mr. Sandoval
started on a neb,

164
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:10,315
order a chest X-ray, and
give him 125 IV Solu-Medrol.

165
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,448
Um, is Nurse Nevin here?

166
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:15,320
She always likes
to know how Gabe is doing.

167
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,367
Uh, not tonight.

168
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,195
Sit tight.

169
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:23,328
- We'll get you fixed up,
Mr. Sandoval, okay?
-[grunts]

170
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:26,070
- Shh.
-[wheezing]

171
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,771
You need to stop
beating yourself up.

172
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,903
You saw the look on his face.

173
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,560
[takes deep breath]

174
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:42,826
He's not angry with you.

175
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:44,611
He's terrified.

176
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,482
Which is exactly

177
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,876
how I felt when we didn't know
what happened to you.

178
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,531
And Conrad was with you the
whole time I was unconscious.

179
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,838
I need to be there for him.

180
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:56,536
Just give him time.

181
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,582
If Nic doesn't turn
a corner soon,

182
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:02,280
there may not be much time.

183
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,648
Inserting the electrode
into the dura.

184
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,520
Tox screen negative.

185
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,391
She doesn't have a drop
of alcohol in her.

186
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:30,482
So her EKG
and her echo were normal.

187
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,659
There's no evidence
of any arrhythmia

188
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,225
that could have preceded this.

189
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,662
[rapid beeping]

190
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,186
[Conrad sighs]

191
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:40,536
BILLIE:
Swelling on the CT
wasn't an overcall.

192
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,843
Her intracranial pressure
is high.

193
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:44,105
Then we start her
on hypersaline...

194
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,281
Dr. Sutton?

195
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:49,414
Uh, we start her on hypertonic
saline, Lasix and mannitol.

196
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,852
- If that doesn't work...
- It has to work.

197
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,246
Let me talk to you for a second.

198
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:05,735
Billie is a strong neurosurgeon,
but if you would like

199
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,868
a second opinion, you just name
the doctor, and I'll deliver...

200
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,218
- I don't want another surgeon.
- No, I-I get... I know.

201
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:13,003
What you want is to direct
Nic's care, but you cannot.

202
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:17,268
Doing so would be a risk to Nic
that we can't let you take.

203
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:19,096
You can't expect me
to do nothing.

204
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,794
I'm not saying that,

205
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:24,362
but you must give
this team the chance.

206
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,901
[monitor beeping steadily]

207
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,600
You don't have to stay for this.

208
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,907
Oh, don't mind me, dear. There's
nowhere else I need to be.

209
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:49,387
Oh, no. Cherry's an old pro.

210
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,563
She sat beside Gabe
for the six months

211
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,827
he was in ICU
recovering from COVID.

212
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,959
Six months, one week, five days.

213
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,135
Is "bronchoscopy" two
Os or three?

214
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,572
- That's three.
- Ah.

215
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,618
I-I like
to write everything down.

216
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:05,969
I-I know you keep Gabe's records
in the clouds or whatever,

217
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,928
but I like to keep
my own account right here.

218
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:10,582
Hey, Devi,
park the scope right there.

219
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:13,542
See how his trachea collapses
every time he breathes?

220
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,718
That's what's causing
the wheezing.

221
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:19,591
It's the tracheomalacia again.

222
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,855
Okay, Devi, we're good.

223
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:25,423
He needed all that time on
the breathing tube for COVID,

224
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:28,252
but it made his trachea weak
and floppy.

225
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,602
And given his history,
I'm afraid we're gonna have

226
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:32,517
to go back
to the tracheostomy tube.

227
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,737
- Oh, he hated that so much.
- I know.

228
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,783
How long will he need it?

229
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,436
Indefinitely.

230
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,743
And he's most likely going

231
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:43,093
to need the ventilator at home,
as well.

232
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:46,314
I mean, the damage to
his own trachea is so extensive,

233
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:50,100
it's the only way we can
get Gabe to breathe safely.

234
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,104
Cherry, I know this is not
what any of us wanted,

235
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:57,717
but I promise you,
it is the best that we have.

236
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,814
No explanation from the police
on what caused the accident?

237
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,903
Not yet.

238
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:16,561
I texted my prayer group
to include Nic.

239
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,825
I hope that's okay.

240
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:32,708
How's she doing?

241
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,928
Listen, about earlier.
I should...

242
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,499
- What's this?
- Elaine Quinn,
patient from last winter.

243
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:44,024
40 years old? She had the dogs?

244
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,069
Two huskies.

245
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:50,465
I remember.
Her car got hit by a snowplow.

246
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:53,729
Worst TBI we'd seen,
but she recovered.

247
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,731
If I can figure out why
she made it through,

248
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,733
I can help Nic make it through.

249
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,867
Elaine Quinn's scans were
entirely different than Nic's.

250
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,956
She had a brain bleed.

251
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,132
We were able
to intervene on that.

252
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,965
I know that's not
what you want to hear.

253
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:14,054
You think I'm in denial?

254
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,406
I don't.

255
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:21,452
I don't pretend to know at all
what this is like for you.

256
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,108
I want to help you.

257
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,982
I just don't want
to say the wrong thing.

258
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,815
No. I want you
to be honest with me.

259
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,121
I know it's bad.

260
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,908
It is.

261
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,572
How you doing?

262
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:58,141
[sniffles]
Me? I'm fine.

263
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:00,317
Well, then you're made
of something much stronger

264
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,450
than the rest of us.
It's okay not to be okay

265
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,800
when your critical patient
is also your friend.

266
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,410
How are you, really?

267
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,676
This is one of the worst nights
of my life as a doctor.

268
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:14,375
And I want to cry and scream
and throw things

269
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,552
because my best friend
should not be in an ICU bed

270
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,859
fighting for her life.

271
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,167
And how's Nic's progress?

272
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,695
Her ICP is higher than
I would like, but it's stable.

273
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:34,961
Stable's not the same thing
as recovering. Right?

274
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,790
Which is why I think it's time

275
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,488
to put her
in a phenobarbital coma.

276
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,316
And you're worried
Conrad won't agree?

277
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,321
This is your call--
how you approach this.

278
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:50,715
You're the doctor.

279
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:59,811
If we put her in a coma,
she can't wake up

280
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,813
until the sedatives wear off.

281
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:04,164
How can I know she's improving

282
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,253
if she's being flooded
with sedatives?

283
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:09,560
- We rely
on monitoring parameters.
- Mm-mm.

284
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,128
[sniffles]

285
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,959
Listen, I have to do something
I don't want to do.

286
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,048
I have to talk to you the way

287
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:21,442
I would the spouse
of any other patient.

288
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,105
Unfortunately,
despite our meds,

289
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:34,672
the pressure in your
wife's brain is still too high.

290
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:36,979
If we don't put her
in a medically-induced coma,

291
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:40,461
we risk compromising any chance
she has at recovery.

292
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,556
[sighs]
Oh, Conrad.

293
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:54,779
Nic has been my best friend
since we were children.

294
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,914
I love her, too, and I will
do anything for her.

295
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,960
It doesn't compare
to what you're going through,

296
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,484
but you have to trust me.

297
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:06,966
I can't. I can't let go.

298
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:11,274
[sniffles]

299
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:14,930
What if we do this
and it's the end, and...

300
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,717
...and I-I can't ever talk
to her again?

301
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,289
This is her best chance,

302
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,857
maybe her only chance.

303
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,946
You know that.

304
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,866
What would Nic tell us to do
in this situation?

305
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:40,434
What would she say right now?

306
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,744
She would say, "Start the drip."

307
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,508
It's herbal.

308
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:14,685
Caffeine never does anyone
any good at this hour.

309
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,907
Thank you, Mrs. Sandoval.

310
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:20,996
How are you?

311
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,393
Is it Gabe?

312
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:29,613
Dr. Austin said
he needs another trach tube.

313
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:34,140
I have a feeling that's gonna
go over like a lead balloon.

314
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:38,274
You can't imagine
how relieved we were

315
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,668
when Nic got Gabe diagnosed.

316
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:45,673
Neither one of us had ever heard
of tracheomalacia.

317
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:50,069
She helped us understand what
long-haul COVID would mean

318
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,158
for Gabe, for both of us.

319
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:58,164
And she made us believe
that we could face it together.

320
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:00,166
Maybe it's silly at my age,

321
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,517
but Nic made me want to go back
to school and become a nurse.

322
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:07,042
She gave us hope.

323
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,961
I wish I could thank her again
for that.

324
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:16,399
You can... when she wakes up.

325
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:21,100
-[door opens]
- BELL: I hope to God
you won't have to.

326
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:27,802
- No updates?
- No, there's-there's
nothing yet, um,

327
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,195
but I brought you a visitor.

328
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:32,415
This is Santina Lopez
from Nexus Life.

329
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:33,938
Hello, Santina.

330
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,940
I'm sorry
you made the trip up here,

331
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,334
but I have no need of you
at this time.

332
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:43,209
I'm sorry.
Could you just give us a minute?

333
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,862
Of course.

334
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,435
You know, there's never
a good time to make this call,

335
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:54,220
and if this were

336
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,612
- any other patient...
- It isn't.

337
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:56,961
...with a severe TBI

338
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:59,268
and no trauma
to major organs...

339
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:04,012
Just given everything we know
at this moment,

340
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,841
we have to consider
every possible outcome.

341
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,669
There are tens of thousands
of people

342
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,627
in this country
waiting for organ transplants.

343
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:14,022
I know, I have patients
of my own on that list.

344
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,681
If the time comes
to discuss Nic's wishes,

345
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:24,815
I promise I will handle it.

346
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,602
[monitor beeping steadily]

347
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,560
[wheezing]

348
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,693
CHERRY:
Oh, there you are. [laughs]

349
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,695
- You miss me?
-[wheezing]

350
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:36,349
How's your breathing,
Mr. Sandoval?

351
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:41,005
We should talk about
what we found on the scope.

352
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:45,053
We want to put in
another tracheostomy tube.

353
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,838
No? Honey, this isn't
a yes-or-no question.

354
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,884
Page Dr. Austin.

355
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:53,366
He should be a part
of this conversation.

356
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,890
We'll be right back.

357
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,849
[man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.]

358
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,721
[Gabe clears throat]

359
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:03,506
When the trach tube came out
last time,

360
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:06,292
we agreed
I'd never have another one.

361
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:10,078
It's okay.
Our insurance can cover it.

362
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,298
It's not the cost, honey.

363
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,691
I'll be tethered to a machine.

364
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:16,911
[wheezing]

365
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:20,219
The noise, the inconvenience.

366
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:26,225
All you do is take care of me.

367
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:30,490
With a trach, it's endless.

368
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,275
I signed up for better or worse,
sickness and health.

369
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,973
I love you.

370
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,106
And I love you.

371
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:40,195
[wheezing]

372
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:46,070
That's why
I've made up my mind.

373
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:49,900
I'm done, honey.

374
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,949
No more tubes,
no more chest compressions.

375
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,691
- Uh-uh.
-[rapid beeping]

376
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:59,258
-[loud wheezing]
- No.

377
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,651
Doctor? Dr. Devi!

378
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,132
[wheezing]

379
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:06,221
-[rapid beeping]
- We need a code airway!

380
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:09,790
DNI. DNI. DNI.

381
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,488
- DNI.
- Mr. Sandoval, you could die
without intubation.

382
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:13,968
REENA:
Dr. Devi?

383
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,796
[loud wheezing]

384
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:17,580
Cancel the code. Mr. Sandoval
just informed me he's DNI.

385
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,583
Get the BiPAP machine, please.

386
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,932
We can keep you breathing
for now, but you need

387
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:24,283
a permanent solution.

388
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,285
[wheezing]

389
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,465
Conrad told me not to come,
but I had to.

390
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:34,162
How's Nic?

391
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,731
- I think he'll be happy
you're here.
-[GiGi babbles]

392
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:40,995
All right. Kyle's on his way.

393
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:43,606
He, understandably,
is taking this very hard,

394
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:45,260
and I'm worried.

395
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,349
I'll see to Kyle.

396
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,786
Why don't you get GiGi
to the nursery,

397
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,353
and I'll have one of the staff
from Peds come

398
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,094
- and help you get her settled?
- Okay.

399
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,835
[GiGi fussing]

400
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,445
[alarm sounding]

401
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:59,056
- Her ICP is up again.
- I can get more mannitol.

402
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:02,451
No. Her osmolarity
is already 320.

403
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:05,193
Asymmetric pupils.
Nonreactive on the right.

404
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:06,716
That's new.

405
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:08,544
[alarms sounding]

406
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:13,506
So is the bradycardia.
This could be a bleed.

407
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:15,290
That could be something
we can fix.

408
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,685
Let's get her to CT
to find out. Now.

409
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,559
Kyle.

410
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,822
Hey. Hi. Hi. Hi.

411
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:29,957
Hi. I, uh... I, uh, found this,
you know, message board online.

412
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:31,872
They said that sensory reminders
can be helpful.

413
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,874
Uh, where's Nicky?

414
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:37,573
She's just been brought to CT.

415
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:40,271
I want to prepare you
for when you see her.

416
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:43,710
Oh, is it...? It's that bad?

417
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,235
On the outside Nic looks okay,
like she's sleeping.

418
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,150
Well, that's good, right?

419
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,195
Not exactly.

420
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:54,068
The impact from the accident
was powerful enough

421
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:57,201
- to injure her brain.
-[gasps]

422
00:22:57,201 --> 00:23:00,074
- It's, uh, like a severe bruise
you can't see.
- Don't.

423
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:02,119
And we don't know if or when

424
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,991
that bruise will improve
or worsen.

425
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,688
It's got to improve.

426
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:08,125
It will improve.

427
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:11,128
I'm afraid, at the moment,
that's far from certain.

428
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:13,217
Okay, I want...
I want to... I want to see her.

429
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:14,958
I need to talk to her.

430
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,526
[voice breaking]:
I want her to know
that I'm here.

431
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:21,008
Of course.
You can see her after the CT.

432
00:23:23,097 --> 00:23:26,622
Can... can-can-can...
can I wait in her room?

433
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,494
Yes.

434
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:32,193
There.

435
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:34,108
I see it.

436
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:38,286
Diffuse effacement
of the gray-white junction.

437
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:40,114
Ventricular compression.

438
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:42,638
Her brain is herniating.

439
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:50,254
All right. So, we do
a decompressive craniotomy.

440
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:51,952
That could stop the herniation.

441
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:53,736
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

442
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:57,610
I can't reverse the injury.

443
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:03,180
Nic won't recover
from this, Conrad.

444
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:14,191
That's my wife in there.

445
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:17,064
GiGi's mother.
The center of our world.

446
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:19,327
We are not giving up on her.

447
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:51,359
â™ª

448
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:58,453
[sighs]:
I love you.

449
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,934
[sniffles]

450
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:02,936
[sighs]

451
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,694
This is unsurvivable.

452
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:23,478
Yeah, I know.

453
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:31,181
These images make it clear.

454
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,186
Nic is gone.

455
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:40,234
There's only one thing left
to do to confirm the diagnosis.

456
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,192
The brain death exam. I...

457
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:44,412
I don't think
Billie should handle that.

458
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:48,155
She's going through enough.

459
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:50,723
Conrad will insist
on performing the tests.

460
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,942
No, we can't allow it.

461
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:56,119
Who does that leave?

462
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:00,210
Are you sure you're up for this?

463
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:06,216
Am I up for it?

464
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,829
No.

465
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:13,659
Is it gonna destroy me? Yes.

466
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:18,228
But it's not about me.

467
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:23,277
It's about two people I love
and their child.

468
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:26,628
And I'm gonna do it for Nic.

469
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,674
And Conrad.

470
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:30,371
And GiGi.

471
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:36,943
[monitor beeping steadily]

472
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,260
[Conrad groans]

473
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,437
I got you.

474
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:01,794
GiGi's asleep in the nursery.

475
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:03,883
[sniffles]

476
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,843
Kyle, I'm so sorry.

477
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:11,368
Well, she looks okay.

478
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,588
Right?

479
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:15,634
I think she's gonna be okay.

480
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:21,509
MARSHALL:
Kit said there are tests?

481
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:27,341
Why don't we, uh, take a walk,
get some air?

482
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:31,519
KYLE:
Nah, I'm gonna stay here
in case she wakes up.

483
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,609
MARSHALL:
The doctors have
to run some more tests.

484
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:37,525
We can come back
as soon as they're done.

485
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:40,615
[sighs]

486
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,504
[Conrad sighs]

487
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,986
[sniffles]

488
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:27,009
Need a hand?

489
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:32,536
I called them just in case.

490
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:34,538
We want to help.

491
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:37,324
Thank you.

492
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:45,985
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
No corneal reflex.

493
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:52,905
No oculocephalic reflex.

494
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:07,006
Negative oculovestibular reflex.

495
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:09,356
Now I'm gonna test
her pain response.

496
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:11,967
She's not feeling any pain.

497
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,926
[Hundley crying]

498
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,928
Once I disconnect the vent,
we wait eight minutes

499
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,581
to see if she breathes.

500
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,854
[rapid beeping]

501
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:36,470
- Enough.
- You're a fall risk. Lie back.

502
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,168
- Give me my clothes.
- Why? You got a hot date
to get to?

503
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:40,866
- I want to go home.
- I'm not taking you home.

504
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:43,129
- Then I'll call a cab.
- I won't give you the phone.

505
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,261
I'd rather die at home
than in this hospital room.

506
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:50,179
Sweetheart, can't you just
let me go?

507
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:53,095
Don't sweetheart me,
you pain in my ass! [gasps]

508
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:57,534
[Gabe wheezing]

509
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:01,800
[Cherry whimpering]

510
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:10,678
CONRAD:
Everything okay?

511
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:14,987
[Cherry shudders]

512
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:18,555
Is it Nic?

513
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:25,345
[Cherry sighs deeply]

514
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:26,781
When Gabe was at his worst,

515
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:29,001
people would tell me
it was God's will.

516
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:31,568
-[scoffs]
- Or "The universe won't give you

517
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:33,527
more than you can handle."

518
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:35,181
They didn't mean any harm,

519
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:37,357
but they didn't make things

No, Mr. Nevin.
That is not what's happening.

540

of Nic's brain stem responses.

541
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:02,224
We had to confirm
her diagnosis.

542
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:03,704
What diagnosis? What?

543
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:04,923
Diagnosis?

544
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,103
I'm sorry. Nic is brain dead.

545
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,155
N-No, no. We... uh,
we saw her hand move earlier.

546
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:22,070
Conrad, tell them.
We saw it.

547
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,595

triggered by spinal reflexes.

you're a miracle worker.

552

in this damn hospital,

553
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,699
but you won't save her?

554

555
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:54,668

Her heart is beating
because of a machine.

556
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:57,410
Her lungs are inflating
because of a machine.

557
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,151
Fine, fine.

558
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,282
Then let them do their work.
J-Just go,

559
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:01,718
please, do your work.

560
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:02,893
I don't care if it takes
days or weeks

561
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:04,243
or months for her to wake up.

562
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,375

- She won't wake up.

563
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,073
Nic is gone.

00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:11,032
And being kept here,
hooked up like this--

565
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,513
that was her idea of hell, and
I'm not gonna do that to her.

566

Nexus Life does that for us.

579

But I insisted.

580
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,765
While nothing can compare
to your pain,

581
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:34,811
I hope you know
how much we all loved her.

582
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,944
I do know that.

583
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:40,165
She loved you.

I hope it will be
a comfort to you and GiGi

that Nic chose
to be an organ donor.

587
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:56,050
She'll be able
to save the lives

588
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,357

that her life-saving work
will continue.

If there is anything I can do...

596
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:26,211
This is what she wants.

on my surgery schedule
immediately.

603
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,296
He is a match for a donor

604
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:10,690
who can provide
a trachea replacement.

605
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,996
A trachea transplant?

606
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,477
We never knew
that was an option.

607

Oh, it wasn't. Until now.

opportunity for Gabe.

an end to his pain.

I don't know how to convince him
to have another surgery.

we ditch the tube?

for a quick fix.

625

breathing on your own again.

- What if it doesn't work?
- What if the sky falls?

Most importantly, Gabe,
what about your wife?

- Cherry knows my wishes.
- CHERRY: Don't fool yourself.

about giving up.
