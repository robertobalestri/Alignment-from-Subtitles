00:00:00,947 --> 00:00:03,486
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- I think I need to get back

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:06,451
to Minnesota 'cause my
MS could be progressing.

3
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:08,582
Whatever you need,
you just say the word.

4
00:00:08,607 --> 00:00:11,294
- They think I'm crazy.
- You'll see a psychiatrist.

5
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,225
And we'll move you
to a better place,

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,282
one that specializes in
postpartum depression.

7
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,876
I was hoping for some
kind of reprieve,

8
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,805
but the governor
didn't budge, so, yes,

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,582
we will be closing
the ER to trauma.

10
00:00:20,607 --> 00:00:22,315
That's awful. I
mean, can't we make

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,967
an emergency appeal
to the state assembly?

12
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:27,020
Our funding was always from the
governor's discretionary fund,

13
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:28,729
so we're completely
at his mercy.

14
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:31,669
I believe you and I joined
the same club today.

15
00:00:32,393 --> 00:00:33,960
We were too good for 'em.

16
00:00:33,985 --> 00:00:36,068
I don't love how we
got here, but I am

17
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:37,859

You know, taking Chastain

you know, it felt like
the beginning of the end.

And victory for Betz.

57
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:08,652
Still, at this rate
we're on the fast track

58
00:03:08,677 --> 00:03:10,228
to a total shutdown by spring.

59
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:14,794

The entire hospital is at risk.

60
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:17,930

How was your new treatment?

67
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:37,885
Oh, the muscle weakening has
lessened, so that's a win.

68
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,471
And, um, no tremors lately.

69
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:45,947
I'm your wife, Randolph.

70
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:47,918
I know when you're not
telling me something.

71
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:49,770
Oh, I just

72
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,090
you know, I should
take a beat before...

73
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,915
jumping back into surgery.

74
00:03:55,255 --> 00:03:57,147
The treatment. It didn't work.

75
00:03:57,172 --> 00:03:58,719
No, it did, it just...

76
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:02,049
Just a little less than before.

77
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:03,332
But we knew from the start

78
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:05,426
there'd be diminishing
returns, so...

79
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:07,639
Just need to make a new plan.

80
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:16,523
It's Dr. Feldman.
"Turn on the TV."

81
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:18,809
<i>We currently
have field reporters</i>

82
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,416
<i>on scene in Midtown.</i>

83
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:22,638
<i>Heavy rain and winds

84
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,159
<i>of a devastating

<i>at 13th and Piedmont.</i>

86
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:27,776
13th and Piedmont. That's a
couple blocks from Chastain.

87
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,233
<i>Again, we are getting
unconfirmed reports</i>

88
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:33,664
<i>that one of the passengers on
board was Governor Mark Betz.</i>

89
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:36,857
<i>- The governor's condition...</i>
- You can't be serious.

90
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:41,559
If it's that close, he'll
be taken to Chastain.

91
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:15,450
Copter crashed into the
café where she was working.

92
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:16,955
Her vitals?

93
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,403
Stable, GCS 14.

94
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:21,960
Okay. Mass casualty protocol.

95
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:24,283
Looks like a concussion
and second-degree burns.

96
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:25,335
Let's get her to Bay Two.

97
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,643
Hey, glad you're here. We
need all the help we can get.

98
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:31,489
Betz was in a helicopter crash.

99
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,586
- The governor?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,771
It's like musical
chairs around here.

101
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:41,986
How many so far?

102
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:43,694
Three ambo, two walk-ins.

103
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,469
Let's get the next one.

104
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,847
Thea Dwyer... the pilot. Blunt
trauma to chest and abdomen.

105
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:53,561
Prolonged extraction
time. Some lacerations.

106
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:56,551
Okay. Trauma Room 11.

107
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:00,355
Is he okay? Is
the governor okay?

108
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,233
All right, I'll go with
her, you get the next?

109
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:05,609
All right.

110
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:08,234
She put that bird down
in zero visibility.

111
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:09,758
Somehow avoided a school.

112
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:13,012
And the governor? Do we
know about his condition?

113
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:14,812
Not sure. He's in
the next ambulance.

114
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:16,627
Should be here any second.

115
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,473
Obvious tenderness
and bruising on her abdomen.

116
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:30,246
- Put me to work.
- Another 18-gauge IV.

117
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:31,351
One of hers just blew.

118
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:33,242
One immaculate IV,
coming right up.

119
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:37,920
How you feeling, Thea?

120
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:39,837
Like... I should've done more.

121
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,012
That's Betz, for sure.

122
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,246
Hey. You guys got this?

123
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,592
- Yeah.
- Go.

124
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:51,591
Listen. You did the best you
could in terrible weather.

125
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:54,706
And you know what? You
saved lives in the process.

126
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:04,585
Wait, wait, that...

127
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,536
This isn't Atlanta General!

128
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,645
Get me out of this place!

129
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:10,725
We're gonna take
good care of you.

130
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,416
Let's get a burn cart.

131
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:13,591
Governor, you
shouldn't be alone.

132
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:14,800
Is there anyone we can call?

133
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:16,639
Uh, just my office.

134
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:17,846
My daughter's at college.

135
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:21,682
My wife... my ex-wife
is in New Zealand.

136
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:23,561
One, two, three.

137
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,203
Oh, I bet you're loving this.

138
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:30,420
I most certainly am not.

139
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:32,514
Well, the sooner I'm
out of here, the better.

140
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,684
Rest assured my doctors will
give you the very best care.

141
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:37,779
Oh, come on. Who
are you kidding?

142
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:41,081
It's no secret how
you all feel about me.

143
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:43,189
I'm not about to give
you the chance to kill me

144
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,930
and call it complications.

145
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:48,140
We are professionals
with one goal:

146
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:50,200
caring for all our patients.

147
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:52,428
But we will do our best
to get you transferred

148
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:53,677
as soon as possible.

149
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:58,888
We'll try to get him
stable enough to move.

150
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:00,817
Can't happen fast enough.

151
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,276
Look, I don't want
any tests... Ow! Ow!

152
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:08,732
Possible broken clavicle.

153
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:11,544
EMTs say that he was briefly
unconscious at the scene.

154
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:13,793
Well, we'll have
to scan him when we can.

155
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:15,614
Chastain. It's some
kind of a joke.

156
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,916
Look, I-I told them
not to bring me here.

157
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:21,493
Somebody call my office!
Or-or bring me a phone!

158
00:08:21,518 --> 00:08:22,979
Hey, hey, hey.

159
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:25,935
Can we finish assessing
your injuries first?

160
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,497
We're gonna get you
stable, give you some pain meds.

161
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,783
And then we will talk
about that transfer.

162
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:36,068
Any chest pain?

163
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:38,717
Just when I breathe in deep.

164
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:40,979
Sounds like pleuritic pain
from the rib fracture.

165
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:43,229
- Maybe this was an overcall.
- No, definitely not.

166
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:44,943
Needs to be checked out.

167
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:46,787
Oh, thank God! Thea!

168
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:49,746
Mom. Dad. I-I'm okay. I'm okay.

169
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:51,540
What the hell were you doing
flying in this weather?

170
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,935
Why would the governor
risk your life?

171
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,648
I'm her dad Quentin Dwyer,
this is my wife Jane.

172
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:57,058
What do you know?

173
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,600
Well, actually, Dr. Sullivan
is the ER doctor,

174
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,733
and can explain.

175
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:02,742
Your daughter has
sustained some injuries,

176
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,727
but we're still
assessing the extent.

177
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,254
I couldn't climb. Must've
been that crosswind.

178
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:11,425
Her heart sounds good, but I'd
like a few more tests before...

179
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,810
- What kind of tests?
- This laceration's gonna need stitches at some point.

180
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:16,092
What's wrong with her heart?

181
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:18,246
Likely nothing. We just
want to be thorough.

182
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:19,466
I don't believe this.

183
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:21,044
You should have
never taken that job.

184
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:24,248
There was a crosswind.
I couldn't climb.

185
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:25,596
She just said that.

186
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:27,343
Thea, you just said that.

187
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:28,683
Is he here? The governor?

188
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,778
Because I'd like to give
him a piece of my mind.

189
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,472
I just don't like
how he treats you.

190
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:34,072
I-I couldn't climb...

191
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:36,439
What's happening?

192
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:39,245
- Thea?
- Grabbing an intubation kit.

193
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,247
Page Dr. Sutton
and clear the CT!

194
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,394
Hold the elevator.

195
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:49,642
I've got this.

196
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,810
Okay, uh, page if
you need me, okay?

197
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,605
Hey, is she
from the heli crash?

198
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,796
Yeah, she's the pilot.

199
00:09:57,821 --> 00:09:59,947
Her EKG was
intermittently arrhythmic.

200
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:01,434
I think it's related
to the head trauma.

201
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,498
She was oriented but
repeating herself,

202
00:10:03,523 --> 00:10:05,874
then became unconscious.
We needed to intubate.

203
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,563
CT should give answers.

204
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:10,255
Hey, uh, you believe
Governor Betz is here?

205
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,022
Oh, my guess is, he's
not too happy about it.

206
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,640
So, I hear, uh, you and
Billie called it quits.

207
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,758
Well, she called it.

208
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,783
You okay?

209
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:21,759
Uh, yeah, I-I'm good.

210
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:25,758
You know, I-I think, uh...

211
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,885
everybody ended up right
where they ought to be.

212
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:37,296
You're gonna need an
X-ray on that clavicle,

213
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:39,183
but of course you can get
that done at another facility

214
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:40,364
if you feel more comfortable.

215
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:41,388
Oh, so I can go?

216
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:42,596
No.

217
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,160
We need a CT so we can
rule out anything serious

218
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:47,015
from your head trauma.

219
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,426
You were unconscious
at the scene.

220
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:52,165
Well, sooner the better.

221
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,782
Well, unfortunately,
CT is all backed up.

222
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,958
Due to budget cuts, we're
a bit short-staffed.

223
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:58,308
Do you think I'm stupid?

224
00:10:58,614 --> 00:10:59,947
I know what's happening here!

225
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:02,012
You're-you're trying
to teach me a lesson!

226
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,455
Well, I don't have
to put up with it!

227
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,701
Now get me out of here now!

228
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:08,351
Get me my...

229
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:13,430
Ow.

230
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,621
ST elevation. He's
having a heart attack.

231
00:11:17,565 --> 00:11:18,839
All right, let's go.

232
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:20,714
Activate the cath lab.

233
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:33,179
It's hard to believe
anyone walked away from it.

234
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:35,112
She landed that helicopter
at the intersection

235
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:37,028
of 13th and Piedmont.

236
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:38,570
Can you imagine?

237
00:11:41,774 --> 00:11:43,216
Oh, no.

238
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:47,889
Multiple contusions.

239
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:50,177
Sulcal and cisternal effacement.

240
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,776
Swelling is severe already.
I'll book an OR. And you...

241
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:57,093
I know. Slam her with
diuretics, hyperosmolar therapy.

242
00:11:57,277 --> 00:12:00,428
I'll bring her up.
Thanks, Billie.

243
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:02,733
Of course.

244
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:22,836
Hey, Marko.

245
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:25,880
Whoa, you actually
answered this time.

246
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:27,427
I was not expecting that.

247
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:29,372
<i>I'm sorry,
work has been nuts,</i>

248
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:31,614
- and I've had some personal stuff to deal with.
<i>- Pravesh, please.</i>

249
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:33,648
I've been around long enough
to know when I'm being ghosted.

250
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:34,654
All right?

251
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,404
Just be straight with me.

252
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:39,957
You've lost interest in my
longevity aspirations, right?

253
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:42,159
<i>Listen, I've reviewed
the materials.</i>

254
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:44,427
And I just don't feel like
it aligns with my interests.

255
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:47,455
Y-You think it's bogus crap
and you're not a bogus doctor?

256
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,628
I'm not the right guy.

257
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:50,052
And you deserve someone
who's passionate,

258
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,556
and that isn't me.

259
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,069
<i>Look, sorry I have to go.</i>

260
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:56,307
But listen, good luck.

261
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:57,582
I am positive that you're gonna

262
00:12:57,606 --> 00:12:59,802
find the right
collaborator, okay?

263
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:02,770
Check it out.

264
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:05,636
- You made those?
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:07,674
Oh, they're adorable.

266
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,753
When did you get so
good at knitting?

267
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:11,428
They have a class
here. As therapy.

268
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:14,034
It's really, really relaxing.

269
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,204
Hey, will you give those to AJ?

270
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:21,022
To give to the boys from me?

271
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:22,848
Of course.

272
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:26,925
I really miss them.

273
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:29,648
Of course you do.

274
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:32,222
You'll see them soon.

275
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:37,520
AJ must regret this so
much, having babies with me.

276
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:39,845
Look, it has not
been easy, okay?

277
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,606
For either of you.

278
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:42,878
But if there's one
thing I know, it's that

279
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:44,383
AJ doesn't regret a thing.

280
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,444
Arjun and Elijah are the two
gifts he never even saw coming.

281
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,591
I hope when the boys are older,

282
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:57,949
they are for each other
what you are for me.

283
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,625
Everything.

284
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,876
His blood pressure is still
soft, despite the pressor.

285
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:13,148
I'm worried he's going
into cardiogenic shock.

286
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:14,768
Once we find the
lesion and open it up,

287
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,258
he should rebound.

288
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:20,119
Oh, wow, look at that.

289
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:21,696
Two prior stents.

290
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:24,222
Yeah, this isn't his
first heart attack.

291
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:26,414
None of this was on
his medical record.

292
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,825
I can't believe our
governor is not smart enough

293
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,750
to give us an honest
medical history.

294
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:34,735
Well, fake tough guys
like Betz are always afraid

295
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,738
that health problems
will make them look weak.

296
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:38,258
His pressure's still
dropping. Are we close?

297
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:41,100
I think I found it.
The culprit lesion.

298
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:45,127
Bingo. Obtuse marginal
branch in the circumflex.

299
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,723
That's a tiny vessel.

300
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:48,489
Opening something that small

301
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,018
won't improve his cardiac
function that much.

302
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,300
He'll still be
dependent on pressors.

303
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,522
Agreed. This man's heart was
in bad shape before the accident.

304
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:57,533
Yeah, he's lucky he
didn't arrest during the crash.

305
00:14:57,558 --> 00:14:59,293
All right, well, let's
open the vessel up

306
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:01,502
and see what else we can do.

307
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,111
We will have
an official statement

308
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,888
a little bit later in
the day, but for now

309
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:08,348
the cause of the accident

310
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:11,577
- is still under investigation, but we will be releasing...
- Dr. Sullivan.

311
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:13,544
- Hey.
- You're back.

312
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:14,397
Yeah.

313
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:16,625
How was, uh, your
trek across España?

314
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,200
Great, yeah, really something.

315
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:20,546
I've always wanted to do that.
I'd love to pick your brain

316
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,571
when you've recovered
from the jet lag.

317
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:25,022
- Sure, a-anytime.
- Yeah.

318
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:27,807
- Good to see you, Dr. Feldman.
- Likewise.

319
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,490
Considering
what he went through,

320
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:31,608
it's nothing less
than a miracle.

321
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:35,117
But the doctors expect him
to make a full recovery.

322
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,170
<i>However, he will be transferred</i>

323
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:40,240
<i>to a top-tier hospital for
the remainder of his care.</i>

324
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:41,500
<i>I can...</i>

325
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,003
She's selling
scrapes and bruises

326
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:45,018
when I just heard from
Raptor that the man

327
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:47,147
was a cardiac time bomb
even before the accident.

328
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:49,703
And if they're not honest
about his prior heart issues,

329
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:50,870
they may spin it

330
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:53,051
to make it look like we
withheld appropriate care.

331
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:55,036
We have got to get
him transferred.

332
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:56,877
But so far everyone is full.

333
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:01,492
And what we discovered
is that you've had two stents

334
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:02,867
and two prior heart attacks.

335
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:05,055
None of which appears
in your medical records.

336
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,448
Look, let me...

337
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:11,689
Let me make something clear.

338
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:14,659
Neither you nor anyone
else in this hospital

339
00:16:14,684 --> 00:16:18,611
are authorized to speak publicly
about my medical condition,

340
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:20,302
past or present.

341
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:26,104
Now, can you please check with
Dr. Voss about my transfer?

342
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:28,447
Yeah, that's not
going to be so easy, Governor.

343
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:30,812
We opened what we
could in the cath lab,

344
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:33,338
but your cardiac function
must've been bad from the start.

345
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:36,939
And right now your heart is
working only at ten percent.

346
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:43,060
Governor, your only hope for
survival is a heart transplant.

347
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:45,562
Your heart was
weak to begin with.

348
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,513
And now you're in heart failure.

349
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:50,284
The meds you're getting from
that big IV in your chest

350
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,508
are the only reason your heart

351
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:53,532
is beating strong enough
to keep you alive.

352
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:55,299
The only way you get on
the other side of this

353
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:57,048
is with a new heart.

354
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,243
We'll get you listed with UNOS,

355
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,525
the organ-sharing network,

356
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,079
but that's just the
start of the process.

357
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,172
Unfortunately you're sick
enough to need a new heart

358
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:05,082
but not sick enough to be
at the top of the list.

359
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:06,146
You're gonna have to wait.

360
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,617
How long?

361
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:10,493
Months, maybe longer.

362
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:12,179
What do I do all that
time? Wither away?

363
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:13,904
Well,
there are options.

364
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:16,024
We can get you out
of here with a VAD.

365
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:19,009
- Now, a VAD is...
- Yeah, yeah, I know what a VAD is.

366
00:17:19,034 --> 00:17:20,516
My dad had one.

367
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,968
Plugging it into a
wall socket at night.

368
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:25,291
Barely able to shower.

369
00:17:25,316 --> 00:17:26,148
It is an adjustment.

370
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:28,414
Yeah, but-but it
is not happening.

371
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:33,419
I am getting a new heart
and I'm not waiting.

372
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:35,810
I'm the governor,
for God's sake!

373
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,275
If you won't get me to the
top of the transplant list,

374
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,767
another hospital will.

375
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:49,618
- Hey.
- Hey.

376
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:51,346
Welcome back. We missed you.

377
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:52,720
Yeah, thanks, good to be missed.

378
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:55,062
- You got a minute?
- Yeah.

379
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:58,283
How's your immunotherapy
work progressing?

380
00:17:58,308 --> 00:17:59,610
If you mean the MS trial...

381
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:00,902
- Yeah.
- The phase one results

382
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:03,287
weren't conclusive but
promising enough where I'm still

383
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:06,813
a believer that targeting
the EBV-infected cells

384
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:08,596
is gonna have good results.

385
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,201
But how about phase two?

386
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:12,376
Clinically, we're ready to
launch, but as you know,

387
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:15,995
we don't have the money yet.
We're barely 50% funded.

388
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:17,779
You know, I'm working on it.

389
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,978
Okay, then.

390
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:23,179
Well, how are you holding up?

391
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:27,054
Uh, yesterday wasn't bad.

392
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,503
Today's good.

393
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:30,608
Tomorrow, I don't...

394
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,186
I'm...

395
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:36,392
I'm just trying to make
some smart choices about

396
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,318
my treatment moving forward.

397
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:42,328
But-but I feel...
I-I feel good today.

398
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:45,448
So... And I'm glad to be back.

399
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,749
Thanks for the assist.

400
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:25,107
No problem.

401
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:27,670
Those parents seem wrecked.

402
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:30,314
Can't imagine.

403
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:34,580
The primary issue is
doing the craniotomy

404
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:36,088
and trying to
reduce the swelling.

405
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:37,741
But after the kind
of accident she had,

406
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:39,156
there could be surprises.

407
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,181
Of course.

408
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:44,137
To be honest, based on the CT,

409
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:48,442
this surgery is a Hail
Mary. But we have to try.

410
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,078
Okay.

411
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:00,310
Removing the skull cap.

412
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:02,780
This should
relieve the pressure.

413
00:20:04,222 --> 00:20:07,486
All right, brain
looks good. Pulsatile.

414
00:20:07,511 --> 00:20:09,844
Wouldn't it be cool
to fly a helicopter?

415
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:11,469
Choppers terrify me.

416
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:13,978
But if this goes well, maybe
Thea will give you a lesson.

417
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:18,754
She's hypertensive
and bradycardic.

418
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:20,971
Pressure must be building again.

419
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:23,072
Her brain is herniating
out of her skull.

420
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:24,614
Could be a seizure.

421
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:25,885
Or fluid overload.

422
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:27,676
Let's give her more
mannitol, stat.

423
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,941
Re-dose furosemide and get
the head of the bed up higher.

424
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,455
Oh, she's getting worse.

425
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:38,516
What am I not seeing?

426
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:44,470
It's something we can't see.

427
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:46,065
- A bleed?
- On the other side of the brain.

428
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,810
I couldn't see it in CT
because of the swelling.

429
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:48,931
When the brain
was decompressed,

430
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:50,547
the bleed had room to expand.

431
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:52,947
We have to open up the
skull on the other side.

432
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,176
Let's get her turned over.

433
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:01,187
Hey. You're here.

434
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:02,562
Yeah.

435
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:05,341
- It's good to have you back.
- Thanks.

436
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:08,101
It's a little weird.

437
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:10,645
I'm sure.

438
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:12,791
Just take it slow.

439
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,889
Have you, um...

440
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,544
Have you seen Dr. Voss yet?

441
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:23,580
No. I may be stalling.

442
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:26,555
I have some explaining to do.

443
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:28,011
Got to come clean.

444
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:29,769
Well, that's brave.

445
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:32,496
And hard, I'm sure.

446
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:35,285
A part of me would
just like to resign.

447
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:38,888
Keep everything a secret,
go work somewhere else.

448
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,537
The minute I tell Voss, the...

449
00:21:42,397 --> 00:21:45,731
stigma of addiction
is on me forever.

450
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:48,666
Could end my career.

451
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:52,349
I'm sure people will understand.

452
00:21:52,772 --> 00:21:54,087
Hmm.

453
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,192
I did.

454
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:02,877
And that means so much to me.

455
00:22:05,394 --> 00:22:06,596
So...?

456
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:08,147
Will you tell her?

457
00:22:08,172 --> 00:22:11,359
I will. I need to.

458
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:13,138
Okay.

459
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,020
- Hey.
- Hey.

460
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,433
How was Padma?

461
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:33,419
It's hard to say.

462
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,831
She's doing better, for
sure, I'm just worried

463
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:38,358
about how it'll be
when she returns.

464
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,942
Right, well, we'll just
take it one day at a time.

465
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:48,565
I assisted Billie
with the pilot.

466
00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:50,464
It's not looking good.

467
00:22:51,044 --> 00:22:53,763
If she dies and the
governor lives...

468
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:55,583
When he made her
fly in bad weather.

469
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,346
That is so unfair.

470
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:59,353
It's just a rough day.

471
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,264
You know, we've just had
so many of those lately.

472
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:04,720
Why? What happened?

473
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:10,096
So, I was talking to
Bell about his MS.

474
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:14,933
And I think that he was hoping
I was gonna get him a spot

475
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,860
in the second phase
of the MS trial.

476
00:23:17,678 --> 00:23:19,407
But there is no phase two yet.

477
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:20,506
Right.

478
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,602
Hey, what about
that gazillionaire

479
00:23:23,627 --> 00:23:25,402
who wanted to live forever?

480
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:26,980
I thought he was willing
to underwrite it, right?

481
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:28,558
Yeah, but I became a
doctor to help sick people,

482
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:31,192
not rich people who can't
accept that they're mortal.

483
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:34,331
If you help Marko,
you might help Bell

484
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:36,575
and thousands of other
people suffering from MS.

485
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,669
And pretend to be
passionate about something

486
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:39,936
that I don't even care about?

487
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,627
Sure, why not?

488
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,242
If it's for the greater good.

489
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:50,075
You always make complicated
things seem simple.

490
00:23:50,665 --> 00:23:53,373
You always make simple
things complicated.

491
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,987
That's why we're a perfect fit.

492
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:01,326
Thank you.

493
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:10,101
How is she?

494
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:11,361
Was the surgery successful?

495
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:13,498
Mr. and Mrs. Dwyer,
this is Dr. Sutton.

496
00:24:13,523 --> 00:24:15,636
She's the neurosurgeon who's
been operating on Thea.

497
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:17,566
She's one of our best.

498
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:23,860
Your daughter had a significant
injury to her brain.

499
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:27,128
We were able to repair a bleed
and relieve the pressure.

500
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:30,713
The swelling has gone down and
she's out of immediate danger.

501
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:33,437
My poor baby.

502
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:36,399
She'll recover, though, right?

503
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:39,831
We won't really know
that for some time.

504
00:24:40,637 --> 00:24:44,328
Of course we will do
absolutely everything we can.

505
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:46,003
You mean she could die?

506
00:24:47,074 --> 00:24:49,116
I'm afraid it's possible.

507
00:24:57,065 --> 00:24:59,232
She's our only child.

508
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:02,020
Our everything.

509
00:25:02,843 --> 00:25:05,684
She flew Apaches in Afghanistan.

510
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:11,555
Two tours without a scratch.

511
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:15,496
We'd almost stopped
worrying about her.

512
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:20,170
All she ever wanted
was to serve, you know?

513
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:25,262
To fly and serve.

514
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:28,712
She seems like
an amazing young woman.

515
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:31,028
She is.

516
00:25:36,155 --> 00:25:38,182
Don't give up hope.

517
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:41,578
We won't either.

518
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,232
Come here.

519
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,837
So, I hear they were
unable to transfer you

520
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:58,372
due to lack of beds.

521
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:01,463
You know, all the ICUs
around town are full

522
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:03,709
because of the patients
we have to transfer

523
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:05,279
due to budget cuts?

524
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,418
That's correct.

525
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:12,521
But I have... a solution...

526
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:15,404
that solves both our problems

527
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:16,954
and keeps me here.

528
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:20,005
Okay, let's hear it.

529
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:24,970
I am willing to
save this hospital.

530
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:28,146
Restore the money
that's been cut.

531
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,146
From my discretionary fund.

532
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,275
Out of gratitude.

533
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,769
Gratitude.

534
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:44,532
My personal physician says...

535
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:47,835
that there are things
that you can do...

536
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,128
to move me to the
top of the UNOS list.

537
00:26:56,744 --> 00:27:01,380
But in exchange you are
offering to save Chastain?

538
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:03,887
Correct.

539
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:06,417
So what'll it take...

540
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:11,313
to lift me higher?

541
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:18,561
An intra-aortic balloon pump.

542
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:23,728
We take a catheter and we insert
a small balloon in your aorta.

543
00:27:23,753 --> 00:27:26,629
And it helps your
heart function.

544
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:28,058
Okay.

545
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:31,496
Are there risks?

546
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:33,021
Of course there are risks.

547
00:27:33,647 --> 00:27:37,608
The balloon could rupture,
causing damage to your aorta.

548
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:40,318
Your platelet count might fall,
which means you could bleed out.

549
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:42,994
But you've done this?

550
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:45,988
Plenty of times when it
was called for medically.

551
00:27:47,246 --> 00:27:48,246
And afterwards?

552
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:50,262
I'll be high on the list?

553
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:53,611
And could get a heart soon?

554
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,860
<i>I can't believe
you're entertaining this.</i>

555
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,859
Is he the person you want to
compromise your ethics for?

556
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:04,067
No, it's not about him, Hawkins.

557
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:06,943
But I-I think
about all the lives

558
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:09,954
we can save if we save Chastain.

559
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:13,005
Think about it. Every
hospital in Atlanta

560
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,681
will be strained to
the point of overwhelm

561
00:28:15,706 --> 00:28:18,524
if Chastain cannot provide
the care that we do.

562
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:21,180
You do realize bumping
Betz up the list

563
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:23,612
- knocks somebody else down.
- Yeah.

564
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,716
Yet I'm willing
to live with that.

565
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:28,794
You think it's worth it.

566
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:30,169
For the greater good? Yes.

567
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:32,383
And what happens when he doesn't
keep his end of the bargain?

568
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:33,832
We have leverage.

569
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:37,333
The secrets he's been keeping.
The multiple heart attacks.

570
00:28:37,358 --> 00:28:39,446
The stents he's had
implanted out of state,

571
00:28:39,471 --> 00:28:40,560
hidden from his own doctors.

572
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:42,884
Oh, so you just want to
throw blackmail into the mix?

573
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:44,241
Pretend we break HIPAA.

574
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:47,045
He goes back on his word,
there will be no pretending.

575
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,270
Look, I don't like any of it.

576
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:54,220
But we have a chance to
do a whole lot of good

577
00:28:54,245 --> 00:28:57,875
by doing just a little
bit of bad, right?

578
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,686
Come on, think about the Hawkins
who used to break all the rules.

579
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,839
Tell me what that guy would say.

580
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,435
He'd say go for it.

581
00:29:21,882 --> 00:29:24,232
Um, thanks for agreeing
to meet me, Marko.

582
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:28,593
Well, I was a little surprised
after the way you blew me off.

583
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,219
Yeah.

584
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:32,026
Well, after we spoke, um,

585
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:35,209
I wondered if I was
being inflexible.

586
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:37,798
So I took another look at
the data that you gave me,

587
00:29:37,823 --> 00:29:39,188
see if I missed anything.

588
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:40,615
- And did you?
- Yes.

589
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,780
Um, I came across a paper
that sort of blew my mind.

590
00:29:44,805 --> 00:29:48,110
It's from the Academy of
Health and Lifespan Research.

591
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:49,923
- Excellent resource.
- Yes.

592
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:54,553
And their work on gene therapy
made me wonder if aging...

593
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:56,874
could actually be a
reversible disease.

594
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:59,147
And wouldn't
that be something?

595
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,884
I mean, I would
love to be around

596
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:03,966
to meet my great-great-
grandchildren someday.

597
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:04,990
Who wouldn't?

598
00:30:05,015 --> 00:30:06,396
Right?

599
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:11,526
So, if you are still willing
to fund the second phase

600
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:13,484
of my clinical trial,
studying the relationship

601
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,168
between Epstein-Barr and MS...

602
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:17,026
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pravesh,
I already told you

603
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:19,266
I'm completely on board.

604
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:20,428
You're the one who, uh,

605
00:30:20,453 --> 00:30:22,039
couldn't stomach a
little bit of compromise

606
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:23,847
to make this happen.

607
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:26,206
But I like this new side of you.

608
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:31,583
I know you're still
on the fence, okay?

609
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:34,683
But I need you and you need me.

610
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,458
And there is nothing
wrong with that.

611
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:44,594
Dr. Sullivan. Ian.

612
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:46,835
Oh, I'm so sorry to
have kept you waiting.

613
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,188
- Yeah.
- It's been quite a day here.

614
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:52,977
Our three-ring circus has
added a few extra rings.

615
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,887
We squeaked by without you,
but I am so glad you're back.

616
00:30:58,267 --> 00:31:00,342
Not quite back yet.

617
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:05,111
I hope Texas Children's
hasn't made a play for you.

618
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:07,254
No, no,
nothing like that.

619
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:14,790
But I do feel an
obligation to tell you...

620
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,433
um... I have a...

621
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,205
I have a personal issue...

622
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,761
that I-I need to take care of.

623
00:31:26,786 --> 00:31:28,424
And I...

624
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:33,604
can't do that working the
way that... I used to work.

625
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:36,068
Oh, it's nothing
serious, I hope.

626
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:37,754
Do you want to work part-time?

627
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:38,779
No.

628
00:31:45,843 --> 00:31:46,858
I think I...

629
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:48,585
It's best I resign.

630
00:31:50,228 --> 00:31:54,499
Is this because we can't fund
the intrauterine surgery center?

631
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:56,361
No, it's not, n-nothing
to do with that.

632
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:59,443
I-I, I love it here. I-I
love being near my daughter.

633
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:01,963
The culture you've created,
it-it can't be beat.

634
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:05,576
But this private
issue, I-I don't...

635
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:09,775
I just don't see any
other way around it.

636
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:13,255
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

637
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,338
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

638
00:32:15,363 --> 00:32:18,653
I wish that there was. I do.

639
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,361
We've loved having you
here, Dr. Sullivan.

640
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:22,887
Thank you.

641
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,362
Likewise.

642
00:32:29,378 --> 00:32:32,971
Advancing the balloon
catheter over the guide wire.

643
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:37,227
And there we are, in
the descending thoracic aorta.

644
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:39,832
Just distal
to the subclavian.

645
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:40,992
Great positioning.

646
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:43,954
As high as possible above
the femoral bifurcation

647
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:47,096
and renal arteries, without
compromising blood flow.

648
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:48,949
Removing
the guide wire.

649
00:32:48,974 --> 00:32:50,774
Uh, just a question.

650
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,545
Uh, from the numbers,
I would have thought

651
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,979
he'd be a VAD candidate, no?

652
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:03,565
Well, you're
not wrong, but a VAD...

653
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,684
Was not the best
option in this case.

654
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,571
Well, because it wasn't the
right thing to do medically?

655
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:11,667
Or 'cause it wouldn't have

656
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:14,568
boosted him up on
the transplant list?

657
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,223
Believe me, we are conflicted.

658
00:33:20,482 --> 00:33:22,156
This wasn't just about Betz.

659
00:33:22,181 --> 00:33:23,464
Actually,
you know what?

660
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:25,975
Uh, I don't want to know.

661
00:33:26,074 --> 00:33:27,925
Attaching the pump console.

662
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:30,702
Initiate pumping.

663
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:37,713
All good. For now.

664
00:33:37,738 --> 00:33:40,600
I'll notify UNOS
where Betz stands.

665
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,669
Conrad, I need your help.

666
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:45,983
It's Thea, the pilot.

667
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:56,350
I thought the surgery went
well, but I'm having trouble

668
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,962
keeping her O2 sats up.

669
00:33:57,987 --> 00:33:59,748
If she dies of hypoxia,

670
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:02,070
then nothing I did in
surgery is gonna matter.

671
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:04,687
All right, well,
we'll figure this out.

672
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:09,697
It's the ICU.

673
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:21,761
I can't get her sats above 85

674
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:23,431
and her peak
pressures are rising.

675
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:25,435
Bilateral breath sounds? She
did have the rib fractures.

676
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:26,871
Pneumothorax was my
first thought too,

677
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:28,564
but she has lung sliding
on her ultrasound.

678
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:30,829
Okay, so no pneumo. Let's
get a portable chest X-ray.

679
00:34:30,854 --> 00:34:32,446
I called them twice,
they're short-staffed.

680
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,633
But her chest imaging
post-intubation was clear.

681
00:34:34,658 --> 00:34:37,320
- She has no history of asthma.
- And her resistance isn't high.

682
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:38,670
But her plateau is.

683
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:42,428
This is ARDS.

684
00:34:42,453 --> 00:34:43,785
Damn, you're right.

685
00:34:43,903 --> 00:34:46,458
Maybe she had an aspiration
event on her way to CT?

686
00:34:46,483 --> 00:34:48,038
Leading to
inflammation and ARDS.

687
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:50,168
So we start low tidal
volume ventilation.

688
00:34:50,193 --> 00:34:51,468
And we go up on the PEEP now.

689
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:52,751
But, Billie, this means...

690
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:54,413
I know. Deep sedation
and paralytics.

691
00:34:54,438 --> 00:34:57,303
We will not be able to
monitor her neuro status.

692
00:34:58,636 --> 00:34:59,836
If we can't get her sats up,

693
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:01,986
there'll be no neuro
status to monitor.

694
00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:03,996
Let's do it.

695
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:17,777
I just got off
the phone with UNOS.

696
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:20,300
Governor Betz has been
moved to the top of the list

697
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:21,500
for a heart transplant.

698
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:27,203
I'd like an explanation.

699
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:30,513
Well, we performed a balloon
pump procedure on the governor

700
00:35:30,538 --> 00:35:32,780
to assist with his
cardiac functioning.

701
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:35,698
A procedure he did
not actually need

702
00:35:35,723 --> 00:35:37,610
but conveniently
moved him up the list.

703
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,515
Yeah, well, we don't
make the rules.

704
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:43,750
I agree with the decision.

705
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:46,640
And the procedure
was successful.

706
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,812
Do you know what this means?

707
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:52,211
The pilot who may
be about to die

708
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,928
because Betz made her
fly in unsafe conditions,

709
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,835
could end up giving
him her heart.

710
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,652
Thea is still hanging
on in the ICU.

711
00:35:58,677 --> 00:35:59,804
We're not giving up on her.

712
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:01,663
And the procedure
on the governor

713
00:36:01,688 --> 00:36:04,263
was part of a compromise
that will benefit us all.

714
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:05,675
And how would that be?

715
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,755
Betz agreed to unlock the
money we need to save Chastain.

716
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:16,187
He's going to restore the money
from his discretionary fund?

717
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:17,302
If he gets a heart.

718
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:19,285
And survives the transplant.

719
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,077
You'd better move heaven and
earth to keep Thea alive.

720
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:38,391
You're still here?

721
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:42,747
Yeah. Didn't want to leave yet.

722
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:45,038
Me, too.

723
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,115
Any sign?

724
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:49,387
No.

725
00:36:50,686 --> 00:36:52,333
How are they doing?

726
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,410
What you'd expect.

727
00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:58,118
They're strong.

728
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:05,061
You were good today.

729
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,859
Thanks.

730
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:17,080
Lost a lot of patients
the last few...

731
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:21,636
I was starting to feel like I
couldn't help anyone anymore.

732
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:28,341
Not sure why I pinned
my hopes on Thea.

733
00:37:29,891 --> 00:37:32,791
It's hard to predict which
patients we'll get attached to.

734
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:41,337
But, you know, a lady chopper
pilot is pretty badass.

735
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:44,493
Says the resident badass.

736
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:52,543
Dr. Sullivan, Dr. Sutton.
Her eyes opened. Come quick!

737
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:18,124
You didn't have to wait for me.

738
00:38:19,537 --> 00:38:21,103
I wanted to.

739
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:29,887
What's wrong?

740
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:32,660
I met with Marko.

741
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:35,183
And I signed on to
participate in his research.

742
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:38,255
And secured funding for
phase two of my trial.

743
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:41,392
What? That's incredible.

744
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:43,142
Congratulations.

745
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,132
But you're not happy?

746
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:50,230
I just, you know...

747
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:52,552
I feel like a con man.

748
00:38:52,577 --> 00:38:57,249
Faking enthusiasm for something
I really don't even care about.

749
00:38:57,274 --> 00:38:59,822
- Did you make promises you can't deliver?
- No.

750
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:01,492
Then you're not a con man.

751
00:39:01,525 --> 00:39:03,133
Did you tell Bell?

752
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:06,066
- Yeah.
- Was he happy?

753
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,561
Thrilled.

754
00:39:10,669 --> 00:39:12,916
Well, I call that a win.

755
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:19,354
You know...

756
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,760
I don't know how I ever
managed without you.

757
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,602
I'm serious.

758
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:32,770
You came here all
those years ago, and...

759
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:35,676
you changed my life.

760
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:44,064
I love you, Leela Devi.

761
00:39:46,815 --> 00:39:50,429
I love you, too, Devon Pravesh.

762
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:00,655
Hey. What happened?

763
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:02,701
You're leaving?

764
00:40:03,596 --> 00:40:05,988
I couldn't tell Kit the truth.

765
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,678
I'm sorry, Cade, but it would
mean giving up my career.

766
00:40:08,703 --> 00:40:11,616
And I can only take
so much at one time.

767
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,724
I understand. I'm sorry.

768
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:16,266
I'm heartbroken.

769
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:19,431
I've loved being here with you.

770
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:23,119
And I hope that w-we can...

771
00:40:25,516 --> 00:40:27,423
Anyhow, for what it's worth,

772
00:40:27,902 --> 00:40:31,283
I think some time off may
be what I need anyway.

773
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,798
But I'm gonna make it up to you.

774
00:40:33,915 --> 00:40:36,691
Everything I've done,
every way I've hurt you.

775
00:40:36,716 --> 00:40:38,575
Look, that's in the past.

776
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,483
I'm proud of you.

777
00:40:45,158 --> 00:40:47,375
Not near as proud
as I am of you.

778
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:55,536
I'll call you tomorrow.

779
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:58,174
Yes, and the day after.

780
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:10,512
Hey.

781
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:21,942
It's so exciting. For
Devon and for you.

782
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:24,774
When will phase two start?
Is he sure you qualify?

783
00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:26,856
He says I meet all the
criteria for the trial

784
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:28,064
and says he's ready to go.

785
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:30,513
It's incredible news.

786
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:35,883
Wow, that was fast.

787
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:36,807
What's that?

788
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:40,546
There's been a motorcycle
accident outside of Macon.

789
00:41:40,571 --> 00:41:43,331
UNOS may have a heart
for the governor.

790
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,739
I just can't believe,
after everything that jerk

791
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:51,449
put us through, we're
gonna save his life.

792
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:55,367
Well, he still has to
survive the surgery.

793
00:41:55,392 --> 00:42:00,029
But, yes, it's what we
do. And I'm proud of that.

794
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:06,055
Well, I just hope we don't come
to regret this deal we've made.

795
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,198
You and me both, Randolph.

796
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:12,824
- So Thea's going to make it?
- Yeah.

797
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:14,007
That's incredible.

798
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,018
I know. I can't
quite believe it.

799
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:19,781
Bye, Ms. Jordan! Bye, Max!

800
00:42:20,178 --> 00:42:21,975
Ah! Come here, you.

801
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,944
Daddy, are we
going to start decorating

802
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,648
for my birthday
when we get home?

803
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:29,178
Yup. Right after dinner.

804
00:42:29,203 --> 00:42:31,258
You know, now that you're
going to be such a big girl,

805
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,217
pretty soon you're gonna have
to leave the kindergarten here

806
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:34,301
and go to first grade.

807
00:42:34,326 --> 00:42:35,717
I want to go to first grade.

808
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:37,601
But first my birthday party.

809
00:42:37,626 --> 00:42:39,092
Okay, birthday girl.

810
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:41,000
And Sammie. When
does she get here?

811
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,251
Hmm. Sammie and her dads, hey,

812
00:42:44,276 --> 00:42:46,276
they're on a plane
right this minute.

813
00:42:46,301 --> 00:42:47,848
I'm so excited!

814
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,583
Honey, you okay?

815
00:43:04,135 --> 00:43:07,052
My tummy. It's hurting.

816
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,903
A lot.

817
00:43:08,928 --> 00:43:10,260
She has a fever.

818
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:13,229
Maybe the flu, right?
