1
00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:01,961
<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

2
00:00:01,986 --> 00:00:03,170
I really am sorry.

3
00:00:03,195 --> 00:00:04,619
Don't be. Just so you know,

4
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:07,369
Hawkins never said, "I
love you," not once.

5
00:00:07,394 --> 00:00:09,672
The treatment... it didn't work?

6
00:00:09,697 --> 00:00:12,732
Oh, it did, just a
little less than before.

7
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:15,862
Your only hope for survival is
a heart transplant, Governor.

8
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:18,296
Move me to the top
of the UNOS list.

9
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:19,792
Betz agreed
to save Chastain.

10
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:22,649
- If he gets a heart.
- And survives the transplant.

11
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:25,150
- You're leaving?
- I couldn't tell Kit the truth.

12
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:27,008
I can only take so
much at one time.

13
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,067
Sammie. When does she get here?

14
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:30,418
They're on a plane
right this minute.

15
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:31,977
Honey, are you okay?

16
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:37,930
- Maybe up more?
- How's that?

17
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,521
A little more.

18
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:41,574
- Okay.
- Perfect.

19
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:43,632
Good.

20
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:46,878
Who knew six-year-olds
were so bossy?

21
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:48,731
The woman
knows what she wants.

22
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,859
Hey, since you
only turn six once,

23
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:56,779
I got you a very special
something for your party.

24
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:59,638
He looks just like Mr. Giraffe!

25
00:00:59,663 --> 00:01:02,295
But bigger. So big!

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,911
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

27
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,769
I love you, Billie.

28
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:08,203
I love you, too.

29
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:11,288
And I can't wait to show
Sammie when she gets here.

30
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:13,088
Yes!

31
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:16,088
Wait till she sees what they
do to get that candy out

32
00:01:16,113 --> 00:01:18,722
- of Mr. Giraffe's big brother.
- Oh.

33
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:23,676
Excuse me.

34
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,385
Don't let me stop you.

35
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,667
Kiss him again!

36
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:29,188
- Again, she says.
- Oh, again, yeah.

37
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:34,222
Wow. Okay.

38
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:35,609
It's Bell.

39
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:39,222
- All right. Oh.
- Hope you're not calling

40
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:40,648
to bail on Gigi's
birthday party.

41
00:01:40,673 --> 00:01:42,527
I got a pretty pink party
hat with your name on it.

42
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:44,580
Yeah, uh, about that. I-I
know it's your day off,

43
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,845
but we have an emergency.

44
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,019
<i>- Not Betz.</i>
- No, the governor's fine.

45
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:50,160
He's, uh... His donor
heart's on the way.

46
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:52,153
But it's-it's Sammie.

47
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:59,293
What's wrong?

48
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:00,553
Well, she got sick
on the flight here,

49
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,340
and Jake and Gregg
thought it was the flu,

50
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:04,509
but she woke up far worse, and
they had to call an ambulance.

51
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:08,988
So, given her medical
history, you can imagine.

52
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,854
Yeah, you're terrified.

53
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,281
I'll be right there.

54
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:16,378
- That looks really good.
- Daddy, what's wrong?

55
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,646
Sammie got sick on the
plane. I have to go see her.

56
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,801
I'm coming.

57
00:02:19,826 --> 00:02:21,674
- Let me get my nursing kit!
- Uh, no, honey.

58
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,267
Why don't we stay here
and wait for news?

59
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,202
Might not be serious.

60
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:31,497
The donor
was a young male

61
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:34,635
with an addiction to motorcycles
and a resistance to helmet laws.

62
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,981
But I'm told the organ
survived the accident

63
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:39,315
in pristine condition,
and it's a perfect match.

64
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,016
Uh, when do we do this?

65
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,540
He's prepped and ready to go.

66
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:44,449
Then we're headed to the OR now.

67
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,030
- Got your text.
- Hey, it's go time.

68
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:48,188
Let's scrub in.

69
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:53,971
I'll meet Sammie's ambulance.

70
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,165
I have to deal with
Betz, but don't panic.

71
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,402
- It could just be a bad flu.
- I know, I know, but Jake's a doctor.

72
00:02:58,427 --> 00:03:00,314
He would know if
it wasn't serious.

73
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:02,005
Keep me posted.

74
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,631
I'll be there as soon as I can.

75
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,582
You're in great hands. I'll
see you on the other side.

76
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,253
I'm counting on it.

77
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:27,627
We kept our end of the bargain.

78
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,895
I want to hear, on
your word of honor,

79
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,488
that you will do the same.

80
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:38,424
Save my life, and I
will save this hospital.

81
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,910
You have my word.

82
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:18,002
- How's she doing?
- Decompensating by the minute.

83
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:20,077
- Glad you're here.
- Look. Honey, it's Grandpa.

84
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:21,504
Hey, sweetie.

85
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,983
Don't worry. We've got
you. We've got you.

86
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:26,088
- Status?
- Ten-year-old female

87
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:28,849
presenting with fever over
104 and flu-like symptoms.

88
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:30,589
- Sats over 80.
- She spiked a high fever

89
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:32,710
last night, became nauseous
and started vomiting.

90
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:33,992
Then she had trouble breathing.

91
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:37,412
Okay, Trauma Bay Ten. Hundley,
we need you and Irving.

92
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,448
We'll update you.

93
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,778
Okay. On my
count. One, two,

94
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:48,891
three.

95
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:52,448
Hey, sweetheart, how you doing?

96
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:55,307
Gigi's birthday party.

97
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:57,981
No one's having a
party without you.

98
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,365
Cross my heart.

99
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,631
- Let's get labs and an ABG.
- You got it.

100
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:06,126
- Airway's intact.
- Absent breath sounds on the left.

101
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:08,065
- Pneumothorax.
- We'll need to decompress it.

102
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,176
- I'll get an ultrasound.
- Okay, I'll order a stat chest X-ray.

103
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,283
- Hundley, will you please?
- I'll prep the chest tube.

104
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:13,686
Sammie, your lung's collapsed.

105
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,167
But we're going
to do a procedure

106
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:17,638
that's gonna help you
feel better, okay?

107
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:18,929
Uh-huh.

108
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,396
I came as quickly as I could.

109
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,254
Oh, Jake.

110
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,112
- Gregg.
- Hi.

111
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:33,359
Where's Sammie?

112
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:35,551
She's with Conrad and
Devon in the trauma room.

113
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:38,066
- Do they know what's wrong?
- Not yet.

114
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,069
What's the update on Betz?

115
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:42,700
The heart arrived.
He's already in the OR.

116
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:46,188
I have to brief the press,
but I'll be right back.

117
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,822
Please.

118
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:06,104
Governor Betz is in surgery.

119
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:09,631
Our best team is performing a
heart transplant as we speak.

120
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:12,720
We have every reason to expect
a good outcome. Thank you.

121
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:24,366
Extending the incision towards
the mitral valve annulus.

122
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,687
Great. Now,

123
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:31,456
removing the cold...

124
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:34,240
I mean old heart.

125
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:35,522
Ready for the donor.

126
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:37,196
All right.

127
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:38,536
Here we go.

128
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:40,302
Oh, looks pristine.

129
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:42,385
No evidence of valvular disease

130
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,319
or damage from the accident.

131
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,257
This is
pretty terrifying.

132
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:50,143
We have two lives
in our hands today.

133
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:52,149
The governor's and Chastain's.

134
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:54,937
Some people, when
the pressure is on...

135
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:58,159
They wish anybody would step
in and take their place.

136
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,515
Me? I prefer the
Michael Jordan approach.

137
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:04,505
You're gonna have to
elaborate on that.

138
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,242
Michael had no fear.

139
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:07,940
If he was in a game,

140
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:10,545
and what was needed for
a win was a three-pointer

141
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,830
from mid-court, a
nearly impossible shot,

142
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:18,116
he would demand that ball and
never wonder if he'd miss.

143
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:20,467
I'd like to be like that.

144
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:22,612
Well, then be Jordan.

145
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:29,008
Hey, sweetie. You
feeling better?

146
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,294
- A little.
- We love you, honey.

147
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,223
You are very brave.

148
00:07:33,248 --> 00:07:34,418
You're admitting her?

149
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:38,149
Yes, but the good news is,
her BP and sats have come up.

150
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:40,114
Temp's still a
little high, but we were able

151
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,030
to reinflate her lung.

152
00:07:42,055 --> 00:07:44,648
- How is she?
- I didn't want to mention this

153
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,621
to Jake and Gregg just
yet, but we did a CT scan.

154
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:53,124
And it's not great.

155
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:55,527
You better
come have a look.

156
00:07:55,552 --> 00:07:57,244
I have it right over here.

157
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,914
So it wasn't just
a collapsed lung.

158
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:13,836
She's got an effusion.

159
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:17,116
We'll need to drain the
fluid and send it to the lab.

160
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:19,810
And given
Sammie's history,

161
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:22,557
there's a strong possibility
that her cancer has come back.

162
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:25,544
Look, obviously,

163
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:27,627
we want it to be anything else,

164
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,981
and we will keep searching.

165
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,365
But there aren't
many other reasons

166
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,408
to explain a
spontaneous pneumothorax

167
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:37,436
and pleural effusion in
a child of Sammie's age.

168
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,137
Just give us a minute.

169
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:46,881
Okay, let's not panic.

170
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,814
Let's think this through.

171
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,007
How am I going to break
this to Jake and Gregg?

172
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,940
Oh, this child,

173
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:56,878
this precious child...

174
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:00,405
- We don't know that it's cancer yet.
- Yeah, right.

175
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,759
The first step, the obvious
one... we need pediatric help.

176
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:05,960
Well, after the cuts
Betz forced us to make,

177
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:08,244
that entire department's
been on life support.

178
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:10,796
And we just lost our
best pediatric surgeon.

179
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:16,424
She's my granddaughter.
We got to get Ian back in here.

180
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:25,116
Thank you for agreeing
to be my sponsor, Wade.

181
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,731
I'm happy to do it.

182
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:28,067
I'll take all the
help I can get.

183
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,405
I'd like
you to make a list

184
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,838
and identify your triggers.

185
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:35,002
Things you see or do that
make you want to use.

186
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:38,649
Avoiding them is an essential
component of relapse prevention.

187
00:09:38,674 --> 00:09:40,841
Well, my biggest
trigger is stress.

188
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,970
I treat sick kids.

189
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:46,442
Families come to me for help at
the worst moment of their lives,

190
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,169
and I'm supposed
to be the savior,

191
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:50,340
make their children better
and never break a sweat,

192
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:53,672
but not every
child can be fixed.

193
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,314
Do you have a plan for how to
deal with this without drugs?

194
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:01,949
I've taken a leave of
absence to reassess.

195
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:03,677
Trying to figure
out if the truth is

196
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:07,354
that my work will always
threaten my recovery.

197
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:09,099
Well, are you searching
for coping mechanisms?

198
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:10,892
Well, the drugs were
my coping mechanism.

199
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:13,789
The only ones that
worked, but now,

200
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,314
I'm facing the
awful question of,

201
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:18,151
am I gonna have to
find a different way

202
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,194
to make a living,
which is something

203
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,650
I can't even contemplate,
because I... I love what I do.

204
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:26,962
Medicine is literally my life,
and I am very good at it.

205
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:30,716
Even loaded, I was better than
99% of the doctors in my field.

206
00:10:30,741 --> 00:10:32,765
That's a dangerous way to think.

207
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,177
In Nar-Anon, it's known
as "Euphoric Recall,"

208
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,036
the tendency to romanticize
your drug use -

209
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:42,342
while conveniently forgetting
all the harm it caused.

210
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:46,982
- I have to take this.
- No problem.

211
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:49,774
Hello, Kit.

212
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,823
I'm... I'm really sorry to
hear that. That's awful.

213
00:10:57,848 --> 00:11:00,020
I-I would like to help,
Kit, I really would,

214
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:01,972
but I don't think that I can.

215
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:10,323
Okay. I'm coming in.

216
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:14,939
Now remove the
aortic cross clamps.

217
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:17,372
Give it a couple seconds for
his new heart to kick in.

218
00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:19,009
Moment of truth.

219
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,298
Nothing.

220
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:26,501
Paddles to me. Ten joules.

221
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,095
Clear.

222
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:35,139
Increase the charge to 20.

223
00:11:35,563 --> 00:11:37,304
Let's try it again.

224
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:40,319
Charging. Clear.

225
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:43,408
Maybe we're missing something.

226
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:45,095
We've rechecked the electrolyte.

227
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,200
It's not the potassium.

228
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:48,259
All right, give him
a dose of magnesium

229
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:49,565
and lidocaine. We'll
give it one last shot.

230
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:52,401
Charging.

231
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:54,599
Clear.

232
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:09,255
Normal sinus!

233
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,371
MJ for the win with
two seconds left.

234
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:21,414
I think these elephants would
look nice over the windows.

235
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:24,425
Sammie's my best friend.

236
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:28,344
I know, sweetie.

237
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:31,693
I want to go to the
hospital to be with her.

238
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,316
She needs me.

239
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:39,584
Okay, why don't you keep
coloring these hearts for me?

240
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,229
Conrad, what's going on?

241
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,271
Waiting on Sammie's labs.

242
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:48,797
Just hoping her cancer
hasn't come back.

243
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:50,342
Oh, no.

244
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,217
<i>How is Gigi?</i>

245
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,855
Oh, she's fine, but she
keeps saying she wants

246
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,419
to go to Chastain, you
know, to be with Sammie.

247
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,282
<i>I'll try and keep her
busy. Keep me updated.</i>

248
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:01,505
Will do.

249
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:10,877
I'm Dr. Ian Sullivan.

250
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:13,669
Dr. Voss asked me to consult
on your daughter's case.

251
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:15,659
Of course. We know you
by your reputation.

252
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:18,079
Thank you so much for
coming in. I'm Jake.

253
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:20,891
And I'm Gregg. We are
so glad you're here.

254
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,535
If anyone can save her...

255
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,466
Honestly, we just
have so much faith.

256
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,208
An-And trust in you.

257
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,088
And this must be Sammie.
How are you feeling?

258
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,213
Not so great.

259
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,041
But I think, now
that you're here,

260
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:41,084
I'll start to feel better soon.

261
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:46,939
Okay, Sammie.

262
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:50,514
I am going to listen to your
lungs and then your heart.

263
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,169
Okay. That's it. Take
a deep breath for me.

264
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:56,444
Sorry.

265
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,711
- That-that wasn't really good.
- No, you're doing just fine.

266
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:02,792
Okay.

267
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:05,581
Now I am going to press
on your belly, okay?

268
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:07,913
- My belly doesn't hurt.
- Oh, that's good.

269
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,023
Okay, princess, you sit tight.

270
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:13,198
If anything gets worse,

271
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:14,980
or if something new
starts to bother you,

272
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:17,488
I want you to press
that red button, okay?

273
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,352
And then I'd come running.

274
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:24,165
Thank you for coming
in so quickly.

275
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,071
Of course. She's a heartbreaker.

276
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:28,832
Have you seen Sammie's
medical history?

277
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:30,819
I'm about to take a deep dive
into all that immediately.

278
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:34,216
- I just did a brief exam.
- Do you think it's cancer?

279
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:37,566
Fear of a recurrence
is understandable,

280
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:39,485
but it could be a host
of different things.

281
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,426
The effusion could be
secondary to an infection,

282
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:44,268
which would fit with
the low-grade fever.

283
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:45,792
I'll order more cultures.

284
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:48,368
- Thank you.
- Sit tight.

285
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:58,339
Strong pressure,
normal heart sound.

286
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,864
Limited mediastinal output. We
can put these to water seal.

287
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:02,813
At this rate, we can
clamp the tubes tomorrow.

288
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:04,662
I'll order another chest X-ray.

289
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,137
Translation?

290
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:08,587
Your new heart is
functioning well, Governor.

291
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:13,054
Ah. Oh. Is...?

292
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,814
Is-is... is this pain normal?

293
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:18,466
BP 60/40.

294
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:19,906
- He's in shock.
- No signs of obstruction

295
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:22,169
in the chest tube. Unlikely
to be a tension pneumo.

296
00:15:22,194 --> 00:15:24,171
The valves sound good.
He's still in sinus.

297
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:25,858
- Crank up the norepi.
- Add vaso.

298
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,175
And start vanc and cefepime.

299
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,781
We need an ultrasound
in here now!

300
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:36,239
- Hey.
- What's going on?

301
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:37,882
I thought you resigned.

302
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:39,654
I'm here at Dr. Voss's request

303
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,439
to consult on Bell's
granddaughter's case.

304
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:45,071
- A consult only?
- Yes, I promise.

305
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:46,696
If they end up
needing a surgeon,

306
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:47,957
I'll help them find a good one.

307
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:50,241
Well, what if
there's an emergency?

308
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:52,170
Then I'll tell Kit everything.

309
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,621
Everything? Including
how you were using here?

310
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:56,859
Yes. I would rather
avoid it, but I will.

311
00:15:56,884 --> 00:15:58,646
Would you like to be a witness?

312
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:02,445
Dad, it's just, you've
come such a long way,

313
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,119
and this commitment
to honesty...

314
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:05,701
I haven't had to be honest yet.

315
00:16:05,726 --> 00:16:08,059
I wouldn't say there's
anything too admirable.

316
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:09,967
But unless you object,

317
00:16:09,992 --> 00:16:11,680
I'd like to stay, as
long as there's a chance

318
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,288
I can help that sweet
kid and her family.

319
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,492
Of course.

320
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:19,248
Let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

321
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:20,655
All right.

322
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:27,355
Oh. Does Sammie have a visitor?

323
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,632
Conrad thought it might not
be a good idea, but she...

324
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,657
I said I had to come.

325
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:32,973
I couldn't refuse her.

326
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:37,185
Okay. Well, I think you may be

327
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,414
just the person Sammie needs.

328
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:50,422
Sammie's been asleep for a bit.

329
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:53,140
Jake and Gregg just took the
chance to get us some food.

330
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,804
Gigi.

331
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:10,878
Birthday.

332
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:13,920
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

333
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,351
We'll have a party
when you're all better.

334
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:18,854
For now, just sleep.

335
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:20,563
I'll be right here.

336
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:24,629
She is just like her mother.

337
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:28,658
I feel like I just saw Nic.

338
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,543
Cardiac index is marginal,
even on pressors.

339
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:38,850
Steroids are not
improving contractility.

340
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,749
His heart's only getting worse.

341
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,249
- Let's intubate.
- Yeah.

342
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:44,671
That'll offload some of the
pressure on his left ventricle

343
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,178
and buy us some more time.

344
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:47,686
Labs are back.

345
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:49,529
Antibody testing is
completely negative.

346
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:51,002
So rejection is
extremely unlikely.

347
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,833
But if he's not rejecting
the transplanted heart,

348
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:53,786
then what is it?

349
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,748
Rechecking his echo.

350
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:01,514
It's subtle.

351
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,705
Apical wall akinesis,

352
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:07,139
- hyperdynamic septum.
- Stress cardiomyopathy.

353
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:09,515
Something else in his body
is causing his heart to tank,

354
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,079
and we got to figure
out what it is fast.

355
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,184
I got this.

356
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:25,557
- Hey.
- Labs and pleural fluid are back.

357
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,339
There are no malignant cells.

358
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:29,387
So it's not cancer.
Did you hear that?

359
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:30,572
The cancer hasn't returned.

360
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:32,354
That's great news.

361
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,599
But if it's not cancer,
then what is it?

362
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:36,123
She's having trouble breathing.

363
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:40,059
We have to know what's
wrong to treat it.

364
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:44,508
I'll be back.

365
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:49,857
Hey, just the guy
I'm looking for.

366
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:51,592
Same here.

367
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:56,517
So, we've effectively ruled
out rejection for Betz.

368
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,909
And we've ruled out
cancer for Sammie.

369
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:00,620
Infectious studies?

370
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:02,398
Blood cultures
are negative so far.

371
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:04,572
Same here. Galactomannan
and glucan?

372
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:06,789
Pending, but Sammie
is not a likely host

373
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:07,997
for a fungal infection.

374
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:09,716
Neither is Betz.

375
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,383
Maybe I should just
add micafungin.

376
00:19:13,408 --> 00:19:16,523
All right, so his
pressure's getting worse.

377
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:19,382
What if it's not vasodilatory?

378
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:22,627
How about obstructive
shock or pneumothorax?

379
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:24,589
And tamponade. Ruled out.

380
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:26,655
I thought about adrenal
insufficiencies.

381
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,291
But you've given him a
slug of steroids anyway.

382
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:31,650
Which is about the only thing
you haven't given Sammie.

383
00:19:31,675 --> 00:19:33,296
I'm still thinking
infectious is possible

384
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:35,641
despite the negative
fluid studies.

385
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,775
Considered autoimmune?

386
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,199
ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid
factor are all in lab.

387
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:43,632
But you don't want
to empirically treat?

388
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:46,047
Not with the concern
for infection.

389
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:48,779
We got nothing.

390
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:54,652
You know what?

391
00:19:56,137 --> 00:20:00,295
You taught me, from my
very first day at Chastain,

392
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:03,427
that if the answer isn't
on these white boards...

393
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,680
Go back to the patient
and the physical exam.

394
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:10,922
Have I ever told you, you were
the best intern I ever had?

395
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:13,901
Well, I had the best teacher.

396
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:18,660
Nearly maxed on epi drip.

397
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,015
Repeat labs are back.

398
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:24,146
His lactate is sky-high.

399
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:26,693
Not a surprise. He's been
hypotensive for hours.

400
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:30,143
Wait. The lactate isn't the
result of the hypotension.

401
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,317
It's a clue about the cause.

402
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,861
Right. Right.

403
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:39,236
We've been so
focused on the heart.

404
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,142
What if...?

405
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:44,014
Distended abdomen.

406
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,043
It's barely noticeable,
but I think you're right.

407
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:47,845
- He has bowel ischemia?
- Yup.

408
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,279
- That explains the shock.
- And the heart failure.

409
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:52,712
We'll need to take him to CT
to confirm, but if we're right,

410
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:54,145
he'll have to go back to the OR.

411
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,262
I'll page Bell.

412
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:01,085
Just take a few deep
breaths for me, Sammie.

413
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:04,555
Why is her tongue red?

414
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:10,635
Lean back for me, Sammie.

415
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,959
Open up and say "aah," okay?

416
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:14,575
Aah.

417
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:18,810
Strawberry tongue.

418
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:21,906
- She has Kawasaki disease.
- That would explain

419
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,203
the fever and the
flu-like symptoms.

420
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,150
Now we can treat it.

421
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:26,521
Let's start her on IVIG.

422
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,465
That's-that's great news.

423
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,232
I can't believe it.
Um, AJ needs me.

424
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,909
It's Betz. Got to go.

425
00:21:41,496 --> 00:21:43,751
- Sammie, what's wrong?
- Must be some kind

426
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:46,696
of cardiac complication
related to the Kawasaki.

427
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,129
All right. You guys stay here.

428
00:21:48,154 --> 00:21:49,672
We're gonna get her
to the cath lab.

429
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:51,002
And page Yamada.

430
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,126
Got your page. What's going on?

431
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,727
- Betz isn't rejecting the heart.
- Okay.

432
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:03,592
Here's the problem.

433
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:05,359
Bowel ischemia.

434
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:07,459
That's your specialty, Bell.

435
00:22:07,865 --> 00:22:10,116
It is, but the last
bowel ischemia we had,

436
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:12,126
the patient died on the
table, and that guy in there

437
00:22:12,151 --> 00:22:13,668
made sure I got sued.

438
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:17,010
Well, we need you
to operate on him.

439
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,215
Is that going to be a problem?

440
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,979
No. I'll save the S.O.B.

441
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:27,588
She has a giant
coronary aneurysm,

442
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,596
a result of the Kawasaki.

443
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:30,990
It looks clotted off.

444
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:32,792
And partially ruptured.

445
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:35,586
Blood is accumulating around
the heart, causing tamponade.

446
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:38,112
I can do a
pericardiocentesis right now,

447
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:40,140
but it's only a temporary fix.

448
00:22:40,165 --> 00:22:41,982
Look, the aneurysm could
rupture at any second.

449
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:44,486
She's gonna need coronary
artery bypass surgery.

450
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:47,611
A CABG on a ten-year-old?
That's unheard of.

451
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:48,584
Look, ischemic heart,

452
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:50,571
MI, sudden cardiac death.
She could have it all.

453
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:53,430
The surgery's a Hail Mary, but
it gives Sammie her only shot.

454
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,495
Okay. I'll book an
OR, Dr. Sullivan.

455
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,428
When can you be ready?

456
00:22:58,496 --> 00:23:00,561
I'm gonna need a half hour.

457
00:23:00,586 --> 00:23:02,253
Okay.

458
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:07,334
So, tell me where
we are with Sammie.

459
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,151
Then I have to
scrub in for Betz.

460
00:23:09,176 --> 00:23:11,851
She has a GCA... Giant
coronary aneurysm.

461
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:13,504
Oh, God.

462
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:16,790
I'm sorry. As I'm sure
you're both aware,

463
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:19,891
the surgery to fix this
is incredibly risky, but

464
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,816
at this point, it's the only
path left to save her life.

465
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:24,507
At least we know what's wrong.

466
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,182
Yeah, yeah.

467
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:31,598
Obviously, you're the
best person to operate.

468
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:33,851
You still have privileges here.

469
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:36,512
Look, I'm ready, and
I-I want to help,

470
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:40,103
but there's something that
you need to know first.

471
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:46,428
I was not hiking across
Spain these last few weeks.

472
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:48,676
I was in rehab.

473
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,921
Rehab for what?

474
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:54,608
Addiction to pills.
Uppers, downers.

475
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,633
Whatever I needed to...

476
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:58,508
relieve stress, to focus,

477
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:01,107
to do my best during surgery.

478
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:02,891
At least that was my excuse.

479
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,492
Were you operating
here at Chastain

480
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:07,508
while under the influence?

481
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,447
- Yes.
- So you lied.

482
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:14,293
You some... somehow
cheated the drug tests

483
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,290
and put sick
children in jeopardy.

484
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:18,858
Yes, but I never
harmed a patient.

485
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:21,389
I was a functioning
addict, I was...

486
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:24,576
Look, there's no excuse,
there's no justification.

487
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,300
I'm not doing that.

488
00:24:27,323 --> 00:24:29,306
This is a disaster.

489
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:31,403
Sammie needs the OR now.

490
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:34,012
- I mean, what do we do?
- Look, I am sober.

491
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:35,461
I intend to stay that way.

492
00:24:35,486 --> 00:24:37,974
If you have lost your trust
in me, I fully understand.

493
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:40,920
But there is not a pediatric
surgeon at Atlanta General

494
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:42,895
who can do this, okay?

495
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,326
I have been in contact
with colleagues

496
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:46,746
in Boston and New York, and
they can be here tomorrow.

497
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:48,819
- Well, it might be too late.
- This is appalling.

498
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:50,752
I can't even
drug-test you in time

499
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:52,697
to make sure you're
sober right now.

500
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:53,887
I am, you have my word.

501
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:55,403
What's your
word even worth?

502
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,662
We can't believe
a thing you say.

503
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:00,633
She's your granddaughter.

504
00:25:01,547 --> 00:25:03,269
What do you want me to do?

505
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:07,464
Well, Ian has to do the surgery.

506
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,366
We have no choice.

507
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:16,128
So, you have this chance to at
least partially redeem yourself.

508
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:18,329
I'll go scrub in.

509
00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:26,387
If he screws this
up, I will kill him.

510
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,634
<i>If anyone
can save her...</i>

511
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:52,935
Honestly, we just
have so much faith.

512
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,560
And trust in you.

513
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,873
We're ready if you are.

514
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,972
Scalpel.

515
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:15,619
Sternal saw to me.

516
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,541
I'm fine. Let's do this thing.

517
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:41,856
Ten-blade to me.

518
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:48,978
Retractor.

519
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:58,550
That's a lot of dead bowel.

520
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,966
That's much more
than I expected.

521
00:26:59,991 --> 00:27:02,417
That explains the shock.

522
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,222
- Oh, pressure's dropping fast.
- Yeah, we need to move.

523
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:07,006
- Bowel resection.
- Stapler to me.

524
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:18,283
Aneurysm is completely
ruptured. She's exsanguinating.

525
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:20,166
Please save her!

526
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:22,341
BP's dropping.

527
00:27:22,795 --> 00:27:24,778
I need to get control here.

528
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:26,705
Too late. She's coding.

529
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:31,429
Dr. Sullivan!

530
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:36,188
Initiating cardiac massage.

531
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:40,167
I need cardiothoracic. Get
Dr. Austin in here right now!

532
00:27:46,391 --> 00:27:47,874
Hey, it's Sammie.

533
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,463
Her aneurysm
completely ruptured.

534
00:27:49,488 --> 00:27:51,698
Dr. Sullivan needs your
help right away, AJ.

535
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:54,874
Randolph,

536
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,262
you got this, man?

537
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,043
Dr. Bell?

538
00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:12,331
Dr. Bell?

539
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:15,753
I heard about Sammie.

540
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,373
Do you need another
set of hands?

541
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:19,630
Get ready for the big
leagues, Devi. We need you

542
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:22,128
- to take over for Bell.
- I'm ready.

543
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,262
Pass me the ball.

544
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:30,732
Let's go.

545
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,483
- What can I do?
- Finish cannulating,

546
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:40,643
so we can start the bypass
and stop the bleeding.

547
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:50,639
And cannulating complete.

548
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:51,968
Hit it.

549
00:28:53,974 --> 00:28:55,614
Cross clamps.

550
00:28:56,905 --> 00:28:59,313
The machine is taking over
the function of her heart.

551
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,096
And it's stopping the bleeding.

552
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:03,321
- She's stabilizing.
- Yeah, but it's not over yet.

553
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:05,830
The hardest part of the
surgery is coming up.

554
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:08,136
I've never performed

555
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:10,064
a CABG on a patient so young.

556
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:13,516
Remember, delicate
vessels, delicate fingers.

557
00:29:13,563 --> 00:29:15,723
Divide and conquer.

558
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:18,141
Dissecting out the vein.

559
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:22,215
Acquiring target.

560
00:29:26,317 --> 00:29:28,542
There's a
perforation in the duodenum.

561
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,584
It's-it's passing.

562
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:34,513
The flare, it's... passing.

563
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,541
You have to get control
of the spillage.

564
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,953
- I'll suction and wash him out.
- Well, we have

565
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:42,552
to patch up the hole. That's
the only way to save him.

566
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:44,883
It's big. Think we'll
be able to close?

567
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:47,325
We'll use a piece of omentum.

568
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,224
Okay, harvesting the tissue now.

569
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:50,415
Pressures are tanking.

570
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,258
Okay, just finishing
the omental patch.

571
00:29:53,283 --> 00:29:55,389
His MAPs are still
falling. We're losing him.

572
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:58,482
I know. I know. Hang
on. Almost there.

573
00:29:59,768 --> 00:30:00,976
And...

574
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:03,229
done.

575
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,960
Bravo.

576
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:13,954
The torch has passed.

577
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:18,494
Far from it.

578
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,324
- We're in this together.
- No.

579
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:22,531
Not anymore.

580
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:25,024
You're the lead surgeon.

581
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,441
The patient couldn't
be in better hands.

582
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:33,298
So, if you don't mind,

583
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:37,781
I will... leave you to it.

584
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:04,019
How's it going?

585
00:31:04,044 --> 00:31:05,711
Well, Ian's been brilliant.

586
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:07,867
Almost there.

587
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:09,402
Last stitch.

588
00:31:12,861 --> 00:31:14,970
And the
CABG is complete.

589
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:17,270
Let's get her heart going.

590
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:19,988
We just need one
more miracle today.

591
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:22,513
Removing the clamps.

592
00:31:22,538 --> 00:31:23,794
And...

593
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:26,522
here we go.

594
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:30,693
Come on.

595
00:31:43,412 --> 00:31:45,187
Oh.

596
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,314
A week ago, my life was saved

597
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,594
<i>at Chastain Memorial.</i>

598
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:08,668
<i>I saw firsthand the
care they provide,</i>

599
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:13,051
<i>and I saw the impact that
taking that care away had</i>

600
00:32:13,076 --> 00:32:15,861
on patients and on
other hospitals.

601
00:32:15,886 --> 00:32:19,054
- He's keeping his word.
- He'd better.

602
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,745
As a result,

603
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:24,366
Chastain's full funding
has been restored.

604
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:26,502
Yes! Chastain lives!

605
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:31,627
Never give up!

606
00:32:42,664 --> 00:32:44,347
Oh! Ho-ho-ho.

607
00:32:50,153 --> 00:32:52,496
Congratulations. You
saved the hospital.

608
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:54,418
Congratulations to all of us.

609
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:56,671
Thanks for coming to talk to me.

610
00:32:56,696 --> 00:32:58,431
- Of course.
- Hi, Dad.

611
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:00,876
Oh. I didn't see you there.

612
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,722
I invited Cade because I
wanted her to hear this, too.

613
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:08,608
The work you did last
week saving Sammie

614
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:10,441
was nothing short of miraculous.

615
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:12,849
Oh, well, Dr. Austin
was an equal partner.

616
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:14,399
It was teamwork all the way.

617
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:17,349
Cade told me how hard you've
been working on your sobriety.

618
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:19,159
She also reminded me

619
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:22,097
that addiction is a disease,
not a moral failing.

620
00:33:23,027 --> 00:33:26,500
Operating under the
influence is a moral failing.

621
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:28,875
All I can do is
dedicate my sobriety

622
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,336
to making up for
the risks I took,

623
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:33,654
and for the damage my
addiction did to Cade.

624
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:36,251
That's a fine sentiment.

625
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:38,351
I hope you can hold onto it.

626
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:41,877
After considerable
thought, I've decided,

627
00:33:41,902 --> 00:33:45,470
if you're willing, I want
you back at Chastain.

628
00:33:53,137 --> 00:33:55,119
That's amazing.

629
00:33:55,144 --> 00:33:56,535
And very brave.

630
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,043
It's a risk I'll take.

631
00:33:58,068 --> 00:34:01,145
You're too valuable to
patients. I can't replace you.

632
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,745
You'll be tested regularly.

633
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,587
And if you use again, even
once, it will be your last day.

634
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:11,131
- Understood.
- So, will you come back to us?

635
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:13,700
You couldn't drag
me away.

636
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:16,484
I'm so happy for you, Dad.

637
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,473
So, um,

638
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:25,102
I've got some good
news and some bad news.

639
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:29,227
As you suspected, your
MS has progressed.

640
00:34:29,252 --> 00:34:30,777
But that also means
that you're eligible

641
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,136
for the second
phase of my trial.

642
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:35,085
Well, that's...

643
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,109
that's a huge relief.

644
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:39,884
And I wonder, you know, if...

645
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,428
full remission is possible.

646
00:34:42,453 --> 00:34:44,323
Well, with or without
the trial, it is.

647
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:46,322
And that can be weeks or months,

648
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,724
and in some cases,
it can be years.

649
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:53,760
Well, let's just hope it's
long enough we can find a cure.

650
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,144
You know, um...

651
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:00,352
I remember when you first
came to this hospital,

652
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:03,704
and you were...
green and innocent,

653
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,622
and had so much to learn.

654
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:06,896
And now...

655
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:10,258
Devon, I'm just...

656
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:12,757
I'm just so glad it's you...

657
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:16,024
that holds my life
in your hands.

658
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,863
Let's beat this.

659
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:23,586
Together.

660
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:25,940
All right.

661
00:35:31,414 --> 00:35:32,497
Thank you.

662
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,221
Welcome back.

663
00:35:37,459 --> 00:35:39,719
God, I'm so excited
to see the boys.

664
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,180
- I'm so sorry for everything.
- Hey, don't be.

665
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:48,541
Postpartum depression
is a medical condition

666
00:35:48,566 --> 00:35:50,234
that can affect anyone.

667
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:53,313
And we both want you to
know that we support you.

668
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:56,573
And we believe you are going to
be a great mother to our boys.

669
00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:59,987
And I promise to always be
honest with you and let you know

670
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:02,102
- if I'm getting overwhelmed.
- Good.

671
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:05,435
Well, let's go see our
babies, shall we?

672
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:09,981
Yeah.

I heard you were taking

Yeah, I'm entering
Devon's MS trial,

695
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:48,222
and I want to spend a little
more time alone with Kit.

696
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:50,414
And with luck,
I'll be back soon.

699
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:59,406
Yeah, but I can't cure
mine with will power.

700
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:01,228
Well, you've done
pretty good so far.

701
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:04,381
You know, there's
another thing we share.

702
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:08,559
When I agreed to
do Betz's surgery,

703
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:11,176
I knew my symptoms were
getting worse, and I believed

704
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:13,711
that I could control
something I couldn't control.

705
00:38:14,302 --> 00:38:15,951
You're worried I
won't stay sober.

706
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:17,775
I'm worried that you, like me,

707
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,453
have the worst disease
of this profession...

708
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:22,135
Arrogance.

709
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:26,185
Are you capable of
policing yourself?

710
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,558
Arrogance was never my problem.

711
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:31,448
It was the opposite... fear...

712
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:35,716
that I'm not good enough,
that I am an imposter.

713
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:38,487
Drugs took the fear away.

714
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,912
Why didn't you come to Kit

715
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:42,929
and tell her you had a problem?

716
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,754
Fear again.

717
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:48,930
I didn't want to lose the thing

718
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:51,958
that was most precious
to me, beside Cade.

719
00:38:52,981 --> 00:38:54,777
But she has her own life.

720
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:57,052
At the end of the day...

721
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,089
every night, I go home alone.

722
00:39:01,145 --> 00:39:02,372
The work...

723
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:06,516
This... is what I have.

724
00:39:08,991 --> 00:39:11,079
Well, that I understand.

725
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:14,428
'Cause I was that guy.

726
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:17,170
- Hmm.
- For decades.

727
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,471
But not anymore. Now with Kit,

728
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:23,537
I mean... I mean, there's a
whole world outside these walls.

729
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,832
I don't think you'll be
outside for too long.

730
00:39:25,857 --> 00:39:28,173
Well, Kit and my family
will be my priority,

731
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:30,520
and possibly helping to find
a cure for this disease.

732
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:32,528
But I'm-I'm not gonna disappear.

733
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:35,292
I'll teach incoming interns.

734
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:38,257
Well, that is one of
your finest skills.

735
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:39,615
You've already helped create

736
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,944
the most brilliant
young doctor here.

737
00:39:45,957 --> 00:39:48,786
My mentor gave me
his stethoscope

738
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:51,066
when I became an
attending, and I...

739
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:53,682
I kept it all these years.

740
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:55,775
And now, on the day

741
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,179
you become an attending,

742
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,283
I give it to you.

743
00:40:01,911 --> 00:40:03,639
I will treasure it, Dr. Bell.

744
00:40:03,664 --> 00:40:04,943
Congratulations.

745
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:06,571
And call him "Randolph."

746
00:40:06,596 --> 00:40:07,946
You're not a resident anymore.

747
00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:11,109
Thank you.

748
00:40:20,815 --> 00:40:22,356
Couldn't be more proud of you.

749
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:38,204
Will you marry me, Dr. Devi?

750
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:41,519
Yes.

751
00:40:56,815 --> 00:40:58,706
Happy birthday!

752
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:02,309
- Oh! Oh, wow!
- Oh, my goodness!

753
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,882
- That's amazing!
- Look at this!

754
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:07,047
- Rainbow!
- And I've got something special

755
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,161
for you.

756
00:41:09,186 --> 00:41:11,870
- We can match.
- Yes, join the party.

757
00:41:14,276 --> 00:41:16,459
Here we go. Ready?

758
00:41:16,484 --> 00:41:17,875
Make a wish.

759
00:41:22,074 --> 00:41:23,519
Regrets?

760
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:26,098
Presents! Presents!

761
00:41:26,123 --> 00:41:29,466
- Come on.
- Presents! Presents!

762
00:41:32,361 --> 00:41:34,845
I'm thinking Charleston
for the weekend.

763
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,462
That sounds ideal.

764
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:37,820
All right.

765
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:41,519
Okay. We hope you like it.

766
00:41:41,544 --> 00:41:44,588
Oh, look at that, huh?

767
00:41:47,413 --> 00:41:48,867
Thank you.

768
00:41:48,892 --> 00:41:50,646
I love it!

769
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:54,247
Sammie, I
have a present for you, too.

770
00:41:54,272 --> 00:41:57,513
It's not new, but
it's really special.

771
00:41:57,538 --> 00:42:01,766
Oh, no, you can't
give Mr. Giraffe away.

772
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:05,428
- It's your birthday.
- I want to

773
00:42:05,453 --> 00:42:07,154
'cause I know
he'll keep you safe

774
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:09,596
so you'll never
get so sick again.

775
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:11,319
- Aw.
- Thank you.

776
00:42:11,344 --> 00:42:14,437
If you'd rather have
a brand-new toy...

777
00:42:14,462 --> 00:42:16,237
Never. He's perfect as he is.

778
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:18,892
- Oh.
- And so are you.

779
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:26,491
You want to continue?

780
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:42,374
I love you.

781
