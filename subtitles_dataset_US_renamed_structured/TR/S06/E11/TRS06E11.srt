181
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:28,438
- of the heart...
- Not to mention

182
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:31,323
accepting the Nobel Peace Prize
for the International Physicians

183
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:33,085
for the Prevention
of Nuclear Weapons...

184
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,633
If we could save this
for another time,

185
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,507
if you don't mind.

186
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:36,622
Of course, of course.

187
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:39,417
Uh, likely RCA occlusion.
Radial approach.

188
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:40,821
Should be in and
out with a stent

189
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,300
and a new lease on
life in no time.

190
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:44,324
James, cancel the cath lab.

191
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:45,597
Stop the heparin.

192
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:47,097
Get me to CT stat.

193
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:48,341
Your EKG

194
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:50,067
shows inferior ST elevations.

195
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:52,521
Your troponin's elevated.
You're having a heart attack...

196
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:56,007
Apparently I am also having
an aortic dissection.

197
00:09:56,032 --> 00:09:58,469
Dr. Austin, I hope
you're ready for surgery.

198
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:00,567
Well, if you're right,
I'm more than ready.

199
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,040
How long do they want
to keep her here?

200
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:10,777
They'll talk to us
once they check her in.

201
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:13,880
So what happens next?

202
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:15,361
Medication?

203
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:17,241
- Therapy?
- All of that.

204
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,140
God, the anxiety,

205
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:21,497
the sense of inadequacy...

206
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:24,109
I thought it was the stress
of being a new mother.

207
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:26,506
How did I not see it was
postpartum depression?

208
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:28,086
What's important is

209
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:30,901
now Padma's gonna be able to
get the help that she needs.

210
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:32,971
We have to tell AJ.

211
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,425
He has an incredibly
important patient today.

212
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,996
Leonard Perry.

213
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:41,360
<i>The</i> Leonard Perry?

214
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:43,586
God, I don't want
to distract him

215
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:45,555
when he can't do anything
for Padma right now.

216
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,681
I'll talk to him later today.

217
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,462
You have to go to work. I know.

218
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:53,528
- I love you.
- I love you.

219
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:01,965
I just don't see how he can
have an aortic dissection.

220
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,471
He's too functional.
His pain is manageable.

221
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,753
It doesn't make sense.

222
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,223
Yeah, it was
probably a slow one.

223
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:08,505
Atypical presentation.

224
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,711
I know I said he's
always right, but...

225
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,477
I want him
to be wrong this one time.

226
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:16,822
Man, what was he
like as a teacher?

227
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:17,771
A saint.

228
00:11:17,796 --> 00:11:20,088
Medicine is like a...

229
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,204
spiritual vocation for him.

230
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:25,654
He believes in the power
of the human touch.

231
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:27,920
Hmm.

232
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:30,037
Well, I'll be damned.

233
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:34,069
Right there. Ascending
aortic dissection.

234
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,086
His right coronary artery
takes off anomalously

235
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:38,294
from his ascending aorta.

236
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,333
Which means when he
had the dissection,

237
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:41,966
he also had an inferior MI.

238
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:44,801
That is... that is a
one-in-a-million diagnosis.

239
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:46,334
How the hell did
he figure that out?

240
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,059
Observation

241
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,475
and experience.

242
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,412
Sir, you should be
back in your bed.

243
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:55,169
- You're not well.
- A type 1A dissection.

244
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:57,875
A Perry-1A, to be exact.

245
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,385
Named after you because you're
the one who categorized it.

246
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,504
Well, are you ready to repair

247
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:07,321
a Perry-1A dissection on Perry?

248
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:11,373
Let's... take a moment to figure
out the best course of action.

249
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,398
Yeah?

250
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:13,495
Sure.

251
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:15,452
Sure, he's right, Dr. Perry.

252
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:17,540
Let's get you back
to an ICU bed.

253
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:18,994
Okay?

254
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,350
You get called to the execution?

255
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,267
- Sorry, what?
- You didn't see the email?

256
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,179
We're all supposed
to meet with Voss.

257
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,182
Chastain's level 1 trauma
center is closing. Tonight.

258
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:33,053
Whoa. That is a huge loss.

259
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:34,567
No more helicopters on the roof,

260
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:36,199
no more trauma team activations.

261
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:38,298
Fewer doctors, nurses, surgeons.

262
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:39,858
It makes you think what's next?

263
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:41,216
Cath lab? Transplant?

264
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:42,698
We're gonna be a nine-to-five
urgent care clinic

265
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:43,511
before you know it.

266
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:44,587
Prepare for a thrilling future

267
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:46,018
of nonspecific abdominal pain

268
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:47,883
and tingly arms and legs.

269
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:49,826
What do we got?

270
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:51,166
Unidentified woman.

271
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:53,061
Witnesses say she got
into a violent altercation

272
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:54,175
with a purse thief.

273
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,294
Closed head injury and
thrown to the ground.

274
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:57,898
- Femur looks broken.
- All right, let's take her

275
00:12:57,922 --> 00:12:59,733
- to Trauma 12.
- Hello, ma'am,

276
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:01,569
I'm Dr. Pravesh,
and you are at

277
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:02,853
Chastain Hospital.

278
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:03,988
Do you remember what happened?

279
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:05,120
My purse.

280
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,431
She wandered out of
the dementia unit?

281
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:07,841
It's possible. I have no clue.

282
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:10,596
She's pretty banged up,
but protecting her airway,

283
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,196
and her vitals are stable.

284
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:14,276
Let's get a full set of
labs and get her to CT

285
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:15,058
as soon as we can.

286
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,485
At her age and degree of trauma,

287
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,353
she could have injured
just about anything.

288
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:20,641
He needs emergent surgery.

289
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,976
His mortality's
increasing one percent

290
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,652
- every hour we wait.
- But at his age,

291
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:25,943
and with the extent
of involvement

292
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,898
of his aorta, and the hit
his heart's already taken,

293
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:30,275
the mortality for that
surgery's over 50%.

294
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,617
- So what's the alternative, conservative management?
- Yes.

295
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:34,957
But we keep strict tabs

296
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,516
on his heart rate
and blood pressure.

297
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,635
And hope the tear in
his aorta clots off.

298
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,153
It's a long shot
and still risky.

299
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,809
He said it himself. It's
a Type-1A Gray Zone.

300
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:45,330
Medical management and
surgery have similar outcomes.

301
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:47,147
All right, so we have
to convince the man

302
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:49,523
who created the surgery
not to have the surgery,

303
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:52,500
and hope the world's
most famous heart surgeon

304
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:54,591
doesn't die in Chastain today.

305
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:57,448
Right.

306
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,661
Hey.

307
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:07,349
Hey.

308
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:09,389
Heard Leonard Perry's
here. How is he?

309
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:13,196
Well, he's hanging in
there, but it's not great.

310
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:17,239
Um, so Kit wants me to move out
all the ICU patients that I can.

311
00:14:17,264 --> 00:14:18,481
What? Why?

312
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,679
Budget issues, I'm assuming.

313
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:23,101
I found a good
candidate. Amir Sheridan.

314
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:24,570
The kid with the
fentanyl poisoning?

315
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,541
- I thought he was improving.
- He's not.

316
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,787
But he's alive.

317
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:29,886
Neuro says wait a year
before they give up on him,

318
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:30,930
but he can't stay here.

319
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:33,746
So we have to find
a skilled nursing facility

320
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:34,751
- that will take him.
- Yes.

321
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:36,004
Which will not be an easy task,

322
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,453
and it's all yours.

323
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:40,219
Someone needs to
talk to his family,

324
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:41,782
and it should probably
be his surgeon.

325
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:44,164
- Billie.
- Can you give that to her, please?

326
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,845
Hey, you got some time
for a trauma patient?

327
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:55,658
Go for it. Distract me.

328
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,789
- What was that?
- A mess.

329
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,239
I get it. If you ever
want to talk, I'm here.

330
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:04,711
I got to say, though, we
all knew it was coming.

331
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:09,036
Kit and Bell's wedding?
Everybody saw it.

332
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:12,194
Everybody but me, I guess.

333
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,711
Hi. Can you tell us
your name, ma'am?

334
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:18,329
You first.

335
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,515
This is Lillian, and
she's a real fighter.

336
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,037
She took on a guy who
tried to snatch her purse.

337
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:26,246
Lillian... something.

338
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:29,147
I can't remember the rest of it.

339
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:31,021
- Bizarre.
- Lillian,

340
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,031
- I'm Dr. Hawkins.
- What time is it?

341
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:35,065
I need to make sure
that I let the dog out.

342
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,813
No. I need you to
stay right here, okay?

343
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:40,936
Stay here.

344
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,189
Can you keep an
eye on her for me?

345
00:15:46,642 --> 00:15:49,123
She's been this
disoriented the whole time?

346
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,057
She's clearing up a
bit, but not much.

347
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:53,652
Any explanation for her
confusion on her workup?

348
00:15:53,677 --> 00:15:56,188
Possible Alzheimer's, but her
urine is clearly infected.

349
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:58,856
She's dehydrated, sodium at 150.

350
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:01,139
She's in pain from a
broken femur, but listen.

351
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:03,927
What's really
concerning me is this.

352
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,211
Mm.

353
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,608
Acute on-chronic subdural.
That's pretty big.

354
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,689
This could be what is causing
her to be so confused.

355
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:14,677
If you're asking my advice,

356
00:16:15,368 --> 00:16:17,414
fix her sodium, treat her UTI,

357
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,877
- see if she clears.
- I think she needs to get to the OR stat.

358
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:23,392
Taking a woman at her
age to the OR is risky.

359
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,171
And if it is dementia,
putting her through surgery...

360
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:28,146
That-that could just
make things far worse.

361
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:30,830
We have to get her to the OR
anyway for her broken leg.

362
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:33,916
I say we try and treat the
bleed at the same time.

363
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:35,847
Okay, so both Billie and Kit.

364
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:36,997
Yes.

365
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:42,416
Now, as confidant as I am in
using your surgical techniques,

366
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:45,481
my recommendation would be
to carefully monitor you

367
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,809
and hope the
dissection stabilizes.

368
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:51,537
Honesty first, among colleagues?

369
00:16:58,844 --> 00:17:02,686
Well, neither option is good.

370
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,048
We believe odds slightly
favor wait and see.

371
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,865
Slightly favor?

372
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,890
So it's not clear.

373
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:11,248
No, it's not.

374
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,435
Given the choice
between hope and action,

375
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,986
I've always tended
towards action.

376
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:22,484
But now that I'm
here, I'm frightened.

377
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,182
Dr. Perry,

378
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:33,803
if you choose to
have the surgery,

379
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:37,270
I promise you that these hands
will do everything they can

380
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:38,628
to save your life.

381
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,219
So you have it?

382
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,342
The healing touch?

383
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:45,067
Well, I don't know about that,

384
00:17:45,092 --> 00:17:47,573
but I do have
experience, talent,

385
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:49,330
and a very big ego.

386
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:52,590
That and the healing touch.

387
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,576
That is where I place my trust.

388
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,593
Okay. No watching and waiting.

389
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:10,069
- We move forward.
- Yes.

390
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,023
Together.

391
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:14,369
You sure?

392
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,743
You don't have to make this
decision right this moment.

393
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:22,468
James, I have never let
fear guide me in the OR.

394
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:25,061
I won't let it
steer me away now.

395
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,925
No more half measures.

396
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,561
I want bold action.

397
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:36,256
All right. You heard
the man, James.

398
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,372
Dr. Leonard has decided

399
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:40,925
to come out the
bunker guns blazing.

400
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,834
That's the idea.

401
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,130
- Okay?
- Okay.

402
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:04,223
How's it going?

403
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:05,864
Good.

404
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,406
Good. Me too.

405
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:11,270
Ah, so, I spoke to Cade.

406
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:13,674
Been avoiding texts
from James all day.

407
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:18,492
Could have done this in
a cleaner way, but...

408
00:19:19,103 --> 00:19:20,894
it happened.

409
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:23,855
And we are gonna do
this right from now on.

410
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,730
I'll talk to James.

411
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,988
I heard you're looking to
relocate Amir Sheridan.

412
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:35,395
- I'm so sad he hasn't woken up.
- Yeah.

413
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,000
We're still looking
for a facility,

414
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,653
but I thought I'd get
the conversation started

415
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,842
with the family. They're
coming in this afternoon.

416
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,566
Did you want to talk to them?

417
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,273
Well, I should.

418
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:46,632
- I mean, of course I will.
- No. No, no, no.

419
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:48,690
- Not after yesterday.
- I'll talk to them.

420
00:19:48,997 --> 00:19:50,220
Would you?

421
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:51,962
Of course.

422
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,967
I don't love how we got here,

423
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:59,325
but I am so happy
that we are here.

424
00:20:00,838 --> 00:20:02,134
I know.

425
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:04,204
Me too.

426
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:08,893
- AJ.
- Yo.

427
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:12,601
I brought you this
for good luck.

428
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:15,213
It's from when I was on
Perry's team in Boston.

429
00:20:15,238 --> 00:20:16,588
Thanks, man.

430
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:17,954
Yeah.

431
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:20,898
So, listen. Obviously, Perry
is consenting for himself,

432
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:22,717
but is there somebody
we should call?

433
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,079
He's a widower, no kids.

434
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:26,801
He always said his
interns were his children.

435
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,493
Oh, wow. So I guess
you're his family now.

436
00:20:29,518 --> 00:20:31,278
Yeah, I guess so.

437
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:34,035
Acute on-chronic subdural,

438
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,086
broken femur and
some bruised ribs.

439
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,071
Lillian's 84.

440
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:39,317
What's she doing, playing rugby?

441
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:40,788
She tried to fight
off a purse thief

442
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:43,033
who then battered her
within an inch of her life.

443
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:45,427
Human beings are
capable of greatness.

444
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,672
Bravery, charity, love, decency.

445
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:49,204
And yet the very same species

446
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:51,625
has monsters who do
things like this.

447
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:53,445
It's gonna be a
scheduling challenge.

448
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,889
I'm trying to ramp down the OR

449
00:20:54,914 --> 00:20:56,558
now that we're closing Trauma.

450
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,818
So there's less
on-call anesthesia.

451
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:00,238
Maybe if you guys double-team it

452
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:01,504
you can share anesthesia?

453
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:03,076
Well, the surgery's
pretty risky already.

454
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,659
Are we sure we want
to do it at all?

455
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:08,304
I see she has a possible
diagnosis of dementia.

456
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:10,643
We could table the
subdural for now,

457
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:12,980
get her another CT
scan in a few hours,

458
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,969
- put her on frequent neuro checks.
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:16,310
Conrad had a similar impulse,

460
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:18,181
but we have no proof that
the problem is dementia.

461
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:19,706
I mean, for all we
know she could finish

462
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,633
the Sunday<i> New York
Times</i> crossword puzzle

463
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:23,618
when she doesn't
have 200cc's of blood

464
00:21:23,643 --> 00:21:25,668
pushing on her parietal lobe.

465
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:27,936
Book the OR.

466
00:21:28,256 --> 00:21:29,360
Okay.

467
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:31,648
I don't want to lose
another patient.

468
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:33,337
I understand being risk-averse

469
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:35,605
after what happened yesterday,

470
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,802
but the patient you lost
had metastatic cancer

471
00:21:37,827 --> 00:21:39,252
and an unhinged family.

472
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:40,865
This woman has no one but us

473
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,026
and at least a
chance of recovery.

474
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,924
You're right. I'm in.

475
00:21:50,636 --> 00:21:52,571
What's his temp?

476
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:55,156
Cooled temperature is down
to 20 degrees Celsius.

477
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,940
Ah, the tear
could have extended since.

478
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,948
All right, we're gonna
have to stop his heart

479
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:02,360
to get a good look.

480
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:04,717
And the bypass machine.

481
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:08,186
We'll have no
circulation at all. For how long?

482
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:11,509
Thirty minutes until anoxic
brain injury sets in.

483
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:13,851
Maybe sooner at his age.

484
00:22:14,318 --> 00:22:15,713
I know this sucks,

485
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,279
but the man said he was all in,

486
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:22,675
which means<i> we</i> are all in.

487
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,956
Bold action.

488
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,408
He's at 18 degrees.

489
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:27,733
Cooling goal reached.

490
00:22:27,758 --> 00:22:29,708
He's going into
hypothermia-induced V fib.

491
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:32,246
Cardioplegic
medication to me.

492
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:36,969
And here we go.

493
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,102
- Arrest time starting now.
- Good. Let's move.

494
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:54,308
You got 25 minutes.

495
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,314
I'm almost done. Hopefully.

496
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:58,673
The dissection took out
his whole aortic arch.

497
00:22:58,698 --> 00:23:01,784
Left carotid, left subclavian
and the innominate.

498
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:03,941
He certainly did not
make this easy for me.

499
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,604
Not to mention the
single-vessel bypass for his RCA.

500
00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:09,464
The good news is
we're almost there.

501
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:14,076
Damn it! 4-0 suture to me.

502
00:23:14,396 --> 00:23:17,673
- You are running out of time.
- My OR requires everyone

503
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,788
to be cool, calm and collected.

504
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:22,661
And that includes
the observation room.

505
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,884
All right, we are good.

506
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,281
I'm unclamping.

507
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:45,674
Yes.

508
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:47,177
- Whew.
- Yes.

509
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:48,714
All right.

510
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:50,037
Oh...

511
00:23:51,142 --> 00:23:52,987
All right, put him back on pump.

512
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,369
How's Dr. Perry?

513
00:24:11,832 --> 00:24:13,734
He made it through the surgery,

514
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,639
but that's all we know for now.

515
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,013
Cade, if you have a minute,
I think we should talk.

516
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:21,779
I'm not sure what
there is to say.

517
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:23,619
Well, we're gonna
be working together,

518
00:24:23,644 --> 00:24:25,477
I hope for a long time.

519
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:29,558
So I want to give you the
chance to get whatever it is

520
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,499
you're feeling off your chest.

521
00:24:35,378 --> 00:24:36,812
Okay.

522
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:53,085
I know Conrad talked to you.

523
00:24:54,597 --> 00:24:55,904
I just wanted to say that

524
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,197
- neither of us saw this coming.
- Oh, come on.

525
00:24:58,222 --> 00:25:01,215
You've been in love with Conrad
the entire time I've known you.

526
00:25:03,455 --> 00:25:07,348
I never had any intention
of taking him away from you.

527
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:11,021
The dance at Kit
and Bell's wedding?

528
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:13,155
Unplanned.

529
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:15,980
But you're right.

530
00:25:16,904 --> 00:25:20,419
And I don't want you to think
that I'm the kind of person

531
00:25:20,444 --> 00:25:22,484
- that would swoop in...
- Look, I like you.

532
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:24,341
Right now I wish I
didn't, but I do.

533
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,849
So for what it's worth,

534
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:28,093
in these types of situations,
no one does the swooping.

535
00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:30,004
It's kind of a two-handed game.

536
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,653
Well, I'm not sure
Conrad's responsible

537
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:36,642
for feelings he couldn't
fight or even face.

538
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,453
Okay. I
didn't need that.

539
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:41,125
I... I'm sorry, I'm not
finding the right words.

540
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,418
It's fine. I will survive.

541
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:44,764
Because I know what I deserve.

542
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:46,342
I deserve someone who loves me,

543
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:48,080
not someone who's
working overtime

544
00:25:48,105 --> 00:25:50,125
to deny they love you.

545
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:53,727
I really am sorry.

546
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:56,818
Don't be. It's pointless.

547
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:02,749
Just so you know,

548
00:26:02,774 --> 00:26:04,837
Hawkins never said "I love you."

549
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,511
Not once.

550
00:26:06,536 --> 00:26:08,762
Neither of us did.

551
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:22,278
Extubating now.

552
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:23,932
Subdural
drain complete.

553
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,011
Perfect timing.
Just closing skin.

554
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:28,010
Well, I think we
actually managed to pull this off

555
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:29,200
in record time.

556
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:30,422
If we're good here,

557
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:32,213
I was due in my next
OR ten minutes ago.

558
00:26:32,238 --> 00:26:34,784
I appreciate you working
with our staff cuts.

559
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:35,658
Thank you, Paul.

560
00:26:35,683 --> 00:26:37,560
Let OR 7 know
I'm on my way.

561
00:26:37,673 --> 00:26:39,169
I'm pretty
much wrapped up here,

562
00:26:39,193 --> 00:26:41,843
and I should check on some
post-op patients, too.

563
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:42,983
You good?

564
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:44,390
Yes. Thank you, Billie.

565
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:47,624
She's in SVT.

566
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,782
Blood pressure's tanking.
Get Paul back here.

567
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:51,962
No time. I know what to do.

568
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,492
- I am not losing this patient today.
- Do it.

569
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,246
Pushing adenosine now.

570
00:27:16,664 --> 00:27:18,714
She's back
in sinus rhythm.

571
00:27:20,947 --> 00:27:22,612
Pressure's coming back up.

572
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:25,261
We've got this. Thanks, Paul.

573
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:27,165
Love being irrelevant.

574
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:31,561
Nice job.

575
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,071
Looks like someone's
made a full recovery.

576
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:38,280
And I'm not talking about
our lovely patient Lillian.

577
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,143
Turns out I survive, too.

578
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:49,484
Ah. Well, you certainly
put me to the test, Dr. P.

579
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:53,017
Oh, he was masterful.
Full aortic arch repair.

580
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:54,461
Truly, Dr. Austin.

581
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,885
And you're already
weaned off the pressors.

582
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,149
Your BP's looking good.

583
00:27:58,174 --> 00:28:00,075
When did you do the
first arch repair...

584
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,152
- 1970?
- '69.

585
00:28:02,177 --> 00:28:04,925
Wow. And they didn't have
all the fancy OR tools

586
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,446
- we have now. Can you...
- Aah!

587
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,861
Oh!

588
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:08,975
What's going on?

589
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,711
I'm dissecting again.

590
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:15,212
The aorta's torn through.

591
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:17,487
And we knew this could happen.

592
00:28:17,512 --> 00:28:19,512
- It's not your fault.
- Okay.

593
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:21,095
Continue the nicardipine

594
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,931
- and the esmolol.
- We'll do that.

595
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:24,676
The man is crashing and
he's still in control.

596
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,309
You won't be able to operate
again. This is worse.

597
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:29,072
We'll control your blood pressure.

598
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:30,882
And your heart rate
and pain, okay?

599
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:33,355
- You're gonna make it through.
- It was a long shot.

600
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,587
We got you, all right?

601
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:35,945
And your job is to stay calm.

602
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,930
Once your blood
pressure spikes...

603
00:28:37,955 --> 00:28:41,974
I die instantly.
I'm aware. And calm.

604
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:45,067
- So calm. So calm.
- So calm. So calm.

605
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:50,549
- Hi.
- I'm Dr. Devi.

606
00:28:50,574 --> 00:28:52,327
She's Padma's
sister. Is she awake?

607
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,927
Yes.

608
00:28:53,952 --> 00:28:57,670
Hey, um, I think she'd
rather see you alone.

609
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:13,839
Hey, Paddie.

610
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,969
You okay?

611
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:22,677
They think I'm crazy.

612
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,967
Tomorrow you'll
see a psychiatrist,

613
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:29,059
and we'll move you
to a better place.

614
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,980
One that specializes in
postpartum depression.

615
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:37,168
What would I ever
do without you?

616
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:39,758
You'll never be without me.

617
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:42,615
And I can't be without you.

618
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:46,583
The boys.

619
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,158
They're with Serena.

620
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:50,511
AJ's gonna go home to them soon.

621
00:29:52,831 --> 00:29:54,183
The worst is over.

622
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:05,455
This is the beginning
of recovery.

623
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,031
The first day of a new life.

624
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,838
Hello, Ms. Lillian Cortland.

625
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:31,184
How you feeling, my dear?

626
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:33,192
I'd like some applesauce.

627
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:35,584
And a clicker that gets me PBS.

628
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:37,486
Because cable news
will rot your brain

629
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:39,887
faster than a moldy grape on
the bottom of a fruit bowl.

630
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:42,171
- Can you tell me who our president is?
- Can you tell me

631
00:30:42,195 --> 00:30:44,093
who all the presidents
are in order,

632
00:30:44,118 --> 00:30:46,393
including Millard
Fillmore? Because I can.

633
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:47,584
Yeah, I get your game.

634
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:49,842
I'm old, so you think I
got mush in my noggin.

635
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:51,542
Hey, you were
right, I was wrong.

636
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,808
Look at that, a man
who admits he's wrong.

637
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:57,058
Now that is a rare quality.

638
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:59,164
My late husband,
may he rot in hell,

639
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,927
he never apologized for
a thing in his life.

640
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:03,764
Lillian, do you remember
how you were injured?

641
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:05,966
Yes, I'm fully aware.

642
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:07,869
I was beaten up by a
mugger because I would not

643
00:31:07,894 --> 00:31:09,484
let him steal my purse.

644
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,791
And where is it, anyway?

645
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:12,553
You know what, Lillian,
we're gonna find out.

646
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:14,657
We're gonna see about
that applesauce, too.

647
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,107
And PBS.

648
00:31:19,455 --> 00:31:21,120
Hey.

649
00:31:22,202 --> 00:31:23,943
What's the latest on Dr. Perry?

650
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:26,544
Well, the godfather of
cardiothoracic surgery

651
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:28,884
did not die in my OR.

652
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:31,214
But his outcome is uncertain.

653
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:33,740
How are you?

654
00:31:36,992 --> 00:31:38,893
There's something we
should probably discuss,

655
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:41,271
but, you know, we
can also talk later.

656
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:43,180
No, no, no, no,
don't do that to me.

657
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:45,205
Sit. Talk.

658
00:31:45,273 --> 00:31:47,327
I could use the company.

659
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:54,700
It's about Padma.

660
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,699
Did she make it home?

661
00:31:57,724 --> 00:32:00,474
I certainly hope so, because
this absent mom thing

662
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:02,256
is getting real old.

663
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:08,764
Padma is struggling with
acute postpartum depression,

664
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:11,634
and she was suicidal.

665
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:16,934
Suicidal?

666
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:21,767
She almost threw
herself off a bridge.

667
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:26,466
She came to me and Devon
for help, and now she's here

668
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:29,128
- on a temporary psychiatric hold.
- Can I see her?

669
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:31,047
No, no. Not yet.

670
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:35,639
She doesn't want to
face you. She's ashamed.

671
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:40,911
Wow, I knew it was bad. I-I
didn't know it was that bad.

672
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:45,517
Devon said no one saw it
because Padma didn't want us to.

673
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:49,720
What about the boys?

674
00:32:49,745 --> 00:32:51,965
Once she's better,
she'll be there for them.

675
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,448
Uh, no, we don't know that.

676
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:56,041
Lots of mothers go through this.

677
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,692
Now at least she's getting help.

678
00:32:58,717 --> 00:33:00,909
What if they're
not safe with her?

679
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:09,007
She loves those
little boys. She does.

680
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:10,769
She's just feeling inadequate
right now, like she...

681
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:12,777
she doesn't deserve
to be their mother,

682
00:33:12,802 --> 00:33:15,234
or she's overwhelmed,
I don't know.

683
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,727
Right. Right.

684
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:19,233
It's, um, it's-it's biochemical.

685
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:20,575
It's hormonal.

686
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,783
There are a lot of things
that factor into this.

687
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:24,095
And it can be treated.

688
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:29,143
Look, she really needs our
support right now. Okay?

689
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:32,303
So please, please
don't turn on her.

690
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,054
I won't.

691
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,872
I can't.

692
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,998
- Hey.
- Hey.

693
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,334
I hear you're
having a rough day.

694
00:34:03,313 --> 00:34:04,387
I am.

695
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:06,991
How's Dr. Perry?

696
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:09,366
We don't know.

697
00:34:10,357 --> 00:34:12,950
He dissected again. He
could still pull through.

698
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:16,585
His tear could stabilize, but
it's out of our hands now.

699
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,277
I'm so sorry.

700
00:34:18,673 --> 00:34:22,358
Hey, before you say whatever
you're about to say,

701
00:34:22,383 --> 00:34:24,183
I think I already know.

702
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:28,435
Hawkins?

703
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:35,147
You're an amazing
guy, James, 100%.

704
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:36,141
If there was no Conrad...

705
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:38,458
Hey, hey, hey. Don't, don't.

706
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:40,866
It's okay.

707
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,164
You knew him long
before you knew me,

708
00:34:43,189 --> 00:34:46,151
there was already a
history. I'm aware.

709
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,429
I don't know what to say.

710
00:34:54,585 --> 00:34:56,995
It was fun while it lasted.

711
00:34:57,945 --> 00:34:59,071
However brief.

712
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:05,610
My heart's intact, okay?

713
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:15,292
This is him. I... I should go.

714
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:18,532
Of course. I hope
he's all right.

715
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:30,367
What's going on?

716
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:34,463
He wanted you to be here.

717
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:14,875
Unfortunately, the patient

718
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,900
has entered the dying process.

719
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,019
You see?

720
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:21,869
Acute aortic valve
insufficiency.

721
00:36:21,894 --> 00:36:24,153
Widening of pulse pressure,

722
00:36:24,178 --> 00:36:27,029
a harbinger of doom
following a repair.

723
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:31,562
It means the aorta has torn
again through the valve.

724
00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:33,955
Even as we speak,

725
00:36:34,374 --> 00:36:37,744
the patient's heart is
being surrounded by blood.

726
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:40,893
Tamponade will ensue.

727
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:44,649
There's nothing more
we can do for him

728
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:46,591
but stay with him.

729
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:49,683
Make sure he is in no pain.

730
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:52,992
Do not give his
care over to nurses.

731
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:56,299
Walk with him on
the final journey.

732
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:58,356
Hold his hand.

733
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:01,463
You see what James...

734
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,746
is doing?

735
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:15,490
This... is how it's done.

736
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:34,589
Can't we place a pericardial
drain, return to the OR?

737
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,810
His blood pressure
is too low to travel.

738
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:41,503
We can open his
chest at bedside.

739
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:45,580
No.

740
00:37:46,553 --> 00:37:49,936
I can't... tolerate that.

741
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,338
Goodbye...

742
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:01,507
my children.

743
00:38:24,926 --> 00:38:26,993
♪ ♪

744
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:05,243
I am so sorry.

745
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,468
Thanks.

746
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:21,104
I think you and I joined
the same club today.

747
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,797
Yeah. We were
too good for 'em.

748
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:38,989
Listen, if you don't
want to be alone tonight,

749
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,603
we could grab stiff margaritas

750
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:44,503
at Waylon's.

751
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,917
You could tell me
all about Dr. Perry.

752
00:39:49,238 --> 00:39:50,363
Yeah.

753
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,383
I'd like that.

754
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,451
He was a truly great man.

755
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:02,635
I know it's not the outcome
you needed this week...

756
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,886
One of the most famous living
doctors dies at Chastain.

757
00:40:06,244 --> 00:40:07,743
We were honored to treat him.

758
00:40:07,768 --> 00:40:09,584
If he could have been
saved, you'd have done it.

759
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,718
Is it true we're no longer

760
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,755
a level 1 trauma
hospital after today?

761
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,547
I never thought I'd
say it, but yes.

762
00:40:15,572 --> 00:40:17,646
The money is gone,
the fight is over.

763
00:40:17,694 --> 00:40:20,455
You know what, Kit?
Whatever happens,

764
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,954
even if this whole
place shut down tonight,

765
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:25,627
we created something
great here together.

766
00:40:25,652 --> 00:40:27,501
And that will live
on in everyone

767
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:29,855
- who was a part of it.
- Thank you, AJ.

768
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,608
Hey. EMT said I
needed to get this

769
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:34,427
to you right away.
They went back to where

770
00:40:34,452 --> 00:40:36,643
they picked up your patient.
It was in a dumpster.

771
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,268
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

772
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:40,296
There's someone I want
you to say hello to.

773
00:40:42,602 --> 00:40:45,288
Miss Lillian, I want
you to meet someone.

774
00:40:45,313 --> 00:40:49,212
Hello. I'm Kit Voss,
CEO of Chastain.

775
00:40:49,237 --> 00:40:51,813
It's wonderful to
see you on the mend.

776
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,056
We have something
that belongs to you.

777
00:40:57,339 --> 00:40:59,716
My purse.

778
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:02,128
Oh, that's wonderful.

779
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:04,181
Oh, thank heavens.

780
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:07,130
Yeah. No more wallet, obviously.

781
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:09,404
But tissues and...

782
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:12,847
and my bus pass
and-and my lipstick.

783
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:14,878
And-and Werther's!

784
00:41:14,903 --> 00:41:16,161
Here. Have-have some.

785
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:18,186
- Okay.
- Oh.

786
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,445
Gosh, I... I'm just so happy,

787
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,303
I can't tell you. I...

788
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:26,280
To think I almost died
over some worn-out old

789
00:41:26,305 --> 00:41:29,192
- crossbody bag.
- It's the principle of the thing.

790
00:41:29,217 --> 00:41:30,792
That's right.

791
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:34,327
You can't let some jerk just
take what belongs to you.

792
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:40,374
I'm old, but I
fought like a tiger.

793
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:43,815
When I know what's
right, I'm all in.

794
00:42:07,923 --> 00:42:10,273
I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to reroute the patient.

795
00:42:10,298 --> 00:42:13,277
Our trauma center is closing
down in five minutes.

796
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:15,764
- Stroke of midnight, finished.
- What was that?

797
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:18,363
- GSW.
- Oh, good luck getting that rerouted.

798
00:42:18,388 --> 00:42:19,882
Nobody else takes
gunshot wounds.

799
00:42:19,907 --> 00:42:21,443
- I know.
- This is so wrong.

800
00:42:21,468 --> 00:42:24,191
May I have everyone's
attention, please.

801
00:42:25,763 --> 00:42:27,989
I have two announcements.

802
00:42:28,688 --> 00:42:31,097
One, I have meat and veggie,

803
00:42:31,122 --> 00:42:32,753
and for anyone who's vegan,

804
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:35,086
there's salad because I
cannot condone vegan cheese.

805
00:42:35,113 --> 00:42:36,077
Hear, hear.

806
00:42:36,102 --> 00:42:38,951
Two, I have determined

807
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:42,525
that Chastain Trauma will
not be closing tonight.

808
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,641
What?

809
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,411
I repeat, we will not
be closing our doors.

810
00:42:46,436 --> 00:42:49,026
Hey, just kidding.
We'll take that GSW.

811
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:51,108
- What changed?
- I did.

812
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:54,620
I've decided we will not
let a bully destroy us

813
00:42:54,645 --> 00:42:55,954
piece by piece.

814
00:42:55,979 --> 00:42:58,572
He cannot win. We are going to

815
00:42:58,597 --> 00:43:02,340
spend every dime to deliver top
care until the money's gone.

816
00:43:02,365 --> 00:43:05,515
We're not gonna limp along
as a hollowed-out shell.

817
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,299
We are going all in.

818
00:43:07,324 --> 00:43:09,761
Yes! Yes!- -

819
00:43:09,786 --> 00:43:11,640
Come on, before this gets cold.

820
00:43:11,664 --> 00:43:12,900
Grab a slice.
