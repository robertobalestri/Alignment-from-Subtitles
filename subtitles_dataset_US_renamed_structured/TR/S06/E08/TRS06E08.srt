<i>- How much did you scam</i>

4
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:09,265
- the taxpayers for?
- Wait, I remember: One billion dollars,

5
00:00:09,437 --> 00:00:10,985
that you used to finance

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,664
your campaign for governor.

7
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:15,342
Find me every ounce of dirt
on that Dr. Bell.

8
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:17,093
I'm gonna destroy him.

9
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:19,965
<i>Claire avoided American
health care and it killed her.</i>

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,981
It was my fault.

11
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:22,474
I should have
seen the signs earlier.

12
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:25,130
Even if you had, it would
probably have been too late.

13
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:27,234
And maybe we could grab a drink?

14
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,513
That sounds like
just what I need.

15
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:30,028
You cool with them together?

16
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,929
Eh, she can do better.

17
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:35,910
We are here tonight

18
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:40,551
to honor someone who
has done more for Chastain

19
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:43,949
than perhaps
any other one person.

20
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:46,512
He has saved more lives

21
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:48,856
than can possibly be counted.

22
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:53,067
For someone who hates
getting dressed up,

23
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:56,207
you look...

24
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:58,582
It's not actually
the dressing up I mind,

25
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:00,317
it's all the pointless

26
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:02,645
small talk and forced smiling.

27
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:05,356
Well,

28
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:07,687
your dad seems right at home.

29
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:10,981
Like a pig in... mud.

30
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,707
Here to present the award

31
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:16,262
for a lifetime
of service to Dr. Bell

32
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:19,520
is yet another
powerhouse surgeon

33
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:22,012
and our own beloved CEO,

34
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:24,012
Dr. Kit Voss.

35
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:29,410
Thank you, Marshall.

36
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:32,582
I'm very happy to be here
tonight to present this award.

37
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,585
I think you all know that

38
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,905
my admiration for Randolph Bell

39
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:41,274
goes far beyond
his skill as a surgeon,

40
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,324
his dedication as a doctor,

41
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,645
and his kindness
as a human being.

42
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,374
It is my great honor to present

43
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,669
the Lifetime of Service Award

44
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:52,473
to Dr. Randolph Bell.

45
00:02:10,123 --> 00:02:13,161
Dr. Randolph Bell,
you've been served.

at the crack of dawn

50
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,163
counts as a romantic date
for most people,

51
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:53,345
but it sure does hit the spot
for an ER doctor.

52
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:56,432
Want to grab dinner tonight?

53
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,118
We could try that new Thai
place in In man Park.

54
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:01,619
You mean like a real date?

55
00:03:01,704 --> 00:03:03,650
- Mm-hmm.
- Hell yeah.

56
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:05,463
Did you find someone
to watch Gigi?

57
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:07,315
Oh, I'll get right on that.

58
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,908
What do we have?

59
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:22,057
13-year-old male,
Malik Sheridan,

60
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:23,174
possible overdose.

61
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,918
Unknown substance,
likely opioids.

62
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:27,009
Barely a pulse
when we got to him.

63
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:29,455
13? Damn it.

64
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,938
Narcan, four milligrams,
intranasal given.

65
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:33,390
Multiple doses epinephrine.

66
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:35,609
Heart rate's improved,
but he's remained unresponsive.

67
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,619
Attempted intubation
but has a difficult airway.

68
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:39,616
Hypercarbic arrest.
How long has he been out?

69
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,693
At least 20 minutes.
His friend called 911.

70
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:43,835
- Trauma room nine.
- What's your name?

71
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:45,470
- Tally.
- Tally, I'm Dr. Hawkins.

72
00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:46,612
What did Malik take?

73
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:47,688
I don't know.

74
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:49,116
- A pill.
- What kind of pill?

75
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,777
Conrad,
his breathing is shallow.

76
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:52,555
Let's move him
so we can intubate.

77
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:55,032
- Good.
- On my count, one, two,

78
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:56,150
- three.
- Three.

79
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,518
He's gonna
arrest again if we don't

80
00:03:57,602 --> 00:03:59,198
- get him breathing better.
- Let's try drive down

81
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,442
the CO2.

82
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:02,146
Pupils still pinpoint.

83
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:04,544
Let's give him another dose
of Narcan and start a drip.

84
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,345
Pushing Narcan now.

85
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,971
He hasn't
flinched since he got here.

86
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:09,750
- Mac 3, to me.
- On it. Hundley?

87
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:11,053
Go, got it.

88
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:14,036
Intubating now.

89
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:20,200
Good bilateral breath sounds.

90
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:21,812
Get him on the vent.

91
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:23,387
Is he gonna wake up?

92
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,434
We're going to do
everything we can

93
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,770
to make sure that happens.

94
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:27,184
Tally, where'd
the pill come from?

95
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,701
This much Narcan should have
pulled him out of this.

96
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:31,044
Are we missing something?

97
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:32,246
Cerebral edema?

98
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,541
I hope not.

99
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:35,137
Tally, what time...

100
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:36,996
Go, I got him.

101
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:01,555
Can I sit down?

102
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:06,996
He's gonna be so mad.

103
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:08,911
I shouldn't have called 911.

104
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:10,411
When his parents find out...

105
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:12,265
You probably saved his life.

106
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,004
Tally, the pill.

107
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:16,460
Did you see him take it?

108
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:17,962
Do you know where he got it?

109
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:19,950
Amir had it.

110
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:22,075
Malik's older brother.

111
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:25,692
He plays football,
but he hurt his back a while ago.

112
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,239
He got a lot of pills
from the doctor.

113
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:33,138
Careful.

114
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:35,543
I don't think this pill
is from the doctor.

115
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,496
We got to wash those hands.

116
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,364
Even a small amount on your skin
could be dangerous.

117
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:43,673
He's stable.

118
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,246
Percocet.
Definitely counterfeit.

119
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:46,322
Probably fentanyl.

120
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:47,568
Can you get this tested, fast?

121
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:49,340
We've got fentanyl test strips
up front.

122
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:50,881
I'll have results
in five minutes.

123
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,779
Full tox will
take a couple hours.

124
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:55,977
Tally, we need to call
Malik's parents right now.

125
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:57,887
Yeah, and we need to find Amir.

126
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,704
These pills
are really dangerous.

127
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,782
If your friends have more,
we got to find them.

128
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:05,504
You don't want anyone else
to get hurt, do you?

129
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:11,746
Malik's phone.

130
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,900
The password is 61309.

131
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:16,278
My birthday.

132
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,522
I'm not saying
cancel the deposition,

133
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:26,357
but maybe just postpone it
until we have more information.

134
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,435
I've been deposed
a thousand times.

135
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,811
I'm more worried about Leela.

136
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:31,735
'Cause the first time
can be a little rattling.

137
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:33,520
Leela's not the one being sued.

138
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:34,608
It's you in the line of fire.

139
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,271
The case isn't even close.

140
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:38,458
I've gone through all the records.
There's nothing.

141
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:40,693
Claire Williams' sepsis
was so far along

142
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:42,747
that even if the kidney stones
hadn't masked it,

143
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:44,117
we couldn't have saved her.

144
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:46,279
You know that's not
what this is really about.

145
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,724
I know. You think
it's about the governor

146
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,381
and revenge for my performance
at his little press ambush.

147
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:52,177
It's definitely the governor.

148
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,202
And this lawyer, Costican...

149
00:06:54,364 --> 00:06:56,442
I heard he was the governor's
fraternity brother.

150
00:06:56,527 --> 00:06:57,871
And a big campaign donor.

151
00:06:57,956 --> 00:06:58,989
I can handle him.

152
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:00,174
He's a snake.

153
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,731
He wants to embarrass you.

154
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:04,794
Why else would they serve you
a subpoena on stage

155
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,333
in front of hundreds of people
when you're getting an award?

156
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:08,646
It's not like
you're hard to find.

157
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,520
You're here
at the hospital every day.

158
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,658
Oh, please, just postpone it.

159
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:16,629
I don't scare that easy.

160
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:30,465
How is it that a woman
who cuts people open for a living

161
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,160
is nervous about
talking to lawyers?

162
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:35,083
In the OR they're not
hoping I make a mistake.

163
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:37,372
Which is exactly what
these lawyers are doing.

164
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,339
Babe, just tell the truth.

165
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:42,843
What if somehow I end up
saying the wrong thing

166
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,603
and then they use it
against Bell?

167
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:46,129
It's gonna be fine.

168
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:47,514
I promise.

169
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:48,756
How can you be so sure?

170
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,167
Because I know what we did.

171
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:52,115
I've gone over the records,
just like you.

172
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,670
We checked every box
with Claire.

173
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:55,182
It was textbook.

174
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:58,254
And I know what a good doctor
you are.

175
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,207
You're biased.

176
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,404
Test came back on the pill.

177
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:20,681
It was fentanyl for sure.

178
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,715
- Malik's parents are on the way.
- Good.

179
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,809
Cops should be here soon.

180
00:08:23,893 --> 00:08:25,166
You reach the brother yet?

181
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,461
Tried three times. No answer.

182
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:30,416
That... kid's walking around
with poison in his pocket.

183
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,477
If he hasn't taken it yet,
he will.

184
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:33,871
Can you track him?

185
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,223
People track their kids'
phones, right?

186
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:45,000
Amir is at Young man High School.

187
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,149
It's only two miles away.

188
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:48,318
Yeah. Go.

189
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:51,462
Take some Narcan.
Here's extra.

190
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:04,042
<i>Help! Please!</i>

191
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:08,991
Stand back, stand back.

192
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:11,498
Is Robert going to be okay?

193
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:13,641
Is he dead? Oh, my God.

194
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:16,638
He's gone.

195
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,689
I got you, bud.

196
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:27,189
You guys know Amir?

197
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,642
Amir Sheridan.

198
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:31,714
He's a football player.

199
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:34,104
Hey. Come here.
Come here, come here.

200
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:37,246
Keep him on his side.
Keep talking to him, okay?

201
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:41,672
Someone get a teacher out here
until the ambulances comes.

202
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:22,777
Don't volunteer anything.
Only answer the question

203
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,154
that's been asked, nothing more.

204
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:25,580
Yeah, I've done this
before, counselor.

205
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:26,656
Many, many times.

206
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,843
I've... never lost.

207
00:10:30,402 --> 00:10:31,995
I've never settled.

208
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:34,762
So, I know you're just
trying to do your job.

209
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:38,050
But trust me,
this lawsuit is a nuisance.

210
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:44,597
So, what aren't you telling me?

211
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,777
Costican is not
your ordinary lawyer.

212
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:48,967
And this...

213
00:10:50,238 --> 00:10:52,182
Is not your ordinary
malpractice suit.

214
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,504
What do you mean?

215
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:55,294
Most depositions
are pretty tame.

216
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:56,870
This one won't be.

217
00:10:57,675 --> 00:11:00,284
Costican is a loose cannon.

218
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:03,059
He's got private detectives
out there

219
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:05,254
talking to former patients
of yours.

220
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,622
They're digging through
everything.

221
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:09,278
Combing through records.

222
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:11,535
Those records are private.

223
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:12,837
In theory.

224
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:16,261
But these guys are scary
and well-connected.

225
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:19,441
We have to be ready
for anything.

226
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:21,963
So, what are they looking for?

227
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,761
The more important question
is what are they gonna find?

228
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:29,926
We've got three more
teenage overdoses!

229
00:11:30,011 --> 00:11:31,293
Pronounced one dead
at the scene,

230
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:32,584
these two were still alive
when I got there.

231
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:33,418
On it. Bay two.

232
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:34,434
Lost this kid's pulse

233
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,669
about 90 seconds ago.

234
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,120
Take him to trauma room 12.

235
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:39,269
This is Amir Sheridan,
Malik's brother.

236
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:40,692
I think he took a fall
down the bleachers.

237
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:43,120
Head laceration,
probable rib fractures.

238
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:45,363
All right, his breathing's
not so hot.

239
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:46,792
We need to intubate him.

240
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:48,378
Looks like he took
a hell of a spill.

241
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:50,581
Page Neuro. Dr. Sutton
needs to take a look at him.

242
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,871
I got this one.
You go get the others.

243
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:53,524
All right, thank you, man.

244
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:58,311
Come on, sweetie.
Come back to us.

245
00:11:58,396 --> 00:11:59,964
Let's get ready to intubate.

246
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:01,649
Pulse-rhythm check.

247
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:05,883
No pulse.

248
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,394
- Pulmonary embolism?
- Resume compressions.

249
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:11,120
Let's give him another round
of epi, bicarb and calcium.

250
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:13,488
Airway definitely not secure.

251
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:15,620
Preparing to intubate.
I need an RT in here.

252
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:16,941
I thought it was an overdose.

253
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:19,159
He passed out and fell.
Head trauma.

254
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:21,183
Looks like rib fractures
on the right.

255
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:22,909
Pulse is strong,
so we got something.

256
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:24,020
Have you checked pupils yet?

257
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:25,355
Nope, it's all you.

258
00:12:25,597 --> 00:12:28,542
Give me 20 of etomidate
and 150 of sux.

259
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,528
Uneven pupils.
That's not good.

260
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:34,581
Definite trauma to the brain.

261
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,515
That kid never stood a chance.

262
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,081
By the time Conrad got to him,
he was already gone.

263
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,769
These fentanyl overdoses
just keep climbing.

264
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,496
Crazy.

265
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:55,000
Pushing past 200 a day,
nationally.

266
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,871
Kids are supposed to learn
from their mistakes,

267
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:58,605
not die from them.

268
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,902
And this one here is gonna
need both of our expertise.

269
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:03,406
It's a damn shame.

270
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:07,920
Meet you in CT.

271
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:13,597
That's two minutes.

272
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:15,081
Pause compressions.

273
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,519
We got a pulse.

274
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,870
His brain has been
without oxygen

275
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:22,035
- for a long time.
- Yeah,

276
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:23,425
we've given him a shot.

277
00:13:23,518 --> 00:13:24,839
Not time to celebrate just yet.

278
00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:26,050
We'll get him to the ICU

279
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:27,240
and send him through
the scanner on the way.

280
00:13:27,324 --> 00:13:28,917
Good.
I'll go check on Malik.

281
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:32,270
Hey, I heard you had a bunch
of overdosed kids in the ER.

282
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:33,934
I came down, I wanted
to see if I could help.

283
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:36,378
Uh, yeah, multiple cases
of fentanyl poisoning.

284
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:38,199
This kid had a PEA arrest
on the way in,

285
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,269
we got him back,
but it's not clear what's left.

286
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:42,033
So, nothing surgical?

287
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:44,675
Dr. Austin and Dr. Sutton
have a head trauma

288
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,521
that'll probably
end up in the OR.

289
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:49,109
Okay, right.
I-I'll check with them.

290
00:13:57,863 --> 00:14:00,409
This one of
the fentanyl overdoses?

291
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:01,753
So young.

292
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:03,991
Yeah. 13.

293
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,097
Two of the older ones
are in real trouble.

294
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:12,079
Another one was dead
at the scene.

295
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,319
You find the rest of the pills?

296
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:18,893
Yep. Older brother
had them in his pocket.

297
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:21,925
13 years old, kid probably
never took anything stronger

298
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,761
than an aspirin before.

299
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,613
We should not be saying
they overdosed.

300
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,316
That kid was poisoned.

301
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,784
<i>Dr. Devi,</i>

302
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,902
at what point
was it clear to you

303
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:34,812
that Claire Williams
would need surgery?

304
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,417
Well, when the kidney stone
was resolved,

305
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,511
she developed an acute abdomen.

306
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:42,511
Culture showed florid
gram-negative bacteremia.

307
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:44,011
Her lactate was very high.

308
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,253
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

309
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:47,059
Have you assisted Dr. Bell
in surgery before?

310
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:48,214
Yes, many times.

311
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:52,030
And how many of those patients
have died under Dr. Bell's care?

312
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:53,985
Object to form.

313
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:59,238
I don't know
a specific number...

314
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:01,058
So, you have seen Dr. Bell kill,

315
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:03,152
or, uh, lose a patient before?

316
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,822
Object to form.

317
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:07,167
Mr. Costican, please.

318
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:08,503
There's no jury here.

319
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,316
Theatrics aren't necessary.

320
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:15,883
Do you believe the surgery
performed by Dr. Bell

321
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:18,703
was a factor in
Claire Williams' death?

322
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:22,070
I am certain she would have died
without the surgery.

323
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,797
She was already
in refractory shock

324
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,445
and she was clearly ischemic.

325
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,933
The surgery was the only way
to save her.

326
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,102
<i>Were you aware that Dr. Bell</i>

327
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:32,711
received financial compensation

328
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:34,992
from a medical device
company, QuoVadis,

329
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:37,695
whose products he recommended
to Chastain patients?

330
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,948
Objection, relevancy.

331
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:40,208
No, sir.

332
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:42,211
Dr. Bell's financial affairs
are not...

333
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:44,188
So, you were not aware
that artificial heart valves

334
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:45,203
made by this company

335
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:47,114
resulted in
patient deaths at Chastain?

336
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,641
Objection, relevancy.

337
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:51,289
No. I'm not a heart surgeon.

338
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:54,237
I assume you're familiar
with the symptoms of, uh,

339
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:56,242
multiple sclerosis?

340
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:58,062
Yes.

341
00:15:58,147 --> 00:15:59,312
Could you describe them?

342
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:04,806
Symptoms vary widely
from patient to patient.

343
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:07,821
- And some may be asymptomatic for long periods of time...
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

344
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:09,282
What would be typical?

345
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,687
MS can cause neural disruption

346
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:14,373
between the brain
and the rest of the body.

347
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,836
This can cause numbness

348
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:18,506
or weakness in parts
of the body, tremors, sometimes.

349
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:20,508
Would any of those
symptoms interfere

350
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:22,001
with one's ability
to perform surgery?

351
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,512
Object to form.

352
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:25,417
They could.

353
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:27,940
But hundreds of thousands
of people in this country alone

354
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:29,849
are living normal lives with MS.

355
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,758
Plenty of surgeons with MS

356
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:33,851
who are successfully
operating today.

357
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:34,936
Thank you, Dr. "Pravish."

358
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:37,300
It's Pravesh.

359
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:39,087
Pravesh.

360
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,459
Thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

361
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:43,648
Dr. Pravesh,

362
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,639
have you ever heard
Dr. Bell referred to

363
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:47,668
by the nickname HODAD?

364
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:51,707
Excuse me?

365
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,528
Have you ever heard
Dr. Bell referred to

366
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,273
by the nickname HODAD?

367
00:16:57,588 --> 00:17:01,099
It stands for
Hands of Death and Destruction.

368
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,969
I don't...

369
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,985
No one refers to Dr. Bell
that way now.

370
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:12,539
Now.

371
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,830
But in the past?

372
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,305
I don't recall.

373
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:26,398
Costican is hellbent on arguing
this in a courtroom.

374
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:28,943
Now, have you stopped
to ask yourself why?

375
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:32,820
Because I see
a big, waving red flag.

376
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:36,843
Now, you and I both know that
Randolph is a great surgeon,

377
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:41,101
but the things that could
come up in a prolonged trial...

378
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,273
You think he should settle?

379
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:45,015
I do.

380
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:46,641
But he did nothing wrong.

381
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:47,977
That might not matter.

382
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:50,314
This is bigger than
any one patient

383
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:51,816
or even one doctor.

384
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,851
It's a fragile moment
for Chastain.

385
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:58,422
If he loses this suit,

386
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:00,781
we all lose.

387
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,149
<i>Sorry to bother,
uh, I'm the new scrub tech.</i>

388
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,873
I just wanted to say
I look forward

389
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:24,750
to working with you in the OR.

390
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:27,225
You're up, Dr. Bell.

391
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,281
Just, uh, just give me
two minutes.

392
00:18:32,366 --> 00:18:34,785
So, you're done already?

393
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:36,633
Yes.

394
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,094
How'd it go?

395
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:40,340
It was, um, it was fine.

396
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:43,966
Not great.

397
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:49,414
Have you seen Jessica?

398
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:50,819
No.

399
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:52,923
Will you talk to her for me?

400
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,547
I'm...
I'm gonna need her help.

401
00:18:56,008 --> 00:18:57,532
<i>What are the criteria</i>

402
00:18:57,617 --> 00:19:00,250
used to make a differential
diagnosis of sepsis?

403
00:19:00,335 --> 00:19:01,976
Well, there's no specific test.

404
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:04,797
A diagnosis of sepsis requires
the presence of infection,

405
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,891
whether it's proven
or suspected.

406
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:09,567
Usually very low blood pressure,
rapid heart rate.

407
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:11,750
Sometimes increased
breathing rate, fever.

408
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:13,532
And all those were present
in Claire Williams

409
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:15,226
when she was first examined?

410
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,414
I did not perform that exam.

411
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:20,430
I'm sorry, you...

412
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:22,874
you didn't examine
your patient before surgery?

413
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,544
I did. You referred
to the first examination.

414
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:26,931
I didn't perform
her initial exam.

415
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:27,840
Of course I...

416
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,285
examined her prior to surgery.

417
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,031
But still, no diagnosis
of the sepsis

418
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:33,461
until Claire Williams
is already in surgery?

419
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:35,127
- Object to form.
- No.

420
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:37,130
- Sometimes surgery is exploratory...
- Is it true

421
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:38,798
that after Claire Williams
was declared dead,

422
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:41,375
you said to Dr. Devi, quote,

423
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,226
"It was my fault, I should have
seen the signs earlier"?

424
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:49,294
No, I don't recall that.

425
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,721
I apologize
for the interruption,

426
00:19:54,806 --> 00:19:56,907
but Dr. Bell is needed
in emergency surgery.

427
00:19:57,007 --> 00:19:58,837
Uh, we're in the middle
of a deposition.

428
00:19:58,922 --> 00:19:59,911
Surely there's
another surgeon who...

429
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,972
Well, apparently,
I have a life to save,

430
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:06,112
so this legal colonoscopy
can wait for another day.

431
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:11,645
- Thanks.
- No problem. I hate lawyers.

432
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:13,391
Thought your brother
was a lawyer.

433
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:14,986
Exactly.

434
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,426
According to his CT,
there's definitely

435
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:23,938
a hemothorax on the right side.

436
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,179
Subdermal hematoma
and uncal herniation I'm seeing

437
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:28,681
gives us very little time.
We've got to his skull open

438
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:30,588
- if he's gonna have any chance.
- That's all you.

439
00:20:30,672 --> 00:20:31,860
Brains before lungs.

440
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:33,946
I'll take care
of the chest tube in the OR.

441
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:36,947
- Oh, his heart rate's dropping.
- Ah, damn it.

442
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:38,524
We're really coming
down to the wire here.

443
00:20:38,608 --> 00:20:40,937
Get him on the table
and we can scrub in.

444
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:50,672
How's the kid?

445
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:51,757
Malik?

446
00:20:52,027 --> 00:20:54,375
Woke up long enough
to extubate him.

447
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:57,187
Think he's gonna be okay.

448
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,281
How was the deposition?

449
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:02,572
- They asked me about HODAD.
- HODAD?

450
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:04,672
- What did you say?
- Well, I...

451
00:21:04,757 --> 00:21:06,143
I dodged it.

452
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:08,541
But it didn't really matter.
They clearly already knew.

453
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:13,469
Kid's awake.

454
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:20,168
Hey, buddy.

455
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:23,487
How you feeling?

456
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,961
- Terrible.
- I bet.

457
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:37,981
Your brother and some of
his friends took the same pills.

458
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,593
Your brother took
a pretty bad fall.

459
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:43,015
He's in surgery right now.

460
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:46,205
Is he gonna be okay?

461
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:49,141
I don't know yet.

462
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:55,211
One of his friends, Robert...

463
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,443
He didn't make it.

464
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,582
Tally?

465
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:07,953
She didn't take anything.

466
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:11,094
You're lucky to have her.

467
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:13,312
You almost died.

468
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,969
She probably saved your life.

469
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,450
My best friend.

470
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:25,281
- I don't know what I'd do without her.
- Yeah,

471
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:27,210
I know the feeling.

472
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:30,236
When can I see my brother?

473
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:31,953
He's still in surgery.

474
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,142
But I'll take you up
when he comes out.

475
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:42,406
Resecting the dura.

476
00:22:43,008 --> 00:22:46,742
How do these kids overdose
at school on a Wednesday morning?

477
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:48,900
Conrad told me
he was prescribed Percocet

478
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:50,047
for the football injury.

479
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:51,484
And when it ran out...

480
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:53,673
He probably went
looking for more.

481
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:55,688
Guessing he found it online.

482
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:57,360
Most of the counterfeit pills

483
00:22:57,445 --> 00:22:59,282
on the street these days are fentanyl.
It's cheaper

484
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:01,056
than dirt
and incredibly powerful,

485
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:03,415
so all the illegal labs
mix it into everything.

486
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,242
Poisoning your
customers can't be good for business.

487
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,876
Okay, dissecting down
to the intercostals.

488
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:10,538
Kelly clamp.

489
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:14,439
I need double suction.

490
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:16,975
There's blood everywhere.

491
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:20,461
Ablate one area
and another one starts bleeding.

492
00:23:22,256 --> 00:23:23,597
Found it.

493
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,099
Cauterizing the source vessel.

494
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:27,694
Through the intercostals,
into the pleural spaces.

495
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:29,179
32 chest tube.

496
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:31,762
His cortex is very swollen.

497
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,389
I'm not sure
we got here in time.

498
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,199
You've given him the best chance
against permanent brain damage.

499
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:41,185
There's too many close calls.

500
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:45,199
This young man is definitely
dancing with death today.

501
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:03,322
You need
something, Dr. Sullivan?

502
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:05,021
Oh, hey, uh, no, I was...

503
00:24:05,106 --> 00:24:07,028
I was just checking on something

504
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,477
I-I noticed before that was...

505
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:12,905
You know, I once caught a nurse
swiping drugs off my cart.

506
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,377
Poor thing
was totally strung out.

507
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,692
That's terrible.

508
00:24:17,902 --> 00:24:20,079
- What happened?
- I had to report it.

509
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:22,840
Lost her job,
destroyed her career.

510
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:24,363
Sad, really.

511
00:24:24,448 --> 00:24:25,804
She was a great nurse.

512
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:27,832
That's tough.

513
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:29,880
- That's a loss, huh?
- Well,

514
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:32,270
addiction doesn't discriminate.

515
00:24:32,494 --> 00:24:34,255
Could happen to anyone.

516
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,429
Okay, yeah, uh...

517
00:24:37,514 --> 00:24:39,173
it seems fine now.

518
00:24:39,257 --> 00:24:40,216
Okay.

519
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:41,957
Thank you, Dr. Lee.

520
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:49,707
- Finished so soon.
- Yeah.

521
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,316
That was fast. How did it go?

522
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:53,254
We're on a break,
which I manufactured.

523
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:55,332
- That bad?
- It was brutal.

524
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:56,918
What did Marshall say?

525
00:24:57,451 --> 00:24:59,277
It... it was good, routine.

526
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:01,155
He's totally behind you.

527
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:04,527
You're a terrible liar.

528
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:05,625
I'm an excellent liar.

529
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:07,301
You just know me too well.

530
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:10,903
The truth is Marshall's worried.

531
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:12,918
He thinks maybe
you should settle.

532
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:18,004
Settling would be admitting
there was a mistake.

533
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:20,100
And there wasn't one.

534
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,574
I trust your judgment.

535
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:25,903
- But?
- The stress is bad for you.

536
00:25:25,988 --> 00:25:28,856
And don't tell me you can handle it.

537
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:31,767
This isn't about
your emotional fortitude.

538
00:25:32,012 --> 00:25:34,012
It's about your MS.

539
00:25:36,563 --> 00:25:37,872
Okay.

540
00:25:37,957 --> 00:25:39,485
Uh...

541
00:25:40,577 --> 00:25:42,090
No, you're right, I...

542
00:25:42,684 --> 00:25:43,837
As usual.

543
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:48,121
Uh, yeah, all right, let's...

544
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,246
settle this thing.

545
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:27,030
They refused to settle?
Just like that? Just refused?

546
00:26:27,115 --> 00:26:28,541
And, also...

547
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:31,655
this OR tech from the surgery,

548
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,107
Donald Killian.

549
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,834
What's he saying?

550
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:37,866
He's saying you were showing
symptoms of MS in the surgery.

551
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,297
What-what symptoms?!
That's...

552
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:42,647
that's ridiculous.

553
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:45,895
This guy begged
to be part of the surgery.

554
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,897
He's a plant.

555
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:49,006
It... it's all payback.

556
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:52,255
My MS had nothing to do
with Claire dying.

557
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:55,053
I could have been completely
cured or flat on my back,

558
00:26:55,138 --> 00:26:57,021
she was gonna die from sepsis.

559
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,178
We need to get back.

560
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,491
It's gonna be okay.

561
00:27:06,576 --> 00:27:08,888
Of course it is.

562
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:13,200
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

563
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:20,787
What do we do?

564
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:41,833
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- Sure. What's up?

565
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,986
- You look awful.
- C-Close the door, would you?

566
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:47,503
What's going on?

567
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:48,741
I'm, um...

568
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:51,773
I'm in a bit of a jam.

569
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:53,482
Dad, you're scaring me.

570
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:55,217
Don't.

571
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:04,395
Where did you get this?

572
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:06,472
It was in the operating room.

573
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:08,521
Left over after a surgery.

574
00:28:11,695 --> 00:28:13,323
I was going to use it.

575
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:17,670
- On myself.
- You what?

576
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:20,411
Let me explain, okay?

577
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:23,210
It was a mistake.
Obviously, I know that, okay?

578
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:25,279
That's why I called you.

579
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:27,655
Look, everything
under control, okay?

580
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,858
I... It was-it was
perfectly sound, medically.

581
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:31,406
I ca-I can
show you the protocol.

582
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:33,986
What in God's name
are you talking about?

583
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:35,625
My meds, for...

584
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:37,846
fatigue and a-anxiety...

585
00:28:37,931 --> 00:28:40,221
I-I... I balance them
very carefully.

586
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:42,643
They allow me
to perform miracles in the OR.

587
00:28:42,728 --> 00:28:44,502
- It's just, it got...
- This isn't Xanax,

588
00:28:44,587 --> 00:28:46,401
this is Propofol.
This could kill you.

589
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:47,713
Kincaid, please!
I just, I'm...

590
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:50,441
I called you, okay?
I need your help. Okay?

591
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:51,851
So, please.

592
00:28:51,935 --> 00:28:54,759
Look, originally,
they were prescribed. And then,

593
00:28:54,908 --> 00:28:56,573
in the move and...

594
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:58,841
and then changing doctors,
like...

595
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:00,846
I can handle
my own medical condition.

596
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:02,291
Bell is on meds.
He-he...

597
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,744
he couldn't function
without them.

598
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,228
I-I...
It's the same for me,

599
00:29:05,313 --> 00:29:06,729
except my condition
is brain-based...

600
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:09,173
- Fatigue, anxiety, depression.
- Well, if that were true,

601
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:11,751
you'd be under the care
of a medicating psychiatrist.

602
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:13,189
- Why aren't you?
- Absolutely.

603
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:16,077
You're absolutely right.
I-I should be, I just...

604
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,907
We're-we're a little late...

605
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,812
for that.

606
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:24,712
Don't you understand
what it's like...

607
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,033
What is required of me
every time I go in there,

608
00:29:27,118 --> 00:29:29,619
being a pediatric surgeon...
What that-what that feels like?

609
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:31,642
The... Holding the precious
lives in my hands,

610
00:29:31,727 --> 00:29:33,674
the-the parents begging me
to save their children.

611
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:35,987
- Hour after hour, day after day...
- Okay, you have to stop

612
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:37,556
this endless rationalizing.

613
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:39,695
You're too smart
not to see this for what it is.

614
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,473
- You are an addict.
- Okay.

615
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:44,432
You know the diagnostic criteria
as well as I do.

616
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:45,884
I saved Padma's twins.

617
00:29:45,969 --> 00:29:47,370
On my regime.
It works.

618
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,384
The-the pills make it possible.

619
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:50,890
- But without...
- Oh, my God, this is crazy.

620
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:52,844
This is crazy.

621
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:55,391
You're right.

622
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:58,278
You're right.

623
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,232
It's like I-I want
to stop, I need...

624
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:03,098
I need to stop.

625
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:04,587
And I need your help.

626
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:06,672
I know that I need help.

627
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:08,874
What are you asking me for?

628
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,126
Prescribe me my medication.

629
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:12,658
Just, it-it's legal.

630
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:15,313
And then, over time,
gradually titrate me off.

631
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,641
Monitor my progress.
We can do this.

632
00:30:18,205 --> 00:30:21,923
Oh, my God.
I am not enabling this.

633
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:24,574
- You cannot ensnare me in your addiction.
- Okay, okay, just...

634
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:26,657
- How dare you?
- Okay, you're right, I'm sorry.

635
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,052
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

636
00:30:29,137 --> 00:30:29,995
You're absolutely right.

637
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,134
I'm just a little desperate.

638
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:32,945
I'm grasping at straws.

639
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:35,266
I would never...

640
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:37,610
I would never
do anything to hurt you.

641
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:39,980
You know that.

642
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:48,457
- All right, I will help you.
- Thank you.

643
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,109
We can...

644
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:51,994
find you the right
rehab facility...

645
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,157
I'm not going to a rehab.
Kincaid.

646
00:30:55,242 --> 00:30:57,531
We're i-we're in the middle
of, uh, uh, fund raising

647
00:30:57,616 --> 00:30:59,459
for the new
pediatric surgical center.

648
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,536
- I... Look, things are going well.
- I-I'm not

649
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,993
negotiating this with you, Dad.

650
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:04,313
If you want my help, this is it.

651
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:06,090
Either you go to rehab

652
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:07,071
or I have to report you.

653
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,967
Well, you're not
doing that, obviously.

654
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:12,126
Come on. That...

655
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,838
I would be fired.
My career, everything...

656
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:14,971
It would-it would
be up in smoke.

657
00:31:15,055 --> 00:31:17,294
There's another way, Kincaid.
I-I can't go to rehab.

658
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:18,657
Then I'm going to Dr. Voss.

659
00:31:18,742 --> 00:31:21,085
No, please, come...
Uh, anything that you want.

660
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,464
But you cannot tell Voss.

661
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,192
And you cannot tell Conrad.
That's just...

662
00:31:24,277 --> 00:31:26,136
It's just a line we can't cross.

663
00:31:26,221 --> 00:31:28,622
I told you,
I am not bargaining with you.

664
00:31:28,707 --> 00:31:30,701
Hawkins will go to Voss.
You know that.

665
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:33,048
And then everything
is over for me.

666
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:36,074
All right? No one's gonna
have a-a pediatric surgeon

667
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,745
on their staff
who has a drug problem.

668
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,747
All right?

669
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:41,416
Think of all that would be lost.

670
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:42,818
Years and years of training,

671
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:45,915
all the lives
that I still could save.

672
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:49,532
I can fix this.
With your help.

673
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,404
Just don't tell anyone.

674
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:54,532
Come on, you can
do that much for me.

675
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,125
If you go to rehab...

676
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,969
I won't tell anyone.

677
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:03,637
Not even Conrad.

678
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:08,018
I will lie for you,

679
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:09,928
one last time.

680
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,977
And then... I'm done.

681
00:32:16,045 --> 00:32:17,906
Thanks.

682
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:21,359
Thank you.

683
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:24,060
I'll make some calls.

684
00:32:31,203 --> 00:32:32,679
You okay?

685
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:34,826
Yeah.

686
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:37,305
You want to talk?

687
00:32:37,468 --> 00:32:39,052
No, I'm good.

688
00:32:39,643 --> 00:32:41,329
Hey, um...

689
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:44,156
can we rain check
on tonight?

690
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,314
My dad has a conference
in Dallas

691
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,938
and I said I'd drive him
to the airport.

692
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,344
Of course.

693
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:54,666
After this kind of day,
I just want to get home

694
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:57,540
and hold on to Gigi
till she's 18.

695
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,511
See you tomorrow?

696
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,015
Well, that was
hairier than expected.

697
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,001
Understatement of the year.

698
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:15,336
This young man is lucky

699
00:33:15,421 --> 00:33:16,917
you were on you were
your A game today, Sutton.

700
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:19,244
Mm.
It's a pleasure riding shotgun

701
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:20,525
with you, Dr. Austin.

702
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:23,028
Placing an epidural drain.

703
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:24,771
Now, before I close the skin,

704
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:28,059
why don't you give us
a look at those pupils, Dr. Chu?

705
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,237
Sluggish, but equal
and reactive.

706
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:36,090
All right, well, that's hopeful.

707
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,633
But not definitive.

708
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,620
It'll be days
before we really know.

709
00:33:40,704 --> 00:33:42,881
Yeah, well, he's young,
that helps.

710
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:46,376
So, whatever happens,
it's gonna be a long road.

711
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:48,945
I hate these wait-and-see cases.

712
00:33:49,216 --> 00:33:52,244
Take a horrible tragedy
and amp it up with uncertainty...

713
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:54,102
Feels cruel.

714
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:57,845
All right,

715
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,806
let's close him up
and get him off this table.

716
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:01,368
Hear, hear.

717
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:04,740
<i>"Breathe In Bleed Out"

Hey.

723
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:10,543
How'd it go with the lawyers?

724
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,496
Uh, it's-it's pretty routine.

725
00:35:12,581 --> 00:35:15,031
- Uh, listen.
- What's up?

726
00:35:15,232 --> 00:35:16,409
I want to ask you a favor.

727
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:17,542
All right.

728
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:19,816
Just between us, I'm just having

729
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:21,739
a little bit of a flare-up.
It's nothing serious.

730
00:35:21,823 --> 00:35:23,556
- Mm-hmm.
- Just a little numbness in my hand,

731
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,874
a little tremor.

732
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,862
And I don't want to make
a big thing out of it.

733
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:27,894
It would upset Kit.

734
00:35:27,978 --> 00:35:30,471
So, I was thinking just a quick
hit of prednisone...

735
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:31,891
would knock it down.

736
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:35,348
Shouldn't your neurologist
prescribe that?

737
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,221
Well, yeah, but she's away at
a conference this weekend, so...

738
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:39,572
I understand.

739
00:35:39,698 --> 00:35:40,999
I'll give it to you, just...

740
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:43,349
you need to see your
neurologist when she gets back.

<i>♪ Breathe in ♪</i>

743
00:36:01,756 --> 00:36:03,632
The illustrious Dr. Voss.

744
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:05,425
Governor.

745
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,357
Uh, gentlemen,
will you excuse us?

746
00:36:13,217 --> 00:36:16,597
<i>The case is super solid.
Do not settle with her.</i>

747
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:20,666
Please, Dr. Voss, sit.

748
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,701
Can I get you a drink?

749
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:27,036
I'm not staying.

750
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:28,701
So...

751
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:32,291
you came here
to try to beg for mercy

752
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:33,885
on behalf of your husband?

753
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:36,036
I don't beg, Governor.

754
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,812
But I am willing to negotiate.

755
00:36:37,897 --> 00:36:40,541
So, why don't you tell me
exactly what you want

756
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,394
and we can try and sort this out
like adults.

757
00:36:42,478 --> 00:36:43,992
Well, you know,
I don't give a rat's ass

758
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,640
about Chastain Hospital.

759
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:48,343
Although my polling
is awfully convincing that

760
00:36:48,428 --> 00:36:51,006
the high price of health care
is a winning issue.

761
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,804
You know, the truth is...

762
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,530
your hubby picked a fight
with the wrong man.

763
00:36:58,615 --> 00:37:01,006
He tried to embarrass me.

764
00:37:01,295 --> 00:37:03,381
And I'm afraid that can't stand.

765
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,693
I got to make an example of him.

766
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:08,478
So, what I want

767
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,904
is for Dr. Randolph Bell
to lose his job,

768
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:14,468
possibly his medical license,

769
00:37:14,553 --> 00:37:17,904
and whatever shred
of a reputation he still enjoys.

770
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:21,654
The truth is, Governor,
that you miscalculated.

771
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:24,718
Because you think
Randolph Bell is like you:

772
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:27,180
Vain, self-important,
small-minded.

773
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:29,499
Hungry for money and power.

774
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,256
But the thing about
men like that... men like you...

775
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,654
Is that more than anything,
they're afraid.

776
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:35,872
Sad, really.

777
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,890
But Randolph Bell is not afraid.

778
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:39,937
Because he's not
fighting for himself,

779
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:41,631
he's fighting for what's right.

780
00:37:41,756 --> 00:37:44,522
You think that
by attacking his reputation

781
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:47,343
and livelihood that
it's gonna make him back down,

782
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:48,413
scare him away?

783
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:50,369
Well, it scared him enough
to send you here.

784
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:51,910
Oh, he doesn't know I'm here.

785
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:55,491
And, honestly, I only came
because I'd rather see Dr. Bell

786
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:58,452
saving lives than wasting
his time fighting with you

787
00:37:58,536 --> 00:37:59,937
and your little attack dog.

788
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:01,593
I thought you came to negotiate.

789
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:03,639
Yeah, I know.

790
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:06,460
But now that we've talked,
I realize there's no point.

791
00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:08,313
You've got nothing to offer.

792
00:38:08,522 --> 00:38:11,557
Yeah, my lawyer tells me
we have a strong case.

793
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:13,559
You don't.

794
00:38:13,897 --> 00:38:16,132
And when, eventually,
they throw out your lawsuit,

795
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:18,788
expect to see me
on the courthouse steps

796
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:21,077
with a dozen
of Atlanta's best doctors

797
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:22,444
talking to the press

798
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:24,749
about how nuisance
malpractice lawsuits

799
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:26,941
are driving up the cost
of hospital care.

800
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:29,962
I think it's a winning issue.

801
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,417
That was a rough one, huh?

802
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,511
Well, my part was a cakewalk

803
00:38:57,865 --> 00:38:59,805
compared to what Billie did.

804
00:39:00,412 --> 00:39:02,577
You know, there's a reason
a picture of your face

805
00:39:02,662 --> 00:39:04,852
is on the side of the building.

806
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:07,041
He's stable.

807
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:10,685
We won't know what the damage is
until he wakes up.

808
00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:13,194
How's the little brother?

809
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,406
He's gonna be okay.

810
00:39:15,928 --> 00:39:17,790
Those poor parents.

811
00:39:18,514 --> 00:39:20,562
You know, I don't think
I ever quite understood

812
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:22,999
what it meant
to have your children

813
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:26,077
walking around
a dangerous world.

814
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:32,352
You know, I've talked
to countless parents, but now...

815
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:33,790
...it hits different.

816
00:39:34,014 --> 00:39:35,900
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

817
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:38,915
My twins aren't even crawling

818
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,161
and I'm terrified
for them already.

819
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:43,499
Nothing really prepared me
for how different

820
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:46,288
being a doctor felt
after having Gigi.

821
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:48,202
Never truly realized
how fragile we are

822
00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:50,575
until I held my own
flesh and blood in my arms.

823
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,077
Yeah.

824
00:39:52,162 --> 00:39:54,507
Now, some part of my brain's
always thinking about

825
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,031
the different ways
Gigi might get hurt.

826
00:39:59,404 --> 00:40:00,851
You know, you're not
really selling

827
00:40:00,936 --> 00:40:03,059
the parenthood thing here.

828
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:06,005
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

829
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,781
But thank God
I don't have twins.

830
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,286
That's not helping
either, Hawkins.

831
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:21,786
Hey.

832
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:25,160
Hey.
How'd the deposition go?

833
00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:26,279
Pretty smooth,

834
00:40:26,364 --> 00:40:28,388
though that lawyer
was a piece of work.

835
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:29,695
Yeah.

836
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:33,217
I wouldn't want to be Bell
right now, or Kit.

837
00:40:33,302 --> 00:40:34,943
Like dealing with
his MS diagnosis

838
00:40:35,028 --> 00:40:36,686
wasn't bad enough, and now this.

839
00:40:37,294 --> 00:40:40,248
Well, I think with
the right person by your side,

840
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,395
you can deal with
even the worst stuff.

841
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:46,232
Well, thankfully neither of us
have to face what they do,

842
00:40:46,317 --> 00:40:49,724
but if we ever do, I definitely
want you riding shotgun.

843
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:52,927
Mm. Although I'm pretty sure
you're riding shotgun.

844
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:55,434
You know
I'm a better driver than you.

845
00:40:55,779 --> 00:40:57,513
In a car, maybe.

846
00:40:57,597 --> 00:41:01,477
But in life? Uh...

847
00:41:06,684 --> 00:41:08,337
What are you still doing here?

848
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,532
I thought
you'd gone home hours ago.

849
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:11,623
Just waiting for you.

850
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,695
There's nothing for me
at home if you're here.

851
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:16,819
You're sweet.

852
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:20,192
What's wrong?

853
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:23,605
I may have done
something stupid.

854
00:41:24,427 --> 00:41:26,567
Well, I think that's unlikely.

855
00:41:27,446 --> 00:41:29,116
I met with the governor.

856
00:41:30,192 --> 00:41:31,973
I know.
But I really thought

857
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:34,028
we could come to
an understanding.

858
00:41:34,223 --> 00:41:36,961
Get him to drop the lawsuit
or at least settle.

859
00:41:37,045 --> 00:41:38,567
And that didn't happen?

860
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:41,137
I thought maybe
we were being paranoid.

861
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:43,892
But it's real and it's personal.

862
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,463
This guy wants to destroy you.

863
00:41:47,786 --> 00:41:51,427
I may have
lost my temper, slightly.

864
00:41:52,153 --> 00:41:54,255
Why are you smiling?

865
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,647
This is far from over.

866
00:41:57,075 --> 00:41:58,990
We are in for
one hell of a fight.

867
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:00,123
No, I know.

868
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,674
But whatever they bring at us,

869
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:03,304
we'll face it.

870
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:14,880
Are you ready?

871
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,512
We're really gonna do this, huh?

872
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:22,157
I wanted to, um...

873
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:25,176
stop by my place
and-and get a few things.

874
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:27,520
- Toothbrush.
- I'll buy you a new one.

875
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:33,459
How long a drive is it?

876
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:35,507
Couple hours.

877
00:42:38,197 --> 00:42:39,598
You know this place?

878
00:42:39,755 --> 00:42:43,469
No, but they've got
a great reputation.

879
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:44,862
They focus on treating doctors.

880
00:42:44,946 --> 00:42:46,232
There's no shortage of docs

881
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:47,833
who struggle with addiction.

882
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:53,367
I'm scared, Kincaid.

883
00:42:54,347 --> 00:42:56,028
I know.

884
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,270
Me too.

885
