2
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:03,342
Just an email
Ian forwarded me.

3
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,642
How is everything with him?

4
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:07,629
<i>Passed his drug
test. Operating up a storm...</i>

5
00:00:07,994 --> 00:00:09,630
Fine, I guess.

6
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:11,406
Seems crazy.

7
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,382
But we all cover up things
we don't want to see.

8
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:14,969
The longer we look away,

9
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:17,852
the harder it gets to see
what's right before our eyes.

10
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:21,875
I know what will make me smile.

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,648
Showing you photos
of the exquisite venue

12
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,875
where in a few short weeks,

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,988
I will marry
the man of my dreams.

14
00:00:30,993 --> 00:00:34,567
<i>Pachelbel's "Canon in D"
playing...</i>

15
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:53,993
Sorry, everyone.

16
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:55,892
It's the governor's office.
I have to take this.

17
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:57,962
Okay, let's, uh,
just give her a minute.

18
00:00:58,047 --> 00:01:01,594
Sure, yeah.
Let's, uh, let's all take five.

19
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:04,486
Daddy, when's Sammie
gonna be here?

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,134
She and Jake are on their way.

21
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,838
And they're bringing
your flower girl dresses

22
00:01:07,923 --> 00:01:09,900
for the ceremony tonight,
isn't that exciting?

23
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:11,210
Yeah!

24
00:01:11,306 --> 00:01:13,368
So, when is he available?

25
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:16,410
Well, I certainly hope so.
Thank you.

26
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:17,774
Everything all right?

27
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,149
Our new governor's been
avoiding my calls all week

28
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:22,029
and now his office
won't even set a meeting.

29
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:24,492
He's probably too busy
making plans to slash funding

30
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:25,946
for public hospitals
like Chastain.

31
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:28,470
And it'll be hard to change
his mind if he keeps dodging me.

32
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:31,887
I know you're worried,
but we'll figure it out.

33
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:33,797
Just not today.

34
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,204
I know we will.

35
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:37,852
And I won't let anything
spoil this evening.

36
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:39,931
Hi. - Boo!

37
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,721
Hi,
everyone, sorry we're so late.

38
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:42,805
- Oh...
- Not at all.

39
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,704
Oh, it's lovely to see you.

40
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,417
I'm just sorry Gregg
couldn't make it.

41
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:47,963
- Yeah.
- Glad you could make it.

42
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:50,344
Oh, unfortunately,
our luggage did not.

43
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:51,558
Airline lost our bags.

44
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:52,874
Oh, no.

45
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,596
Our dresses were in them.

46
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,396
- But I want to be a flower girl.
- That's okay,

47
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:00,594
- sweetheart.
- Oh, sweetie.

48
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,728
It's Tracy Laybourne.

49
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:06,199
I believe God created
voice mail for times like this.

50
00:02:06,283 --> 00:02:08,009
Tracy, good morning.

51
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:11,159
Ms. Laybourne is a tech mogul
from Silicon Valley,

52
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:12,705
and one of the few
prospective donors

53
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,837
who could keep us afloat
if our funding gets cut.

54
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,525
<i>Randolph,
I'm glad you picked up.</i>

55
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,023
I thought you might
be in surgery.

56
00:02:18,107 --> 00:02:21,023
Actually, uh,
I took the day off.

57
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,398
Is everything okay?

58
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:24,368
It's my daughter.

59
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:25,754
She's not feeling well.

60
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,610
Okay, uh,
tell me what's going on.

61
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:30,848
Well, we were on our way
to the aquarium

62
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:32,666
and Max started feeling

63
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:34,607
sluggish and sweaty.

64
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:36,369
Incredibly tired.

65
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,982
<i>I think she needs to see a
doctor, and you're the only one</i>

66
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:41,336
- I know in Atlanta.
- Okay, sounds as though

67
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,321
she needs an internist.
I can

68
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:45,545
send our best to meet you
at Chastain ER

69
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:47,649
and I'll be there
as soon as I can.

70
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,974
Thanks.

71
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:13,962
Conrad, can you take a look
at Tracy's daughter?

72
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:17,025
- I-I could, but I...
- Go. I'll watch Gigi.

73
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,928
- I mean, I took the day off.
- Uh, the girls

74
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:20,615
do need new flower girl dresses

75
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:21,783
and I need a new suit.

76
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,754
Great. So we'll divide
and conquer.

77
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,057
You go get your suit

78
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,728
and I'll take
our little ladies shopping.

79
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:28,348
Meet back here.

80
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:29,516
You don't have to do this.

81
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:30,523
I can get a sitter.

82
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:32,531
Are you kidding me?
It'll be fun.

83
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,445
Shouldn't we finish
the rehearsal?

84
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,251
Oh, thank you, Lindsay,
but Randolph and I already have

85
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,922
a few weddings between us,
so I think we're good.

86
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:42,297
I'll get him back in one piece.

87
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:44,680
You, not so fast.

88
00:03:49,057 --> 00:03:50,694
What was that for?

89
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:52,871
That was my last kiss
as a single woman.

90
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:55,695
And mine as a single man.

94
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:29,813
And lungs are clear.

95
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,776
You're gonna be okay.

96
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:34,245
We'd be more than happy
to bring in

97
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:35,588
a sign language interpreter.

98
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:38,102
Oh, no need. I can translate.

99
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:41,293
And Max is a great lip reader.

100
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:43,189
Besides,

101
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:46,787
most interpreters can barely
keep up with my daughter.

102
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,697
Yeah.

103
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:50,905
You are too fast.

104
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,631
She's chatty.

105
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:56,991
Last month,
it was dinosaurs, and then

106
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:59,730
ancient history, and now...

107
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,883
sea creatures.

108
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,494
And sharks.

109
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:07,662
Sounds like
you've got it covered.

110
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:09,198
If you need anything,
let me know.

111
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:10,384
Oh, thank you.

112
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:12,304
Were Max's eyes
this yellow when she

113
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:14,560
- woke up today?
- Hmm.

114
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,064
I don't think so.
Is that serious?

115
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,627
No, there's no reason
to be alarmed.

116
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:20,253
Could mean a lot of things.

117
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:23,611
I'll rush some labs,
find out what's going on.

118
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:28,822
All right, this is the place.

119
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:32,884

Dr. Bell here

135
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,043
I can't believe it.

136
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:14,957
Did Dr. Voss
change her mind already?

137
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,935
Well, thankfully, Kit has not
come to her senses yet,

138
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,273
so I expect to see all of you

139
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:21,074
- at our ceremony this evening.
- Oh, I would not miss it.

140
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:23,750
How's Tracy's daughter?

141
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,772
Her liver enzymes just came back

142
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:27,123
and they're off the charts.

143
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:28,739
How high are we talking?

144
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:30,800
So high the lab
ran them three times.

145
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:32,519
Her INR is 2.0.

146
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:34,572
She's going into liver failure.

147
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:37,917
And fast.
We need to move faster.

148
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,415
All right, I'll talk with Tracy

149
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,200
while you get Max
a bed in the ICU.

150
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:43,300
And I'll bring Ian up to speed.

151
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:45,741
If we can't figure out the cause
and reverse it fast enough,

152
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,792
there's only one thing
that will keep Max alive.

153
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,035
Transplant.

154
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,589
Wait...

155
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:59,845
- my daughter may need a liver transplant?
- I'm...

156
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,234
I'm sorry.
I wish we had better news.

157
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:05,701
Come on, honey.
Let's go.

158
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:08,260
- Take that thing out. We're getting out of here.
- We need to get her

159
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,516
to the ICU right away to monitor
her labs and mental status.

160
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,557
That's the only way to know
how fast her liver is worsening.

161
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,690
You know what, no offense,
but I brought Max here for a checkup,

162
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:17,958
not a transplant.

163
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:20,611
We both know that this hospital
is in financial trouble

164
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:23,000
and that's why
you reached out to me.

165
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:26,861
- I'll explain in the car.
- Tracy,

166
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,235
I would strongly advise
against moving her.

167
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:32,388
This has nothing to do
with you helping Chastain.

168
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,191
Max is critically ill.

169
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:36,462
Her condition could change
at any moment

170
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,900
and moving her in this state
is a risk I would not recommend.

171
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:41,138
Okay, right.

172
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:42,507
Listen.

173
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:45,865
My daughter was born
with her hearing.

174
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,211
But at six months old
she got an infection

175
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,091
and the hospital I took her to
was wildly underfunded.

176
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:53,235
They sent her home
with an antibiotic

177
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,887
and completely missed the fact
that she had meningitis.

178
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:58,507
That's how Max lost her hearing.

179
00:07:58,591 --> 00:07:59,726
Yes.

180
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:02,030
I donate to hospitals
like Chastain

181
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:04,719
because they need the help.

182
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:08,055
But I won't let my daughter
get harmed again.

183
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:12,735
And I just had my assistant
get the number

184
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:15,173
of the best pediatric surgeon
in the country.

185
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:18,193
All right. Let's go, honey.

186
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,007
And we've no idea
what caused this?

187
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,857
Not acetaminophen, I checked.

188
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:23,958
You started her on NAC,
to be safe?

189
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:25,978
And a battery of tests.

190
00:08:26,078 --> 00:08:28,255
My daughter deserves the best
and that's exactly

191
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,152
- who she'll be seeing.
- What's the deal?

192
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,014
We've got a problem.

193
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:35,364
Hello, this is Dr. Sullivan.

194
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:39,009
Hello?

195
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,856
You're here.

196
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:44,818
I am.

197
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,496
But I can't talk right now.

198
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,862
I'm about to meet
my next patient.

199
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:55,856
Hi.

200
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:07,646
So what happens now?

201
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:09,456
Well, first,

202
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,088
you have to trust me.

203
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:13,027
I do.

204
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,511
And I'm sorry.

205
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,831
- I just...
- There's no apology necessary.

206
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,652
Dr. Sullivan
will keep Max stable

207
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:21,027
while Dr. Hawkins does his
damnedest to try and figure out

208
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:22,177
why her liver is failing.

209
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,527
We find the cause,

210
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:24,605
then maybe we can treat Max

211
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,744
and avoid a transplant
altogether.

212
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,408
Give me the real.

213
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:32,557
You're not here
because the outlook is positive.

214
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:36,722
Things don't go our way,
we can list Max with UNOS,

215
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:39,026
get a liver
from a deceased donor.

216
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:40,417
But that will take time.

217
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:42,252
There is another option.

218
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:44,401
Transplant the lobe
of a living donor.

219
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:46,455
Someone related to Max who can

220
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,198
give a part of their liver
to her.

221
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:51,370
So, you could make
a list of relatives,

222
00:09:51,455 --> 00:09:53,011
just in case,
people we can call.

223
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,292
There-There's no one else.

224
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:56,487
No father in the picture
and I have no siblings.

225
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:59,308
It has always
just been me and Max.

226
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,268
So if she needs a liver,

227
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,260
I will give her part of mine.

228
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:07,448
Okay.
I can take you to the lab

229
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,862
and get some blood drawn
to see if you're a match

230
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:11,550
and walk you through

231
00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:13,533
- next steps on the way.
- Okay.

232
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,888
Portal vessels are patent.

233
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,976
Good flow. No sign of clot.

234
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:27,910
Which would be a good thing,
but, right now...

235
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,425
We still don't have the cause.

236
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,577
- Viral studies back yet?
- Well,

237
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:34,760
hep B and C are both negative.

238
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:43,386
Loss of appetite could indicate
worsening liver failure.

239
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:45,391
Or it could mean...

240
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:48,750
You don't like Jell-O?

241
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,863
I always get the "E" wrong.

242
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:58,778
You know how to sign?

243
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,299
A little.

244
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,877
Hey, sweetie.

245
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:10,678
How are you feeling?

246
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,064
Mm.

247
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:17,346
So, we can't go home yet.

248
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:18,980
Right?

249
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:20,101
The doctors,

250
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:22,474
they're gonna try to help me

251
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,197
to help you.

252
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:32,052
By... letting me

253
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:35,308
give a part of me to you.

254
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:41,841
You remember when you had

255
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:46,029
that Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head?

256
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:51,357
And she could give her ears

257
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:55,532
or her nose to him?

258
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:58,482
It's kind of like that.

259
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:08,448
Of course.
I will be fine, sweetie.

260
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:16,573
Your mom's liver will grow back.

261
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,396
That's pretty cool, huh?

262
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,781
That was pretty impressive
in there.

263
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:41,334
When did you learn ASL?

264
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,756
I took a class in college.

265
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,065
I don't remember that much,

266
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,421
but I do remember
my favorite was "microwave."

267
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:47,742
Oh.

268
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:50,142
Wait. Hold-hold on.

269
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:55,181
Do these nails match the dress
I saw in the back of your car?

270
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,987
I got them done for tonight.

271
00:12:57,072 --> 00:12:59,510
I thought you said you weren't
a wedding kind of girl.

272
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:02,483
I... I believe
your words were...

273
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,904
"weddings are
a special kind of torture."

274
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:07,646
Yes. But I am looking forward
to this one.

275
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:10,336
Bell and Kit invited me.

276
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:12,392
Not just as your plus-one.

277
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,678
Think I'm finally
part of the group.

278
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:20,481
Means a lot to me.

279
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:22,256
Me too.

280
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,476
Don't tell me you've
been tweeting at the governor

281
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,436
- all morning.
- You know me too well.

282
00:13:28,521 --> 00:13:30,823
<i>Full disclosure, I also follow
you on social media</i>

283
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,318
and I saw for myself.

284
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:34,694
This-this is how you relax?

285
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,021
Says the man treating patients
on his wedding day.

286
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,671
<i>How's the girl?</i>

287
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,444
She may need a liver transplant,

288
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,350
but we just found out
her mom is a match.

289
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:45,400
That's great news.
Keep me posted.

290
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:47,489
Of course.

291
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:51,063
After this echo,
you should be cleared to donate.

292
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:52,298
Mm.

293
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:53,769
Nice ink game, by the way.

294
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:59,263
Yeah, back in my 20s,
I was big into the music scene.

295
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:01,150
- And then Max was born.
- Mm.

296
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:04,540
Now I'm a little... quieter.

297
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:07,007
She's an amazing kid.

298
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,851
I started my company 'cause
I wanted to give her everything,

299
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:12,356
and... now I can.

300
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:15,271
Yeah, well, family
is a powerful motivator.

301
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:17,460
Mm. Mm.

302
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:25,248
What is it?

303
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,754
The echo is showing signs

304
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:30,091
of critical aortic stenosis.

305
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:33,460
It's a severe narrowing
in the valve that brings blood

306
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:36,150
from your heart to your body.

307
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:41,131
Uh, I have been
more short of breath lately.

308
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:42,999
Tiring more easily.

309
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:46,440
Well, an aortic valve
replacement should fix that.

310
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,161
But it is major.

311
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:51,517
Your heart is going to need
some time to recover before you

312
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:54,306
can safely donate
part of your liver.

313
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,123
All right, well, how much time?

314
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,396
Weeks.

315
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:59,634
Maybe months.

316
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:02,973
But Dr. Bell said
that Max may need a liver soon.

317
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:06,681
And I'm saying that
if we attempt a transplant now,

318
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:09,126
you could die on the table.

319
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,388
No, but...

320
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:15,857
I have to save my daughter.

321
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:19,225
I can't live without her.

322
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:21,861
She's my whole world.

323
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,318
So, we will find another way.

324
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:50,468
What did you find out?

325
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:52,334
Nothing.

326
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:54,764
We have no idea
why this kid's liver's failing.

327
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:56,920
No Kayser-Fleischer rings
in her eyes.

328
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:58,458
No evidence of Wilson's.

329
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:01,194
Autoimmune serologies are...
they're pending.

330
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,975
But it's unlikely, and hepatitis
labs came back negative.

331
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:06,568
Well, we have to hurry,
'cause I just talked to AJ

332
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:09,356
and Tracy can't donate.

333
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,720
Max's coags are climbing.

334
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:16,871
She could start
bleeding internally

335
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:18,609
- at any moment.
- Well, just double down.

336
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:21,098
Try harder. If you can't figure
out why Max's liver's failing

337
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:23,253
and we have no donor...

338
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:27,425
...this child could die.

339
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:36,746
<i>"Corners"
by Book On Tape Worm playing...</i>

340
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:41,449
Aunt Billie?

341
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,925
What will you wear
for your wedding?

342
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:46,622
You know, not everyone
gets married.

343
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:49,285
If you do,
can we pick your dress?

344
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:53,222
Is your daddy
gonna get married again?

345
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,162
I don't know.

346
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:57,933
He has a girlfriend.

347
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,717
Do you like her?

348
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,778
She's okay.

349
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:03,317
She's not like my mommy.

350
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,416
I mean, I don't
remember my mommy,

351
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:06,988
but it's different.

352
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,775
I remember your mommy.

353
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,622
She was really nice.

354
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:13,200
She was a nurse when I was sick.

355
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:15,074
She took great care of me.

356
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:17,639
I wish I remembered her.

357
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:24,654
There she is.

358
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,152
The woman of the hour.

359
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,762
- I'm not married yet.
- No, but you're trending on Twitter.

360
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:34,090
Yeah. Right behind
the latest banana muffin craze

361
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:36,386
and a bunny dancing
on a bed to the Beatles.

362
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:38,967
Hey, that bunny is talented.

363
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:41,690
Governor Betz has got to be
feeling the pressure

364
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:43,082
to meet with you now.

365
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,770
So far, no word.

366
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,730
But I did get a call
from a local news station.

367
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,527
They want to interview me live
on-air later.

368
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:53,991
And I'm actually considering it,
on my wedding day.

369
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,144
You're really worried
about this.

370
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:59,284
If we lose the millions
the governor plans to cut,

371
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:01,575
Chastain will become
a third-rate hospital,

372
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,597
and I can't stand that.

373
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:05,792
I wish I could help.

374
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:08,442
Gregg and I owe so much
to Chastain.

375
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:11,642
If it wasn't for you and Bell
and all the doctors there,

376
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:12,941
we wouldn't have Sammie.

377
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:14,832
I wouldn't have a family.

378
00:18:16,582 --> 00:18:17,821
Oh!

379
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:19,949
What do you think?

380
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,533
- Wow.
- I love them.

381
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,189
They're perfect.

382
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:26,348
- Sammie insisted we try on every dress in Atlanta.
- Mm-hmm.

383
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:28,334
You know, your daughter
is very persuasive.

384
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:30,797
Yeah. Who could say no
to that face?

385
00:18:34,037 --> 00:18:35,839
You're right.

386
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:40,077
Who could say no to that face?

387
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:51,770
When did this start?

388
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:54,111
A few minutes ago.

389
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:55,430
I'm ordering blood and plasma.

390
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,334
I'll reexamine
her belly. Hang on.

391
00:18:57,418 --> 00:19:00,090
Let just see what's going on.

392
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:02,072
Mm...

393
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:03,545
So what's the plan?

394
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,583
Well, for now,
we try and keep her stable

395
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,645
while we hope UNOS
moves her up the donor list.

396
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,074
But that's a long shot,
isn't it?

397
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:13,050
Tell me the truth.

398
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:17,566
There's a chance
a liver may not come in time.

399
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:21,745
No.

400
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:23,855
But I am here.

401
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,250
I don't care about the risks.

402
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:28,261
Let me donate.

403
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:29,966
- Your heart can't tolerate...
- What my heart

404
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,321
can't tolerate
is losing my daughter.

405
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,024
I'll write a check.

406
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:34,808
How much?

407
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:35,911
- Just tell me.
- Tracy...

408
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:37,777
You don't get to tell me
that I...

409
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:40,653
can't risk my life for her.

410
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:43,527
I am her mother.

411
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:50,927
She's in A fib.

412
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:52,705
I'll page Dr. Austin.

413
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,480
What did you tell her?

414
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,877
I told I'm gonna help her.

415
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:11,355
Don't make a liar out of me.

416
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:16,003
All right.
Her A fib has slowed,

417
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:18,892
but the rapid rate has landed
her in pulmonary edema.

418
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,483
Tracy's in even worse shape
than we thought.

419
00:20:21,757 --> 00:20:24,145
How much time you think we have
before Max's liver fails?

420
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,730
Based on what I've seen so far,

421
00:20:25,832 --> 00:20:27,598
she has days, at best.

422
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:35,630
Look, I wasn't enthusiastic
about racing Tracy

423
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:38,069
through a TAVR even when she was
in better shape.

424
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,438
But now you want me
to take her to the cath lab

425
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:40,974
while she's in heart failure?

426
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:42,677
Dr. Austin, the sooner
you repair the valve,

427
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:44,581
the sooner she can recover
and be ready for a transplant.

428
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:46,769
Organ donation
from living donors

429
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,888
is supposed to be low-risk.

430
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:49,976
That's how we justify it.

431
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:51,796
I can't risk the mom's life.

432
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,183
- Randolph, you hear me.
- I do.

433
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:54,802
As surgeons, we don't risk
a living person's life

434
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,571
to give their organs
to someone else.

435
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,041
Not to mention the guilt

436
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:01,265
the child will feel
if the mother died saving her.

437
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:03,895
I'm not gonna make
that child an orphan.

438
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:08,213
Max doesn't get a liver, she
doesn't have a future at all.

439
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:11,152
It's your call, AJ.

440
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,291
If you can get Tracy
cleared for surgery,

441
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:15,694
I'll operate with you.

442
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:19,235
But whatever you decide,
you have my full support.

443
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:28,297
I just reached
the damaged valve.

444
00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:33,782
And now I will deploy
the bioprosthetic.

445
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:38,573
And once it opens,

446
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,145
you should be able
to breathe easier.

447
00:21:44,373 --> 00:21:46,477
Oh...

448
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,928
And after this?

449
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,582
After this, you rest.

450
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,926
The new valve
should make your heart relax

451
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,264
and the fluid in your lungs
go down.

452
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:00,934
And then I can donate

453
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:03,339
if Max doesn't get better?

454
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:06,211
We're all hoping
that Dr. Hawkins can figure out

455
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:09,510
what's going on with your
daughter so you won't have to.

456
00:22:11,432 --> 00:22:12,708
But, yes,

457
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,763
if she doesn't improve
by tomorrow,

458
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:18,573
we will proceed
with the transplant.

459
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:23,796
Thank you.

460
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,669
For giving my daughter a chance.

461
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:36,672
Here you are.

462
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:39,899
<i>Wheelchair to the cafeteria.</i>

463
00:22:40,055 --> 00:22:41,307
Hey.

464
00:22:41,392 --> 00:22:43,236
I need fresh eyes.
You got a minute?

465
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,364
As long as it doesn't involve
more ear wax removal.

466
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:46,534
I wish it did.

467
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:48,533
I got a sick girl.
Ten years old.

468
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:51,361
Previously healthy with rapidly
progressive liver failure.

469
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:53,015
Worsening coagulopathy.

470
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,205
- What have you ruled out?
- Ischemia,

471
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,240
toxic ingestions,
viral causes, autoimmune.

472
00:22:57,324 --> 00:22:58,601
Did you send CMV?

473
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:00,149
Three times.

474
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:02,601
An anti-smooth muscle antibody?

475
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,725
Negative.

476
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:07,574
Family history?

477
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:09,077
Not that we know of.

478
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,235
Uh, any ingestions?
She's a kid,

479
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,469
maybe she was outside.

480
00:23:12,554 --> 00:23:13,924
No poison mushroom in the woods.

481
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:17,440
So you really have ruled
everything out, haven't you?

482
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:20,849
I think we both know
what this is.

483
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:25,913
It's idiopathic.
We can't find

484
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:28,281
the cause of Max's liver failure
and we'll likely never know.

485
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,599
Words I never thought I'd live
to hear you say, Hawkins.

486
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:33,335
Well, in over 20%
of hepatic failure cases,

487
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,428
we never find the reason.

488
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,506
Well, if we don't
know the cause,

489
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:37,178
that means it could
recur after transplant.

490
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:40,460
Yeah. But it's highly unlikely
based on everything I ruled out.

491
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,375
And we all know she'll die
without a new liver.

492
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:43,561
Of that, we can be sure.

493
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:45,320
So we turn our attention
to Tracy and hope that

494
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:46,976
she can recover in time
for us to attempt...

495
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,577
- ...we'll have less than we ever had.
- Transplant.

496
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,842
<i>It's important people understand
Governor Betz's budget cuts</i>

497
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:54,071
<i>will have an impact
beyond Chastain,</i>

498
00:23:54,205 --> 00:23:57,186
<i>when the population we serve
overcrowds the rest</i>

499
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:58,960
<i>of Atlanta hospitals.
A burden...</i>

500
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:01,402
Aren't you marrying
that woman today, Bell?

501
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:02,604
I certainly hope so.

502
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:03,951
<i>Dr. Voss, I understand</i>

503
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:06,272
<i>there's a former patient
with you who would like</i>

504
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:08,278
<i>to say a word to the governor.</i>

505
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,448
<i>That's right.</i>

506
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,091
<i>You ready?</i>

507
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:17,249
<i>Hi. I'm Sammie.</i>

508
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:20,106
<i>And when I was seven,
I got really sick.</i>

509
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:22,561
<i>Everyone gave up on me.</i>

510
00:24:23,107 --> 00:24:26,618
<i>But the doctors at Chastain
never did.</i>

511
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:28,341
<i>They saved my life.</i>

512
00:24:28,646 --> 00:24:30,202
<i>Without them, I wouldn't have</i>

513
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:31,528
<i>a bicycle.</i>

514
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:34,201
<i>Or get to cook
macaronis with my dads.</i>

515
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:36,810
<i>And eat way too much ice cream.</i>

516
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:38,061
It's Max.

517
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:40,685
<i>And play with puppies.</i>

518
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:46,104
- She's in multisystem organ failure.
- And going into DIC.

519
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:48,445
We don't act now, she may not
make it through transplant.

520
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,600
- Tracy is still tenuous in the PACU.
- We all know

521
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:53,239
she'd do anything
to save her daughter.

522
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:54,858
Hawkins, can you
buy us more time?

523
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:56,763
I can't change the diagnosis.

524
00:24:57,356 --> 00:24:59,354
It is now or never.

525
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:02,909
Let's get OR 1 and 2 prepped.

526
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,612
Meet you gentlemen there.

527
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,818
Bell, if you join me in this OR,

528
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,382
you might not make your wedding.

529
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:21,772
No one would question
you passing this case off

530
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:23,260
to another surgeon.

531
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,018
<i>Saw you and Sammie on TV.</i>

532
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:34,639
<i>You were both great.</i>

533
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:36,756
Well, we'll see if it works.

534
00:25:39,107 --> 00:25:41,228
That's not why you're calling.

535
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:43,923
You're headed into surgery,
aren't you?

536
00:25:44,024 --> 00:25:45,694
I just sent someone
to pick up my suit

537
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,116
so I can leave from here.

538
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:49,802
I should still
make it there on time.

539
00:25:50,264 --> 00:25:52,218
But it'll be close.

540
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:55,378
Is that okay?

541
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:58,937
<i>What matters most is you help
that mother and her daughter.</i>

542
00:25:59,521 --> 00:26:03,412
Besides, a surgeon saving lives
on his wedding day...

543
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:06,402
Sounds like the kind of man
I'd want to marry.

544
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:09,076
<i>Good luck.</i>

545
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:17,944
- Hi there.
- Hi.

546
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:19,779
Seems our online
ordering system is down.

547
00:26:19,865 --> 00:26:21,815
Do you think you could please
fill this for a patient of mine?

548
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:23,210
Of course, Dr. Sullivan.

549
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:24,569
We are a little backed up.

550
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:25,656
Give me 30.

551
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,344
It-It's urgent.

552
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,898
They're all urgent today.

553
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:31,852
Right.

554
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:38,225
You know what?

555
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,568
I don't have time to wait.

556
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:41,316
Thanks though.

557
00:26:43,984 --> 00:26:46,563
My patient said he had
a weird tingle in his toe

558
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,921
- for ten years.
- Pin.

559
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,905
Honestly,
I think he was just lonely

560
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,074
and he needed company.

561
00:26:51,158 --> 00:26:52,186
And you need a drink.

562
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:53,623
Good thing
we're going to an open bar.

563
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:55,109
Mm-hmm.

564
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,487
Dr. Devi,
I know you already signed out,

565
00:26:57,571 --> 00:27:00,288
but I have
a pediatric liver transplant

566
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:02,714
and you have a chance
to scrub in with me.

567
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,693
That sounds amazing.

568
00:27:04,778 --> 00:27:07,396
But you know I'm not applying
for a peds surgery fellowship,

569
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:08,898
- right?
- You're chief surgical resident.

570
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:10,613
Let's see if you're as good
as everyone says you are.

571
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:12,459
OR. Now.

572
00:27:14,872 --> 00:27:15,993
You want me to wait for you?

573
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:17,293
I'll just meet you there.

574
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:18,818
Pin.

575
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:21,361
Thanks.

576
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,936
I'll be there to help keep your
heart stable during the surgery.

577
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,659
While I procure a lobe of liver
from you for Max.

578
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,280
Thanks.

579
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:22,398
I overheard a nurse said
you're getting married tonight.

580
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:25,334
Right after this.
That's right.

581
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:27,170
I can't thank you enough.

582
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:29,927
Well, you don't have to.
I'm right where I belong.

583
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:35,014
Okay, I'm ready
to make the incision.

584
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:36,357
How's her heart looking?

585
00:29:36,456 --> 00:29:37,865
Ejection fraction

586
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,076
is holding steady.

587
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,425
We can proceed.

588
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,781
This is our window.
Scalpel.

589
00:29:49,195 --> 00:29:52,718
I've never seen a liver
this inflamed before, Dr. Sullivan.

590
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,709
Does this suggest anything
about the cause?

591
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,130
Clamp to me.

592
00:29:57,235 --> 00:30:01,107
- I'll do the portal vein and the IVC.
- Vascular clamp.

593
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:03,670
And I've got the hepatic artery.

594
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:20,507
Can we get some music in here?

595
00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:21,844
Cooley clamp.

596
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:23,415
Sure, Dr. Sullivan.

597
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,053
Any requests?

598
00:30:25,138 --> 00:30:26,295
I don't care.

599
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:27,888
Just something with a beat.

600
00:30:28,222 --> 00:30:30,360
And turn it up.

601
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:36,597
<i>"In Too Deep"

603
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:42,654
Tracy's new valve
is seated beautifully,

604
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:43,756
if I do say so myself.

605
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:45,927
Not as beautiful
as this healthy liver.

606
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:48,550
Exposing and mobilizing
the right hepatic artery now.

607
00:30:48,635 --> 00:30:50,053
Identifying the portal vein.

608
00:30:50,138 --> 00:30:51,138

Well, then we're
gonna have to work faster.

623
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:35,787
But if we slip the bile
and the... vascular connections,

624
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:38,089
this'll be all for naught.

625
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,115
- Damn it.
- What's wrong?

626
00:31:41,563 --> 00:31:44,335
This lobe is too large.

627
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:47,373
Your colleagues are used
to doing transplants for adults.

628
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:50,420
What if we just try
a retroperitoneal dissection

629
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:51,904
to make more space?

630
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,522
Uh... yes, of course, Dr. Devi.

631
00:31:57,607 --> 00:31:59,030
Well, we can do that.

632
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:00,436
But we shouldn't have to.

633
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:02,998
The sooner we begin,
the sooner we can close.

634
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:07,874
Hey. Why don't you get out
of here, Randolph?

635
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,257
I can close. I'll see you
when you're a married man.

636
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:12,693
Thanks, AJ.
Appreciate it.

637
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:16,582
She's hypotensive.

638
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:18,940
MAP's in the 50s and dropping.

639
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:22,711
But we tied off all the vessels.

640
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:24,904
She must have a bleed
someplace else.

641
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,576
I need you back in here
with me, Bell.

642
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,337
I'm nearly maxed on norepi.

643
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:32,559
All right,
give me an ultrasound.

644
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:36,006
I don't see a source.

645
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:38,592
There's oozing
but no frank bleed.

646
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:40,764
That's because
there's no blood in her abdomen.

647
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:42,335
It's around her heart.

648
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,855
She's in tamponade.

649
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:45,179
And she's coding.

650
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:47,008
- I'll crack her chest.
- No, I don't think

651
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,052
there's time. I can get there
from here. Scissors.

652
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,851
I'm cutting
through the diaphragm.

653
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:57,068
Oh, the pericardial sac is full.

654
00:32:57,153 --> 00:32:58,334
Drained the fluid.

655
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,333
Starting open heart massage.

656
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:03,508
An open heart
massage via the abdomen.

657
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:05,210
Damn, Bell. That's nice work.

658
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:07,167
Yeah, it's an old trick.

659
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:08,920
We still need to find
the source.

660
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,874
- I can't keep my arm here forever.
- All right.

661
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,560
Now we crack the chest.

662
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,854
He's still in the OR, isn't he?

663
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:27,758
I just called.

664
00:33:28,404 --> 00:33:31,170
Tracy had a complication.
They're still at it.

665
00:33:33,732 --> 00:33:36,858
There's no way to know how long
it'll be until Bell gets here.

666
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:39,198
Or if he makes it all.

667
00:33:44,904 --> 00:33:48,016
Just a few more stitches and...

668
00:33:48,691 --> 00:33:49,726
...done.

669
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:51,428
How we looking?

670
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:55,694
Pressure has stabilized,

671
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:59,224
gentlemen. Yeah.

672
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,467
So, how's Max doing?

673
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:07,866
Early signs are good.

674
00:34:07,951 --> 00:34:09,671
- And Tracy?
- Ah, she made it.

675
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,382
I mean, thanks to the masterful
work of the groom-to-be here.

676
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,522
And if his work is done,

677
00:34:13,607 --> 00:34:14,953
we need to get this man
to the chapel.

678
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:17,045
- Yeah, I'm beyond late.
- All right, let's go.

679
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:18,584
I'm gonna stay.

680
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:23,115
Look out for Tracy and be here
for Max when she wakes up.

681
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,418
I can sign a bit.

682
00:34:24,514 --> 00:34:26,718
I can reassure her till her mom
comes out of sedation.

683
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:29,636
We can get an interpreter.
You should come.

684
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:33,094
I know how much you were looking
forward to tonight.

685
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,110
We can't get one this late.

686
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,846
I've connected with this girl.

687
00:34:36,947 --> 00:34:38,085
I have to stay.

688
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,492
All right,
then I'll stay with you.

689
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:42,842
No, I'm sorry, this is my ICU
and I'm kicking you out.

690
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,970
Oh, so that's
how it is now, huh?

691
00:34:46,271 --> 00:34:48,653
You've known Kit and Bell
a lot longer than I have.

692
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:50,763
You should be there.

693
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,107
Save me some cake?

694
00:35:23,146 --> 00:35:25,200
Oh, God, you look amazing.

695
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:29,778
I'm too late.

696
00:35:29,863 --> 00:35:31,918
I am so sorry, Kit.

697
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,785
Don't be.

698

<i>Pachelbel's "Canon in D"

699
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:45,458
Everyone's still here.

700
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:48,598
I told them
you were worth the wait.

701
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:24,097
Oh, Kit.

702
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,637
Please be seated.

703
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,417
Welcome.

704
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:45,217
We're here to celebrate the love

00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:47,718
between Randolph Bell

706
00:36:47,803 --> 00:36:49,280
and Kit Voss.

707
00:36:49,365 --> 00:36:51,119
They started out as colleagues,

708
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:52,785
became friends

709
00:36:53,351 --> 00:36:56,491
and had the courage
to open their hearts,

710
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:57,991
take the leap

711
00:36:58,097 --> 00:36:59,683
and risk it all for love.

712
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:01,883
Thank God they did.

713
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:04,991
And now the bride and groom
have prepared their vows

714
00:37:05,075 --> 00:37:06,765
that they would like to share.

715
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:08,874
Go ahead, Kit.

716
00:37:09,283 --> 00:37:10,820
Randolph,

717
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:13,291
you know how I like to be right.

718
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:15,965
Mm-hmm.

719
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:18,281
When I first met you, I thought

720
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,938
you were a bit
of an arrogant sod.

721
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:23,895
I never expected

722
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:26,304
you'd make me feel so happy,

723
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:27,941
so loved.

724
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:31,655
And I never, ever thought
you'd be my forever.

725
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:34,152
But, Randolph, you are.

726
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:39,554
And I've never been so glad
to have been so wrong.

727
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:53,698
Kit.

728
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:57,382
Thank you for
waiting for me to...

729
00:37:59,004 --> 00:38:01,141
...become the man I am now.

730
00:38:01,565 --> 00:38:02,692
I've made some mistakes.

731
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:04,830
Most here could name a few.

732
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:08,689
And then I met someone who...

733
00:38:09,342 --> 00:38:10,879
believed I could be better.

734
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,525
A better... surgeon.

735
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,547
A better stepfather.

736
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:17,697
Just a better person.

737
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:20,755
And all I could do
was just try and become

738
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,395
the man that somehow...

739
00:38:23,056 --> 00:38:24,650
...you knew I could be.

740
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,877
Kit, everything
that's good in me

741
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:29,775
is because of you.

742
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:35,404
Okay.

743
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,025
And now...

744
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:42,548
by the power vested in...

745
00:38:42,637 --> 00:38:45,476
Okay.
