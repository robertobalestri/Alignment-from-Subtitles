1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,046
Previously on The Resident...

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:03,798
<i>Babies cry, Padma.</i>

3
00:00:03,823 --> 00:00:05,238
<i>Just hold them as
much as you can.</i>

4
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:07,556
It's just hard,
do you understand?

5
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:11,975
This isn't about your
emotional fortitude.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,423
It's about your MS.

7
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:15,415
The stress is bad for you.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,119
The twins aren't even crawling,

9
00:00:17,144 --> 00:00:19,055
and I'm terrified
for them already.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,887
Never truly realized how fragile
they are until I held my own

11
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:23,289
flesh and blood in my arms.

12
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,969
You know, you're not really
selling the parenthood

13
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:27,097
- thing here.
- Thank God I don't have twins.

14
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:28,667
That's not helping
either, Hawkins.

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,785
A little fuel to start the day.

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,398
Ugh. Does it come in an IV?

17
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:43,062
I was up all night.
Neighbor had a party.

18
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:46,095
Nothing like EDM blasting
through the walls

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,402
to lull you to sleep.

20
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:49,175
- Who said I was trying to sleep?
- Hmm?

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,649
I got right in there and
taught those fools the wobble.

22
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:53,851
Hey...

23
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,210
Hello,
I'm not ordering

24
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:58,168
French fries here. Can
I get some damn help?

25
00:00:58,193 --> 00:00:59,728
What do we think, ATV accident

26
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:01,141
- or cow tipping gone wrong?
- Help, doctor.

27
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:03,889
Uh, $20 these two make
their own fireworks.

28
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:05,484
Thank you.

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,799
Hi, I'm Dr. Feldman.
This is Nurse Hundley.

30
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:10,460
- What happened?
- Uh, my buddy Wolf here

31
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:11,832
is in a little bit
of pain, that's all.

32
00:01:11,856 --> 00:01:13,503
Okay, we'll take care
of him, and your name?

33
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:16,332
- Cricket.
- All right, Wolf and Cricket.

34
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:21,225
Let's get you checked out.

35
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:22,584
Don't need an exam.

36
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:23,978
Just...

37
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:25,581
just something for the pain.

38
00:01:25,606 --> 00:01:26,606
Hmm.

39
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:28,394
Well, I can't prescribe

40
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:30,858
any medication
without a full exam.

41
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:32,841
So, where exactly

42
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,737
is this pain?

43
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:35,801
All over.

44
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:37,939
Looks like you've got
some blood on your arm.

45
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:39,308
Let us take a look.

46
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,374
He don't
like to be touched.

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,718
Well, then we're not
gonna get very far today.

48
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,512
Told you. This was a bad idea.

49
00:01:48,537 --> 00:01:50,007
Let's go somewhere else.

50
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:51,618
- Hold on...
- Do not touch me!

51
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:54,001
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

52
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,159
What's going on here?

53
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:57,787
Well, they won't let us leave.

54
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,289
If you let us take
a look at your arm,

55
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:01,951
we'll give you
something for the pain.

56
00:02:05,928 --> 00:02:06,928
All right.

57
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:09,736
Come on, take a seat.

58
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:11,274
Lie down.

59
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:19,789
CONRAD Ooh...

60
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,491
That looks like it hurts.

61
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,664
- It does.
- Yeah?

62
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,891
Okay, what did this to you?

63
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:28,319
Nothing.

64
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:29,691
A cat.

65
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,019
Maine Coon.

66
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:32,907
Big sucker.

67
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:35,493
- Must've been ginormous.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:39,462
40 pounder. We don't call
her Girlzilla for nothing.

69
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:45,855
Good morning.

70
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,466
The cavalry has arrived.

71
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,062
Hey, hey, little fellas.

72
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,515
Mama's getting you all
squeaky clean, huh?

73
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,165
Trying.

74
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:55,858
I got them wristbands

75
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:58,299
because they're so
hard to tell apart,

76
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,070
especially at this age.

77
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:02,625
Hey, I'll tag in.

78
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:08,620
I can't believe the
sitter bailed last-minute.

79
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:11,913
- Maybe I should stay home.
- Hey.

80
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,077
No, that is nonsense, Padma.

81
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:16,870
You have been overwhelmed
for months, and you deserve

82
00:03:16,937 --> 00:03:19,476
the day off.

83
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:21,337
Thanks.

84
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:23,766
Oh, I just want to
feel like myself again.

85
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,355
Hopefully, this
self-care day does it.

86
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,138
I really appreciate
you stepping up.

87
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:31,466
I know today's a
big day for you.

88
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:34,973
Hey, no worries. I have a
couple hours before the surgery,

89
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:36,543
and Chastain nursery

90
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:37,770
will take them.

91
00:03:37,795 --> 00:03:39,666
I'm sure they'll like it there.

92
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,280
I'll be back by
8:00. Oh, and, um,

93
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:47,854
Elijah is the green wristband,
and Arjun is the blue.

94
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,585
Got it.

95
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,178
Oh...

96
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:57,219
Maybe, uh...

97
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:04,792
Hey, Padma.

98
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:36,943
Wow. Sam, this is amazing.

99
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,786
Another hour,
and your patient

100
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,167
will have a brand-new
titanium ribcage

101
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:42,575
tailored to fit her chest wall.

102
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:45,183
And this only took
three days to build.

103
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,386
Well, at Inman Park Tech, we
make the impossible possible.

104
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:50,875
Well, if anyone deserves
it, it's-it's Tessa.

105
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,404
She was one of my
clinical trial patients,

106
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:56,603
and sadly, the meds didn't work,

107
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,674
and so the cancer
spread to her ribs.

108
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:00,410
If the surgery
goes well today,

109
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,506
this could be the start
of a new life for her.

110
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:05,386
And the beginning of a
beautiful new partnership

111
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,849
between Inman Park
Tech and Chastain.

112
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,294
You know, I have to be honest,

113
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,265
Dr. Pravesh, I was
skeptical about doing

114
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,693
business with Chastain.

115
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:14,749
Everyone knows you're about
to get your funding cut.

116
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,008
Don't count us out.

117
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:18,388
We're fighting hard to stay in
business, while still delivering

118
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:20,785
care with the same
level of excellence.

119
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:23,022
You see, that spunk right
there is why we decided

120
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,091
to support Chastain

121
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,763
in being the first hospital
in America to implant

122
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,199
a titanium ribcage.

123
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,938
- Ah, come over here.
- Hey, Sam.

124
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,276
- Dr. Pravesh, this is Gina.
- Hi.

125
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:36,048
- She's making a documentary about our lab.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

126
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:38,520
They've already received
early interest from Sundance.

127
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:41,058
Yeah, now it's just about
finding a great story,

128
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,728
and Sam thinks your
patient has one.

129
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:46,837
We'd like Gina and her crew to
film the implantation surgery.

130
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:48,574
Um...

131
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:51,746
Well, I would need to
get clearance first

132
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:54,117
and the consent of the
patient, of course.

133
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:56,756
It would be great
publicity for us both,

134
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,194
and you'd be getting the
word out that Chastain

135
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:00,898
is still a
cutting-edge hospital.

136
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:05,608
All right, um, let
me see what I can do.

137
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,580
Great.

138
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:13,857
So, I have some good news. I
just spoke with Dr. Pravesh,

139
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,166
and your surgery will
definitely happen today.

140
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,170
Oh,

141
00:06:20,236 --> 00:06:22,240
Dr. Pravesh is an angel.

142
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,979
Your titanium ribs will
be here within the hour.

143
00:06:25,113 --> 00:06:26,348
Wow.

144
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:28,252
A titanium rib cage.

145
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:32,160
Will they let me through TSA?

146
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,532
I'm worried. We thought
the last surgery

147
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,370
- would fix everything.
- Oh, please,

148
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:39,441
don't question the
doctors, Wendy.

149
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,245
They made no promises
when they operated.

150
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:43,517
- It wasn't a cure-all.
- No,

151
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:45,353
it's-it's okay. After
the trial failed,

152
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:48,392
Dr. Austin and I succeeded
in removing the sarcoma

153
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:49,762
from your mom's chest wall,

154
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:51,967
breast, and the
affected ribs, but

155
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,670
it left her lungs

156
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,774
and her heart
without protection.

157
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,480
I don't have
much of a choice, dear.

158
00:06:58,547 --> 00:07:00,316
It has to be done.

159
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,187
We have to replace them.

160
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,790
Well, the surgery is risky,

161
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,295
I won't lie. A
full implantation

162
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:07,941
of 3D printed ribs like
this has only been done

163
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:10,838
once before, but we have
a multidisciplinary team

164
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:12,541
of experts ready
to make that happen

165
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:13,977
as safely as possible.

166
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:17,183
Will Dr. Austin be joining
you in the surgery?

167
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,056
Yes, of course. He
should be here soon.

168
00:07:23,664 --> 00:07:25,400
What's wrong with him, doc?

169
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:28,172
Lacerations, fever,

170
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:30,276
pain in the right upper
area of his belly.

171
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:33,584
Gonna order some labs and get a
CT of his abdomen to find out.

172
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:36,021
Cat-scratch fever is at the top

173
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,460
of our list, assuming it really

174
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:41,298
was a Maine Coon
that mauled you.

175
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,169
It was a cat, okay?

176
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:44,572
"A cat."

177
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,476
Interesting word choice.

178
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:48,914
I need to impress on
you how important it is

179
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:51,352
you tell us the truth.

180
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:52,755
We can't diagnose and treat you

181
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:54,926
if we don't have the
right information.

182
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:00,003
Talk to me. Our ribs,
how do they look?

183
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:02,975
Futuristic, like something
out of a Marvel movie.

184
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:04,545
Tessa's in great spirits.

185
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:06,315
Her daughter, little less so.

186
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,419
She watched her mom
struggle long enough.

187
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,189
Tessa's husband died tragically,

188
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,595
my trial failed
her, then cancer,

189
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,212
and now, she needs new ribs.

190
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:16,287
This poor woman, she's suffered.

191
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:19,953
Then let's hope this
surgery is a win for her.

192
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:21,291
Actually,
there's something

193
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:22,584
that I need to run by you.

194
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:24,123
A documentary crew

195
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:27,138
has been following the robotics
lab at Inman Park Tech,

196
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:30,163
and... they want to film

197
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:31,599
Tessa's surgery.

198
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,902
That's a big ask.

199
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:35,033
There are liability
issues and privacy, too,

200
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:36,404
- for Tessa.
- And will we have

201
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:39,295
any creative say in how
Chastain is represented?

202
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,018
I imagine we will not.

203
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,957
Then, there's your answer.
I'm sorry, Devon, hard pass.

204
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,063
Respectfully, Dr. Voss,
this is a once

205
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:49,795
in a lifetime opportunity,
and if it all goes well,

206
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,491
it could put
Chastain back on top.

207
00:08:51,787 --> 00:08:54,137
This documentary could be
very good publicity for us.

208
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:56,612
Well, a-and if not, it could
have the opposite effect.

209
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,410
We... we'd need creative
say, pending the outcome.

210
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:03,117
Okay. We make it very clear
that we need creative say,

211
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,856
or we don't move forward
with the documentary.

212
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,370
Under those circumstances,
I'll allow it,

213
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:09,241
but you're in charge, Devon.

214
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:11,199
Don't let a camera
crew get in the way

215
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:13,498
of achieving the best
outcome for our patient.

216
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,928
- Okay.
- Dr. Voss.

217
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,404
Could I have a word?

218
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,543
Have you seen the front page
of the <i>Atlanta Metro Daily?</i>

219
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:29,782
It's about Bell,
and it is not good.

220
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:43,710
It's despicable. Anonymous
sources. Gutter journalism.

221
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,472
This has Governor
Betz's fingerprints

222
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:47,301
- all over it.
- But is it true?

223
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:49,589
There are nuggets of
truth, but it's blown

224
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,858
way out of proportion.

225
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,561
Well, I
heard that, long ago,

226
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:53,764
the staff used to call him

227
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:57,286
HODAD, Hands of Death
and Destruction.

228
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:59,182
He operated when
he shouldn't have,

229
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,878
when he had a physical problem.

230
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:03,650
He's a different man
now, a different doctor.

231
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,637
Well, they sure made
his MS an issue.

232
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:08,426
Randolph has some of the best
outcomes in the hospital.

233
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:11,633
He's top of his field. I
have total faith in him.

234
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:14,294
He has a rib implantation
in a few hours.

235
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,319
What are you going to do?

236
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:19,998
The implantation
is high profile.

237
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:23,022
The publicity will be
good for Randolph's image

238
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,424
when he's successful.

239
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:26,128
And what if it isn't?

240
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:30,604
I have to believe
in our surgeons.

241
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:33,045
Until then,

242
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:35,670
I do damage control.

243
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:41,684
Wolf's lab results are in.

244
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,565
Positive for severe
pancreatitis,

245
00:10:44,632 --> 00:10:46,903
but negative for
cat-scratch fever.

246
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,940
Which means his
symptoms aren't caused

247
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,477
by whatever scratched
him on the arm.

248
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:51,713
Definitely not.

249
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,991
Well, I'll start him on fluids,

250
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:54,519
make sure his pain
is under control.

251
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:56,792
And I'll send off some more labs.

252
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:59,430
I think he has an
exotic cat at home.

253
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,127
Yeah, with scratches like
that, it makes the most sense.

254
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,271
Well, no one's gonna confess
to a crime that easily.

255
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,933
We'll have to pull
the truth out of 'em.

256
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:09,152
I need you two in here, now!

257
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:17,910
Pulmonary edema. The
pancreatitis is getting worse.

258
00:11:17,935 --> 00:11:19,077
Getting him on oxygen.

259
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:21,059
Wolf, I'm done playing.
Tell me what's going on.

260
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:22,508
You need to tell us. Now.

261
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,317
Two of lorazepam and get
me an intubation kit.

262
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:34,765
Can't you just
make an exception?

263
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,854
Chastain recently
changed their policies.

264
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,457
We can no longer accept
babies under ten months.

265
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:42,222
Laura, I am needed for a
groundbreaking surgery.

266
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:44,723
Help me out here, please.
Just for a few hours.

267
00:11:44,748 --> 00:11:47,423
Dr. Austin, I wish I
could, but there are rules,

268
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,597
and violating them is gonna
put Chastain in legal jeopardy.

269
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:52,317
I'm really sorry.

270
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,263
Right.

271
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,306
Make sure they get my
good side, Dr. Pravesh.

272
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:04,357
All sides of you
are good, Tessa.

273
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,720
I want to go on record.

274
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:11,038
I think this documentary
is a bad idea.

275
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,577
It could only distract
everyone in surgery.

276
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:16,114
Listen, if there are any issues
at all, I will pull the plug.

277
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,383
That is a promise.

278
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:19,469
Your mom is the priority.

279
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:20,797
Always.

280
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:23,071
Okay.

281
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,441
Thanks.

282
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,251
I come bearing ribs.

283
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:31,722
Let's get you
in. Come on, come on.

284
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:32,982
We need to get this.

285
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:36,330
Wow. I really will
be the bionic woman.

286
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:38,702
Yeah. So, this

287
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:39,971
will be your new sternum,

288
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:42,166
and these curved
pieces will replace

289
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:43,737
the ribs that we removed.

290
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,816
They're beautiful.

291
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:48,494
So, historically,

292
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,163
patients like Tessa ended
up with a flat metal plate

293
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,865
to cover their vital organs,
which might've kept them safe,

294
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,928
but also left them
unable to move.

295
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:58,132
So, their ability
to live full lives

296
00:12:58,157 --> 00:12:59,787
was drastically curtailed.

297
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,943
But all that changes
now with Tessa.

298
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:05,341
With these new ribs, we'll
give her full mobility

299
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:07,108
and a new life.

300
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:09,780
Isn't there another
surgeon? I would love

301
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,685
to get a profile on him
and his consent to film.

302
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,697
Yes, Dr. Austin, he'll
be the lead surgeon.

303
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:15,500
He's triple board-certified.

304
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,571
He's got nerves of
steel and great hands,

305
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:18,907
and he is arguably

306
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,563
the best cardiothoracic
surgeon in the nation.

307
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:22,890
And a new father.

308
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:24,485
Oh, here he is.

309
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:26,864
Hey, uh, my apologies.

310
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,929
Sitter cancelled. What's this?

311
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:32,701
Um, these guys are
filming the surgery

312
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:34,170
as part of a documentary.

313
00:13:34,237 --> 00:13:36,930
Um, have you sorted
out your childcare?

314
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:39,649
I've been calling Padma,
she's not been answering.

315
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:41,686
I'm still working it out. Hey.

316
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:43,957
Tessa, I read your report,

317
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,827
and your pre-op exam is clear.

318
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:49,034
You are as healthy as possible
and ready for surgery.

319
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,140
You have any questions
before we take you to the OR?

320
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:00,857
The
article is a political smear job

321
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,095
by a governor trying
to destroy Dr. Bell

322
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:05,047
because he dared
speak truth to power.

323
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:07,613
Yes, he's my husband,

324
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,486
and I couldn't be more
proud of him at this moment.

325
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,011
That's all I'm going to say.

326
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,221
Dr. Stanley.

327
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:19,085
I wasn't expecting to hear from
you till our next board meeting.

328
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:22,485
Oh, come on. It's slander.

329
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,494
- You and I both know that Randolph is a specta...
- Ma'am, you can't go in there.

330
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:27,178
I'm gonna have to call you back.

331
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:29,438
You're Kit Voss, the
CEO of the hospital?

332
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:30,976
The person in charge?

333
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,001
I tried to stop her.

334
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:33,690
It's all right, Tabitha.

335
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:34,900
I am.

336
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:37,230
My mother is Tessa Perez.

337
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:39,869
She's about to have
her chest cracked open

338
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:42,237
for this dangerous
new operation.

339
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:44,166
Okay.

340
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:47,885
I'm here to help you.
Tell me what's wrong.

341
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:51,242
I read the article online.

342
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,429
You can't possibly
let some butcher

343
00:14:53,496 --> 00:14:55,032
do this operation on my mom.

344
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:56,869
These
allegations are false.

345
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:58,338
Remember, Dr. Bell was the one

346
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:00,777
who successfully removed
your mother's cancer

347
00:15:00,844 --> 00:15:02,013
just weeks ago.

348
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:03,917
Yeah, after the
Chastain clinical trial

349
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:05,312
should've cured it.

350
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,226
Clinical trials are experiments.
There are no guarantees.

351
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:10,941
And this is also experimental.

352
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:12,943
Maybe this could kill her.

353
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:15,593
I'm sure you were both told

354
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:18,367
the risks are high,
but so are the rewards.

355
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:21,133
I'm-I'm sorry, but your
mother is out of options.

356
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:22,564
She chose this.

357
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,017
Then get her another doctor.

358
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:30,102
I would trust my
life to Dr. Bell.

359
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:32,938
I'd want him if I were
going into this surgery

360
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:35,067
- your mother is facing.
- You're his wife!

361
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:38,290
You're not impartial.

362
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:42,552
Look, my mom is my best friend.

363
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:44,648
Okay? She's the
kindest person I know,

364
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:48,540
and she's too trusting. I
have to be careful for her.

365
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:51,979
I've watched her
suffer long enough.

366
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:57,156
From now on, I protect her.

367
00:16:01,398 --> 00:16:04,304
Either Dr. Bell is out,

368
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,392
or we are.

369
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,793
You're taking me off
the surgery, aren't you?

370
00:16:31,859 --> 00:16:33,195
I'm sorry,

371
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:35,467
but the patient's
daughter insists.

372
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:38,031
No, I heard about
the article, and...

373
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:40,610
well, I get that it's a
risk to Chastain. The...

374
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:44,279
cameras running, a...
surgeon who's been publicly

375
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,775
outed as incompetent.

376
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:48,233
You can't be allowed to
do a high-risk operation

377
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,009
- on a patient.
- It's quite possible that even

378
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:52,696
your best effort could still
result in a failed outcome.

379
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,339
No, it's-it's
clear what we have to do.

380
00:16:57,456 --> 00:16:59,883
- I'm out.
- You don't deserve this.

381
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:03,050
You are a brilliant surgeon
and even better man.

382
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:07,004
We're in a war with Betz, and
he launched a nuclear weapon.

383
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,533
We're gonna fight it.

384
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:09,894
Okay.

385
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,676
Hands of Death and
Destruction. HODAD.

386
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,738
Now,

387
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:18,252
what can I do to help?

388
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,324
Well, AJ can't do the
surgery on his own.

389
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:23,796
There's no one I
trust more than you.

390
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:26,368
Can you step in for me?

391
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:27,469
Of course.

392
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:30,009
I'm familiar with
what was planned.

393
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:32,180
Okay, good, good, so
I'll-I'll run through

394
00:17:32,246 --> 00:17:34,017
the specifics with
you so you are ready.

395
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:38,960
<i>Dr. Lopez, come
to the pharmacy for a consult.</i>

396
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,298
<i>Dr. Lopez to the pharmacy...</i>

397
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,310
Your friend is dying.

398
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,890
You need to tell
us what did this,

399
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:51,752
or we can't save him.

400
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:56,161
Well, the truth is we...

401
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:59,033
we get kicked,
bit, and scratched

402
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,839
all the time by a lot of things.

403
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:04,210
Kicked? Bit?

404
00:18:04,235 --> 00:18:06,339
- By what?
- We, um...

405
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,431
We have a home zoo.

406
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,295
That, uh, the show
about that guy

407
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:16,268
who made a great
living raising tigers

408
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:18,806
made a big impression.

409
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:25,854
You know it didn't end
well for him, right?

410
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:27,958
He's famous.

411
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:29,424
He's in prison for murder.

412
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:32,175
Okay.
What's your point?

413
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,885
How do you not
understand the danger

414
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,174
you're putting yourselves in?

415
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:38,058
Wild animals can
carry many diseases,

416
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,253
not to mention maul you.

417
00:18:39,278 --> 00:18:41,151
Hey, people pay big money

418
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:44,123
to pet a king cobra,
feed an ape, take a photo

419
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,827
next to an African lion.

420
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:47,229
We're animal lovers,

421
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,568
- I swear.
- What you're doing is illegal.

422
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:52,073
Your friend's on a vent.

423
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:53,643
He's hanging on by a thread.

424
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:58,920
Okay. What... what can I do?

425
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:00,957
What savaged his arm?

426
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:03,496
That was a lion. Maude.

427
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,869
She's normally real gentle,
but, uh, we got careless.

428
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:08,449
Okay, finally we're
getting someplace.

429
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:10,151
What else could've
bitten or scratched him?

430
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:12,447
We got so many animals.

431
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:14,417
It... it could've
been any of them.

432
00:19:14,518 --> 00:19:17,356
Well, then you and I
are gonna make a list.

433
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:27,531
Oh.

434
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:31,029
- Hey.
- Aw, look at those cheeks.

435
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:33,459
Mm. Just the
babies I wanted to see.

436
00:20:33,484 --> 00:20:34,882
Oh, that's great, Hundley.

437
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:37,500
That's just the reaction the
three of us were hoping for.

438
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:38,851
Listen, I hit a bit

439
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:41,570
of a logistical snafu,
and I need a babysitter.

440
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,780
Billie already gave me a
heads-up. I'll take one.

441
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:46,277
- Hand him over.
- Thank you. One is a great start.

442
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:49,842
Yeah. That's
why God made two hands.

443
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:54,796
One for charting, and one
for snuggling.

444
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,959
Wait. Is this Elijah or Arjun?

445
00:20:57,582 --> 00:21:00,853
Well, we also had a
mishap with the wristbands

446
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:03,984
and the tub so I'm not quite
sure who's who at the moment.

447
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,200
- Mm-hmm.
- But do not judge.

448
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:08,210
Even Mommy has trouble
telling them apart.

449
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:10,921
Having a baby with a friend
complicates everything.

450
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:13,880
Two of them is another
level entirely.

451
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,712
Or did you miss that in the
parenting instructional manual?

452
00:21:16,737 --> 00:21:19,610
Uh, there's a parenting
instruction manual?

453
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:21,304
Hey, Feldman!

454
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:23,241
You are great with the boys,

455
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,412
they love you, and
I need childcare.

456
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,349
Oh, of course.
Hundred bucks an hour.

457
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,688
Done! Thank you, my man.

458
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,527
He was gonna do that for free.

459
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:45,185
Pancreatitis,

460
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:47,591
delirium, seizures.

461
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:49,990
None of Wolf's
symptoms are consistent

462
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:51,999
with injuries caused by
any animals on this list.

463
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,999
There's got to be
something else.

464
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:56,388
No, that-that's all the big
animals we got, I swear it.

465
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:58,432
All the big animals?
You got any small ones?

466
00:21:58,457 --> 00:22:01,111
Oh, we-we got critters, but
Wolf mostly takes care of 'em.

467
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:03,274
You know, snakes,
spiders, scorpions.

468
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,570
Ugh. You are killing
me here, man.

469
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:08,451
You didn't think it would be
useful to mention this earlier?

470
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:10,031
It's a side hustle.

471
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:11,857
By the way, you
would not believe

472
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:13,000
what some dude in China will pay

473
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:14,757
for a little Brazilian
scorpion venom.

474
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:16,954
Hurts to milk 'em, though.

475
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,815
And they bite.
Stings like a bitch.

476
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,576
Brazilian scorpions?

477
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:23,833
Tityniae serrulatus,
to be specific.

478
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,873
Tityustoxin.

479
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,346
Was Wolf, by chance, siphoning
the venom this morning?

480
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:34,918
I hope so. We got
a deadline to meet.

481
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:36,287
That's it.

482
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,991
Where you going?

483
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:39,962
Tityustoxin from
the scorpion venom

484
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:41,331
was causing Wolf's pancreas

485
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:43,101
to inflame and
auto-digest itself.

486
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:45,236
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means

487
00:22:45,261 --> 00:22:48,434
your business partner needs
antivenom, or he dies.

488
00:22:54,696 --> 00:22:57,067
Hey, what's taking Bell so
long? He should be here by now.

489
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:59,063
I've taken him off the surgery.

490
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:00,991
Because of the article?

491
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:03,046
I'm stepping in for him.

492
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:06,432
Well, I'm disappointed for
Bell, but I'm good with it.

493
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:08,461
Pravesh?

494
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:10,990
Given the circumstance, it's
the best option we have.

495
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,898
Aah!

496
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:16,367
Hey, what's wrong? Talk to me.

497
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:18,371
My back. The pain.

498
00:23:18,472 --> 00:23:21,645
And-and my legs... they're numb.

499
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:25,352
- Keep rolling.
- What's going on?

500
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:26,904
Is she okay?

501
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:28,526
New lower extremity weakness.

502
00:23:28,593 --> 00:23:30,362
Cauda equina syndrome.

503
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:33,399
- What does that mean?
- We need to go now!

504
00:23:33,424 --> 00:23:34,927
I'll meet you in the OR.

505
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:36,005
Go, go. Go!

506
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,320
- Anybody?!
- Wendy. Wendy.

507
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,537
What's going on?

508
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:42,443
We have to get
your mother to the OR now.

509
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:44,667
She has a serious complication
that we have to deal with first.

510
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:46,103
- Come on.
- We have to stabilize her

511
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:47,829
before we can implant the ribs.

512
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:49,258
I can't promise you

513
00:23:49,283 --> 00:23:51,754
that the rib surgery
is gonna happen today.

514
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:08,071
How did we not
see this in imaging?

515
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:09,708
We couldn't have.

516
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:12,085
The cancer must have
metastasized rapidly

517
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,283
during her time in the
ICU, even between scans.

518
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:18,820
What's going on?

519
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:21,820
Our patient has a
dangerous complication.

520
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:23,452
Should we be filming?

521
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:27,009
No, this has nothing to do
with the rib implantation.

522
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,843
What are the odds that Tessa's
story has a happy ending now?

523
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:34,791
A lot less than they
were this morning.

524
00:24:36,695 --> 00:24:37,831
We're losing nerve signal.

525
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:39,468
The tumor has
eroded the bone.

526
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:42,006
Pathologic spinal fracture
leading to cord compression.

527
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,645
All right, if we don't
get rid of this tumor,

528
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:46,749
new set of ribs aren't
gonna make a difference.

529
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:48,953
You're right. She
needs a decompression.

530
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:51,057
Should I page Billie?

531
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:52,527
Right away.

532
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:55,767
Our neurosurgeon is on the way.

533
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:57,637
You can go. We won't
be filming any more.

534
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,875
I'm thinking that
this is great stuff.

535
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:02,093
- You know, conflict is drama.
- No.

536
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:04,193
There's a woman down there
whose life hangs in the balance.

537
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:06,188
Filming it would
be a distraction.

538
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,273
I'm not gonna let you continue.

539
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:10,155
The patient comes first.

540
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:15,577
Okay, but you're missing
out on a golden opportunity.

541
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:20,898
I'm sorry, but please leave.

542
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,369
<i>The vertebrae
is crumbling.</i>

543
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,913
<i>Any word
on Billie, Pravesh?</i>

544
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:31,513
She's coming.

545
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:33,876
<i>Well, she better hurry.</i>

546
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:48,193
What have we got?

547
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:50,293
An emergent
spinal decompression.

548
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:52,099
When did you lose

549
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:53,835
SSEPs to the lower extremities?

550
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:55,822
Five minutes ago.

551
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,985
Time is spine.

552
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:00,724
All right, osteotome to me.

553
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,908
Hi. Sam, how are you?

554
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:16,402
What the hell is going
on over there, Pravesh?

555
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,924
There's been an unforeseen
complication with the surgery.

556
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:22,095
I'm not talking
about the surgery.

557
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,923
I'm talking about this article.

558
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:25,810
<i>The article... It...</i>

559
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,924
It's a mixture of exaggeration
and outright lies.

560
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:31,253
You told me Chastain
was the best.

561
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:32,513
This guy, Dr. Bell...

562
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:34,524
- He's on Tessa's medical team.
<i>- Well, not anymore.</i>

563
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:35,661
We-we took him off the surgery.

564
00:26:35,685 --> 00:26:36,671
If the article's a lie,

565
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:37,817
why would you take
him off the case?

566
00:26:37,841 --> 00:26:38,929
It's either one or the other.

567
00:26:38,953 --> 00:26:40,350
<i>Well, at this point, it's moot</i>

568
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,335
because we don't even know
if we can move forward.

569
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:44,785
And if you can, who operates?

570
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,013
<i>Dr. Voss. She's our CEO.</i>

571
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,632
Top ortho surgeon. She can
do it. There's no one better.

572
00:26:49,703 --> 00:26:51,881
<i>But Sam, there won't
be any more filming.</i>

573
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:54,211
Fine. I can live with that.

574
00:26:54,236 --> 00:26:56,890
<i>We've worked so hard, it's
too late to pull the plug.</i>

575
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,389
But Inman Park Tech

576
00:26:58,414 --> 00:27:00,415
better come out of this
looking like rock stars.

577
00:27:00,483 --> 00:27:03,254
If not, our new
partnership is over.

578
00:27:11,872 --> 00:27:14,276
Hey, I got your
page. How bad is it?

579
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:15,796
Um, unclear.

580
00:27:15,821 --> 00:27:18,163
Apparently, one of Conrad's
patients was stung repeatedly

581
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:21,057
by a scorpion and developed
severe pancreatitis.

582
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:24,854
I think I speak for the
whole hospital when I say,

583
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:27,436
we know how good you are,
and we're all behind you.

584
00:27:27,504 --> 00:27:28,906
Well, I appreciate that.

585
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:32,346
You taught me so
much. This will pass.

586
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:33,799
I hope so.

587
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,724
All right, so, here's the deal.

588
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:40,008
I dosed him with antivenom.

589
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:42,874
But he's already developing
necrotizing pancreatitis.

590
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:44,335
With worsening
organ dysfunction.

591
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,650
His urine output's trailing
off, he's tough to ventilate.

592
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:48,913
- What's his bladder pressure?
- Mid-20s.

593
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:50,539
He's got abdominal
compartment syndrome.

594
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,587
If the pressure in his
abdomen gets any higher,

595
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:54,380
he's-he's gonna go into shock.

596
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:55,701
Well, he needs a laparotomy.

597
00:27:55,726 --> 00:27:57,951
- Should I book an OR?
- Um, no, not yet.

598
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,991
We need to maximize
medical management first.

599
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:01,475
Let's start with paracentesis,

600
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,929
drain the fluid at
bedside and then reassess.

601
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:06,507
Okay, I'll prepare
the paracentesis now.

602
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,380
As an internist, I appreciate
the nonsurgical approach,

603
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,613
but is this you or
the article talking?

604
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:20,208
This is about the patient.

605
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:22,412
I-I... I know you might
find it hard to believe,

606
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:27,189
considering that nickname has
come back to haunt me, but I...

607
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:30,669
I am long past the days

608
00:28:30,694 --> 00:28:34,203
of letting outside influence
dictate the way I do my job.

609
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,974
There's a ton of ascites
fluid in his abdomen.

610
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,405
No wonder he's so distended.

611
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,069
Yeah, there's quite a bit.

612
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:05,900
Well, do you
want to do the procedure?

613
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:07,737
Technically, Conrad
consulted you.

614
00:29:07,804 --> 00:29:09,708
Uh, nope, nope.

615
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:12,412
You can handle it.

616
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:32,955
Spinal cord
is decompressed.

617
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,497
The tumor is resected.

618
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,893
And our nerve signal
is back, but weak.

619
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:39,490
Now we have to
stabilize the spine,

620
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:42,154
rebuild it, vertebrae
by vertebrae.

621
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,915
I'm trying.

622
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,521
These screws won't hold.

623
00:29:46,428 --> 00:29:48,776
Her bones must have been
compromised from the tumor.

624
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,457
We have to
fuse more levels.

625
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,162
But I'm not sure if
Tessa can hold up.

626
00:29:57,236 --> 00:29:58,939
Her blood
pressure's dropping.

627
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,400
She's going into A-fib.

628
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:02,486
We need more IV fluids,

629
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:05,016
and we need another
amio bolus ready.

630
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,379
Hey, Doc?!

631
00:30:18,404 --> 00:30:20,983
His blood pressure's low.

632
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,793
And his abdomen is tense.

633
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,116
Paracentesis wasn't enough.

634
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:30,579
- Can you do it again, or...?
- It won't solve the problem.

635
00:30:30,604 --> 00:30:34,145
He's too sick. Hamad,
page Bell and Devi.

636
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,888
Have 'em meet us in the OR now.

637
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:45,865
Okay.

638
00:30:46,668 --> 00:30:48,839
Spinal fusion is a success.

639
00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:51,773
Thanks to our
brilliant neurosurgeon,

640
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:53,043
<i>Tessa is stable.</i>

641
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:54,395
Yeah, but
is she stable enough

642
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,966
to make it through
the rib implantation?

643
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,393
That's for
us to figure out.

644
00:30:58,013 --> 00:31:00,566
Dr. Sutton, we'll take
it from here. Thank you.

645
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:01,965
I'll leave you to it.

646
00:31:02,065 --> 00:31:04,871
- Good luck, everyone.
- All right.

647
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,508
<i>Let's close up her back.</i>

648
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:10,738
<i>Now, do we proceed with
the implantation or...?</i>

649
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:14,574
Or do we stop and give her
a rest from anesthesia,

650
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:16,691
return to the ribs another day?

651
00:31:16,716 --> 00:31:19,302
Her A-fib hasn't recurred,
but if it does...

652
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:21,394
<i>It's a risk.</i>

653
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,609
<i>But every day without those
ribs brings another risk.</i>

654
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:25,211
<i>Heart and lungs exposed.</i>

655
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:26,848
<i>Pravesh, you
made this a reality.</i>

656
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:29,888
<i>You know Tessa.
You make the call.</i>

657
00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:33,880
<i>Let's do it.</i>

658
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:39,637
This is on me.

659
00:31:39,662 --> 00:31:41,343
I thought the paracentesis
would be enough.

660
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,680
It was the right call,

661
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:45,850
but now the compartment
syndrome is compressing his IVC.

662
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,622
- We should go.
- There's not enough blood getting to his heart.

663
00:31:47,646 --> 00:31:49,092
- Get your stuff.
- His MAPs are in the 40s.

664
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,519
Hawkins, at-at this rate,

665
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:51,924
he could code before
we get to the OR.

666
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:54,152
Well, then he needs a
decompressive laparotomy

667
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:55,740
right here, right now.

668
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,386
Dr. Devi's on her way to the OR.

669
00:31:58,411 --> 00:32:00,850
I think it's best
we do it there.

670
00:32:11,303 --> 00:32:13,785
Listen to me. I knew that man

671
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,144
they wrote about in that
article, and that's not you.

672
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:17,672
Not now.

673
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:19,403
I'm not so sure
about that anymore,

674
00:32:19,428 --> 00:32:20,428
for a number of reasons.

675
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:21,722
I'd trust you with my life.

676
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:23,618
After everything
we've been through,

677
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:24,927
that has to mean
something to you

678
00:32:24,952 --> 00:32:26,388
because it means
something to me.

679
00:32:26,426 --> 00:32:28,676
I know you can save this
man's life right now.

680
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,990
Come on. Let's do it.

681
00:32:37,716 --> 00:32:39,787
I need Betadine and a ten blade.

682
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:52,513
No pulse. Just hold
off on compressions.

683
00:32:56,615 --> 00:32:58,185
Ten blade.

684
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:17,935
He's got a pulse,
and it is strong.

685
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:26,621
That was amazing, man!

686
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:28,124
You see that?

687
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:30,328
And we filmed all of it.

688
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:32,723
Congrats, Dr. Bell.
You brought the drama.

689
00:33:32,748 --> 00:33:36,021
Wow. That was awesome.
I just, uh... I need...

690
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:39,747
I just need you all
to sign a release,

691
00:33:39,772 --> 00:33:41,476
of course.

692
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:44,607
Um, I'm not sure that...

693
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:46,670
Footage doesn't lie.

694
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:49,240
Amazing. So good.

695
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,865
Let's rotate.

696
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:11,787
Removing the prosthetic.

697
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:21,197
All right.

698
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,468
Ready to implant the titanium.

699
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:44,190
Fits like a glove.

700
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:47,887
She's back in A-fib

701
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:50,650
and hypotensive. We can
bolus her amio again,

702
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:52,980
- but we're running out of time.
- Let's bring this home.

703
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:54,769
Attaching the ribs in place.

704
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,425
<i>I mean, it's like
a piece of armor.</i>

705
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:26,861
Utterly amazing.

706
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:41,423
How's my mom?

707
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:44,129
She came through
beautifully. What a fighter.

708
00:35:44,196 --> 00:35:45,909
The ribs fit perfectly.

709
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:47,839
As you see, the
surgery was a long one.

710
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:50,740
Recovery's going to be
tough, but we're optimistic.

711
00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:54,149
Okay. Thank you.

712
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:57,289
Um, thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

713
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:00,050
I'm sorry that I
ever doubted you.

714
00:36:00,087 --> 00:36:01,480
It's not over yet.

715
00:36:01,505 --> 00:36:03,883
But we've done our best,
and now we'll do our best

716
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:06,496
to make sure she
gets back on her feet

717
00:36:06,521 --> 00:36:08,527
and living her new life.

718
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:12,776
- Thank you.
- Of course.

719
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,092
Hmm.

720
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,118
Hey.

721
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:42,913
Irving and Hundley bailed?

722
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:44,550
There was a multiple
injury crash,

723
00:36:44,617 --> 00:36:46,488
and they got
overwhelmed in the ER.

724
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,033
I was leaving and couldn't
handle this cuteness,

725
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:51,665
so I kidnapped them.

726
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:53,969
Hey. Hey, little man.

727
00:36:54,036 --> 00:36:57,610
Aw. Did you miss Papa?

728
00:36:57,635 --> 00:37:01,141
You know, I never
held my son, Trevor.

729
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,256
Well, you know, you were a
child yourself when he was born.

730
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:05,852
Mm.

731
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:09,777
Well, because of where he
came from, I didn't want to.

732
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:12,383
Couldn't do it.

733
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:14,644
This is what I missed, hmm?

734
00:37:14,744 --> 00:37:16,948
You know, you can still be
a great mom if you want to.

735
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:21,056
- Mm.
- And hey, you found a way to make a new bond with Trevor.

736
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,660
Yeah, he's a good guy.

737
00:37:22,727 --> 00:37:25,198
He's working hard to
develop new drugs.

738
00:37:25,886 --> 00:37:28,025
Chemistry is his first passion,

739
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,375
so he moved to Baltimore.

740
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,737
- But we're still in touch.
- Mm-hmm.

741
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,151
Mm, but this is something else.

742
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:37,456
Oh, you got that right.

743
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,916
These two bring me a
special kind of joy.

744
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:43,568
Even when Elijah's just
staring daggers at me.

745
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:45,074
Yeah.

746
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:47,699
You know, I think he's hungry.

747
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,690
Seems like you can tell
your twins apart after all.

748
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:52,576
Ah, well, I forgot that
their distinguishing features

749
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:54,338
are their personalities.

750
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:57,337
Well, you're gonna have a lot of
fun watching these two grow up.

751
00:37:57,362 --> 00:38:00,001
They're gonna love their papa.

752
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:01,838
Mm.

753
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:04,749
I-I do not even know what
I'm feeling right now.

754
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:06,952
Y-You should have been there,
right? Th-this doctor...

755
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:09,072
He cut right into your
stomach right in the hallway.

756
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:11,687
Your guts started oozing
out all over the place

757
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,481
- like...
- Okay, okay, enough.

758
00:38:13,506 --> 00:38:15,331
Dr. Bell saved your life.

759
00:38:15,843 --> 00:38:18,228
You're going to need
another trip to the OR once

760
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:21,243
your belly's less swollen to
get that abdominal wound closed,

761
00:38:21,268 --> 00:38:23,807
but you'll be okay.

762
00:38:25,351 --> 00:38:28,023
- How you feeling?
- Better.

763
00:38:28,508 --> 00:38:29,810
A lot better.

764
00:38:29,835 --> 00:38:32,306
You underestimated
that scorpion.

765
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:34,369
Repeated exposure
to scorpion venom...

766
00:38:34,436 --> 00:38:36,406
Yeah, that wreaks
havoc on your body.

767
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:39,370
I feel like a damn fool.

768
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:40,892
- It won't happen again.
- Good.

769
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:42,089
Let this be a
lesson to you both.

770
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:43,789
Don't lie to your doctors.

771
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:44,924
We-we... we didn't lie.

772
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,663
I mean, we just didn't
tell the whole truth.

773
00:38:46,687 --> 00:38:49,527
Yeah, which almost
got you killed.

774
00:38:50,191 --> 00:38:53,174
Well, w-we will take
precautions from now on, right?

775
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,314
W-Wear gloves, be the safest
unauthorized zoo in the state.

776
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:59,363
Trafficking in exotic animals
is illegal in the state of Georgia,

777
00:38:59,388 --> 00:39:01,291
and having any wild animal

778
00:39:01,316 --> 00:39:02,978
- requires a permit.
- Well,

779
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:06,341
sure, but, I mean, who's
really paying attention?

780
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:09,339
I am.

781
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:16,253
Reported you both to the
state animal control.

782
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,567
- Oh.
- Wait. What the hell, man?!

783
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:20,754
Wh-What about
doctor-patient privilege?

784
00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:23,199
I didn't tell them anything
about your health history.

785
00:39:27,342 --> 00:39:28,979
Here you go.

786
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,916
Pravesh?

787
00:39:30,983 --> 00:39:32,909
Congratulations.

788
00:39:33,214 --> 00:39:35,455
You have every right to
be proud of yourself.

789
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,965
And you pulled off that
surgery like a boss, Voss.

790
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,744
We proved something here.

791
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:45,123
Huge leaps in medicine can
happen in unexpected places.

792
00:39:45,148 --> 00:39:46,619
- Yeah.
- Doctors?

793
00:39:46,644 --> 00:39:50,594
I hear the patient is in
recovery, doing beautifully.

794
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:52,323
- Job well done.
- Thank you.

795
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,753
And I can't wait to
see what Chastain

796
00:39:54,778 --> 00:39:57,017
and Inman Park Tech
partner on next.

797
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:58,446
Me, too.

798
00:39:58,471 --> 00:40:00,842
Nice going, Pravesh.

799
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:02,880
Still love your spunk.

800
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:06,480
Spunk.

801
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:17,476
I thought we were
meeting at home.

802
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,480
Well, couldn't wait.

803
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:20,875
Is something wrong?

804
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,922
Oh, I told you I wasn't
gonna read the article.

805
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:25,185
But of course you did.

806
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,135
But I-I didn't finish.

807
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,564
Um, my heart started racing,

808
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:32,775
and there was a
ringing in my ears,

809
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,276
and then the room
started to spin.

810
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:36,146
Like an anxiety attack?

811
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:37,641
It's the MS, Kit.

812
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,408
It's probably made
worse from the stress.

813
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:44,170
And it cleared up, and
I got through the day.

814
00:40:44,195 --> 00:40:45,966
But...

815
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:49,791
it's not the only time since
I returned from the clinic.

816
00:40:49,816 --> 00:40:52,278
Well, let me see if
Conrad's still around.

817
00:40:52,303 --> 00:40:54,842
- He can examine you.
- Hey.

818
00:40:57,756 --> 00:41:01,096
I think we both know this is
not something Conrad can manage.

819
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:04,209
And maybe it is the stress.

820
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:08,409
But it... it could also be
side effects of my new meds.

821
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:11,751
Oh, they worked for a while.

822
00:41:12,968 --> 00:41:15,480
Maybe they're not
working so well anymore.

823
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:21,111
My MS could be progressing.

824
00:41:21,901 --> 00:41:25,776
Then we'll find another
treatment, a-a clinical trial.

825
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:33,479
I think I need to get
back to Minnesota.

826
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:39,626
Whatever you need,
you just say the word.

827
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:43,347
All I want is you by my
side, whatever it takes.

828
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,855
All right, home sweet home.

829
00:42:04,657 --> 00:42:06,393
Oh.

830
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:08,401
Okay.

831
00:42:15,198 --> 00:42:19,674
Where... is Mommy, guys?

832
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:25,429
I'll be right back.

833
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:28,689
She's supposed to
be home by now.

834
00:42:32,145 --> 00:42:34,249
Padma?

835
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:47,417
Padma?

836
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:58,123
<i>Hi. You've reached
Padma. Leave a message.</i>
