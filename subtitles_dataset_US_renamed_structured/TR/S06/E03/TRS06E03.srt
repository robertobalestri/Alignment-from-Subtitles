<i>pounding season yet.</i>

3
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:06,500
Fixing things is my job.

8
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:20,534
Billionaire businessman
and first-time candidate is

9
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:22,746
- the new governor of Georgia.
- Do you want to go get a drink?

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,088
I think I better try
and figure out how Chastain is

11
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:28,229
going to survive without
a third of its budget.

12
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:29,350
Maybe it's nothing,

13
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:32,003
but the other day,
I saw him take a pill.

14
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:33,878
If he is using
while he's working,

15
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:34,973
then that's a problem,

16
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:36,400
to put it lightly.

17
00:00:36,642 --> 00:00:38,869
You just went
through a major surgery.

18
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:41,682
It's like all these things
that can go wrong

19
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:42,937
and destroy you,

20
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:46,071
and there's nothing you can do
about any of it.

21
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,392
I got you my best robe.

22
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:51,447
It opens in the front,
makes nursing easier.

23
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:52,197
Thank you.

24
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:53,714
And you forgot your slippers.

25
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,439
You'll be up and walking
in no time.

26
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:57,783
Are you ready?

27
00:00:57,868 --> 00:00:59,130
You don't look ready.

28
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:01,744
It's still so early. Is it time?

29
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:04,220
Yes, we have to be there
at 6:00 a.m.

30
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:06,134
The C-section
is scheduled for 9:00,

31
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:07,884
and they need to get you ready.

32
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:10,377
What are you typing?

33
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:13,252
Last will and testament?

34
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,830
You're making out a will?

35
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:17,745
I realized I don't have one.

36
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,400
Everyone needs a will.

37
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:21,730
There's this website
where you can do it online.

38
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,903
I think it's official.

39
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,423
Padma, look at me.

40
00:01:28,432 --> 00:01:29,718
You are not going to die.

41
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:31,805
You can't promise me that.

42
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:33,242
I rushed.

43
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:36,187
I rushed to get pregnant.
I rushed to find a donor.

44
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:38,141
I made this huge
life-changing decision

45
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:40,532
without realizing
something so fundamental.

46
00:01:41,122 --> 00:01:44,109
Terrible things can happen
at any moment.

47
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:45,696
Hey.

48
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:47,809
You ready to go?

49
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:53,492
Apparently not.
Holler when you're ready.

50
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,491
Look,

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,140
you're about to meet
your two babies.

52
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:03,860
This is the first page
of the first chapter

53
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:05,778
of the book of the rest
of their lives.

54
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:07,604
- Aren't you excited?
- Yes.

55
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:11,156
But not all books
have happy endings.

56
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,789
If I die today...

57
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,086
It's a C-section.
You are not going to die.

58
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:17,008
I have to know one thing.

59
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,907
If something unexpected

60
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:20,818
and awful happens today,

61
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:23,585
will you make sure
they are taken care of?

62
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:26,867
I will always make sure
they are well taken care of,

63
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:29,174
but that won't be necessary.

64
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:30,828
You're their mommy,

65
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,996
and you will be there
to look out for them.

66
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:38,086
I know it looked bad,

67
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:39,922
but he could've lost
his entire leg or worse

68
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:41,835
if we hadn't amputated on site.

69
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:46,670
BP's steady,

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,194
and his respiratory rate
seems normal.

71
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:54,097
Bleeding minimal.

72
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:56,124
Tourniquet's holding.

73
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:03,687
You'll take him
to the best docs, right?

74
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:06,428
He's a union brother. He's got
gold-plated health insurance.

75
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:09,312
We're going to Yates University
Hospital. It's the nearest ER.

76
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:13,261
- You two need a ride?
- Uh, we're good, thanks.

77
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:14,435
All right.

78
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:18,281
Another Go Team job well done.

79
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:25,491
5:30 a.m.

80
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:26,710
I'm starving.

81
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,363
Do you know any place
that serves

82
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:30,625
good pancakes at this hour?

83
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,146
Chez Conrad Hawkins whips up

84
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,624
a mean buttermilk
blueberry batter.

85
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,656
Mmm, that sounds intriguing.
How's the coffee?

86
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,505
Gunshots.

87
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:44,728
Let's get out of here!

88
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,911
Hey, buddy, what happened?

89
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,258
Where'd you get shot?

90
00:03:55,614 --> 00:03:56,914
Easy, easy, easy.

91
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,600
Can you tell me your name?

92
00:03:58,684 --> 00:04:00,948
Single gunshot wound
to the abdomen.

93
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:03,173
Pulse is thready and falling.

94
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:04,303
Bullet to the midsection.

95
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:05,490
Could've taken out
just about anything.

96
00:04:05,574 --> 00:04:07,373
Ambulance won't make it in time.
He's hemorrhaging.

97
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,050
Scoop and run.
It's the only way he lives.

98
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:11,571
I'll grab my car.
We'll treat him on the way.

99
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,856
Okay, my friend, here we go.

100
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:23,040
He's decompensating.

101
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,301
I'll call Yates.

102
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:28,840
Yates Emergency Department.

103
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,513
Triage. This is Nurse Collins.

104
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:32,607
We have an incoming male,
mid-30s,

105
00:04:32,692 --> 00:04:33,953
single GSW to the abdomen.

106
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:36,127
We need you to prep
a trauma bay and some blood.

107
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:37,432
Hold, please.

108
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:40,670
You got to be kidding me.

109
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,090
- You still there?
- Yes.

110
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:46,278
The ED is full up.
We're diverting patients.

111
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:49,522
We just sent an amputation there
ten minutes ago.

112
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,281
Yates is the closest ED.

113
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:52,802
Like I said, we're diverting.

114
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,523
Take him to Chastain.

115
00:04:54,634 --> 00:04:56,287
He's bleeding out.

116
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:00,324
Tell me they did not
just hang up on us.

117
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:02,573
Unbelievable.

118
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:05,400
They just assume a gunshot
victim is poor and uninsured.

119
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:07,732
Which means it would cost them
a mint to try to save him.

120
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:08,919
Yeah, they know the deal.

121
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:11,381
One bullet can require
100 health care workers

122
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:12,770
to fix the damage it causes.

123
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,677
Then we get him to Chastain.

124
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:44,586
8:00 a.m.,
omphalocele in OR Four,

125
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:46,526
9:30, partial nephrectomy
in OR Two and...

126
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:49,118
All righty.
I like those kicks, by the way.

127
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:51,118
Comfortable, as well as stylish.

128
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,823
And, uh, one more thing...

129
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:54,954
You need to get drug tested.

130
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,900
First I've heard of that.

131
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:58,386
Yeah, the order
came in last night.

132
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:01,410
All nurses, all doctors on
shift, mandatory drug testing.

133
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,164
Testing center's
on the third floor.

134
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:04,737
Everybody's got to pee in a cup.

135
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,082
See you in OR Four.

136
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:56,702
It's almost over.

137
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,386
Almost over.

138
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:01,098
Your C-section is scheduled
for two hours from now.

139
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:02,620
Two very short hours.

140
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:05,234
And then you'll have
two healthy baby boys.

141
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,581
It'll be a miracle.

142
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:08,757
A C-section is not nothing.

143
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:10,585
I looked it up,
and it's a tough recovery.

144
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,718
After everything
you've been through already,

145
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,460
this should be cake.

146
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,288
You'll be fine, Padma.

147
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:24,388
Dr. Pravesh, Dr. Devi,
Dr. Austin,

148
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:25,997
nice to see all of you.

149
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:27,867
Padma, how are you feeling?

150
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,239
She is a little nervous.

151
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,935
Please, I can speak for myself.

152
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:34,950
I'm terrified.

153
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:36,995
Understood.

154
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:39,411
How about we get you
comfortable on the bed?

155
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:42,139
This bag weighs a ton.

156
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:43,923
What do you have in here,
gold bricks?

157
00:07:44,054 --> 00:07:46,347
Some incense and crystals

158
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:49,146
and a comfy robe
and a nice book.

159
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:52,245
We're gonna put some
monitors on your belly so we can

160
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:53,987
keep track of how your
precious ones are doing, okay?

161
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,682
And I'll put some sage
and jasmine near your bed.

162
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,421
Oh, and the crystals
by the window.

163
00:07:58,506 --> 00:08:00,508
Quartz closest to me.
Moonstone by the door.

164
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:03,466
Dr. Johnson, can you please
tell her she's gonna be okay?

165
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,503
Padma, what specifically
has you so worried? Talk to me.

166
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,409
After the in utero surgery,

167
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:12,401
I don't see this hospital
the same way.

168
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:17,409
I'm gonna be at your side
every step of the way, okay?

169
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:20,300
- Okay.
- And...

170
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:23,799
the good news is,
the babies sound great.

171
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:25,969
Strong hearts, both of them.

172
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:29,699
We are a go for the C-section
in two hours.

173
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:31,362
Yes.

174
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:33,668
It's all good.

175
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:35,628
Low risk of complications.

176
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:37,108
I'm gonna check
on some patients,

177
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:38,459
and I'll be back
in a little while.

178
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:40,458
Oh. Okay.

179
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:42,808
Two hours.

180
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,331
Two hours left.

181
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:50,555
A doughnut's primary
characteristic is the hole.

182
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:53,688
If you fill the hole with jelly,
it can't be called a doughnut.

183
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:55,441
It's 100% still a doughnut,

184
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:57,538
and you've been wasting
your life not enjoying it.

185
00:08:57,623 --> 00:09:00,206
- I walk a higher path, H.
- We got a gunshot wound,

186
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,378
coming from the scene.
We need a stretcher.

187
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:10,925
Male, 30s,
single GSW to the abdomen.

188
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:22,526
Let's put him
in the new trauma bay.

189
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:24,700
20 minutes en route
and barely has a carotid.

190
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,334
He's a mess.
Any idea what happened?

191
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:28,262
Found him like this.

192
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,995
He's lucky you did.
He doesn't have much more time.

193
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,469
You get access. I'll intubate.

194
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:43,699
- On it.
- 16 gauge IV to right AC.

195
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,395
His carotid's still thready.
How are we doing on blood?

196
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,048
Two units going in
through the pressure bags.

197
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:53,922
This guy have I.D.?

198
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,534
No wallet.
Not responsive at the scene.

199
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,971
- How can I help?
- Give our patient a name.

200
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:02,933
- Last week's anonymous GSW, we were...
- GSW?

201
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,644
Gunshot wound.

202
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,598
We were on D,
named him Dandelion,

203
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:08,386
so we're on the letter E
this week.

204
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:11,347
Oh, uh... Maybe Eucalyptus?

205
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,507
Welcome to Chastain, Eucalyptus.

206
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,507
I hope you survive your stay.

207
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:20,556
BP's low. We need more blood.

208
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,400
Belmont transfuser.

209
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:24,823
- Maya?
- Getting it.

210
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,269
Bilateral lung sliding,
no pneumothorax.

211
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:31,300
Bullet did not take down a lung.

212
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:34,572
Midline laparotomy scar.
Might've been shot before.

213
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:36,529
Often the case.

214
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,291
Let's roll him on my count.

215
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,844
Three, two, one, go.

216
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:47,498
Exit wounds?

217
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:49,413
Nothing fresh.

218
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:52,620
Old scar from the last GSW.
We're good to go on the Belmont.

219
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,239
FAST is grossly positive
in the right upper quadrant.

220
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:11,455
IVC is completely collapsed.

221
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:12,610
The bullet definitely

222
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:13,700
took out something vascular.

223
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:18,442
BP's steadying.

224
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:20,922
We gave him a chance,
but he needs an OR now.

225
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,816
I'll bag. Let's move him.

226
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:28,191
I'll page trauma.

227
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:30,066
Get Raptor and Leela on board.

228
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:40,551
The jasmine's a little...

229
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,292
Pungent.

230
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,209
It's not helping anyway,
so you can toss it out.

231
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:52,867
Trauma surgery, a GSW.

232
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,393
No, what does that mean?

233
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:56,178
They need me in OR One.
It's emergency surgery.

234
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:58,284
Uh, can't they find
someone else?

235
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:00,230
I will be back
before your C-section starts.

236
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:01,441
Don't worry.

237
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:03,833
Go. I have a light morning.
I'll stay with her.

238
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:12,793
I need an OR. Anything you got.

239
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:14,105
Take him to OR One.

240
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,322
Give me your phone.
I'll handle scheduling.

241
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:19,042
This is Dr. Voss.
Cancel anything in OR One,

242
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,347
and move nonelective surgeries
to Two and Three.

243
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:23,679
And call the chief of surgery,
Dr. Sutton,

244
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:27,290
about rescheduling anything
non-emergent. Keep me posted.

245
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,290
What happened?

246
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,417
I thought you were on
an amputation call.

247
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,081
We were.

248
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:34,973
Finished, and then
heard gunshots.

249
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,723
Found the GSW around the corner.

250
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:38,792
We brought him here
in the back of Cade's car.

251
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:41,537
- Say his chances are 50-50.
- Couldn't you have taken him

252
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:44,347
to Yates University Hospital?
Their ED must've been closer.

253
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,962
Oh, we tried.
We sent the amputation there,

254
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,441
but when we called with
the gunshot ten minutes later,

255
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:51,484
Yates said they were diverting.

256
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:53,095
Both know what that means.

257
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:55,573
Blunt trauma victims...

258
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:58,226
Car crashes,
workplace injuries...

259
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:01,441
Tend to be middle class,
well-insured.

260
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:03,488
A private hospital like Yates
is happy to take them

261
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:05,009
and make a nice little profit.

262
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,183
Yeah, money talks,
and penetrating

263
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:09,153
trauma victims...
Shootings, stabbings...

264
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:10,728
Are usually uninsured.

265
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,034
And get sent to public hospitals
like Chastain,

266
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,599
and we suck up the cost.

267
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:25,644
That's why we work here.

268
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:29,081
But a patient like that

269
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,751
can eat up
a hospital's resources

270
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:33,098
and do it fast.

271
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,803
What a mess.

272
00:13:54,337 --> 00:13:57,122
His anatomy is a disaster.
Nothing is where it should be.

273
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,081
Dense adhesions, missing spleen.

274
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:01,735
This is not this guy's
first rodeo.

275
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:03,146
You think he's been shot before?

276
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,347
100% certain.

277
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,745
Shot, opened and closed.

278
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:08,566
Maybe even twice.

279
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,909
This dude certainly knows
how to find trouble.

280
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,042
Pressure's dropping fast.
He's exsanguinating.

281
00:14:17,185 --> 00:14:19,971
It's hard to get orientation
with all this scarring.

282
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:21,407
You got anything?

283
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:23,651
Damage to
the liver, small bowel,

284
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,399
and the branch
of the renal artery.

285
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:27,099
How does one bullet cause
this much damage?

286
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:28,851
Small caliber, low velocity.

287
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,808
The bullet never exits the body.

288
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:33,776
It just bounces around,
tearing up the organs.

289
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:34,993
It's incredibly destructive.

290
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:37,745
You, sandwich the liver
with packs.

291
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,750
Squeeze with both hands
till it stops bleeding.

292
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,808
Okay, resecting the bowel.

293
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:52,987
Isolating the renal artery.

294
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:55,180
Jejunal injury is stapled off.

295
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:57,395
- That should stop him from bleeding out.
- Okay, good.

296
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,223
My packs are not
soaking through anymore.

297
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:01,055
Great. Let's finish him up.

298
00:15:01,186 --> 00:15:03,231
But we haven't found
the bullet yet.

299
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,919
This is just damage control.

300
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,094
We need him to be stable
to give to CT for a pan scan.

301
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,844
There we'll find out
where the bullet is.

302
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:13,411
- Anybody know this guy's name?
- Eucalyptus.

303
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,162
We're up to E already?

304
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:18,290
Seems like a few days ago
we were on D.

305
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,290
A week ago, to be exact.
Dandelion.

306
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,224
Chrysanthemum was the week
before that.

307
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:23,962
Nearly all gunshot wounds.

308
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:26,404
At this rate, we'll have treated
enough unknown patients

309
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:29,053
- to get us to Z by New Year's.
- Z... Z...

310
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:31,518
Zinnia. I love zinnias.

311
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,864
Did Eucalyptus
have a phone on him?

312
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:35,715
Not that we found.

313
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,281
Anything distinctive?
Scars? Tattoos?

314
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:40,356
Uh, he had a tat of a skull
on his arm.

315
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:41,879
Okay, I'll get a picture.

316
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,004
Um, anything else
that might help me identify him?

317
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:46,831
Fast food receipt in his shirt
pocket, but he paid in cash.

318
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:49,123
I'll cross-reference
with social media, reach out

319
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,165
to local shelters, uh,
track down family members,

320
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,228
if possible, to notify them.

321
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:55,022
If we learn anything more
about him,

322
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:56,589
we'll let you know right away.

323
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:59,897
Hey, Go Team,

324
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:01,815
don't forget to chug some water.
Get your bladders nice and full.

325
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,466
- Yeah.
- Words I never wanted

326
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,641
to hear you say to me.

327
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:08,038
CT scan should come up
in ten minutes for Eucalyptus.

328
00:16:08,122 --> 00:16:09,924
I'll go check on him.

329
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,674
Care to elaborate?

330
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,580
Oh, you know,
Chastain is performing

331
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:16,393
mandatory drug testing
on all doctors today.

332
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,658
Since when does Chastain
drug test their staff?

333
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:23,963
- Been a minute.
- Three years, at least.

334
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:25,983
Huh.

335
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:36,633
Um...

336
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:39,110
How you feeling?

337
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:41,346
I've been better.

338
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,752
Well, Raptor and Leela
will be here soon.

339
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:45,484
They're wrapping up in the OR.

340
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,385
Oh, so just...
half an hour to go.

341
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,507
Uh, no, actually, your C-section
has been pushed back

342
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:56,564
- by an hour.
- An hour?

343
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:57,936
Why?

344
00:16:58,031 --> 00:16:59,816
There's a backup in the OR

345
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:01,727
due to a gunshot victim.

346
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,862
But everything looks good here.

347
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:06,086
You want to leave.

348
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:07,738
No, I want to stay with you,

349
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:09,737
but I have patients
that I have to round.

350
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:19,695
The Chronicles of Narnia, huh?

351
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:24,260
It calms me down.

352
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,610
I can't...

353
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:29,176
really focus
on anything new right now.

354
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:33,706
Yeah. Of course.

355
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:37,902
I'll go check on Leela
for you, okay?

356
00:17:38,212 --> 00:17:39,692
Okay.

357
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,533
Okay.

358
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:58,145
Two lines means positive

359
00:17:58,232 --> 00:18:00,315
for benzodiazepines.

360
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:33,332
- This is for you, Dr. Sullivan?
- Yeah, for my back.

361
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,721
I've used it before,
very effective.

362
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:38,294
Oxaprozin is not
a controlled substance,

363
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:40,642
but this medication can be hard
on your stomach,

364
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:43,037
- so don't take too many at once, okay?
- For sure.

365
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:45,082
Thanks.

366
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:00,064
Padma's doing good.

367
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:02,853
Devon said she's reading
Chronicles of Narnia.

368
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:04,319
The kids book?

369
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:05,869
Whenever Padma and I
were stressed,

370
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:07,347
we'd read it aloud
to each other.

371
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:08,891
It was like a tranquilizer.

372
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:10,630
Ah, for me, it was
Anne of Green Gables.

373
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:11,845
I must've read that
a hundred times.

374
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,604
- How's Eucalyptus?
- Uh, well, we're about to find out.

375
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:23,103
Okay, looks like you repaired
everything you could.

376
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:25,319
No ongoing bleeds.

377
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,104
Let's get him to the ICU,
keep him stable.

378
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:30,716
Monitor serial hematocrits,
and watch that kidney function.

379
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:32,979
Once he recovers
for 24 hours or so,

380
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,375
we can get that
wound vac out of him

381
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:35,678
and stitch him right back up.

382
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:37,288
Hold on.

383
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:39,158
Lower thoracic spine. Look.

384
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,074
Bullet is lodged in the bone

385
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:42,905
right next to the cord.
That's dangerously close.

386
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:45,905
We have to remove it.
If we don't and he moves

387
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:47,388
- the wrong way, then...
- He's paralyzed,

388
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:49,692
which might happen anyway,
regardless of what we do.

389
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:51,650
Add neurosurgeon
to the list of doctors

390
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:53,086
keeping Eucalyptus alive.

391
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:55,219
When you open him back up,
page me.

392
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:56,742
I'll come running.

393
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:08,547
I think something triggered
this drug test.

394
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:10,495
They suspect someone's using?

395
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,279
That would be my thought.

396
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:14,760
Well, who do you think it is?

397
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:17,367
What are we, living
in a police state?

398
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:19,193
They'll chip us next.

399
00:20:19,738 --> 00:20:22,437
Kidding. I know you're just
doing your job.

400
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,828
And doing it very nicely,
by the way.

401
00:20:36,406 --> 00:20:38,321
You wanted to talk? What's up?

402
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:40,743
Can you close the door?

403
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:52,662
This hospital-wide drug test.

404
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:55,010
Did you go to Kit
and suggest she do it?

405
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:57,542
Yes. Yes, I did.

406
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,562
What did you tell her?

407
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,633
I just said there was
a possibility

408
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:03,964
someone in the hospital
was taking drugs while on shift.

409
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,419
Did you name my father?

410
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:08,335
Of course not. I didn't even say
it was a doctor.

411
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:10,598
I talked to you about Ian
in confidence.

412
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,775
And I didn't break
that confidence.

413
00:21:12,862 --> 00:21:15,168
My conversation with Kit
was completely anonymous.

414
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,996
I can't believe
that you did this.

415
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,566
We can't have
a drug-addicted surgeon

416
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,999
operating on our patients.

417
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:22,393
I had an intuition, Conrad.

418
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:24,221
It was a feeling, that's all.

419
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:26,876
And if he's clean, fine.
If not, that's a violation

420
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:28,225
of the Hippocratic Oath.

421
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:29,945
"Do no harm."

422
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,742
This does a lot of harm,
to me and my family.

423
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:35,015
Did you think about that?

424
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:39,453
If he's using,

425
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:41,673
it's a dangerous situation
for everyone here,

426
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:43,414
including your dad.

427
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:46,243
So, yes, I did think
about your family.

428
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,664
If it was your father,

429
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:49,709
would you have dealt with it
by going to Dr. Voss?

430
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:55,252
Okay.

431
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,462
I hear you. I guess I would've
talked to him first.

432
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:00,549
Which is exactly
what I was going to do,

433
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,177
but you took it out of my hands.

434
00:22:02,743 --> 00:22:04,993
I don't need you to save me

435
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:06,526
or the members of my family.

436
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:07,861
You should've let me handle it.

437
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:09,830
If your father
was about to operate

438
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,525
on a vulnerable child
in your care,

439
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:13,884
would you be comfortable
with him doing it high?

440
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:19,831
And if that child suffered
irreparable harm...

441
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:23,541
...how would you live with it?

442
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:31,736
I have heard you.
Now, have you heard me?

443
00:22:37,537 --> 00:22:40,405
Eucalyptus is in the ICU.
I have to go.

444
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,249
Status update?

445
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:55,594
He's getting harder
to ventilate.

446
00:22:56,423 --> 00:22:58,468
Pressure is reading
artificially high.

447
00:22:58,553 --> 00:22:59,989
Let's increase the PEEP to 16

448
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:02,155
and set the driving
pressure alarm to 60.

449
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,242
- How's his urine output?
- Not good.

450
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:06,157
He needs more fluids
and more blood.

451
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:08,530
Uh, let's prep his neck
for another line.

452
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,319
The bullet destroyed his kidney,

453
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:16,460
so if he wants to survive
the next 48 hours,

454
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,944
he'll need dialysis
pretty much around the clock.

455
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:20,726
Page renal, Juliet.

456
00:23:20,963 --> 00:23:23,130
You'll have to give up
your other patients today.

457
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:24,651
You're on Eucalyptus watch

458
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:27,219
- for the rest of your shift.
- Yes, Dr. Sullivan.

459
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:28,998
You're putting him on

460
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,737
a "one nurse to one patient"
ratio?

461
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:32,301
We're short on nurses
to begin with.

462
00:23:32,385 --> 00:23:34,000
He needs real-time monitoring.

463
00:23:34,085 --> 00:23:35,628
And dialysis as well?

464
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:37,341
Do we even have
a machine available?

465
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:39,123
We do, but it's our last one.

466
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:43,699
Look, I will try
to manage his care

467
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:45,278
and keep costs low, but if we
don't throw everything at him

468
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:47,451
right now, he dies.

469
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:50,596
Of course.

470
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,319
Do what you have to do,

471
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,534
and-and thank you.

472
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:03,646
Hey.

473
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:07,181
Sorry it took so long.

474
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:10,206
Devon's been an angel,
but I am glad you're back.

475
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,605
How we doing?

476
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:14,391
Vitals are good. We're having
some small contractions.

477
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:16,173
Maybe I don't need a caesarean.

478
00:24:17,518 --> 00:24:18,964
I can give birth naturally.

479
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:20,729
I'm afraid that's not
in the cards.

480
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,834
Cervix is still only
at one centimeter,

481
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:25,144
and these contractions aren't
coming at regular intervals,

482
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:26,969
so I'm fairly certain
they're Braxton Hicks.

483
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:28,533
It's a false labor, Padma.

484
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:31,625
But the good news is,
our OR schedule has opened up,

485
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,933
so your C-section
is back on the board.

486
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:34,540
Oh, thank God.

487
00:24:34,938 --> 00:24:36,098
I'm gonna go get ready.

488
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,718
Someone will bring you down
very soon.

489
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:40,112
- Okay.
- Those twins will be here any minute now.

490
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,943
You ready?

491
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,293
- Yeah.
- Okay.

492
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,417
What's going on?

493
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:54,942
His pressure was soft,
but it just tanked.

494
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,244
Look at his abdomen.

495
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,886
Damn it.

496
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:01,090
Dialysis isn't working?

497
00:25:01,264 --> 00:25:02,877
No, he doesn't have enough blood
to make it through the circuit.

498
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,425
It's pooling in his abdomen.

499
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:07,017
Let's pause dialysis
and return what we can.

500
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:08,995
Get two more units
of blood up now.

501
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,676
I'm having trouble again
with the ventilation.

502
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,762
Got bloody secretions
from the ET tube.

503
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,558
Looks like he's bleeding
around the line. Guy's a mess.

504
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:16,602
We can get him
back to normal. Let's get two

505
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:19,501
- of FFP, some platelets, and...
- Dr. Sullivan,

506
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:22,200
the wound vac.

507
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:25,566
Canister's full. The blood's
backing up into his abdomen.

508
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,211
His internal bleeding is
out of control.

509
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,118
He needs the OR.

510
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:30,815
Page AJ.

511
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,800
Tell him we're coming in hot.

512
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,211
Again.

513
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:47,980
In. Out.

514
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:49,442
In. Out. You're gonna see

515
00:25:49,573 --> 00:25:50,838
your babies soon...
Just focus on that.

516
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:52,228
My baby boys.

517
00:25:52,358 --> 00:25:53,707
Hold up, guys.

518
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:55,927
I am so sorry, but I'm afraid

519
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:58,193
the twins are gonna have to stay
in there a little longer.

520
00:25:58,277 --> 00:25:59,136
- What?
- Why?

521
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:01,223
We got bumped out of the OR.
Another emergency.

522
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:03,832
Something to do with
the GSW again.

523
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,288
Eucalyptus.

524
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:10,419
OR One.

525
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:12,509
What?

526
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:16,287
I'm so sorry. I have to go,
but I will be back, okay?

527
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:17,469
Wh-When?

528
00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:19,648
Soon.

529
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:21,213
Soon?

530
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:24,206
Go. We can handle this.
We'll take care of it.

531
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,297
I will let you know the second
we're back on the schedule.

532
00:26:28,742 --> 00:26:30,701
Hey, don't worry,

533
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:32,181
I will not leave you again.

534
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:37,751
What do you mean "delayed"?

535
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:39,710
I've been waiting months
for a new hip.

536
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,495
I'm so sorry, Mr. Garret,
but unexpected emergencies

537
00:26:42,626 --> 00:26:44,581
can have a ripple effect
on scheduled surgeries.

538
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:47,147
- Will it even be today?
- You will get your new hip,

539
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:50,050
I promise, but we have to give
life-threatening cases priority.

540
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:51,768
No. Cancel it.

541
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:53,550
We need that room
five minutes ago.

542
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:55,862
We're shifting things around.

543
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:57,902
I'm sorry.
We're doing the best that we...

544
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,495
Wait, Dr. Sutton.

545
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,886
I've got to scrub in on the GSW.

546
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:02,320
The bullet is lodged
in his spine.

547
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:04,706
Dr. Miller says his myomectomy
needs to go.

548
00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:09,705
Everything that can push
is pushing.

549
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,183
We've got no choice.

550
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,440
How'd we get this low
on AB negative?

551
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:20,536
We were low to start, then
the GSW went through 50 units.

552
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,144
50?

553
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:26,800
Call scheduling, see if they can
bump the coronary bypass

554
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:28,612
- in OR Three.
- Bump a bypass?

555
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:31,425
That'll free up four units,
minimum.

556
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:34,886
Yes. This is Kay down in
blood bank. I need to bump a bypass.

557
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,466
I'm worried about Padma.

558
00:27:41,815 --> 00:27:43,600
Same here, but she'll be okay.

559
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:46,620
Flights get delayed,
you still make your destination.

560
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,098
Eventually.

561
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:50,315
After sitting at O'Hare
for ten miserable hours,

562
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,905
and sometimes they say,
"Get a hotel room,"

563
00:27:51,989 --> 00:27:54,189
- but then all the hotels are booked.
- Jessica.

564
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,399
All right.

565
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:02,178
Removing the wound vac.

566
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,753
Damn,
that's a lot of blood.

567
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,147
All right, set up extra suction.
Laps to me.

568
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:15,588
And massive transfusion
protocol, now.

569
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:20,457
Where's he bleeding from
this time?

570
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,054
Like I said, the
bullet went everywhere.

571
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:23,698
We have to approach this
systematically.

572
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:25,330
Okay, you lead, I'll follow.

573
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:27,232
Okay, repack every quadrant,

574
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:30,538
- and then remove them clockwise until we find it.
- Okay.

575
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:42,525
You're doing great.

576
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:48,365
I was really hoping to never
have to see this room again.

577
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:51,037
Honestly, same here.

578
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,346
Devon.

579
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:58,850
Something's happening.

580
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:03,221
Oh, it hurts under my belly...
A lot.

581
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:05,377
Dr. Johnson!

582
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:07,466
Oh, God!

583
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:09,286
I've got you.
It's gonna be okay.

584
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:12,365
- What's happening?
- Fetal heart rates are dropping.

585
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,388
She has lower left
abdominal pain.

586
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:19,667
She's bleeding from her uterus.

587
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:21,169
- An abruption?
- Yes.

588
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,834
Placenta's detached
from the uterine wall.

589
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:24,750
She needs an OR right away, but,
Devon, there's none available.

590
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:26,401
I'll make one available.

591
00:29:31,116 --> 00:29:33,205
Hey, we need an OR right away.

592
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,404
I'm sorry, Devon.
Every room's booked solid.

593
00:29:34,488 --> 00:29:36,248
Padma is having an abruption.
If we don't get

594
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,935
those babies out now, they die,
maybe she does, too.

595
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:43,116
Cancel the appendectomy
in OR Two.

596
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:45,116
Prep it for a C-section.

597
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:46,729
Thank you.

598
00:29:47,697 --> 00:29:49,115
Cancel OR Two.

599
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,031
Need for C-section.

600
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:54,204
Oh, God!

601
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:56,161
It hurts!

602
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:58,341
We're almost there, okay?

603
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:00,388
She's going into shock.

604
00:30:00,637 --> 00:30:02,122
Padma, I'm here. I got you.

605
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,183
Ten blade.

606
00:30:37,426 --> 00:30:38,833
Give me fundal pressure.

607
00:30:53,066 --> 00:30:54,896
Baby number one is out.

608
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,509
Reach.

609
00:31:08,594 --> 00:31:10,232
Baby number two.

610
00:31:20,817 --> 00:31:23,385
Okay, now, Padma, she's bleeding
heavily from the abruption.

611
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:25,035
Get me four units of blood
to catch up.

612
00:31:25,128 --> 00:31:27,364
We're out of AB negative.

613
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:28,888
In the entire hospital?

614
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:31,393
Yes, it was used up
from the gunshot wound.

615
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:32,483
Oh, my God.

616
00:31:32,568 --> 00:31:34,396
Let's try uncrossmatched blood.

617
00:31:34,674 --> 00:31:36,567
Okay, but we need it now.

618
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:40,700
Add TXA, more oxytocin.

619
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:42,857
I need help. Page trauma now.

620
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:51,733
I need four units
of uncrossmatched right now.

621
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:58,420
Two units are all we have left.

622
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:15,001
OB is paging trauma to OR Two.
Padma's had an abruption.

623
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:16,873
- An abruption?
- She's bleeding out.

624
00:32:18,962 --> 00:32:22,574
- She could die.
- Go. I'll finish here and join you as soon as I can.

625
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:27,423
- What can I do?
- Help me keep this son of a bitch alive.

626
00:32:27,536 --> 00:32:28,450
It's not his fault he got shot.

627
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,234
Are you certain of that?
Because I'm not.

628
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:34,630
His pressures are tanking.

629
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,461
All right, it's
coming from the liver.

630
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:38,315
We need to do a hepatectomy
to control the bleeding.

631
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,270
Clamps to Dr. Sutton.

632
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:48,644
Padma.

633
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:55,041
- Two units of uncrossmatched.
- That's it?

634
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:56,869
It's all they had.

635
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,436
Have you found the source?

636
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,525
Uh, not yet.
She had an abruption.

637
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:02,182
I treated her for atony.
I'm looking for the laceration.

638
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:04,224
Now she's
bleeding uncontrollably.

639
00:33:04,355 --> 00:33:06,139
These two units won't last long.

640
00:33:12,842 --> 00:33:14,496
Leela.

641
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,062
You've done this
a hundred times.

642
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:19,357
Here's what we're gonna do.

643
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:21,294
Get better exposure.
Laps, suction.

644
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:23,555
- Retractors to me.
- Ring forceps here.

645
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:28,669
Tear at the uterine artery with
an extension of a hysterotomy.

646
00:33:28,754 --> 00:33:30,538
It's in a tough spot.
Rotate more superiorly.

647
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:32,303
- This is as much as I can give.
- You're gonna have to give me more.

648
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,389
- I can't find the tear.
- Okay, if this doesn't work...

649
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,132
- It will work.
- Her pressure's tanking again.

650
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:37,889
- She's on two pressors.
- Leela, she's gonna code.

651
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:39,623
More suction. I know where I am.

652
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:41,740
I've isolated the vessel.

653
00:33:41,914 --> 00:33:43,525
Adding a third press or.

654
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:45,247
Get the crash cart.

655
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:47,332
Wait, hang on, hang on.
Almost there, almost there.

656
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:57,582
I've tied off the bleed.
We're good.

657
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:21,345
Partial hepatectomy complete.

658
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:24,217
Bleeding's stopped.

659
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:31,573
Pressures stabilizing.

660
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,792
All right,
2-0 silk suture to me.

661
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:35,117
AJ.

662
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,771
Go to Padma.

663
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,493
I'll try to remove the bullet.

664
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,716
Thank you.

665
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:42,282
I need access to dissect
down to the spine.

666
00:34:46,802 --> 00:34:48,372
Okay, retract.

667
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:50,683
Hey.

668
00:34:50,945 --> 00:34:53,466
- How's Padma?
- She's okay.

669
00:34:54,431 --> 00:34:56,737
She's stable.
We stopped the bleeding.

670
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:59,161
Leela did it. She's a boss.

671
00:35:00,036 --> 00:35:01,864
Of course she was.

672
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:06,131
The babies are in the NICU
if you want to go see them.

673
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:09,065
<i>"Angels" by Khalid playing...</i>

00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:30,245
Strong hearts,

688
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,766
no sign of any adverse effects

689
00:36:31,851 --> 00:36:33,958
- from the abruption.
- Oh, that's welcome news.

690
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:35,128
And Padma?

691
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,612
Last I heard, on her way to ICU.

692
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:39,198
Extubated and stable.

693
00:36:40,876 --> 00:36:42,425
That what you wanted
to see me about?

694
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,555
Oh, no.

695
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:47,335
You tested positive
for benzodiazepines.

696
00:36:49,028 --> 00:36:50,768
That's not possible.

697
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:56,631
Actually, it is possible.

698
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,206
I've been taking oxaprozin
for my back pain.

699
00:37:01,322 --> 00:37:03,190
I took two yesterday.

700
00:37:03,594 --> 00:37:05,557
Can make you test positive
for benzos.

701
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:07,040
It's happened before.

702
00:37:07,163 --> 00:37:09,573
I should've said something
before the test.

703
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:10,739
My mistake.

704
00:37:11,823 --> 00:37:13,952
Okay. Makes sense.

705
00:37:14,037 --> 00:37:16,343
- All right.
- Oh, but, Dr. Sullivan,

706
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:19,392
I'm sorry,
but I can't have you operate

707
00:37:19,523 --> 00:37:20,959
with a positive test result.

708
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:22,636
It's against hospital rules.

709
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:25,026
You'll have to stop taking
the oxaprozin,

710
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:26,243
let it clear your system,

711
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,728
and then get tested again
in a week.

712
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:30,229
Okay, sure.

713
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:31,706
Okay, I'll make sure

714
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,272
the test administrator
puts you on the schedule.

715
00:37:35,804 --> 00:37:37,502
Should be clear by then,
no problem.

716
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:02,629
She looks good.

717
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:04,699
I'm gonna try to wake her up.

718
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,483
Padma?

719
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:13,003
Padma?

720
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,807
It's Dr. Sullivan.

721
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:17,518
How you feeling?

722
00:38:22,556 --> 00:38:25,027
Where are the babies?

723
00:38:25,112 --> 00:38:27,575
They're fine.
They're in the NICU.

724
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,028
Crying, just like babies do.

725
00:38:30,113 --> 00:38:31,767
Strong and healthy.

726
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,104
There was a
serious complication.

727
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:37,035
You'll likely have
a long recovery,

728
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,296
but you're okay now.

729
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:41,736
Call me if you need anything.

730
00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:09,198
Got a sec?

731
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,113
There's something
I have to tell you.

732
00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:19,083
I don't want you to get upset.

733
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:21,496
I've tested positive for benzos.

734
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:23,678
No, it's not what you think.

735
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:26,258
I've been taking oxaprozin
for my back.

736
00:39:26,343 --> 00:39:28,127
It causes a false positive.

737
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:30,451
Didn't you realize
the oxaprozin would do that?

738
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:31,450
I should've.

739
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,426
I didn't.

740
00:39:33,511 --> 00:39:34,934
Kit's asked me
to stop taking them.

741
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:37,108
I'll test again in a week.
I should be clear by then.

742
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:42,125
Okay.

743
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:44,070
It's no worries, Dad.

744
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:47,345
Just wanted you to know.

745
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:19,286
Any idea when we can transfer
him out of the hospital?

746
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:21,705
A week, maybe longer.

747
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,174
We'll have a hard time
placing him

748
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:24,604
in a long-term care facility.

749
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:27,351
The bullet transected
his spinal cord.

750
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,281
Eucalyptus
will never walk again.

751
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,585
Poor guy.

752
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:34,676
And we don't even know
if he has health insurance.

753
00:40:34,805 --> 00:40:36,728
Health insurance?

754
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:38,859
We don't even know his name.
Winston came up empty.

755
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,657
One bullet caused
so much mayhem.

756
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:46,469
For our patient
and for our hospital.

757
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:49,846
One damn bullet.

758
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,668
We good?

759
00:41:05,836 --> 00:41:07,712
My father tested positive.

760
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:10,861
He has an excuse.

761
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:13,470
Said he's been taking pain meds
for his back.

762
00:41:15,454 --> 00:41:17,415
Is that possible?

763
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,470
It's possible.

764
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,626
But...

765
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,573
We don't have to talk about it.

766
00:41:28,813 --> 00:41:30,704
We don't have to talk
about anything.

767
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,251
Come home with me.

768
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:36,001
I need to be alone.

769
00:41:37,054 --> 00:41:38,534
Do some thinking.

770
00:41:41,892 --> 00:41:43,204
Tomorrow?

771
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:44,806
Sure thing.

772
00:41:46,648 --> 00:41:48,085
Whatever you need.

773
00:42:23,113 --> 00:42:24,423
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

774
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:25,987
Good work today.

775
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:29,710
Got a male, teenager,
single GSW to the chest.

776
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:32,637
No exit wounds. BP crashing,
no breath sounds to the right.

777
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,566
- Does he have a name?
- Unconscious at scene, no I.D.

778
00:42:40,452 --> 00:42:41,627
We're on F.

779
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,238
How about Fuchsia?

780
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:45,762
Welcome to Chastain, Fuchsia.

781
00:42:47,677 --> 00:42:50,071
All right, let's get you
to Trauma Bay Nine.

782
00:42:53,726 --> 00:42:55,686
- Call respiratory.
- And set up for a chest tube.

783
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,600
Call blood bank.
