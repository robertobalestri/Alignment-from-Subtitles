1
00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:02,561
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:04,257
- Would Nic approve
of me , with Cade?

3
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:05,658
- I just want you
<i>- To be happy.</i>

4
00:00:05,683 --> 00:00:07,760
It feels like there's
<i>something between you.</i>

5
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:11,104
We share something that's...
It's hard to describe.

6
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,485
I am not bargaining with you.

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,401
Please, uh, anything
that you want,

8
00:00:14,426 --> 00:00:15,626
but you cannot tell Conrad.

9
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:16,893
If you go to rehab,

10
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:18,039
I won't tell anyone.

11
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:20,378
<i>I just closed
on the perfect condo</i>

12
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:21,955
<i>for Padma and the babies.</i>

13
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:23,290
<i>Babies cry, Padma.</i>

14
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:25,648
<i>No, this is
hard, do you understand?</i>

15
00:00:25,673 --> 00:00:27,385
What are they doing?
They're pulling the plug?

16
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:29,554
You can save everyone
in this damn hospital,

17
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:30,906
but you won't save her?

18
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,173
Nic is gone.

19
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,507
I'll never forgive you for this.

20
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:43,990
Miss me already?

21
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:45,567
<i>You know I do.</i>

22
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:48,147
How's your drive up
to the vineyard going?

23
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,556
<i>Good. I, um...</i>

24
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:52,172
- I just got here.
<i>- Oh.</i>

25
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:54,239
Okay then, what's on the agenda

26
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:56,929
for this long-awaited
girls' trip?

27
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:00,204
Wine tasting today,

28
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,811
all day spa
reservation tomorrow.

29
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:04,264
Well, I'm glad
you're getting away.

30
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:06,859
You work hard. You
deserve a break.

31
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:08,276
<i>Have fun.</i>

32
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,559
Bye.

33
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,730
Hi, are you here for family day?

34
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:20,680
Yes.

35
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,749
And your loved one is?

36
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:25,001
My father, Dr. Ian Sullivan.

37
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:28,505
Welcome. Sign in.

38
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,187
AJ, hi.

39
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:32,581
<i>Your text was vague.</i>

40
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:34,417
<i>Where are you? Is
everything okay?</i>

41
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,892
Oh, I'm sorry. My van
broke down in Savannah,

42
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:39,100
and I couldn't get it into
a shop until this morning.

43
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,603
<i>Okay. Well, I'm glad
you're all right.</i>

44
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:43,531
Well, they said it could
be fixed by this afternoon,

45
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:45,107
<i>so I'll be back
as soon as I can.</i>

46
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:47,109
Great. All right, look,
Serena's here early,

47
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,686
so we've got it covered
till you get back.

48
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,135
<i>Great, I guess
I'll see you then.</i>

49
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:53,282
Hey, let me put you on
speakerphone so the boys

50
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:54,564
<i>can hear your voice.</i>

51
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:56,776
Actually, AJ, I can't.

52
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:59,043
The mechanic just got
here, so I have to go.

53
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:02,379
<i>Sure. All right, well, text me
when you're back on the road.</i>

54
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,569
A 68-year-old man, found
passed out on the street,

55
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:18,307
lacerations on his
forehead and knees,

56
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,834
heartrate's in
the 50s, BP 98/52.

57
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,478
Can you grab
me some stuff for labs

58
00:02:22,502 --> 00:02:24,686
- and an EKG machine?
- I got it.

59
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:26,881
On my count.

60
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:28,497
One, two, three.

61
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,320
Chastain was the
nearest hospital,

62
00:02:31,344 --> 00:02:32,413
but he did not
want to come here.

63
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:33,742
Yeah, yeah, and I still don't.

64
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:35,609
Look, hey, hey.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

65
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:37,068
Just-just... Let me out of...

66
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:39,064
I got to... I-I got to...
I got to be somewhere...

67
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:40,901
Conrad, you
better get over here.

68
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:42,704
It's Nic's dad.

69
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,775
Nice to see you too, Kyle.

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Wait, you guys know him?

71
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,249
It's been a minute.

72
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:53,381
It sure has.

73
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,807
Oh, I want out of here.
Get me out of here.

74
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:58,422
We just want to help you.

75
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:00,316
Yeah, well, they can...
They can check me out,

76
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,683
but you, you stay the
hell away from me.

77
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:15,694

78
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:37,867
God. Kyle Nevin.

79
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:41,079
The last time I saw him
was the day Nic died.

80
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,967
He didn't even come
to the funeral,

81
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:44,439
he was so angry at me.

82
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:47,102
He's still upset with
you five years later?

83
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:49,450
Figured he'd get in touch

84
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:51,975
if he wanted to see
his granddaughter.

85
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:55,502
But he never did.

86
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:57,355
How does he seem?

87
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,637
Not well.

88
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:01,524
He's not taking care of himself.

89
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:03,601
I should have tried
harder to reconnect.

90
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,436
You tried.

91
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:11,017
If he didn't even want to
see Gigi, that's on him.

92
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,698
Blaming you for Nic's death,

93
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:15,652
after we did everything we
could to try and save her?

94
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:23,299
The scans just came back
on one of my patients.

95
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:25,715
Are you good?

96
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:27,738
Yeah.

97
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:36,772
Have you ever passed
out like this before?

98
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:38,838
What? No. No, I was just
walking to my car. Maybe...

99
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,691
I don't know, maybe I tripped
or something. I don't know.

100
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:45,957
Do you have trouble
getting up stairs or hills?

101
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:47,511
Look, I run out of
breath sometimes,

102
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:48,923
but find me a guy
my age that doesn't.

103
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:51,651
Is there anyone I can call
to bring you your things,

104
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:53,083
- to make you more comfortable?
- No, no, no.

105
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:54,768
I don't have any
friends here anymore.

106
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:57,690
I just came to Georgia to
clear out a storage unit.

107
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,399
Okay.

108
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:01,469
Where are you living these days?

109
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:02,919
Vermont.

110
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,877
Is there a doctor
there that I can call

111
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:05,997
to get your medical history?

112
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:08,385
No, no. No, look, stop.
No, there are no doctors,

113
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,910
there is no history.

114
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:14,640
None that I care
to remember anyway.

115
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:17,336
Oh, this place looks
exactly the same.

116
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:19,649
Oh, well, there've been
some changes around here.

117
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:22,232
We even have a new preschool
and a kindergarten now...

118
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:24,424
Wait, what? Preschool?
What kind of kid

119
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:26,658
wants to go to
preschool at a hospital?

120
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:29,687
There's one student
there you might know.

121
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:31,188
Gigi?

122
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,949
- Yup.
- Gigi?

123
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:35,155
Yeah, she's in kindergarten,

124
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,072
so we see her a lot around here.

125
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:39,727
All right, so,

126
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:40,977
I would like to admit you,

127
00:05:41,002 --> 00:05:43,243
get you on repeat
labs and an EKG.

128
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:45,256
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah, sure, whatever.

129
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:47,080
Can I see Gigi first?

130
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:50,977
Thanks for doing this.

131
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,867
Once Kyle realized
that Gigi was here,

132
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:55,189
he wouldn't talk
about anything else.

133
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:57,047
Well, that's a surprise,

134
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:59,365
but if it gives me a way
to get eyes on him...

135
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,267
Why haven't I seen
Grandpa before?

136
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:05,361
He lives far away.

137
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,740
Gigi, that's
your grandfather, Kyle.

138
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:12,115
Kyle...

139
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:14,544
you remember Georgiana Grace.

140
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,052
Say hi, honey.

141
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:18,306
Hi.

142
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:20,070
Wow.

143
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,142
You look a lot like
your mother did

144
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,813
when she was about your age.

145
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:25,980
Everyone says
she looks like Nic.

146
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:27,641
Yeah.

147
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,891
Hey, you want to come up here

148
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,516
and you want to sit beside me?

149
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:36,438
Yeah? Okay.

150
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,499
Come on.

151
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:43,761
That's a girl.

152
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,638
Are you okay, Kyle?

153
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,986
Yeah, yeah, I just
got that capal thing.

154
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:49,804
- Whatever...
- Carpal tunnel?

155
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:53,524
Carpal tunnel, yeah, both hands,

156
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:57,508
but... hardly the worst
of my worries right now.

157
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:01,463
You look different from the
pictures Daddy showed me.

158
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,758
More handsome, I hope?

159
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,530
You showed her pictures?

160
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:12,140
Of course.

161
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,685
I wanted her to know
her grandfather.

162
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:21,510
There she
is.

163
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:26,056
Thanks for making the drive.

164
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,162
You look great, Dad.

165
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:30,187
How are you feeling?

166
00:07:30,212 --> 00:07:32,212
Honestly, the last few weeks

167
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:34,547
have been tougher
than I expected.

168
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:35,930
Because of the detox?

169
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,992
Crazy nausea, palpitations,

170
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:39,508
panic attacks on steroids.

171
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,235
That wasn't even the worst part.

172
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,578
What was?

173
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,321
Therapy.

174
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,235
Our counselor Genevieve,
she takes no prisoners.

175
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,046
She had me digging into stuff
I've avoided for a long time.

176
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,571
About my father.

177
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,089
Your mother.

178
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:55,149
And you think that's helped?

179
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,558
I know it has.

180
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:59,245
But what kept me going?

181
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:01,374
Knowing I'd see you today.

182
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,899
All right,

183
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:06,119
if everyone could please take
a seat, we'll get started.

184
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,272
Look, I told you
everything Padma told me.

185
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:15,110
She's in Savannah,
she'll be back tonight.

186
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:17,572
I know what she said,
but how did she sound?

187
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,769
Normal.

188
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:20,715
Why isn't she
returning my calls?

189
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,998
This is your sister we're
talking about, all right?

190
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:25,465
Whose idea of fun is
llama yoga in the woods.

191
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,399
AJ, I'm really
getting worried, okay?

192
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,998
She really loves her babies.

193
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:31,673
These last few months have
been rough on everybody,

194
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:33,031
especially Padma.

195
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:35,781
So if she needs an extra
day or two to unwind,

196
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,875
that's a win for everybody.

197
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,521
And plus, I've made sure the
boys are well taken care of.

198
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:41,771
We're good.

199
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,424
I got to go.

200
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,438
<i>Hi, you've reached
Padma. Leave a message.</i>

201
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:03,088
This bright area is the tumor.

202
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,353
After all these
years, it's... back?

203
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,189
It's a good thing that you and
Lance brought her in today.

204
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,189
Now that we know
what's going on...

205
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:21,063
we need to talk
about what's next.

206
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:23,674
You mean surgery,
like last time?

207
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,002
It's more complicated now.

208
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:29,093
Your mom is older, she's
not quite as strong,

209
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:32,610
and the tumor is
different, larger,

210
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:35,906
and now in an area of the brain
that's more dangerous to access,

211
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:38,684
with a very high risk of
bleeding if we operate.

212
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,567
I don't recommend surgery.

213
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:42,259
You don't want to save her?

214
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,422
Of course I do.

215
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,224
But based on the location
and size of the tumor,

216
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:52,000
I believe that surgery is
more likely to do harm.

217
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,444
You're saying you
can't fix this?

218
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,980
Even if you make it through
the surgery, you could die,

219
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:00,610
sooner rather than later,
because we operated.

220
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:04,349
And a cure isn't
possible in my opinion.

221
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:06,223
You're not hearing us.

222
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,818
We are not giving up on
her, and neither should you.

223
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,143
I beat cancer once.

224
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:14,911
I'll beat it again.

225
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:18,078
I want the surgery.

226
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,530
And if you
won't operate,

227
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,024
well, we'll find
someone who will.

228
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:29,275
We need a more detailed
patient history.

229
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,420
Well, Kyle hasn't been
exactly forthcoming,

230
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:32,695
but I will keep trying.

231
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,080
I guess I'll go check on
patients who want my help today.

232
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:36,880
We'll keep you posted.

233
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:38,147
Thank you.

234
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,555
Hey, did you call for

235
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,078
an interventional cardiologist?

236
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:43,016
I did not.

237
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:44,368
Hey.

238
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,358
Oh, hey.

239
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:49,381
Gentlemen, I saw
Mr. Nevin bradying down

240
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:51,055
on the monitors at
the nurses' station,

241
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,988
figured I'd check in and
make sure he's doing okay.

242
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,295
New guy's got to be
proactive, right?

243
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,763
Dr. Yamada thinks he knows
what might be going on.

244
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:01,577
I'd like to start
with a stress test.

245
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:05,056
And I'd like Dr. Austin to
examine my patient first.

246
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,155
Thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

247
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,491
Sure, but you'll
need to go fast.

248
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,516
Transport is on the way.

249
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,488
Wonderful.

250
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:15,393
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

251
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:24,680
How's he doing?

252
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,030
His stress test just started.

253
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:28,991
Thanks for getting him
set up, Dr. Yamada.

254
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:30,921
- I'll take it from here.
- I'd like to stick around

255
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:32,740
- and help out.
- Well, I really appreciate that,

256
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:34,855
but Kyle is basically family.

257
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,939
So, I'm in a unique position
to offer clinical judgment

258
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,556
without any personal
feelings in the way.

259
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:46,451
Hey, we got it.

260
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:50,832
- Got a chair for you.
- We got a chair right here.

261
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,855
- All right.
- There you go.

262
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,188
Oh, I'm good.

263
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:57,606
I just got a little
dizzy.

264
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,813
Let me see the printout.

265
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:06,588
His heartrate didn't increase
during the stress test

266
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:07,936
like we would have
expected it to.

267
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,179
It was too low.

268
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:11,535
That's why he's been
short of breath.

269
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:15,979
If it gets any
lower, he could die.

270
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:17,417
And if we don't intervene,

271
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,522
that's exactly what will happen.

272
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:28,369
But let's face it,

273
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,832
at the end of the day,

274
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:31,621
addiction isn't one
person's disease.

275
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:33,529
It's the entire family's.

276
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:35,221
Maybe you feel guilt

277
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:37,105
because you didn't
recognize it sooner,

278
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,170
or you're angry
because you didn't get

279
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:41,024
the love and care
you longed for.

280
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:44,294
So later today, your loved
ones will get a chance

281
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:46,468
to hear what you've
been through.

282
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:49,828
Everyone must talk honestly,

283
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,457
maybe for the first time,

284
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:54,608
for true recovery to begin.

285
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:06,052
Oh.

286
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,621
Well, what a wonderful surprise

287
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,146
to wake up to.

288
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:15,129
Daddy told me to let you sleep.
He said you needed your rest.

289
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:18,381
You tell him you were
quiet as a mouse.

290
00:13:19,934 --> 00:13:22,268
He said you fell. Are you hurt?

291
00:13:23,044 --> 00:13:24,944
Not really.

292
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:27,884
Just my pride.

293
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,213
Daddy can fix that, too. He
can make anything better.

294
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,246
Except your mom.

295
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:39,187
He couldn't save her.

296
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:43,821
He tried. He
misses her so much.

297
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:53,870
I think it's time we
consider possible next steps.

298
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,490
I only see one. We
need to get Mr. Nevin

299
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:57,371
to the cath lab right away.

300
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:59,541
Because you think
his episodes of bradycardia

301
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:02,433
are caused by a
lesion you can stent?

302
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,157
- Seems likely to me.
- Hmm.

303
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:05,886
It's possible. His
stress test didn't show

304
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,860
- signs of ischemia.
- No slam dunk signs of it,

305
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:09,605
but there were
nonspecific changes.

306
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,033
All right,
let's back up here.

307
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:13,633
There is no clear evidence
of coronary artery disease.

308
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,421
AJ's right. Kyle
only failed the test

309
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:17,731
because he couldn't
increase his heartrate.

310
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,663
Which could be
due to a blockage.

311
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:21,472
Or maybe he just
needs a pacemaker.

312
00:14:21,497 --> 00:14:24,144
Okay, and what
would you recommend?

313
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,285
I want to monitor him, get
an electrophysiology study,

314
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,339
and probably go ahead
and put in a pacemaker.

315
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:32,348
And while we're waiting, he may
very well have a heart attack.

316
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:35,769
All right, why don't
we start with the cath?

317
00:14:35,794 --> 00:14:37,925
If there's blockage,
maybe we find the source.

318
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,144
In the meantime, I don't
think a stent or a pacemaker's

319
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:42,189
the full answer, so
we keep searching,

320
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,140
not just for something that
explains his arrhythmia,

321
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:45,830
but the rest of his issues, too.

322
00:14:45,855 --> 00:14:47,521
Sounds like a plan.

323
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:48,970
Cool.

324
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:55,431
If I really thought
Doris had a shot,

325
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:56,843
of course I'd take it.

326
00:14:56,868 --> 00:14:58,868
That's all tumor.

327
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:02,445
It is, and entangled
in the vasculature.

328
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,131
At worst, she never
makes it out of the OR,

329
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,579
and at best, surgery buys her,

330
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:07,828
what, a few months?

331
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,204
Likely with permanent
neurological deficits.

332
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:14,427
A doctor has the right
to refuse to operate.

333
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:16,171
But her sons said
that if I don't,

334
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:17,761
they'll find a surgeon who will.

335
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,362
They're not gonna find
anyone as good as you.

336
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:26,994
Look, it's your decision,

337
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,394
but... if there's even
the slightest chance

338
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,338
she could end up better off,

339
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:35,027
you're the best person to
give her a decent outcome.

340
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:45,884
I'm sorry, you guys
can't go any further.

341
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:53,368
Hey, you got this, Mom.

342
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:57,199
We love you.

343
00:15:58,106 --> 00:15:59,906
You'll be okay.

344
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:19,609
So, Dr. Yamada found a
lesion in the right coronary artery.

345
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:22,352
He's stenting it now.

346
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:24,267
If Kyle's bradycardia persists,

347
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:25,837
he's definitely gonna
need a pacemaker.

348
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:28,236
Something else is going on here.

349
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,407
Nic would
want me to help him.

350
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:34,743
I mean, I'm just gonna say, I'm
surprised you are not angry.

351
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:36,234
I mean, the man walked away

352
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,695
from you and his
only grandchild.

353
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,553
I forgave him a long time ago.

354
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:42,906
The day Nic died, he lost
the only child he had left.

355
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:45,070
The need to blame
someone's natural.

356
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:47,363
Well, seems to me,
once we patch him up,

357
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:49,146
he's going to be on his way,

358
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:51,099
and probably not coming back.

359
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:54,572
Yeah, so whatever is wrong
with him, we better fix it now.

360
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:03,794
This tumor is even more vascular

361
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,157
than it appeared on the scans.

362
00:17:06,753 --> 00:17:08,365
Pressures are dropping fast.

363
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,777
It's eroding into
the surrounding vessels.

364
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:11,968
She's bleeding out.

365
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:13,567
Increase suction.

366
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:15,164
Add a pressor.

367
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:17,087
We're maxed out.

368
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:19,175
Then activate massive
transfusion protocol.

369
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,457
We need to buy some time.

370
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:21,611
Don't give up.

371
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:23,119
Hang in there.

372
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:24,467
Forceps.

373
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:27,949
I knew this was a bad idea.

374
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:39,924
You're Ian's daughter, right?

375
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:41,881
Uh, yeah, I am.

376
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:42,922
Jan Price.

377
00:17:42,947 --> 00:17:45,281
Fellow inmate. That's
what we call ourselves

378
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:46,616
- since we can't leave.
- Ah.

379
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:48,765
Ian told me you're
not only an ER doctor,

380
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,696
but an ICU doc, too?

381
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:53,232
Yeah, I couldn't
choose, so I chose both.

382
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:54,868
Well, that's impressive.

383
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:57,429
No wonder he doesn't
stop talking about you.

384
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:00,579
Especially the way that
you took care of him

385
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:02,327
when he was diagnosed
with cancer.

386
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:04,661
That meant a lot to him.

387
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:08,080
That's nice to hear.

388
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:11,764
Sorry. Did he tell
you to say all this?

389
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:13,788
No, not at all.

390
00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:15,716
I just wish I were
more like your dad.

391
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:17,485
He's been a
cheerleader for us all,

392
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,994
and an inspiration
for many of us here.

393
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:22,761
Nice meeting you.

394
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,475
The tumor was deep
inside the brain,

395
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,362
entangled among several
key blood vessels.

396
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:36,703
And you got it out?

397
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:39,265
Yes, but there was a
lot of bleeding, and...

398
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,780
Now our mom's gonna be okay?

399
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,383
I never said that.

400
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:47,130
I was honest about
the risks involved,

401
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:49,577
and the fact that a total
cure isn't possible.

402
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:52,216
The surgery went as
well as it could,

403
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:54,330
but we won't know for sure
how Doris tolerated it

404
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:55,516
until she wakes up.

405
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,515
And even then, her
recovery will be long

406
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,240
with the possibility of
many post-op complications.

407
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,827
You said that she wouldn't
make it out of surgery...

408
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,158
but she did.

409
00:19:09,352 --> 00:19:11,502
We know our mom.

410
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,342
She's gonna beat this.

411
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:24,721
Padma's gonna call you
back as soon as she can.

412
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,596
No, something's not right.

413
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:30,216
"Twintuition" is
real, and in the past,

414
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:31,575
no matter how far
away she's gone,

415
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,284
I could always sense if
she was sick or hurting

416
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:37,143
or in trouble.

417
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:40,204
But Padma has gone radio
silent like this before, right?

418
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:42,880
I remember that one time she
left in her van for a month

419
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,496
without taking her cell phone.

420
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:45,869
She was connecting with nature.

421
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,114
That was long before
she had babies.

422
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,518
Okay, here's what we know:

423
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:54,159
She told AJ that she was
gonna be back tonight,

424
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:56,729
and tonight is still
a couple hours away.

425
00:19:56,754 --> 00:19:58,996
And you...

426
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:02,294
sometimes get overly anxious
when it comes to your sister.

427
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:10,047
Maybe, just for today,
give her some space.

428
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:13,755
She's not answering texts
because she doesn't want to.

429
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:16,630
Okay.

430
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:19,245
All right, I'll see you.

431
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:38,051
You have
a new doctor, I see.

432
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:40,738
Uh, nurse, thank you very much.

433
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,717
Daddy said I could spend
recess with Grandpa Kyle.

434
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:45,924
Oh.

435
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,113
Your heart is good.
Do you have any pain?

436
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,793
Yeah, yeah, I do.

437
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,669
My back hurts.

438
00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:55,360
- It's... It...
- Let me take a look.

439
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:05,993
Grandpa! Grandpa!

440
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,518
Come here, Gigi.

441
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:09,301
Take Gigi.

442
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,326
I need a code cart in here.

443
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,660
What happened?

444
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:19,809
She had some runs of V tach,
but then went into V fib.

445
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:22,396
Likely from a
cerebral catastrophe.

446
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,894
I wish I could have
at least gotten her to CT.

447
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,666
Her pupils are
fixed and dilated.

448
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:29,254
I've already given her mannitol.
We've shocked her three times

449
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,047
with no return of
spontaneous circulation.

450
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:34,634
There's nothing more we can do.

451
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:41,480
Time of death 16:37.

452
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,885
This is exactly what
I was afraid of.

453
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,941
They should've listened to me.

454
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,346
Where are her sons?

455
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:53,416
I have to operate on
another critical patient.

456
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:55,033
They went to the cafeteria.

457
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:57,832
Well, I'll break the news
to them as soon as I'm out.

458
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,605
Sure, we hope this
time is different,

459
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,797
but honestly, I doubt it.

460
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,246
Three times in treatment,
three times it failed.

461
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,370
I don't know how long we
can keep trying to help

462
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:20,877
before we walk away.

463
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,748
And we can't keep
the truth about your disease

464
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:25,773
from Mom and Dad any longer.

465
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:27,526
Yes, it'll hurt them,

466
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:29,885
but how can you
accept responsibility

467
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,095
for the pain you've caused
if we keep covering it up?

468
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,795
Jan, can you see

469
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,467
how your sisters lying for you

470
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:39,414
is detrimental to them?

471
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,728
And how that enables you?

472
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:44,678
I never asked
anyone to lie.

473
00:22:44,703 --> 00:22:47,833
Seriously? You asked
me to lie to your work

474
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:49,949
when you blacked out
at the Hawks game.

475
00:22:49,974 --> 00:22:52,561
Not to mention all the
lies you've told me.

476
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:55,417
I can't believe the last time
I actually believed a word

477
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:58,426
coming out of your mouth. I
feel like you would lie to us

478
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:00,860
about anything.

479
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,706
Is Grandpa okay?

480
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:13,771
Well, his heart slowed down
just for a little while,

481
00:23:13,796 --> 00:23:16,015
which is why he
seemed to fall asleep,

482
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,040
but it started again.

483
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:19,773
Is he gonna die?

484
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,519
We're figuring out what's wrong.

485
00:23:23,544 --> 00:23:24,801
Now...

486
00:23:25,623 --> 00:23:27,715
you should go back
to your classroom

487
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,384
and let the doctors
do their work.

488
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,961
Come on, princess, let's get
you back to your schoolmates.

489
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:36,254
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

490
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,418
His heart rate stopped
for five seconds,

491
00:23:41,443 --> 00:23:43,218
then spontaneously restarted.

492
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:45,377
If the blockage Dr. Yamada found

493
00:23:45,402 --> 00:23:46,693
was the sole cause
of his issues,

494
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:47,942
this wouldn't have happened.

495
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,800
He must have sick
sinus syndrome.

496
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:51,880
Okay, so we agree that
he needs a pacemaker?

497
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:54,472
Yes, we are all in agreement.

498
00:23:54,497 --> 00:23:56,283
Well, the question
is why he needs it.

499
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:57,878
Hawkins, I trust your judgment.

500
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,484
If there's another diagnosis

501
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:00,903
to be found, you'll find it,

502
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:03,167
but this man needs a pacer,
and he needs it yesterday.

503
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,445
Yeah, let's get him
on the schedule.

504
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,379
Hey, where's our mom?

505
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:09,880
Did you move her?

506
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:16,469
There was a
post-op complication.

507
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:18,661
Your mother's heart stopped,

508
00:24:18,686 --> 00:24:21,820
and we did everything we could

509
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:23,567
to try to restart it, but...

510
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:26,848
she didn't make it.

511
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:29,634
I'm so sorry.

512
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:33,573
What the hell are
you talking about?

513
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:36,837
You're saying she's dead?

514
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:40,126
She was just here.
I just saw her.

515
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:43,786
We need to talk to
Dr. Sutton. Now.

516
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:46,052
She got pulled into
an emergency surgery,

517
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:48,134
and she wanted to be
the one to tell you.

518
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,887
I am so sorry.

519
00:24:49,912 --> 00:24:52,344
No, no, no, no. No!

520
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:54,095
Please calm down.

521
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
We don't even know
who the hell you are.

522
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,410
Dr. Sutton was the one

523
00:24:57,435 --> 00:24:58,515
who did the operation.

524
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,094
We have grief counselors.
Let me call them.

525
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,077
Haven't you done enough?!

526
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:13,013
Sealing off the aneurysm.

527
00:25:14,219 --> 00:25:15,638
Is this where they kill people?!

528
00:25:15,663 --> 00:25:16,666
You can't be in here.

529
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,930
This is a sterile environment.

530
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:20,386
- You killed our mother!
- Code Gray in OR Two.

531
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:22,198
Give me that!

532
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:23,641
Security is coming.

533
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,459
Get out of my OR.

534
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:48,261
Are you okay?

535
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:50,362
Did security find them?

536
00:25:50,387 --> 00:25:52,844
No, they're still looking,
but they think they're gone.

537
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:55,036
Billie, I am so sorry.

538
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:57,216
The sons, they just...
They just walked in,

539
00:25:57,273 --> 00:25:58,349
and the mother wasn't there.

540
00:25:58,373 --> 00:25:59,413
I had to tell them.

541
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,547
It's not your fault.

542
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:03,835
They were wrong to
push for the surgery.

543
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:08,134
Maybe they know it,
so they blame someone.

544
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:15,702
Sometimes I don't know
how I keep doing this.

545
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,335
Are you okay?

546
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:26,905
I don't want to be okay.

547
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:31,307
That would mean that I've lost
the ability to feel anything.

548
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:37,084
You should go home.

549
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,492
I can't.

550
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:43,136
I have another patient
I actually can help.

551
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:47,273
I have to do it.
That's why I'm here.

552
00:26:49,344 --> 00:26:51,821
The work helps to steady me.

553
00:26:54,243 --> 00:26:55,510
I got this.

554
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:02,771
Ventricular lead.

555
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:05,507
Thank you, Dr. Yamada.

556
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:09,829
You know, you would make
an excellent assistant,

557
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:11,729
Dr. Yamada.

558
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,636
Well, be sure to
pin the guide wire

559
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:18,060
to the drape, Dr. Austin.

560
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:20,546
We don't want it ending up
in the pulmonary circulation.

561
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:23,632
I hadn't planned on
that, Dr. Yamada.

562
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:26,724
Do they both need
to be in there?

563
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:29,355
There's a bit of a
turf battle going on.

564
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:32,353
I'm worried about Kyle
after he leaves Chastain.

565
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:34,799
Maybe his underlying
diagnosis is loneliness.

566
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:36,060
That is more dangerous

567
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:37,476
than some diseases.

568
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:39,699
And harder to treat.

569
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:43,049
Good, we have capture.

570
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:44,247
Nice.

571
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:47,004
Pressure's in the 80s.

572
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:48,195
Stop the V pacing.

573
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,788
Now, let's get the
atrial lead in.

574
00:27:49,813 --> 00:27:51,292
We're gonna have to
start on the pressors.

575
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,355
Hold on, hold on.

576
00:27:56,971 --> 00:28:01,402
Well, look at that,
pressure's back up.

577
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:05,867
His blood pressure tanked

578
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,649
as soon as they
paced his ventricles.

579
00:28:07,674 --> 00:28:10,296
So when his ventricle was the only
chamber working, his pressure fell.

580
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,895
Which could happen because
his ventricle is so thick.

581
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,820
Which is generally the result of

582
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:16,236
longstanding high
blood pressure.

583
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,823
His isn't high.
Borderline low, even.

584
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:21,620
Poor guy. Kyle has had
everything else go wrong.

585
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:23,294
He said he had back pain.

586
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,518
And carpal tunnel.

587
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:27,323
Plus anemia, renal dysfunction,

588
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:28,972
bradycardia,
thickened ventricle.

589
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:30,565
All of them together
means Kyle has...

590
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,896
Amyloidosis.

591
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:34,248
You were right, he has a
long-standing diagnosis

592
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:35,957
that explains everything.

593
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,314
It would've killed him.

594
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:39,589
But now we can treat it.

595
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:47,564
There's something very difficult

596
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:51,776
that I... I realize
I have to admit.

597
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:56,975
How much I've hurt you.

598
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:03,855
The key characteristic
of my addiction,

599
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,364
at least when I'm using,

600
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:08,198
is narcissism.

601
00:29:09,642 --> 00:29:12,143
My work, my needs,

602
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,317
they were all that mattered.

603
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:16,169
It-It's a miracle that
you turned out to be

604
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:19,370
the incredible person
you are.

605
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,592
So please, believe
me when I tell you

606
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:26,508
that I am ready...

607
00:29:27,454 --> 00:29:29,354
to do better.

608
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:33,701
Would you like to respond?

609
00:29:35,078 --> 00:29:38,246
Charm is a deadly deceiver.

610
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:41,915
And my father has charm.

611
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:45,330
More than anyone I know.

612
00:29:45,355 --> 00:29:46,521
He uses it

613
00:29:46,546 --> 00:29:49,681
to win over people he needs.

614
00:29:50,243 --> 00:29:51,989
He's charmed all of you.

615
00:29:53,162 --> 00:29:56,162
But it's a magic trick,

616
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,260
and you fell for the illusion.

617
00:29:58,285 --> 00:29:59,429
Honey, I'm being open

618
00:29:59,454 --> 00:30:00,842
and honest,
admitting my flaws...

619
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,006
Ian, you're supposed to listen.

620
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,453
You know all the
right words to say,

621
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:09,311
and you say them,

622
00:30:09,638 --> 00:30:11,573
but there is no way on earth

623
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:13,545
to know if you
actually mean them.

624
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,123
I will show you.

625
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,115
I will walk the walk. You
just have to believe in me.

626
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,819
Oh, so your sobriety is
dependent on my belief in you.

627
00:30:21,844 --> 00:30:23,467
That line...

628
00:30:23,492 --> 00:30:26,084
That line is such a crock,

629
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:28,342
and I'm done with it.

630
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:30,667
I've believed,

631
00:30:30,983 --> 00:30:34,251
I've hoped a hundred times.

632
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,959
And what's worse
is I've enabled.

633
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:42,874
I lied to my school

634
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:45,325
when you didn't show up for
parent-teacher conferences,

635
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,609
I-I told the court you
were an exemplary parent

636
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:51,381
because I was
afraid to lose you.

637
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:55,091
And throughout it all,
your workplace never knew.

638
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:58,812
No matter where you
were, I protected you.

639
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:03,270
Even now, I'm-I'm
lying to your boss,

640
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,883
I'm lying to my own boyfriend.

641
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:09,414
I...

642
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:12,063
I think I should really go

643
00:31:12,524 --> 00:31:15,692
because all I see here

644
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,089
breaks me.

645
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,794
Other families'
lives torn apart,

646
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:22,450
other relatives'
lives destroyed,

647
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:24,733
I see myself in all of them.

648
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,425
We've all been dragged
down by this disease,

649
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,561
and I... I can't go any lower.

650
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:36,887
Ian, you can get sober or don't.

651
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,129
But it's your problem.

652
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:48,066
Cade, wait, please.

653
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:49,483
I can't. I'm done.

654
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,773
Don't-don't say that.

655
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:51,976
You're right, those
were just words,

656
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,280
but let me show
you with actions.

657
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:56,420
They-they told me I was
going to need a goal

658
00:31:56,445 --> 00:31:59,555
if I was gonna have any kind
of sustained, real recovery,

659
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,391
and something that I
wanted more than anything,

660
00:32:01,415 --> 00:32:03,276
that I could only
get in sobriety,

661
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:05,753
and I thought that that
goal was going to be

662
00:32:05,778 --> 00:32:07,124
somehow to get my career back,

663
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:09,374
but I realize now it's something
much more important than that.

664
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:11,972
My goal is to make amends to you

665
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:15,499
for all the harm
that I have done.

666
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:18,740
Sweetheart, I...

667
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,880
I never even thought about

668
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:24,062
what my addiction did to you.

669
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:27,103
I know. To admit
that, to say that,

670
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:28,619
it's horrible.

671
00:32:29,885 --> 00:32:31,616
But if I can live
knowing that every day,

672
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:35,160
I have a chance, a hope
to make that up to you?

673
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,229
Cade...

674
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:41,274
Give me a chance

675
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:43,359
to prove to you

676
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:45,382
and win back your love.

677
00:32:57,493 --> 00:33:00,236
You're the only father I have,

678
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:03,780
but I'm not lying
for you anymore.

679
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,760
And then, the two men
just... they just left.

680
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:19,910
Yeah, before security
could get to them.

681
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,355
Well, we need to make
sure they're gone.

682
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,247
I already went through
our surveillance videos

683
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:26,855
from floors three and four.

684
00:33:28,185 --> 00:33:29,960
Did you check the OR suite?

685
00:33:33,993 --> 00:33:35,470
There.

686
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:36,603
That's them.

687
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,934
They're still in the hospital.

688
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:42,862
This is 301.

689
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,245
We have a pair of adult
males, possibly dangerous,

690
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,338
seen on the seventh floor.

691
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:47,849
Is Billie still in
surgery on that floor?

692
00:33:47,873 --> 00:33:49,372
I don't know. Maybe.

693
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:51,082
Request
immediate response

694
00:33:51,107 --> 00:33:52,379
to that area.

695
00:34:41,855 --> 00:34:43,446
You killed our mother,

696
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:45,555
now we're gonna kill you.

697
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:26,760
Are you okay?

698
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,958
Keep him up.

699
00:36:01,582 --> 00:36:02,823
Stay down!

700
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:23,258
They wanted to throw
me down the stairs.

701
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:29,111
Uh, to kill me.
That's what they said.

702
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:35,371
If Conrad hadn't shown
up when he did...

703
00:36:39,623 --> 00:36:41,773
I'm just so glad you're okay.

704
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:44,047
I just hope Billie is, too.

705
00:36:45,798 --> 00:36:48,099
She's almost done
with her statement.

706
00:36:50,172 --> 00:36:53,094
I got to go get
Gigi, check on Kyle.

707
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,258
Why don't I help? I
can take Billie home.

708
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:01,234
That's okay. She
asked me to drive her.

709
00:37:02,668 --> 00:37:04,656
I'll meet you in Kyle's room.

710
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,640
Hey, I'll see you at home, okay?

711
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:15,428
Hey.

712
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:18,867
You got a second?

713
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:20,333
Yeah.

714
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:27,858
Look, we got off
on the wrong foot.

715
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:29,474
I take the blame for that.

716
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:31,758
You did excellent work today.

717
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,845
My assumption is, for
as long as you're here,

718
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,487
you and I are going to do
more good work together,

719
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:40,606
so I believe that you
deserve the truth.

720
00:37:40,631 --> 00:37:43,148
Okay.

721
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:44,995
I'm all ears.

722
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:50,371
Conrad's wife Nic

723
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:52,466
was Billie's best friend.

724
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,022
And after he lost her,

725
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:57,316
I don't think he
ever got past that,

726
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,342
and maybe he never will,

727
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,274
but what you need to know is

728
00:38:02,325 --> 00:38:05,291
Conrad and Billie
love each other.

729
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:09,410
I know that's tough
for you and Cade,

730
00:38:09,435 --> 00:38:12,085
because whether they wake
up to the truth or not,

731
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,302
it's always gonna
come between you.

732
00:38:23,923 --> 00:38:25,531
Thanks.

733
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,529
How are you feeling, Kyle?

734
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:37,886
Better.

735
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:39,284
That is because your son-in-law

736
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:41,652
figured out that you
have amyloidosis,

737
00:38:41,677 --> 00:38:43,460
which means that
protein is accumulating

738
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:45,076
in places that it shouldn't,

739
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:47,011
and that explains
your slow heart rate,

740
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:49,338
fatigue and even
your carpel tunnel.

741
00:38:49,363 --> 00:38:51,105
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

742
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,463
But we can treat it, and the guy

743
00:38:53,488 --> 00:38:55,253
that you've been
blaming for Nic's death,

744
00:38:55,278 --> 00:38:58,279
whose own heart broke
trying to save her,

745
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,333
he's the person you have
to thank for all of this.

746
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,590
Always had to be the hero.

747
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:07,805
Hey.

748
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,895
Someone wanted to see you.

749
00:39:11,606 --> 00:39:12,659
Hey.

750
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:15,369
So, I was right, wasn't I?

751
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:17,645
My dad can fix anything.

752
00:39:21,378 --> 00:39:23,012
Thank you.

753
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,627
I've been so lonely.

754
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:33,715
This child is everything.

755
00:39:36,794 --> 00:39:39,590
Good night, Grandpa. I'm
glad you're back home.

756
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:51,440
When I first got here,
you asked where home is.

757
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:57,070
There's your answer.

758
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:06,168
I'll see you tomorrow.

759
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:41,569
Thank you.

760
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:44,470
For everything.

761
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:47,505
You came to the rescue.

762
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,873
Ah, please, you've rescued
me hundreds of times.

763
00:40:53,544 --> 00:40:56,103
Nic would have been
proud of you today.

764
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:04,411
I want you to be proud of me.
