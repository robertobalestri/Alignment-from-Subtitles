<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color="#fff840">"The Resident"...</font>

2
00:00:02,663 --> 00:00:03,929
You're making out a will?

3
00:00:04,077 --> 00:00:05,512
I realized I don't have one.

4
00:00:05,613 --> 00:00:06,993
You are not going to die.

5
00:00:07,078 --> 00:00:08,095
You can't promise me that.

6
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,637
Chastain is performing mandatory
drug testing

7
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:12,414
on all doctors today.

8
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:15,585
Positive.

9
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:17,579
This hospital-wide drug test.

10
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,961
Did you name my father?

11
00:00:19,046 --> 00:00:20,571
And I didn't break
that confidence.

12
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:22,211
I don't need you to save me.

13
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:23,984
Baby number one is out.

14
00:00:25,555 --> 00:00:26,984
<i>Baby number two.</i>

15
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:29,656
The babies are in the NICU
if you want to go see them.

16
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:33,008
I've been taking
Oxaprozin for my back.

17
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:34,524
It causes a false positive.

18
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:35,895
Kit's asked me
to stop taking them.

19
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:37,130
I'll test again in a week.

20
00:00:37,214 --> 00:00:38,850
Just wanted you to know.

21
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:43,676
<i>So, how about some weather?</i>

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,712
<i>Joanne, you there
with our weather today?</i>

23
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:45,968
I don't hear water running.

24
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,640
Those teeth aren't gonna
clean themselves.

25
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:54,031
Giorgiana Grace. Chop-chop.
We're gonna be late.

26
00:00:57,984 --> 00:00:59,140
Gigi?

27
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:05,744
Hey.

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,109
What's all that hacking up here?

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,018
I feel sick.

30
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:14,898
You're not warm.
Tell me what hurts.

31
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:17,328
I think I have a cold.

32
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:22,701
Oh, no.

33
00:01:22,953 --> 00:01:24,758
That sounds
much worse than a cold.

34
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:29,034
It sounds like you have
Ferris Bueller Syndrome.

35
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:30,883
What's that?

36
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:34,109
It is a very rare disease
where little boys and girls

37
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:37,835
fake sick so they don't have
to go to school.

38
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,140
Sounds pretty serious to me.

39
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:45,415
This isn't about school, is it?

40
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:47,664
Sounds like someone's
worried about

41
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:49,960
their belt ceremony tonight.

42
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:53,267
I don't want to do
tae Kwon do anymore.

43
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:55,665
But you love tae Kwon do.
And you've worked so hard.

44
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,140
Don't you want to get that cool
yellow stripe on your belt?

45
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:01,563
You only move up
if you break the board.

46
00:02:01,648 --> 00:02:04,016
I've seen you do
that routine a hundred times.

47
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:06,015
What's the problem?
And I will be there

48
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,984
cheering you on the whole time.

49
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:09,476
Okay?

50
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:12,421
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I can't do it.

51
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:32,778
Come on.

52
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:37,090
Come on.

56
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:19,451
Morning, Tabitha.

57
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:21,391
Ooh, love the hair.
New highlights?

58
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:23,113
- They are.
- Mm.

59
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:25,083
Funny, my husband
didn't even notice.

60
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:27,146
Sounds like your husband needs
to get his eyes checked.

61
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,754
Did something happen
to your eyes? They're...

62
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:33,008
black.

63
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:36,138
Oh.
Nothing.

64
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:37,442
- Annual eye checkup.
- Mm.

65
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:40,114
That's what a few drops
of tropicamide will do for you.

66
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,199
Hmm.

67
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,615
My cousin, his eyes used
to be dilated like that.

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,146
Turns out, he was
in withdrawal at the time.

69
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:49,129
You're not withdrawing
from drugs now,

70
00:03:49,214 --> 00:03:50,247
are you, Dr. Sullivan?

71
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:51,528
That's hilarious.

72
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:52,853
You're hilarious.

73
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:54,575
On that note, though,
I-I do have

74
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,115
an important operation
that-that demands my attention

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,299
this afternoon. I'm...

76
00:03:58,384 --> 00:03:59,520
I'm wondering if we can move

77
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:01,289
that drug test up
to earlier in the day.

78
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,059
Ideally before noon?

79
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,530
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Sullivan,

80
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:06,973
but we outsource those tests
to a third party company.

81
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:09,689
They won't be here
until your appointment at 4:00.

82
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,536
That's a shame.

83
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:15,284
But... I will make sure

84
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:17,055
they're still here
after your surgery.

85
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,077
We will get you tested, Ian,
don't you worry.

86
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,581
- Thank you, Tabitha.
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:25,005
21-year-old woman
with endocarditis

88
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,739
in the setting of IV opiates.

89
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:28,262
She's on broad spectrum
antibiotics

90
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:29,715
with stable hemodynamics.

91
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,839
Diana, hi.

92
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:34,536
I'm Dr. Sullivan.
How are you feeling?

93
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:36,359
My baby.

94
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:38,949
Have you, have you seen,
have you seen her?

95
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:41,583
Diana gave birth to a baby girl
late last night.

96
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:43,848
What's your daughter's name?

97
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:47,154
They won't let me see her.
Is-is she okay?

98
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:49,153
Looks like there's
a Baby Jane Doe

99
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:51,567
in the neonatal
intensive care unit.

100
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:53,590
I can pop by and check on her.

101
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:57,820
It's my fault
that she's suffering.

102
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:02,075
Everybody told me that I would
screw her up if I didn't stop.

103
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:03,778
But I didn't.

104
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,885
We'll get you a list
of treatment centers

105
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:08,028
once you're
a little more stable.

106
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,114
My baby needs her mama.

107
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:15,919
I want to get clean.

108
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,411
I believe you.

109
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:21,793
But first we need to get
this infection under control.

110
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:24,567
We'll be back
to check on you soon.

111
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,015
Uh, let's do another
blood culture on Diana.

112
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:39,926
And run a CBC, ESR, and CRP.

113
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:43,879
She's just so nice. And sad.

114
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:47,595
- I feel bad for her.
- So do I.

115
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:50,169
But right now there are
still drugs in her system.

116
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:53,434
And once she starts withdrawal,
Diana will not be as nice.

117
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:55,680
You should prepare
yourself for that.

118
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:57,497
My uncle was the same way.

119
00:05:58,254 --> 00:05:59,857
He was a completely
different person

120
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,379
when he was trying
to stop drinking.

121
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:05,582
Addiction is a horrible disease.

122
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:09,864
Sometimes fighting it can look
just as ugly as feeding it.

123
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:15,184
Is this about
her nightmares again?

124
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:17,309
<i>Luckily, the
nightmares seem to be a thing</i>

125
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:18,679
of the past.

126
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:21,437
Gigi and I have
a new challenge now.

127
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:23,240
She needs some tough love.

128
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:26,457
- So, can you cover for me?
- Don't worry, man, I got you.

129
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,676
<i>You sure you don't mind?</i>

130
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:30,054
Well, it's either this
or I'm washing cloth diapers

131
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,817
to prep for
the twins' homecoming.

132
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:33,387
You're doing me a favor.

133
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:35,209
All right.

134
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:36,686
Thanks, man. I owe you.

135
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,661
<i>And tell Gigi I hope
she feels better.</i>

136
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:40,750
- Will do.
- Sorry, Daddy.

137
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,286
Did I get you
in trouble at work?

138
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,531
No, you didn't.

139
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:48,835
Uncle Devon's gonna
cover for me.

140
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:50,313
But don't think this means

141
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:51,748
you're getting out
of your belt ceremony.

142
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:54,103
- But, Daddy...
- No buts.

143
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:55,638
Listen, we are gonna practice

144
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:58,728
until you can do every single
take down in your sleep.

145
00:06:58,813 --> 00:06:59,932
Capisce?

146
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:01,266
- Capisce.
- All right.

147
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,187
But you don't know tae Kwon do.

148
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,024
Well, then you better teach me.

149
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,957
All right? Now let's go.

150
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,477
What do you got for me, Feldman?

151
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:13,707
34-year-old female
with myasthenia gravis.

152
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,568
Her parents brought her
to the ED after finding her

153
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:16,973
at the bottom
of their staircase.

154
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:19,051
Classic muscle weakness.
Clearly an MG flare-up.

155
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,903
But what caused the flare
is your problem, not mine.

156
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:24,154
This woman was diagnosed
over six years ago.

157
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:25,331
Myasthenia gravis is chronic,

158
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:26,767
but she should be
in remission by now.

159
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,202
No, the treatments never worked.

160
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:29,646
Her neuromuscular symptoms

161
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,341
worsened to the point
that she had to move back in

162
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:33,481
- with her parents for full-time care taking.
- Hmm.

163
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,793
Well, looks like I've got
my work cut out for me.

164
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:37,021
Yeah, you'll like Marty.

165
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,076
She's a nerd. Like you.

166
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:40,395
Then we can finally see

167
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,700
if you can still hang
with the real doctors.

168
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:49,081
<i>Attending
to vocational counseling...</i>

169
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,384
Hi.

170
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:53,754
I'm Dr. Pravesh.
You must be Marty.

171
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:57,614
Who is Marty?
Why is Marty?

172
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:00,680
I usually reserve
my existential dread

173
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:01,750
for the end of the day.

174
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:04,274
But I think I can make an exception.

175
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:06,809
I heard you took
a little tumble.

176
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:08,946
I didn't want to ask for help.

177
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:12,116
When your 70-year-old parents
have to get you to the bathroom

178
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,411
every morning, you keep
the requests to a minimum.

179
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,833
At least
when I'm in the hospital,

180
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,403
they get a break from it all.

181
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:21,027
Probably a nice break
for you, too.

182
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:23,281
Well, if I could
help them out financially,

183
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:25,018
I might feel
a little bit better.

184
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,604
But that's the one
universal truth

185
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:28,090
they don't tell you about.

186
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,575
You can't get a job
with a philosophy degree.

187
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:32,841
Oh, it all makes sense.

188
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:34,287
You're a truth seeker.

189
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,997
Too bad the truth
doesn't pay, huh?

190
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,934
I'd like to get to the bottom
of your myasthenia flare.

191
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:42,318
So if you don't mind
hanging out,

192
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:44,523
I can admit you
and run some tests, okay?

193
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:47,442
Lucky for both of us,
I got nowhere to be.

194
00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:49,933
I'll be back.

195
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:51,434
All right.

196
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:54,510
The twins look perfect.

197
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,788
Healthy weight,
strong heartbeats.

198
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:59,214
I'd say this family can
go home this afternoon.

199
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,879
Ah, you hear that, Padma?

200
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:03,050
We're finally breaking
you guys out of here.

201
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:05,891
That is music to my ears. Oh.

202
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,394
I'll see you and the boys
in a month.

203
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:08,881
You need anything, you call.

204
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,964
Thank you, Ian.

205
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:15,901
Strong lungs on this one.

206
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,036
She have a name?

207
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:19,917
This is Jane.

208
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,534
Well, that's what
we're calling her.

209
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:23,355
Typical NAS baby.
She just...

210
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,191
she can't get comfortable.

211
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:26,808
Well, I'd be miserable, too,

212
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:28,862
- if I was withdrawing from drugs.
- Yeah.

213
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:30,362
- May I?
- Yes.

214
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,112
I know it hurts, sweetie.
Trust me, I know.

215
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:37,315
Where's the mother?

216
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:41,203
Admitted in ICU.
Long-term heroin user.

217
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:45,003
Although "mother" is not
the word I would choose.

218
00:09:45,142 --> 00:09:46,948
Neural tube defect.

219
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:49,485
Has anyone taken Jane for scans?

220
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:51,637
Well, Dr. Lawrence
said he would check her out

221
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,159
after he got out of the OR.

222
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,396
Unless you could
take a look at her

223
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,318
because I've had
a really rough day today,

224
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:58,715
and I just,
I could really use your help.

225
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:01,616
I'll be back for Jane.

226
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,807
There's something I need
to take care of.

227
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:16,050
Dr. Sullivan, everything
all right in there?

228
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,377
All good, Susan.
Out in a sec.

229
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:20,863
Dr. Voss is
out of the office today.

230
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:22,449
She asked me to remind you
about your follow-up

231
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:23,684
this afternoon, the drug test.

232
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:24,823
Yeah, of course.

233
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:27,019
Drug test.
Who could forget that?

234
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,440
They'll be ready for you
in the lab at 4:00.

235
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:31,930
4:00. Can't wait.

236
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,502
Oh, my God.

237
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:39,664
Oh... Nine hours.

238
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,830
Nine hours.

239
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,927
Take your test,

240
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:48,315
then all the pills you want.

241
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:53,535
Less than a day old,
and this little girl

242
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,840
has already been through it all.

243
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:56,879
Outside of her obvious
spinal deformity,

244
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:58,980
this is what
concerns me the most.

245
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:01,917
Proximity of her neural tissue
to the skin.

246
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:03,581
They're practically touching.

247
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,486
Jane needs surgery,
no doubt about that.

248
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:07,990
Preferably sooner than later.

249
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:10,862
I can book us an OR for noon,
if that works for you.

250
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:13,995
I-I'd rather do after 4:00.

251
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:17,075
That gives us time
to get an MRI under sedation.

252
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:18,812
Well, the longer we wait,
the more at-risk Jane is

253
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:20,198
for a catastrophic CNS
infection.

254
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:22,453
Her immune system is
way too fragile to fight that.

255
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,104
Dr. Sullivan, are you
feeling okay?

256
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:30,786
It's like a sauna in here,
don't you think?

257
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,592
You know, you're right.

258
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,095
Let's move forward
with the surgery.

259
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,000
I-I'll check my schedule.
I'll get back to you.

260
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:44,918
All right,
on the count of three

261
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:46,710
you can open your eyes.

262
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:48,522
One...

263
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:51,893
two...

264
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:53,659
Three.

265
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:59,527
Grandmaster Hawkins' dojo
is officially open.

266
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,798
In Korea they call it
a <i>dojang.</i>

267
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:04,198
Yeah, well,
my apologies to Korea.

268
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:06,143
And you're not a grandmaster.

269
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:09,940
We'll see about that.
You ready?

270
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:17,909
<i>- Kamsahamnida.
- Kamsahamnida.</i>

271
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,028
Protect yourself.

272
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:28,364
<i>- Kiai!
- Kiai!</i>

273
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:30,012
<i>Kiai...</i>

274
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:33,356
Now...

275
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:40,993
Break the board, young Padawan.

276
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,465
Kiai!

277
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:45,217
Daddy, are you okay?

278
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:46,972
Yeah, I'm fine.

279
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,927
I'll get my nurse's kit.

280
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:04,739
Artificial urine?

281
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:14,159
Okay, that's more like it.

282
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:19,203
Hey, you're running point
on Baby Jane Doe

283
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:22,348
- in the NICU, right?
- I am, yeah. Who-Who's asking?

284
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:23,943
The mother.
She's in my ICU.

285
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:26,145
I promised I'd give her
an update.

286
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,489
How about I come down
and talk to her?

287
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,709
Great. Okay.

288
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:32,959
- See you down there.
- All right.

289
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:44,219
I don't get it.

290
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,294
My, my baby's spinal cord is
outside of her body?

291
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:49,793
Not exactly.

292
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:52,837
Uh, a neural tube defect occurs

293
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,509
when the fetus doesn't get

294
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:57,396
enough folic acid
during pregnancy.

295
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,216
And when this happens,

296
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:03,274
the-the lower part of the spine
can't grow properly.

297
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:05,529
- Folic acid? What is that?
- Mm.

298
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,646
No one told me anything
about any vitamins.

299
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:08,732
Well, you know what,
they might have

300
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,856
if you'd shown up for a single
prenatal appointment.

301
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:15,215
What's important is that
Dr. Sullivan is going to

302
00:14:15,349 --> 00:14:17,369
repair the sac of fluid
on your daughter's back.

303
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:18,938
Mm-hmm.

304
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:21,754
And me and my baby
can go home?

305
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,416
We will talk time lines
once both of you

306
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,176
are back on your feet.

307
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:37,208
What you should have told her
is that no doctor

308
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,059
in their right mind
would send a child home

309
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:40,849
with an active heroin addict.

310
00:14:41,028 --> 00:14:42,703
And who would that help?

311
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:44,349
Diana is suffering, too.

312
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:45,677
She knows she hurt
her daughter.

313
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:47,974
Oh, does she? I heard she was
out in the parking lot

314
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:49,300
shooting up before
she came in to deliver.

315
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:52,880
And I'm horrified by that, but
both mom and daughter are here

316
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:55,490
because they had virtually
no access to prenatal care.

317
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,302
She was set up to fail
from the start.

318
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:59,787
I don't think she is in there
beating herself up

319
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:01,272
over what happens,
and if you think she is,

320
00:15:01,356 --> 00:15:04,279
you have no idea
how addiction works.

321
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:09,839
Ever since Bell left
for Minnesota,

322
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:11,544
I feel like I've been coasting.

323
00:15:11,628 --> 00:15:14,020
No other surgeon has let me cut.

324
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:15,645
I really need a challenge.

325
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:18,085
You've got this, babe.

326
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:22,650
That blood panel has really
got your attention.

327
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:24,635
Should I be jealous?

328
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,723
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:28,504
None of this makes any sense.

330
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:29,941
Marty's in her mid-30s.

331
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:31,551
There's no reason her disease
should have progressed

332
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:33,120
to need full-time care taking.

333
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,270
A lot of myasthenia patients
respond to plasma transfusions.

334
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:40,723
Except she's receiving plasma
every six months.

335
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:43,239
It helps until it doesn't,
as does prednisone,

336
00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:46,230
azathioprine,
Mycophenolate, rituximab.

337
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:54,981
Unless... the reason none
of her treatments have worked

338
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:58,902
is... is because we're treating
the wrong thing.

339
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:00,775
And by the way,
if you want to cut again,

340
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,402
try working with Nolan.

341
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,999
Okay.

342
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,543
I have to go.

343
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:12,900
Marty, I think it's time
we take a step back.

344
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:16,139
Reassess the basis
of why you're here.

345
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:18,745
- Now who's the existential one?
- What I mean is,

346
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:21,751
have you ever considered
that your original diagnosis

347
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:24,440
could be flawed?

348
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:28,613
What, like I don't have
myasthenia?

349
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:30,301
On paper you fit
all of the criteria

350
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:31,324
for myasthenia gravis.

351
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,580
Wait, if I don't have it,
then what's wrong with me?

352
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,429
I have no idea.

353
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:38,293
I'm sorry, Marty, I...

354
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:40,806
I don't mean to overwhelm you.

355
00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:49,222
I've just always been someone
who questions everything.

356
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:51,109
Whether there's a God

357
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:54,582
or if time is an illusion or...

358
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:01,180
But I never once thought
to question my diagnosis.

359
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:06,301
You want answers, and I want
to give them to you.

360
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:09,074
This means we have to run
a few more tests.

361
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:13,481
All right.
Let's do it.

362
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:19,551
Let's get security on standby.

363
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:21,066
That is my baby in there.

364
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:22,794
You cannot take her from me.

365
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:25,028
I understand this is upsetting,
but we have to do

366
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:26,051
what's best for Jane.

367
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:27,988
You think going to a foster home
is better than

368
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:30,044
her own mother?!

369
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:32,442
- She needs me.
- We'll make sure

370
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:34,095
- CPS finds her a safe home.
- No.

371
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,263
This isn't permanent, okay?

372
00:17:35,348 --> 00:17:37,520
You can still make this right.

373
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:38,605
It hurts.

374
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:40,379
It all hurts!

375
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:41,464
I know. I know, Diana,

376
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:44,035
but you can still get clean.
Okay?

377
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:47,082
Diana?

378
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,252
What's going on?

379
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:51,462
She's in shock. Likely sepsis
from the endocarditis.

380
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:52,796
I need a norepi drip

381
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:55,566
and an intubation kit
in here now.

382
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,458
Is she gonna be okay?

383
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:04,735
Diana has a lot
to make up for.

384
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,192
We're not giving up
on her just yet.

385
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:15,387
Pupils are reactive.
That's a good sign.

386
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:18,243
BP is still low.
The pressors aren't enough.

387
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:20,699
Hand me that ultrasound.

388
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:28,975
What is it?

389
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,848
Diana has a splenomegaly.

390
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:33,363
Why would her spleen
be enlarged?

391
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,276
It's hard to say for sure,

392
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:37,489
so we need to get her
to Imaging to confirm.

393
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,215
We can't move her like this.
She-she could crash again.

394
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,311
She will eventually if we don't
get a clearer picture

395
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:43,879
of what's going on.

396
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,082
Page Dr. Devi and tell her
to meet us in CT.

397
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,582
Scans are up.

398
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,646
Well, the refractory fever
makes more sense.

399
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:09,231
I don't think I've ever seen
a spleen with so many abscesses.

400
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,880
The bacteria from her heart
has metastasized into clots,

401
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:13,471
moving from one organ
to the next.

402
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:15,809
A splenectomy might be
her only option.

403
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,216
- Will she even survive a surgery?
- Maybe.

404
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:20,501
Maybe not.

405
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:21,824
Looking at these scans,

406
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:24,208
I doubt she'll survive
without it either.

407
00:19:24,324 --> 00:19:26,012
She's your patient.

408
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:28,535
What do you want to do?

409
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:32,434
You're right.
Let's do the surgery.

410
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,004
Thank you.

411
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:39,318
Hey.

412
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:42,043
Can you spare a second
to pick your brain?

413
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:44,622
- Shoot.
- My patient, she's 34

414
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:47,421
and diagnosed with
myasthenia gravis years ago.

415
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:48,808
That's a rough one.

416
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:50,427
But at least the prognosis
is decent.

417
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:52,131
Except hers isn't,
which is why I questioned

418
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:53,637
if she was misdiagnosed.

419
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:55,028
Okay, I hear you.

420
00:19:55,246 --> 00:19:56,415
Have you tested her yourself?

421
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,066
Blood test, edrophonium test.

422
00:19:58,151 --> 00:19:59,888
All point back to myasthenia.

423
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:02,075
None explain why her
muscle weakness

424
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,621
isn't responding to treatment.

425
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:06,512
Well, maybe the weakness isn't
coming from her muscles at all.

426
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:10,602
If that's true,
an electromyography could confirm.

427
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,538
An EMG will tell you
if your patient's weakness

428
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:15,223
is coming from her muscles
or her nerve cells.

429
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:16,614
If it turns out to be
a muscle issue,

430
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:18,567
then she most likely has
myasthenia gravis.

431
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:21,489
But if the EMG proves
the nerve cells are responsible,

432
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:23,168
there's no way
she has myasthenia.

433
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:26,083
An EMG is an incredibly
invasive procedure.

434
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,554
Not to mention
excruciatingly painful.

435
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:31,004
Yes, but if the result is
what I think it is,

436
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:33,480
we could potentially cure
her symptoms.

437
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:34,683
You know, Devon, some people

438
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,544
just don't respond to treatment.

439
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:37,981
We never know why.

440
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:40,525
Are you sure this is
more than a hunch?

441
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,239
My patient wants answers.

442
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,699
She'll do whatever it takes
to get them, and so will I.

443
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,419
So, can you do it?

444
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,109
I just hope,
for your patient's sake,

445
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:49,964
this is worth it.

446
00:20:57,769 --> 00:20:59,426
Are you waiting
on Postmates, too?

447
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:02,605
Yep. Should be here
any minute.

448
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,574
Hope it's not one
of those ghost kitchens.

449
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:07,565
I've had my fair share of
pad Thai that never showed up.

450
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,199
Yeah, that-that won't be
a problem.

451
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,686
You got to be kidding me.

452
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:24,004
Yeah, ghost
kitchen strikes again.

453
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:29,287
All right,
this is gonna hurt,

454
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,115
but then the worst part
will be over.

455
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:42,027
Why is Billie doing an EMG
on our patient?

456
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:44,473
You mean my patient,
and this is the only way

457
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:46,200
to pinpoint where Marty's
weakness is coming from.

458
00:21:46,284 --> 00:21:47,494
We know where
her weakness is from.

459
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:49,527
She has myasthenia gravis.

460
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:51,558
I'm not so sure about that.

461
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:54,185
- My gut is telling me something else is going on.
- Hold up.

462
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:55,829
You're saying dozens
of neurologists

463
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,618
who've all diagnosed Marty
with myasthenia are wrong,

464
00:21:58,702 --> 00:22:01,347
all because you have
a Spidey-sense?

465
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,590
I'm sure those doctors made
the best diagnoses they could

466
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:06,423
with the information they had,

467
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,099
but the inefficacies
of the treatments...

468
00:22:08,183 --> 00:22:09,538
This isn't about
the treatments, Pravesh.

469
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:10,982
This is about you
treating a patient

470
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:13,324
like one of your little
science experiments.

471
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:16,436
Look, I know you don't think
I'm a real doctor anymore,

472
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,902
but I am actually trying
to help my patient.

473
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:23,669
Does that look like
it's helping, Devon?

474
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:27,316
If you ask me,
all your clinical trials

475
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:30,280
have desensitized you to
what real harm looks like.

476
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:33,203
That right there.
That's it.

477
00:22:40,051 --> 00:22:42,522
Let's check that balance,
check that balance. Here we go.

478
00:22:42,655 --> 00:22:44,008
Okay, we go one, one.
And two, two.

479
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:45,277
That'd be three. Okay.

480
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:46,998
Four! Four! Kick.

481
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:48,751
Okay, here we go.

482
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:50,922
- Kiai. Kiai.
- Gigi.

483
00:22:51,006 --> 00:22:54,045
<i>♪ Why you gotta be
always talking in my face ♪</i>

484
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,834
- ♪ <i>- Talking in my face?</i> ♪
- Here we go. One. <i>- Kiai!</i>

485
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,236
Again. One. One.
Come on, right here.

486
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,673
Ah! One more, one more.

487
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:01,811
Ah, oh, God, you got me.

488
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:03,580
Oh, God, you got me.
You got me.

489
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:05,451
- Kiai! Kiai!
- Oh, God.

490
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:07,071
Oh, so strong.
I'll fight back.

491
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:08,590
- I'm gonna fight back.
<i>- Kiai! Kiai!</i>

492
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:10,779
- I'm gonna fight back.
<i>- Kiai!</i>

493
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:14,636
Yeah, time-out, time-out.

494
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,373
Phone call.

495
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:20,708
Hurry back, Dad.

496
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:23,153
We have more pummeling to do!

497
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:26,191
Oh, boy.

498
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:29,793
<i>So, what, you gonna
leave Chastain</i>

499
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:31,681
<i>and become a karate instructor?</i>

500
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:33,285
Tae Kwon do, technically.

501
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,923
Turns out it's harder
than it looks.

502
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:36,040
<i>Gigi did that to you?</i>

503
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,894
It wasn't my fault.

504
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:41,207
The Popsicle-stick splint
says otherwise.

505
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,107
<i>How are things going
over there?</i>

506
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:45,293
How much time do you have?

507
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:47,152
Talk to me.

508
00:23:47,237 --> 00:23:49,720
<i>I have this patient
who I thought for sure</i>

509
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,925
<i>was misdiagnosed with
myasthenia gravis...</i>

510
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,621
<i>so I did an EMG.</i>

511
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:57,141
Okay. What did it tell you?

512
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,996
<i>Nothing.
It only reconfirmed</i>

513
00:23:59,081 --> 00:24:00,165
her original diagnosis.

514
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:04,277
You know, I keep asking myself
where the line is.

515
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,656
How far do I push
before what I thought

516
00:24:07,741 --> 00:24:10,855
was helping
is actually harming someone?

517
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,964
Trust your instincts.
What's your gut say?

518
00:24:18,242 --> 00:24:19,694
That I got to keep digging.

519
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:22,201
<i>Then you have your answer.
I should probably go.</i>

520
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:24,785
I've got time for about
six more kicks to the chest

521
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,640
before Gigi's ceremony tonight.

522
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:29,847
Wait, hold on.
Say that again.

523
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:30,769
<i>Say what?</i>

524
00:24:30,854 --> 00:24:32,785
That I got about
six more kicks to the chest

525
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,207
before Gigi's ceremony?

526
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:37,144
Keep digging, my friend.
I got to go.

527
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,396
Dr. Pravesh, I know
I said I wanted answers,

528
00:24:42,544 --> 00:24:45,894
but I'm not sure how much more
of this I can take.

529
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:48,438
I know, Marty.
This'll be the last thing.

530
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:50,860
I promise.
It'll be painless.

531
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:54,058
I'll be back.

532
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,379
Listen, I'm sorry
I came on so strong,

533
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,602
but I won't apologize
for what I said.

534
00:25:10,964 --> 00:25:12,938
Neither will I.

535
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:15,750
I want to hear you out, Devon.

536
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:19,375
So tell me, what exactly is it
you expect to find?

537
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:25,871
That.

538
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,237
You're kidding, right?

539
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:32,094
You know if you do
a full body scan of anyone,

540
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:33,465
you're gonna find
something somewhere.

541
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:35,603
It's an incidentaloma.
It doesn't prove anything.

542
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:38,039
Not yet.
But a biopsy will confirm

543
00:25:38,124 --> 00:25:39,930
that Marty has lung cancer.

544
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,763
Years ago,
a trial was conducted

545
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:44,483
to study a small-cell
lung cancer

546
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:46,578
that was known to mimic
neuromuscular symptoms.

547
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:47,743
All right,
so you're saying

548
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:49,594
it could imitate
myasthenia gravis.

549
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,531
It's nearly indistinguishable.

550
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,702
But it wouldn't respond
to myasthenia treatment

551
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,608
because it's not
a neuromuscular disease at all.

552
00:25:56,692 --> 00:25:58,830
Well, I'll be damned.

553
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:02,390
Looks like you're still
a real doctor after all.

554
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:19,180
Oh, there you are.

555
00:26:19,265 --> 00:26:21,318
Dr. Sutton's looking for you.

556
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:22,889
You don't look good,
Dr. Sullivan.

557
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:25,607
Yeah, just a little heartburn.
I-I must have eaten too fast.

558
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,461
Okay, well,
why don't you sit down?

559
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:29,340
- You know, I can't, I got to get going. I'm good.
- I can help you.

560
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:30,693
- Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.

561
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:32,859
Stay here.
I'll get you some water.

562
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:35,883
Everything's fine.

563
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:40,751
They're taking Jane to the OR.

564
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:43,258
- We have to go now.
- Why? What happened?

565
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:45,296
She's showing signs
of encephalitis.

566
00:26:45,381 --> 00:26:47,742
It's now or never.

567
00:26:48,937 --> 00:26:51,039
All right, 3:55.
I need ten minutes

568
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,487
I'll meet you there.

569
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,290
We don't have ten minutes, Ian,
you know that.

570
00:26:54,374 --> 00:26:56,946
Okay, five minutes.
Start without me.

571
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:06,375
I have an appointment
for Ian Sullivan, 4:00 p. m.

572
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:07,830
Our technician is
stuck in traffic,

573
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:09,086
so we're running a little late.

574
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,740
He's not here?
No, that's not possible.

575
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,627
I have a 4:00 p.m.
It's 4:00 now.

576
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:14,564
I'm sorry for the delay,
but if you just take a seat...

577
00:27:14,648 --> 00:27:15,833
No, I'm not taking a seat.

578
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:17,687
I've been waiting all day
for the damn test.

579
00:27:17,787 --> 00:27:20,393
I have a newborn, a little girl
waiting for me right now.

580
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:21,778
Can we please do the test?

581
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:24,636
You can fill this out
while you wait.

582
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:44,727
Will Dr. Sullivan be
joining us?

583
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:10,430
Okay, let's do this, please.

584
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,527
- Just a few more minutes, sir.
- I just need to pee in a cup.

585
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:14,465
What could possibly
take so long?!

586
00:28:14,603 --> 00:28:17,408
Just a few more minutes.

587
00:28:29,464 --> 00:28:31,469
Oh, screw this.

588
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:43,342
Jane's
vitals are starting to dip.

589
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:46,098
- Should we wait, or...
- No.

590
00:28:46,197 --> 00:28:48,168
Let's get started.

591
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:51,842
Scalpel to me.

592
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:03,750
Dad, we need to talk.

593
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:06,888
I can't right now, dear,
I've got to get going.

594
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:09,127
Earlier with a patient,
you were having trouble.

595
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:11,849
You were forgetting things.
And it's been weighing on me.

596
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:15,423
I've got surgery now, Cade.
I can't do this right now. Okay?

597
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:17,008
I don't think
you should be operating.

598
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:18,852
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell you

599
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,816
about the Oxaprozin.
Anything I do now

600
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,186
is gonna be under
your little microscope.

601
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,555
Well, can you really blame me.

602
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:27,046
- I am worried about you.
- Do not patronize me!

603
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:29,465
Is that why you came in here?

604
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,805
Comb through all my past.
Okay, fine, let's to that, then.

605
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:34,177
Okay, you're being irrational.
Just calm down.

606
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:35,179
Do you want me to admit it?

607
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:36,203
I was a terrible father?

608
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:37,563
That's what you tell all
your friends, right? I...

609
00:29:37,647 --> 00:29:39,100
You tell them
I was a deadbeat.

610
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:40,956
- You had to raise yourself, right?
- No, that's not fair.

611
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,657
- I-I never meant that you...
- You know, Cade,

612
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:44,203
sometimes you are not
the victim.

613
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:45,573
Sometimes you are the problem.

614
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,113
You make everyone around you
feel like a failure,

615
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:49,984
Miss High and Mighty.

616
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:51,069
Do you have any idea

617
00:29:51,173 --> 00:29:54,179
what having a daughter like that
does to a man?

618
00:29:55,571 --> 00:29:58,906
I'm sorry I'm such
a disappointment to you, Ian.

619
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:27,579
And that concludes time-out.

620
00:30:27,663 --> 00:30:29,503
Does anyone have any questions
before we begin?

621
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:34,516
Unrelated, but does anybody have
a bidet that they can recommend?

622
00:30:34,905 --> 00:30:38,872
Dr. Nolan, we are ready
to proceed with the splenectomy.

623
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:40,699
Splenect-away, Dr. Devi.

624
00:30:40,784 --> 00:30:42,664
If you screw up, I'll scrub in.

625
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,985
Just do me a favor and don't

626
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,617
splat yourself
all over the pavement.

627
00:30:48,831 --> 00:30:51,870
Looks like you're flying solo
today, Dr. Devi.

628
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:58,281
Scalpel.

629
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:06,685
Oh. About time.

630
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:08,489
Where the hell have you been?

631
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:17,858
Vitals are dropping.
Should we push more epinephrine?

632
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:22,617
Look, I don't know
what is going on with you, Ian,

633
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:24,254
but pull it together.

634
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:28,228
Jane needs you.

635
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:33,098
Ian!

636
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:49,470
- Fever's spiking.
- Sepsis is worsening.

637
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:51,173
We have to move fast.
Clamps to me.

638
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:53,493
Diana's going into A-fib.

639
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,923
You hear those alarms, Devi?
You tried, and you failed.

640
00:31:56,008 --> 00:31:57,627
- I am scrubbing in.
- This was always a risk.

641
00:31:57,711 --> 00:31:59,190
Let me get her heart rate
under control.

642
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:01,728
She's too sick. Stop
the surgery, cardiovert now.

643
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:04,540
The only way through is to do
the surgery. Stapler to me, now.

644
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:06,756
If you do not get her rate down,
she is going to...

645
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:08,633
She's going to make it.

646
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:17,984
Heart rate
and temperature normalizing.

647
00:32:18,094 --> 00:32:19,764
Great work, Dr. Devi.

648
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:22,328
See? You can get back

649
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:24,750
to your bidet now.

650
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:29,055
With pleasure.

651
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:38,093
All right, carry your incision
down into the meningeal sac.

652
00:32:38,185 --> 00:32:41,392
That's it.
Mobilize the nerve roots.

653
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:43,412
Dr. Sullivan,
this is your specialty.

654
00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:44,698
Dr. Sutton can handle it.

655
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,228
Okay, now use your sutures.

656
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:51,445
Delicately fold the neural
placode into the spine.

657
00:32:57,557 --> 00:33:01,815
I know my way around a spine,
but not one this small.

658
00:33:01,984 --> 00:33:03,821
Jessica's right.
You should take over.

659
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:07,827
- You're doing fine. Just keep going.
- I will.

660
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:11,017
But if Jane dies
on this table, it's on you.

661
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:21,585
Okay. 7-0 Prolene to me, please.

662
00:33:21,812 --> 00:33:24,193
Better late than never,
I suppose.

663
00:33:24,277 --> 00:33:26,382
See if you can get me
some exposure here.

664
00:33:26,474 --> 00:33:28,640
Retract the skin edges, please.

665
00:33:31,554 --> 00:33:33,124
All right.

666
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:35,883
- You see that little guy?
- Mm-hmm.

667
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:37,838
- The filum terminale?
- It tethers the spine,

668
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:40,910
as you know,
but now we need to cut it, okay?

669
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:42,421
Place back in the nerves

670
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:44,952
and then close
the dura and the fascia.

671
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:46,858
You with me, Sutton?

672
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:50,997
Lead the way.

673
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:52,906
Ah.

674
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:02,603
It's official. You don't have
myasthenia gravis.

675
00:34:02,944 --> 00:34:05,007
But I have cancer.

676
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,002
Yes. A paraneoplastic syndrome
called Lambert-Eaton.

677
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:12,323
It explains why
your neuromuscular symptoms

678
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:15,218
were worsening
with the myasthenia treatment.

679
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:24,007
Look, I know
cancer is never good news.

680
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:27,047
But now that we know what we're
dealing with, we can fight it.

681
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,125
And we happen
to have excellent weapons

682
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,757
against this particular type.

683
00:34:30,842 --> 00:34:33,539
I'm not going to lie to you, Marty.
It's a long road ahead.

684
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:36,219
But if we stay the path,
in a few years, there's a chance

685
00:34:36,304 --> 00:34:39,054
that you can gain some
of your independence back.

686
00:34:41,131 --> 00:34:43,903
You mean, I could move out
of my parents' house?

687
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:48,398
Take care of them for a change?

688
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:50,773
The point is,
you've had the wrong treatment

689
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:52,445
for the wrong problem,

690
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:54,507
and it was only going
to get worse.

691
00:34:55,046 --> 00:34:56,629
Now there's hope.

692
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:05,947
Thank you.

693
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:22,028
Your training is complete,
young Padawan.

694
00:35:22,406 --> 00:35:24,618
You ready to get
that yellow stripe?

695
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:27,249
In class last week,

696
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:29,274
I couldn't break the board.

697
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,617
And some of the kids
laughed at me.

698
00:35:31,702 --> 00:35:32,969
That's not very nice.

699
00:35:33,054 --> 00:35:34,906
We all fail sometimes.
That's how we learn.

700
00:35:34,991 --> 00:35:37,994
But you never fail
at anything, Daddy.

701
00:35:38,163 --> 00:35:39,864
Oh, yes, I do.

702
00:35:39,948 --> 00:35:41,868
All the time. I just...

703
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,844
I just don't give up.

704
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:47,129
Remember when you thought you'd
never sleep in this bed again?

705
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,269
Because of all the nightmares?

706
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,077
I remember. It was scary.

707
00:35:54,163 --> 00:35:57,335
Yeah, but now you sleep
by yourself every night.

708
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,495
Because you were brave enough
to try again.

709
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:04,866
It doesn't matter
if you break some stupid board.

710
00:36:05,223 --> 00:36:07,709
What matters is
that you keep trying.

711
00:36:07,794 --> 00:36:10,433
- Capisce?
- Capisce.

712
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:20,561
Jane will be okay.

713
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:23,115
But that could've ended
very badly.

714
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:25,201
Thanks for holding down
the fort.

715
00:36:25,286 --> 00:36:27,139
I shouldn't have had to.

716
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,907
What happened back there, Ian?

717
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:32,152
Well, long story short,

718
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:34,659
I was sick and now I'm not.

719
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:37,582
Well, someday,
I want the long story.

720
00:36:38,248 --> 00:36:40,469
Because that can
never happen again.

721
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:41,670
It won't.

722
00:36:41,755 --> 00:36:42,757
I assure you.

723
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:46,289
Dr. Sullivan, they're waiting
for you in the lab.

724
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:49,380
Of course. Be right there.

725
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:53,139
See you tomorrow.

726
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,350
See you tomorrow.

727
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,256
Excuse me?

728
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,645
Are you a doctor?

729
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,804
The nurse said they were taking
me for an MRI two hours ago.

730
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:17,791
I'll see what I can find out.

731
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:28,105
Tell me...

732
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,477
Mr... Sanchez.

733
00:37:30,756 --> 00:37:32,760
Any history of liver disease?

734
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:36,026
Kidney problems?

735
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:37,882
- Any drug use?
- No.

736
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:39,420
Definitely not.

737
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,943
Great.

738
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:45,803
Ah. Your urinal's full.

739
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:48,313
Here, you know what?

740
00:37:48,943 --> 00:37:51,080
Let me help you there.

741
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:57,251
That's everything.

742
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,398
Enjoy the rest of your evening,
Dr. Sullivan.

743
00:38:00,568 --> 00:38:02,705
Oh, I certainly will.

744
00:38:16,006 --> 00:38:17,342
Where am I?

745
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:20,164
You're in the hospital, Diana.

746
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:21,584
You had your spleen removed.

747
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:24,232
But you should be
feeling better soon.

748
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:29,998
Don't touch me!

749
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:38,450
Where's my bag?

750
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:40,905
Did someone take it?

751
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:43,995
They seized it when you were
admitted, remember?

752
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:46,874
I need my bag.

753
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:49,121
I want to... I want out of here.

754
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:51,296
Your daughter's out of surgery.

755
00:38:51,381 --> 00:38:52,478
She's recovering now.

756
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,046
Did you hear me?
I want to go home.

757
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:56,436
You're in withdrawal.

758
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,757
You have a long road
to getting clean.

759
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:01,140
And until you are,
you won't be getting Jane back.

760
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:02,381
That's bull.

761
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:03,984
A baby needs her mom.

762
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:06,708
Not if her mother continues
abusing drugs.

763
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:08,678
And trust me,

764
00:39:09,084 --> 00:39:11,183
I know what that looks like.

765
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:15,686
At every soccer game
or piano recital,

766
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:17,437
Jane will look out
into the crowd.

767
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,867
And see every parent there
but hers.

768
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:22,482
And she'll hate herself for it.

769
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:25,365
She'll spend the rest of her
life wondering why her mother

770
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:28,326
chose a fix over a relationship
with her daughter.

771
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:31,960
- Get out.
- She'll have a hard time trusting people,

772
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:34,613
making friends, falling in love.

773
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:37,191
Because how could she believe
anyone could love her

774
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:39,480
if her own mother doesn't?

775
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,984
I'm begging you,
don't do that to Jane.

776
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:44,540
- She doesn't deserve it.
- Evelyn.

777
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:49,922
That's her name.

778
00:39:52,861 --> 00:39:54,765
Get some sleep.

779
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:38,658
<i>"Wake Up!" By Purple Disco

780
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:44,274
Champagne?

781
00:40:44,436 --> 00:40:45,839
What's the occasion?

782
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:47,321
Well, let's see.

783
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:49,720
Padma and the twins
are in the new condo,

784
00:40:49,805 --> 00:40:51,930
safe and sound with AJ.

785
00:40:52,477 --> 00:40:54,489
Which means
it's just the two of us tonight.

786
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,759
I like it.

787
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:59,189
And although
karma did come for my neck

788
00:40:59,274 --> 00:41:01,720
when I stupidly asked
the universe for a challenge,

789
00:41:01,882 --> 00:41:03,751
I rose to the occasion

790
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,524
and I successfully completed
my first solo surgery.

791
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:07,931
No way.

792
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:10,488
That's amazing, Leela.

793
00:41:10,745 --> 00:41:12,247
Cheers to that.

794
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:20,556
So how'd it go
with your patient?

795
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:23,673
Just uncovered
a six-year-long misdiagnosis

796
00:41:23,758 --> 00:41:25,307
and started her on a treatment
to cure her cancer.

797
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:26,391
So, no biggie.

798
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:28,056
Wow.
