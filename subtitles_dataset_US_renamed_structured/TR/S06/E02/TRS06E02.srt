1
00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:02,347
Previously on The Resident...

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,150
<i>I saw you pocket the pills.</i>

3
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:05,857
<i>We're not having an
issue with that again.</i>

4
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:07,791
Your twins are in grave danger.

5
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:09,494
Just do whatever you have to do.

6
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:10,563
Please save my babies.

7
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:13,903
Smaller one's heart
rate is climbing to 103.

8
00:00:14,038 --> 00:00:15,407
I want to see you tonight.

9
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:19,481
<i>And if this idiot</i>

10
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:21,428
becomes our new governor,
we'll have less than we ever had.

11
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:23,155
- He's polling ahead.
- Yeah, I wish

12
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:24,593
I was there to help. <i>- No.</i>

13
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,428
<i>You're exactly
where you need to be.</i>

14
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:28,041
I have some good
news. They're trying me

15
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:30,336
on a new anti-CD20 antibody,

16
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:31,940
and I'm tolerating
it really well.

17
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:34,813
<i>State
Assemblywoman Camille Rogers</i>

18
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:37,884
<i>is in a much tougher
fight than many expected.</i>

19
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,487
<i>Opponent Mark Betz,</i>

20
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:42,127
<i>the billionaire real estate
and finance entrepreneur,</i>

21
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:45,667
- is a first-time candidate for public office.
- Hey. I got your email.

22
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:48,072
I'll have those OR numbers
to you by end of day.

23
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:50,343
Thanks. I'm trying to
prepare for the worst,

24
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:51,713
in case Betz becomes governor.

25
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:54,250
- How's it looking?
- It's too close for my liking.

26
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,453
How is that possible?

27
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,223
Betz hasn't even
held public office.

28
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,902
But he has millions
to spend on attack ads.

29
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,465
So now half the state's gonna
reject an experienced woman

30
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,378
who wants to give them
health care and education.

31
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:04,948
Yeah, apparently, that
just doesn't resonate

32
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:07,912
like "billionaire who wants
to slash social services."

33
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:10,182
Who would actually cut
funding to public hospitals?

34
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:12,989
Well, let's hope we
don't have to find out.

35
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:14,525
Is everything okay otherwise?

36
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:16,829
How's Randolph's
treatment going at the clinic?

37
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,165
He's responding well.

38
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:20,236
His-his team are...

39
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,441
uh, encouraged.
I'm working on it.

40
00:01:22,507 --> 00:01:24,510
I worry about you when
I get emails at 3:00 a. m.

41
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:27,652
Oh, it's just this election.
It's got me tied up in knots.

42
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:29,751
All we can do is vote and
hope for the best, right?

43
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,492
Can't worry about
things we can't control.

44
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,528
Those are the things
that worry me the most.

45
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,944
<i>Georgia's new voting laws</i>

46
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:37,371
<i>have taken effect,</i>

47
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:39,942
<i>leading to massive

not both.

Democracy needs you.

51
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:47,057
We can cover.

52
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:48,860
It's slow here anyway.

53
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:49,795
<i>Now, you know</i>

00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:51,932
you shouldn't have

Relax.

What?

57
00:01:56,877 --> 00:01:58,614
Unbelievable.

58
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:01,686
Are you deaf?

59
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:04,692
Quit checking your Bit coin
and move the hell up.

60
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:12,139
- Are you kidding me?!
- A line

61
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:15,112

between citizens!

62
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,180
We're all interdependent!

63
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:17,259
Do you know what that means?!

64
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:19,021
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

65
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:21,727
We're all tired of waiting, but
you gotta dial it down, brother.

66
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:24,163
I'm not your brother. Go
back to where you came from.

67
00:02:24,264 --> 00:02:25,735
Chill.

68
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:27,037
Did you hear that?

69
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:28,806
Came from Atlanta, gringo.

70
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,644
Where are you from?

71
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,647
Assault! You all saw that!
This man assaulted me!

72
00:02:32,715 --> 00:02:35,387
- Hey, you need to back off!
- Police! This man's assaulting me!

73
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:47,611
I'm at St. Anthony of the
Cross Community Center.

74
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:50,617
There are multiple injuries, a
cardiac arrest, a blunt trauma.

75
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:53,689
We're gonna need
some medics here now!

76
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,896
♪ ♪

77
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:20,844
Hey. Any exit polls yet?

78
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:24,050
Not yet. But they're thinking
it won't be decided tonight.

79
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:25,429
Well, if you need a distraction,

80
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,389
I could use your
help with a consult.

81
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,093
I can clear
something. What's up?

82
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:32,234
Well, I just got off the phone
with one of my trial patients,

83
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:34,003
and he's having
severe back pain.

84
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,877
He tends to be a minimizer,
so I know he's really suffering.

85
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:38,278
Which trial is this?

86
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:40,817
Multiple sclerosis.

87
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:43,031
He's been doing pretty
well with the treatment,

88
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,127
but the pain is bad enough
that he hasn't been able to walk.

89
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:47,364
So maybe an MS flare.

90
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:48,766
But if he's not mobile...

91
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,714
Then he can't be a part
of the trial any longer.

92
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:54,010
Exactly. So I'm hoping
that we can help reverse it.

93
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:55,346
Happy to take a look.

94
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:56,849
How's the trial going otherwise?

95
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:59,420
We're getting good results
with one of the treatments.

96
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:01,626
Well-tolerated,
limited side effects.

97
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:04,799
How does it compare to
the new anti-CD20 meds?

98
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:06,703
Randolph's been
responding well to those.

99
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,174
Oh, that's good news. We
haven't been able to compare it

100
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,286
with any other treatments yet.

101
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,080
We need to expand the study.

102
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:15,086
- Which means more funding.
- Yes.

103
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:18,759
Another reason we're hoping
this election goes our way.

104
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:20,774
I don't see your little sticker.

105
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,266
Oh, I'm gonna hit
the polls at lunch.

106
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:23,704
Yeah, make sure you do.

107
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:27,845
All right. And we also got
your lavender essential oils

108
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:30,283
and palo santo,

109
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:31,720
which, if you ask me,

110
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:33,459
looks like an overpriced
bundle of sticks.

111
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:37,029
Oh. Padma, I'm so sorry...

112
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:39,168
They only had
regular cheese puffs.

113
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:40,771
Oh.

114
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:43,009
That's okay.

115
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,076
Look at you.

116
00:04:44,211 --> 00:04:46,615
Thought I could not get my
hands on some spicy cheesies?

117
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:50,766
It's about the only thing
on the list I do understand.

118
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,495
Thank you. You have no
idea what this means to me.

119
00:04:53,596 --> 00:04:55,500
- I think I do have an idea.
- You know,

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,505
I tried this online recipe
for keto cheesies once.

121
00:04:58,574 --> 00:04:59,752
Never again.

122
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:01,913
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

123
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:05,821
Uh, I got to go review some
pre-op echocardiograms.

124
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:08,391
But, wait, I want to show
you this amazing documentary.

125
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:09,939
Ah, the Himalayas
are gonna have to wait.

126
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:11,331
I'm done with the Himalayas.

127
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:12,802
It's ocean docs now.

128
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:14,648
- Ocean docs?
- See, the thing about octopuses...

129
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:16,651
Not "octopi," okay, only
pretentious people say that...

130
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,956
Is that they're supposedly so
intelligent and compassionate

131
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,853
that scientists think they're
a life form from outer space.

132
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:24,490
- "Scientists", huh?
- Mm-hmm, you have to see this one scene.

133
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,362
Uh, look, I really got
to check it out later.

134
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:27,764
I got to go. See you soon.

135
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:30,771
Okay, wait, I'll send it to you.

136
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:37,417
Morning, everyone.

137
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:38,987
- Doctor Hawkins.
- Doctor Sullivan.

138
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:40,957
Aw, they still call each
other "doctor" at work.

139
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:43,930
Very professional. We all
know you're dating, Doctors.

140
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:45,901
Can't stay out of my ER, huh?

141
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:47,939
You know how much I
love being surrounded

142
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:49,942
by undifferentiated illness.

143
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:52,581
Plus you keep slipping
out before I'm up.

144
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:55,286
- Mm, a girl's got to vote.
- Uh-huh.

145
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,925
Well, Gigi would love to share

146
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,862
some Nutty Wheats with you

147
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:01,800
whenever you're ready
to make the big leap.

148
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:04,572
I was actually thinking
I'd introduce you both

149
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:06,040
to Crispy Chuck tonight.

150
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,887
- Your ex-boyfriend from high school?
- Mm, good one.

151
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:09,548
No, it's Crispy
Chuck's Chicken Truck.

152
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:10,929
It's the best fried
chicken ever.

153
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:12,730
You have to be on a
secret list to know about it.

154
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,625
Letting me in on
your chicken truck.

155
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:16,461
Wow, well, this is, this is big.

156
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:18,399
I'm glad you appreciate
the significance.

157
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:19,706
Sorry to interrupt this summit.

158
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,137
Hundley called the triage line.

159
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:23,509
- Multiple trauma victims incoming.
- From where?

160
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,488
There was an all-out
brawl at a polling station.

161
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:26,882
Democracy in action.

162
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,754
Let's put out a
page for back-up.

163
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:31,793
I think I can beg off
rounds, help out for a bit.

164
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,764
Knowing you,
you're gonna need it.

165
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:35,533
Just try and keep up, all right?

166
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:37,737
40s-ish female, head injury.

167
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:39,878
- Possible concussion.
- Let's get her to Trauma 11.

168
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:41,646
I'll get started on
her assessment.

169
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:42,949
What was she struck with?

170
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:44,886
One of those folding
chair-cane things.

171
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:47,290
- Don't ask.
- All right, let's get heat stroke to Bay Four.

172
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:48,826
Asthma attack to Bay One,

173
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,798
wrist injury to Bay
Seven. Hawkins?

174
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:52,500
I'm reassigning
you to this periorbital

175
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:53,803
hematoma, Trauma Ten.

176
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,630
I'm on it. Jessica, can
you take that for me?

177
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:57,444
- Cardiac arrest?
- We got a pulse back,

178
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:58,990
- but he keeps going in and out.
- That one's for me.

179
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:00,684
Thank you. Trauma Nine.

180
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,387
Love the smell of
napalm in the morning.

181
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,925
- What's his injury?
- I'm fine. I don't need any of this.

182
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:07,807
- He got tackled, might have broken ribs.
- Hundley and I can take him.

183
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:09,242
You're gonna have to
find a place in the hallway

184
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:10,478
'cause we're
running out of space.

185
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:11,649
- Yeah.
- Didn't I tell you never

186
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:13,442
to say the S-L-O-W
word out loud?

187
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,812
That's a made-up superstition.

188
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,719
From a man who won't
let a sneeze go unblessed.

189
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:18,552
Because that would be wrong.

190
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:21,524
Any signs of concussion?

191
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:25,399
Okay, ondansetron,
fluids and a stat

192
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:26,706
CT for possible skull fracture.

193
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:28,305
And a fresh gown for you.

194
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:30,242
Thank you.

195
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:31,745
How's the eye?

196
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:33,716
Orbital fracture,
possible entrapment.

197
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:35,788
Might be looking at
neurosurg and ophtho.

198
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:38,726
And we have a possible
skull fracture in Trauma 11.

199
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,497
- Yep.
- So let's get Dr. Sutton in here.

200
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:44,237
Hawkins, can you tag
team this guy with me?

201
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:46,274
- Sure.
- He got tackled.

202
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,509
Has acute abdominal pain.

203
00:07:47,577 --> 00:07:48,846
Doesn't want imaging.

204
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,860
Just wants to get out
of here. Says it's his IBS.

205
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:53,757
- And he got it from the tackle?
- Yeah, I didn't push it.

206
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,894
Mr. Mendez, this is Dr. Hawkins.

207
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,329
How's it going?

208
00:07:57,396 --> 00:07:59,177
- Heard you took a bit of a tumble.
- But his lungs are clear.

209
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:02,807
- Little angry dude lost it, I'm fine.
- Okay.

210
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,014
Let's take a look at these ribs.

211
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,785
Does that hurt?

212
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:10,891
Told him I got
IBS. I always hurt.

213
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,930
Well, I'm with Dr. Feldman,
we need to take some pictures,

214
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,935
- make sure nothing's broken.
- Look, I got to get to work.

215
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:18,538
The sooner we find
out what you need,

216
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:19,908
the sooner you'll
be on your way.

217
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,079
And we can give you some
medication for the pain.

218
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:25,687
Fine.

219
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:28,927
- Page me if his symptoms worsen.
- Thank you.

220
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,736
- Betz is pulling ahead...
- I got the prior authorization

221
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:35,941
filled out for Mr. S's
anticoagulation,

222
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,412
so hopefully this time
he doesn't forget to take it.

223
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:39,881
Most new interns hate paperwork.

224
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:42,052
And you seem like
you actually like it.

225
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:45,058
I mean, I won't lie, my
family's on me constantly, like,

226
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,230
"When are you going to
start saving lives, Maya?

227
00:08:47,297 --> 00:08:48,198
"This is why we sent you

228
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,168
"to med school." Of
course, I don't mention

229
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:52,039
I'm the one paying the loans.

230
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:55,346
Oh, immigrant parents. Am I right?

231
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:56,816
Oh.

232
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:58,953
ER just paged out a
major code disaster.

233
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:01,033
That means multiple injuries.
You want to see some action?

234
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:03,105
- Bring it.
- Maybe now you'll have something to tell your parents.

235
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:05,365
¡Sí, mamá, much a sangre hoy!

236
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:07,571
Hey. Thanks for coming.

237
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:09,006
Of course. Possible
skull fracture?

238
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,546
Trauma 11, and an
orbital fracture in Ten.

239
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:13,414
I'd start with the orbital.

240
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:15,318
Skull can wait, GCS is 15.

241
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:17,423
- Busy day.
- Yeah.

242
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,927
Hey. I got your page.

243
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:22,000
This is my intern, Maya
Nuñez. What can we do to help?

244
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,739
I've got a sprained
wrist in Bay Seven.

245
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:27,544
- That's it?
- Sorry?

246
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,916
Guess we did miss all the fun.

247
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:33,956
- Don't speak too soon.
- Get off me!

248
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,927
I just need to make
sure nothing's broken.

249
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:38,198
- Keep your hands off of me!
- Hey.

250
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:40,298
- Hey, hey, hey.
- She's trying to take my eye out!

251
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:42,539
It's okay, Stewart. No
one's trying to hurt you.

252
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:46,682
- I want to make sure you leave here with functional vision.
- Stop! Stop!

253
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,293
Help! Stop!

254
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,831
Help! Let me go!

255
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,635
- Let's get some restraints.
- Call 911!

256
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,572
Get this lunatic out of here!

257
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,711
- Hang on.
- Ow! Stop!

258
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:02,379
He's a vet. I might have an idea

259
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:04,818
of what's going on here.

260
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:15,874
Thanks.

261
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:21,018
Good news. CT scan shows

262
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:23,590
your orbital bones
won't need surgery.

263
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,961
- Great.
- Noticed your ink.

264
00:10:26,028 --> 00:10:29,735
I was Navy, too.
Corpsman in the Marines.

265
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:33,107
15th Expeditionary,
3rd battalion.

266
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:36,280
Oorah.

267
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,923
How long you been out?

268
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,162
12 years.

269
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:46,000
It's pretty tough
in the Navy, man.

270
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:49,274
I was a sonar tech at Bangor.

271
00:10:49,341 --> 00:10:52,279
Never deployed.

272
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:55,653
So...

273
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,125
what is going on, Stewart?

274
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,395
You seem pretty on edge.

275
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,701
I don't know.

276
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:05,807
Sometimes I just lose it.

277
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,447
I guess I'm getting old
and cranky like my dad.

278
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,754
Well, I'd like to do some blood
work, check out at a few things.

279
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:15,793
Can I call someone
to come pick you up?

280
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:18,633
I'm staying with my sister.

281
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,639
She's not gonna be
happy to hear from you.

282
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:23,542
You let me worry about that.

283
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,946
Be right back.

284
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:30,088
Yeah?

285
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:31,725
Ben, Jasper.

286
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:33,361
- This is Dr. Voss.
- Hi.

287
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:35,432
And she is one of our
orthopedic specialists.

288
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:38,038
- Pleasure to meet you, Ben, Jasper.
- Nice to meet you.

289
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:39,905
And I'm hoping that
she can help us figure out

290
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:41,342
what's, uh, going
on with your back.

291
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:44,585
So, Ben, how would you
compare your symptoms

292
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:46,822
to your previous MS flare-ups?

293
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:49,193
Oh, uh, this is
nothing like my MS.

294
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,600
It came out of nowhere,
one morning, boom!

295
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:54,136
Um, fire shooting down my legs.

296
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:56,842
Yeah, he couldn't get out
of bed. Excruciating pain.

297
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:59,213
And before this Ben was
showing some real promise

298
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:00,349
in the clinical trial.

299
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,186
Yeah, well, my triathlon
days are behind me,

300
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,892
but, yeah, I was
definitely getting stronger.

301
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,363
Of course we want to
keep you on that track.

302
00:12:07,397 --> 00:12:10,001
Any incidents you can recall

303
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:11,337
that may have caused an injury?

304
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:14,244
I haven't done anything crazy.

305
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:15,880
He did help me clean
out the CD closet.

306
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,784
Yeah, well, who keeps CDs?

307
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:18,986
Not me anymore.

308
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:20,791
Well, I'd like to
get some imaging.

309
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,192
And I'm going to consult

310
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:24,129
with our neurosurgeon,
Dr. Sutton.

311
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,735
So there's a chance,
if this isn't my MS,

312
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:28,807
I can get back in the trial?

313
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,475
I see no reason to give up hope.

314
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:33,682
- Yeah, we got to keep our star athlete, right?
- Yeah.

315
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,991
Hey, I was just coming by to see

316
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,894
if you still need an
extra set of hands.

317
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:42,265
Uh, we just got a moment
to breathe, but thanks.

318
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:44,504
- I think we have it handled.
- What the heck happened?

319
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:46,942
People attacking each
other at a polling place?

320
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,746
Mostly one crazy guy.

321
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:50,249
Are you sure you weren't there?

322
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:52,052
- The bump on your forehead.
- Oh!

323
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,956
Yeah, I hit it on a cabinet.

324
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:55,793
Doing too many things at once.

325
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,496
Mr. Incredible in the OR,

326
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:59,366
Mr. Magoo in the kitchen.

327
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:02,472
Everything's fine, Kincaid.

328
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,812
I didn't say anything.

329
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:06,048
I know the look.

330
00:13:06,148 --> 00:13:07,884
You're sweet to worry, but...

331
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:10,255
Look, Seattle was a
long time ago. I'm good.

332
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:11,355
Promise.

333
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,760
Okay.

334
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:14,899
Ah.

335
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:17,403
And if you're good...

336
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,379
Hey, just checking to see

337
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,049
if those head trauma
pictures came in.

338
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:26,120
Yes, they did. No fracture.

339
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:27,990
- Just a concussion.
- That was lucky.

340
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:29,961
Oh, I've been
meaning to ask you,

341
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:31,899
how's Gigi doing?

342
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,268
No nightmares the past week.

343
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:35,072
I'm hoping we're
out of the woods.

344
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,676
- Thanks for asking.
- Must be so hard

345
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:38,846
dealing with all the
parenting stuff alone.

346
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,549
Believe me, all I
keep thinking about

347
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,855
is how great Nic would
have been at dealing with this.

348
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,524
Well, you're doing
an amazing job.

349
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,927
Thank you.

350
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,397
Gigi misses you.

351
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:49,869
We should all do something
together again soon.

352
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:51,706
That's okay.

353
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:53,408
I'm sure your weekends are full.

354
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,813
- Where's my cardiac patient?
- Left AMA.

355
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,226
Said he had to get
back to the polls.

356
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,721
Wow, that's a
dedicated voter for you.

357
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:02,125
Here. Brought you a fresh one.

358
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:05,099
- Mmm.
- Oh, no, we're good over here, thank you.

359
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,677
Well, you're not the
one who had to tackle

360
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,337
that Proud Boy in there.

361
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:09,841
My hero.

362
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,778
He's not still here, is he?

363
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:14,159
- I'm just running a few tests.
- Right, because "jerky dude"

364
00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:15,921
is so hard to understand?

365
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,423
I should get back.

366
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,202
Hey, you know, if you
need to chill him out,

367
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,764
I got some nature
docs from Padma.

368
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:22,744
- Thought it was mountain climbing.
- That was last week.

369
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:25,172
But seriously, though, there's
a cool one where this octopus

370
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:27,845
thanks a guy after he
saves him from a sandbar.

371
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,114
Excuse me,

372
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,083
I'm here for my
brother, Stewart Mayer?

373
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,087
Yeah, Emma, hi. I'm Dr. Hawkins.

374
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:34,955
I left you a voice mail.
Do you have a minute?

375
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:36,662
- Yeah.
- Great.

376
00:14:36,763 --> 00:14:38,732
A scalpel?

377
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:42,139
Should he
be coming home with me?

378
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:44,611
So this is, this is new,

379
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:45,947
this level of volatility?

380
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:49,520
Yeah, he's been on edge
ever since his wife left and...

381
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:52,058
lately it's gotten pretty bad.

382
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,429
But before that, he
was just an annoying

383
00:14:54,496 --> 00:14:57,370
- tech bro mansplainer.
- Is he on any medication?

384
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:59,875
Some over-the-counter
stuff when he had the flu?

385
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:02,856
All right, I'm waiting
on a few test results.

386
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,485
- You mind hanging out for a bit?
- Yeah, can I see him, actually?

387
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:07,190
Yeah, sure.

388
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:14,269
Anybody see this patient leave?

389
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:17,945
Wait here, I'll
go check outside.

390
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,729
Stewart?

391
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:28,866
Stewart...

392
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:31,772
I've been looking for you.

393
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
Your sister's here. Why don't
we go inside and talk to her?

394
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:40,121
Trying to quit, huh?

395
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,159
Yeah, obviously not going well.

396
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:44,565
Tried everything...
Hypnosis, pills.

397
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:46,467
Nothing works.

398
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:49,540
Taking medication
to help you quit?

399
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:52,614
Yeah, why?

400
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:55,085
Ben is 52.

401
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:57,088
Former competitive athlete.

402
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,259
Diagnosed with MS six years ago.

403
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,030
Well, I can see
why he's in pain.

404
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:02,967
He has a fracture at T11.

405
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,513
Doesn't remember
any impact or trauma.

406
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:08,110
With advanced MS and
this degree of osteoporosis,

407
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,255
this could have
happened just moving

408
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,616
from his bed to the wheelchair.

409
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:13,322
He's responding really
well to Devon's clinical trial

410
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:15,275
and is hoping to continue,
so how do we help him?

411
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:16,596
Well, given his comorbidities,

412
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:19,234
my suggestion would be
non-surgical management.

413
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:22,139
Brace, pain control
and physical therapy.

414
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:23,876
Which means he
doesn't walk again.

415
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:28,418
There's no guarantee surgery
would restore his mobility, Kit.

416
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:31,157
I mean, there's a serious
chance he could end up with less.

417
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,528
And a smaller chance
he doesn't survive at all.

418
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:35,900
Risks we take with
every procedure.

419
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:37,536
Ben is an athlete.

420
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:39,407
He'll be highly motivated

421
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:41,019
in his post-operative
physical therapy...

422
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,403
Respectfully, Ben's motivation
won't matter if the procedure

423
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:45,195
ends up paralyzing him,
or he ends up hopped up

424
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:47,255
on pain medication
for the rest of his life.

425
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:49,159
That's a real possibility.

426
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:52,399
If there's hope for Ben
with this procedure,

427
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,441
don't we owe it to him
to give him that chance?

428
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:58,947
Let's present him
with the options

429
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:00,057
and let him make the decision.

430
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:02,754
I appreciate your caution.

431
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,358
I will talk him
through the risks.

432
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,962
Hey, Kit...

433
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:08,531
Mm?

434
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,538
I don't know what you and Bell
are going through, obviously,

435
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:13,240
but I do know that
chronic disease

436
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:15,346
is tough on caregivers, too.

437
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,016
If there's any
support you need, I...

438
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,153
Thank you, Billie.
You're very kind.

439
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,023
But this is about Ben.

440
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,827
I'm fine.

441
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:31,377
Your brother was
prescribed medication

442
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:33,782
to help him quit
smoking... Varenicline.

443
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:35,318
One of the side effects?

444
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:37,857
Aggression and mood swings.

445
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,259
So anti-smoking medication

446
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,263
is what was making
him act like a lunatic?

447
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,000
I
Wouldn't say "lunatic..."

448
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:44,269
Uh, I would.

449
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:46,173
It's rare, but it is
in the warnings.

450
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:47,778
I gave him some
nicotine patches.

451
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:50,158
Things should go a lot smoother
once he's off the varenicline.

452
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:51,360
I'm definitely getting off it.

453
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:52,753
Yeah. Maybe
stay off Twitter, too.

454
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,825
That can also cause
aggression and mood swings.

455
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:57,128
Thank you very
much, Dr. Hawkins.

456
00:17:57,195 --> 00:17:59,000
You guys take
care of yourselves.

457
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,536
Officer Carter, APD.

458
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:03,675
I need to speak with the
gentleman in this video.

459
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:09,252
Is he being charged?

460
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,324
Excuse me, Officer.

461
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,127
I was a witness in that incident

462
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:14,396
and the person who started it

463
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,300
is over there trying to leave.

464
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:17,612
- That's right!
- Look, I don't care.

465
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,015
I just need someone
to make a statement.

466
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,209
I... I will...

467
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:21,811
He's in respiratory distress!

468
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:22,780
I want to...

469
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:24,384
I want to press charges.

470
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:26,555
You're not pressing anything.

471
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:27,723
His lung is collapsing.

472
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,093
All right. Give me

473
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,731
a scalpel, a chest
tube and suture.

474
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,786
Fractured rib here
punctured Enrique's lung.

475
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:44,289
Must have happened when
he got agitated with the cop.

476
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,326
Well, the chest
tube is on water seal

477
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:48,566
and the lung is re-expanding,
so he should be good

478
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:50,210
to check out of here tomorrow.

479
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:51,638
Oh, geez.

480
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,875
- What?
- Padma.

481
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:55,779
I have entertained her

482
00:18:55,846 --> 00:18:57,349
nature docs, I have

483
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,287
indulged in her aromatherapy,

484
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,423
and now she's on to astrology.

485
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:07,169
Hey. Look at this.

486
00:19:10,476 --> 00:19:11,679
Hmm.

487
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:13,950
Looks like some kind of
mass in his ascending colon,

488
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:16,421
causing partial
bowel obstruction.

489
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,392
When I was doing the
abdominal exam, he said

490
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,411
- he had IBS.
- Well, that's the catch-all phrase

491
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:22,465
for unknown GI distress.

492
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,336
Let's get him into surgery.

493
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:26,340
He needs to remove that blockage

494
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:28,178
before the bowel
loses blood flow.

495
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:30,449
Let's scan the rest
of his abdomen.

496
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:31,861
I guess it's good
he broke a rib today.

497
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:34,892
Well, I'm sure Padma
would say it's in the stars.

498
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:37,328
Enrique Mendez, 46.

499
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:38,742
Imaging for a fractured
rib and collapsed lung

500
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:40,446
revealed obstruction
with threatened bowel.

501
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:41,848
Oh, looks like he could
perforate at any time.

502
00:19:41,872 --> 00:19:43,875
Yeah, we need to
get in there right away.

503
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,555
- Is there a prognosis?
- Well, it's hard to say with those images.

504
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:47,516
There's likely malignancy,
but we won't know

505
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:49,555
until we get in
and see the extent

506
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:51,223
of the location and the disease.

507
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,961
And would you be
all right if I invited

508
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,197
my intern to come observe?

509
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:55,967
That depends. She a Capricorn?

510
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,236
Kidding.

511
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:58,782
Your sister's killing
me with the astrology.

512
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:00,609
- Oh, sorry.
- Sure, you can join us.

513
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:03,048
Just buckle up.
Might be a long one.

514
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:05,184
Thank you so much, Dr. Austin.

515
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:07,824
And for the record,
I'm a-a Virgo.

516
00:20:09,994 --> 00:20:12,601
First bowel surgery!

517
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,038
Here you see the fracture

518
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:16,473
causing pressure on the spine.

519
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,546
We're going to remove
this damaged piece of bone

520
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:20,616
and use rods to
stabilize your spine.

521
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:23,355
After some physical
therapy, you should be

522
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:24,466
back to where you were before.

523
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,996
So I'd be out of this chair.

524
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,131
That's the hope.

525
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:29,634
But what's the reality?

526
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:31,806
Well, there are several
factors in our favor here.

527
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:34,376
Ben's history with
competitive sport, for one.

528
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,314
All that grit and determination

529
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:37,884
will be essential
in your recovery.

530
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:39,630
Nice to know it's still
good for something.

531
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,892
- However, I would...
- And our chief surgeon

532
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:44,698
here at Chastain is a
top-notch neurosurgeon.

533
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,435
Dr. Sutton and I will
be operating together,

534
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:50,476
so it's an ideal
team going into this.

535
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,846
But it has to be said

536
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:54,450
that there is no guarantee
that you would regain

537
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,186
the mobility you had before.

538
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:59,160
And we don't know that you'd
be able to continue with the trial.

539
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,596
But if we don't do this surgery,

540
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:03,501
I'm not getting out of
this chair again, right?

541
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:06,307
- Nothing is certain.
- But with the progression

542
00:21:06,374 --> 00:21:08,679
of your MS, yes, that
is a likely scenario.

543
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:11,852
Can we... take
some time to think?

544
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:14,991
- Of course.
- I-I don't need time.

545
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:16,828
- I want to do it.
- Ben,

546
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:18,900
- I think we should talk about this.
- I...

547
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,636
I want to complete the trial.

548
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:23,141
We were getting good
results. I'm not ready to give in.

549
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,613
I advise that you talk it over.

550
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:29,654
But hold on to that spirit, Ben.

551
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:36,334
- Can we talk?
- I like him, he's a fighter.

552
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:37,570
I know.

553
00:21:37,604 --> 00:21:39,207
That's why I'm concerned.

554
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:40,809
Every patient in every trial

555
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:42,289
thinks they're gonna
be in the top five percent

556
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:43,390
of the best patient outcome.

557
00:21:43,414 --> 00:21:44,617
And as we know, patients with

558
00:21:44,684 --> 00:21:46,788
good attitudes often
have better outcomes.

559
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,157
But that's not enough.

560
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,197
Look, Ben came to me thinking
he was going to play tennis again.

561
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,535
I've done a lot to
manage his expectations.

562
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,606
I don't believe I indicated
he'd be playing tennis.

563
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,418
No, but I don't think we've
given him an accurate idea

564
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,621
of the risks that
he's gonna take

565
00:21:58,645 --> 00:21:59,981
just to get back into the trial,

566
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:03,520
when, statistically speaking,
it may not even help him.

567
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,491
The thing about
statistics, Dr. Pravesh,

568
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:07,061
is that people aren't numbers.

569
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:10,067
Our job is to
illuminate pathways,

570
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:11,471
warn of pitfalls,

571
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:13,340
and follow where
the patient leads.

572
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,011
Are you saying I
haven't done that?

573
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:16,381
Of course not.

574
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,651
I just hope we're ready

575
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:19,519
to follow where he's
leading, because...

576
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:21,692
I don't feel good about it.

577
00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:35,653
Okay, Mr. Mendez, we
need you to sign here

578
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,624
and initial here. All right?

579
00:22:48,377 --> 00:22:49,681
I need to go scrub in.

580
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,193
Do you mind taking
this to the nurse in there?

581
00:22:51,217 --> 00:22:52,686
Of course.

582
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:44,557
If this goes long,
you can wait in observation.

583
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,160
No way. I'm not
missing anything.

584
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,566
This is a retractor.
You can help me adjust it.

585
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:50,802
Mobilize the omentum with me.

586
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:54,076
Let's get a good look inside.

587
00:24:01,324 --> 00:24:02,594
What is it?

588
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:03,972
All through here...

589
00:24:03,996 --> 00:24:07,936
Diffuse peritoneal
carcinomatosis.

590
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,078
- S-So...
- It's metastasized.

591
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,347
Everywhere.

592
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,920
He's terminal.

593
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,699
There's nothing you can do?

594
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:23,868
Unfortunately, not when
the damage is this extensive.

595
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:26,374
- It's beyond treatment.
- Let's close, please.

596
00:24:26,473 --> 00:24:27,986
Would you
like to practice closing?

597
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,488
At least you can
work on your sutures.

598
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:31,517
Can't you remove
some of the bowel,

599
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:32,721
clear out the tumors?

600
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:34,222
Help him live a little longer?

601
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:35,727
Unfortunately,
we're beyond that.

602
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:37,229
It happens sometimes.

603
00:24:37,296 --> 00:24:39,567
We open someone up and
we see something we can't fix.

604
00:24:39,634 --> 00:24:42,072
It's a peek and shriek.

605
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,112
"Peek and shriek"?

606
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:49,220
He's someone's father.

607
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:50,690
I...

608
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,660
I-I told him he was
going to go to sleep

609
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,529
and-and wake up better.

610
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,135
We have to do something.

611
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:01,912
How can you just give up? I...

612
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:05,117
I don't understand.

613
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:09,393
I am so sorry, Dr. Austin,

614
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:11,096
I will talk to her.

615
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:15,807
You need to apologize to
your intern, Dr. Devi, not to me.

616
00:25:16,842 --> 00:25:17,943
Why?

617
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,182
You referred to this
patient's inoperable cancer

618
00:25:20,248 --> 00:25:22,820
as a "peek and shriek."
I mean, you should know

619
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,491
to use more discretion
in front of a new intern.

620
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,564
Obviously I know it
sounded bad, but...

621
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:30,836
I'm well aware why
we use these phrases.

622
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:32,807
"Watering the cabbage patch."

623
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:34,375
"Circling the drain."

624
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:37,549
So we don't have to look this
horror in the face every day.

625
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:39,954
- Exactly.
- But she doesn't know that.

626
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:42,794
All she knows is her
mentor sounded like

627
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:45,065
she didn't care
about this man at all.

628
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:49,641
Now, help me close this fascia.

629
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:05,372
Hey, Maya.

630
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,209
Hey.

631
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:12,094
Look, I know it may have sounded

632
00:26:12,118 --> 00:26:14,256
like I don't care
about Mr. Mendez.

633
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:20,367
But sometimes we
disconnect from our patients

634
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:21,939
when they can't hear us,

635
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:24,542
because when we have to
talk to them and their families,

636
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:26,647
it can get overwhelming.

637
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:28,952
I know it sounds terrible,

638
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:31,657
but it's just a way of
protecting yourself,

639
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,294
so you don't get
compassion fatigue.

640
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:37,703
And then you won't have what
you need when you really need it.

641
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,112
Can I show you?

642
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:49,527
As we explained, the
surgery was partially exploratory.

643
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:50,796
And, unfortunately,

644
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:52,576
the mass blocking
Enrique's lower intestine

645
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,336
turned out to be malignant.

646
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:56,140
You mean cancer?

647
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,715
That's why you've
been having so much pain.

648
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,826
With this type of
cancer, Mrs. Mendez,

649
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:07,763
it's likely it was
already advanced

650
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:10,367
by the time he started
having symptoms.

651
00:27:10,434 --> 00:27:12,205
So what do we do?

652
00:27:12,306 --> 00:27:15,045
Unfortunately, the cancer
has spread too much

653
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,449
for us to remove it surgically.

654
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:19,855
And what does that mean?

655
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:23,027
An oncologist
will be here shortly

656
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:24,931
to discuss a number of regimens

657
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:27,201
that may be of
some benefit, but...

658
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:31,176
as much as we hoped this
was something we could fix...

659
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:35,285
it's likely Enrique's
time may be short.

660
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:37,624
No.

661
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,693
I'll give you
two some time to talk.

662
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:53,622
Thank you for including me.

663
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,458
I'm still learning, too.

664
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:06,949
Rongeur, please.

665
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:09,554
Another bone fragment.

666
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,057
His bones are so brittle.

667
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:14,631
Unexpected for a
man in his early fifties.

668
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,000
Not for a man with advanced MS

669
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:17,747
who's undergone years
of steroid treatment.

670
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,309
Suction.

671
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,951
I'm having trouble
with a bit of bone here.

672
00:28:25,018 --> 00:28:28,090
- It's dangerously close to the cord.
- I know.

673
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:32,365
I've almost got it...

674
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:35,471
We've got a heart rate in
the 160s. Afib with RVR.

675
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:37,093
- What's his pressure?
- Dropping.

676
00:28:37,142 --> 00:28:39,512
- MAPS in the 50s.
- His heart is failing.

677
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,758
The steroids from
his MS treatment

678
00:28:40,782 --> 00:28:42,318
must have weakened his heart.

679
00:28:42,385 --> 00:28:44,522
- Bolus amiodarone. Now.
- 150 milligrams

680
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,027
IV amio going in.

681
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,173
I'm not sure how long
he's going to tolerate this.

682
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:50,035
We're working as
quickly as we can.

683
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:51,904
If we stop, he
doesn't walk again.

684
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:53,316
We got a heart rate
in the 170s, team.

685
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,480
- Might have to shock.
- Let's move.

686
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,849
It's a race against time.

687
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,757
We have to finish this
surgery before he codes.

688
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:07,102
Padma?

689
00:29:11,744 --> 00:29:13,247
Padma?

690
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:14,215
You okay?

691
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:16,487
No.

692
00:29:19,894 --> 00:29:22,633
I can't feel them moving.

693
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,068
Okay. Okay, okay.

694
00:29:24,135 --> 00:29:25,180
We'll just get you
into the bed first,

695
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:26,507
let's get you into the bed.

696
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:37,997
Let's just...

697
00:29:38,064 --> 00:29:41,069
take a listen, okay?

698
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:46,279
Okay.

699
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:55,432
There's a heartbeat.

700
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:58,572
Okay?

701
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:08,391
There's the other.

702
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:11,497
They're fine.

703
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:18,544
Do you want me to get an
ultrasound so you can see them?

704
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:22,184
I was sure they were...

705
00:30:27,663 --> 00:30:29,199
That's perfectly normal.

706
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:33,074
You just went through
a major surgery.

707
00:30:35,412 --> 00:30:37,348
It's not only that.

708
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:38,852
It's like...

709
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:40,188
All these

710
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:44,763
shadows are hiding
that I never saw before,

711
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,804
all these things that
can go wrong and...

712
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:49,338
and destroy you

713
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:53,346
and there's nothing you
can do about any of it.

714
00:30:55,384 --> 00:31:00,663
I think that's just
called being a parent.

715
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:06,207
What am I doing?

716
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:10,648
I've thought more
about Burning Man

717
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,186
than becoming a mother.

718
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:18,632
What if I'm terrible at it?

719
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:20,300
What if...

720
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:23,909
what if I'm not
ready for this at all?

721
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:29,820
Well, the good news is,

722
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:32,491
you're not doing
any of it alone.

723
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:35,064
Hey.

724
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:38,471
I'm right here. For
anything you need.

725
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:40,643
Okay?

726
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:44,348
Okay.

727
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,127
My sister seems like
such a fearless, free spirit.

728
00:31:50,194 --> 00:31:52,332
And most of the time she is,

729
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:55,673
but just like everybody else,
she has a breaking point.

730
00:31:56,507 --> 00:31:57,910
So all the essential oils

731
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:00,048
and crystals I was
making fun of...

732
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:01,817
They're her way of coping.

733
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:03,788
She's terrified.

734
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,026
Of course she is.

735
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:09,165
All right, what does she need?

736
00:32:14,611 --> 00:32:18,852
- Head injury?
- Discharged. Just a minor concussion.

737
00:32:18,951 --> 00:32:20,221
How's Enrique?

738
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,027
Eh, stabilizing in the ICU.

739
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:24,897
Tough news.

740
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:26,200
It's very tough.

741
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:27,344
Well, you should
get to the polls.

742
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:29,707
That's one thing we can fix.

743
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:35,518
What?

744
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:39,358
It was good being in
the trenches with you.

745
00:32:40,729 --> 00:32:42,531
You, too.

746
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:45,171
So...

747
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,979
should I bring by
some Crispy Chuck's?

748
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:52,484
That sounds great.

749
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:20,643
How's he doing?

750
00:33:20,742 --> 00:33:22,646
Stabilizing.

751
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:27,589
I should have accounted
for the steroid treatments.

752
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:32,499
It was hard to see
clearly on this one.

753
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:36,507
MS is such a bastard.

754
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:41,884
You think you're on
a plateau and then...

755
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:43,622
it just crumbles.

756
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,595
Things are developing
all the time, Kit.

757
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:47,362
I know.

758
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:50,802
Randolph's been doing better.

759
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,573
But it's always there,

760
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,180
like a sword hanging
over our heads.

761
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,652
I think I'm handling it,

762
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:04,061
or at least compartmentalizing.

763
00:34:04,162 --> 00:34:07,737
But, apparently...

764
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:09,840
I'm scared.

765
00:34:13,914 --> 00:34:15,184
For what it's worth,

766
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:17,422
you do a really good job
of keeping that a secret.

767
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:21,396
I know.

768
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,643
There really is hope, you know?

769
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,527
Just the person
I was looking for.

770
00:34:53,628 --> 00:34:55,030
- Hey.
- I just wanted to check in,

771
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,233
make sure you're okay.

772
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,501
I'm fine. Why?

773
00:34:57,603 --> 00:35:00,240
The guy who lunged
at you in the ER?

774
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:02,311
Oh. Uh, that feels
like a lifetime ago.

775
00:35:02,378 --> 00:35:04,349
I'm fine. You're the
one who tackled him.

776
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:07,188
Turns out varenicline
was making him nuts.

777
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:09,092
Huh. That's...

778
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,228
oddly comforting?

779
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:12,733
I know, right?

780
00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:22,485
And also, uh...

781
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,759
I don't know how to say this.

782
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:30,702
You were Nic's best friend,

783
00:35:30,802 --> 00:35:32,907
so every time I see you,
it's like Nic's watching me

784
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,342
through you, or something.

785
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:35,689
I don't know. I know
that sounds weird.

786
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,349
Seriously, you
have to let that go.

787
00:35:37,414 --> 00:35:39,619
It makes me
second-guess everything.

788
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,489
Like...

789
00:35:43,094 --> 00:35:45,898
Would Nic approve
of me with Cade?

790
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:55,184
Like I said, I just
want you to be happy.

791
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:57,222
Whoever you're with.

792
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,494
So would Nic.

793
00:36:02,097 --> 00:36:04,936
Okay. Thank you. I just...

794
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:08,811
I just had to get
that off my chest.

795

I went through with Nic

796

better than anyone.

797

00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,778
And why
would you want to do that?

877
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:53,614
Back in Seattle, he
had this patient, Carmen.

878
00:40:53,715 --> 00:40:55,985
She had Edward's syndrome.

879
00:40:56,987 --> 00:41:00,896
So he operated on her maybe
six times over a few years.

880
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:03,000
She was an amazing kid.

881
00:41:03,132 --> 00:41:07,576
Everyone loved her, but
my dad got really attached.

882
00:41:09,012 --> 00:41:12,652
So when she died,
he took it hard.

883
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,525
Started drinking
too much and then...

884
00:41:18,965 --> 00:41:22,806
He started writing
himself prescriptions.

885
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:29,987
Was he addicted?

886
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:34,262
He always claimed
he had it under control.

887
00:41:34,362 --> 00:41:36,333
And he never hurt anyone.

888
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,202
You know, just himself.

889
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:44,081
So he operated
under the influence?

890
00:41:45,284 --> 00:41:46,820
I don't know.

891
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:49,927
It's possible.

892
00:41:50,561 --> 00:41:52,498
But then he quit.

893
00:41:52,532 --> 00:41:54,402
All on his own.

894
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:56,574
Cold turkey.

895
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,012
That was five years ago.

896
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,286
And ever since, I've
always been on the lookout

897
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,259
for any kind of sign.

898
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,186
What are you seeing?

899
00:42:21,757 --> 00:42:23,894
Maybe it's nothing.

900
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:29,005
But... the other day,
I saw him take a pill.

901
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,746
I don't know what
it was, I didn't ask.

902
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,186
And then today, he-he had
this bruise on his forehead, and...

903
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:39,626
He said it was nothing.
But he seemed jittery.

904
00:42:42,498 --> 00:42:45,639
Well...

905
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:48,076
I don't pretend to
know him like you do.

906
00:42:48,177 --> 00:42:49,847
But...

907
00:42:49,914 --> 00:42:52,452
if he is using
while he's working,

908
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:54,456
that's...

909
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,358
that's a problem.

910
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:59,065
To put it lightly.

911
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:03,306
I know.

912
00:43:05,443 --> 00:43:07,181
Come here.
