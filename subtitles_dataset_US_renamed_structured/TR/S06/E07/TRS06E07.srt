<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color="#fff840">"The Resident"...</font>

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,314
Governor Betz has got to be

3
00:00:03,398 --> 00:00:04,455
feeling the pressure
to meet with you.

4
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:06,699
- So far, no word.
- You're really worried about this.

5
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:08,384
<i>- You talked to your sister?
- You're worried?</i>

6
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,311
<i>- A little.
- She wanted this. She chose it.</i>

7
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:12,647
Did she understand
what she was choosing?

8
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,081
- Want to dance?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:18,516
<i>I'm grateful</i>

10
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,265
you're always there
for both of us.

11
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:21,765
I love you guys.

12
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:25,492
<i>Come and meet my hospice nurse.</i>

13
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:26,737
This is Jana ya.

14
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:28,487
She takes care
of dying folk like me.

15
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:29,998
I'm not just here
for your mother.

16
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:31,447
I'm here for you, too.

17
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:40,627
Which do you think is better...
Side-by-side stroller

18
00:00:40,712 --> 00:00:42,905
or front-to-back
Splash Mountain style?

19
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:46,174
Side-to-side doesn't come
in fire engine red,

20
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,655
and I'm not about to be
strolling through Piedmont Park

21
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,239
in pumpkin spice orange.

22
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:53,330
Is the stroller for you,
or is it for the twins?

23
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:57,510
Hey, if I'm spending what I'm
spending on a glorified wagon,

24
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:59,736
don't I deserve the color
of my choosing?

25
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,627
Ah.

26
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:06,916
This next chapter looks good
on you, AJ.

27
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,150
Thank you, my brother.

28
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:11,642
And what about
your next chapter?

29
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:14,674
What's the status
with you and Cade?

30
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,395
We're having fun.

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,619
She's... really great.

32
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,725
Hmm.
You know, it's funny.

33
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:27,288
I thought you and Billie
would end up together.

34
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,565
But I adjusted

35
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:31,838
and I told myself I was wrong.

36
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:35,869
But then I saw you and Billie
dancing at the wedding.

37
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:41,562
Cade wanted
to be at the wedding.

38
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:44,147
- She just had to work.
- Ah.

39
00:01:44,424 --> 00:01:47,369
Yeah, that explains everything.

40
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:56,956
I've practiced medicine
in many places,

41
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,658
but never in a place like this.

42
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,094
Closest I got was residency.

43
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:03,603
Our ER had a jail ward.

44
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:06,736
Challenging, pretty rewarding.

45
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:08,830
Hey.

46
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:11,228
Jana ya.

47
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:13,395
Hey.

48
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:15,771
- Hey.
- Oh.

49
00:02:15,954 --> 00:02:19,064
Thank you so much
for agreeing to see Bobby.

50
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:20,846
You have no idea
how much this means to me.

51
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:22,444
They aren't taking
his symptoms seriously,

52
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:23,962
and I had nowhere else to turn.

53
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:26,791
Well, prison clinics are
notoriously short-staffed,

54
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,800
and sadly,
the people they house...

55
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:30,551
They aren't top priority.

56
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:32,604
What kind of symptoms
is he having?

57
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,292
Well, he was in terrible pain
during visiting hours.

58
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:37,933
They won't let me examine him,
so I don't know what's going on.

59
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:38,900
How come they won't let you

60
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,829
- help your own brother?
- Only outside

61
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:43,424
specialists like you guys
are allowed to.

62
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,533
And just so you know,
Bobby was convicted

63
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:48,127
of something that he didn't do.

64
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:51,024
Now he's alone on death row.

65
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:53,049
He doesn't deserve this.

66
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,640
Yeah. We will make sure

67
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:57,765
that Bobby gets the care
he needs, right?

68
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:01,055
We're gonna figure out
what's going on.

69
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,046
Thank you.

70
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:12,368
Once they're asleep,
go for a walk

71
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:14,765
or take that yoga class
in the park.

72
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:17,453
I know, Padma,
but that's why AJ hired Serena,

73
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:19,231
so you can have time
for yourself.

74
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,914
All right, okay.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

75
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,493
Still doesn't want to let them
out of her sight?

76
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:24,395
Apparently not.

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,920
Doesn't she trust
the new babysitter?

78
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,047
No, it's more than that.

79
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:29,718
She can't relax with them
or without them.

80
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,443
I wish she wasn't so alone.

81
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,547
AJ's been amazing,
but at the end of the day

82
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:34,829
they're not a couple, you know?

83
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:36,563
Look, Padma is strong.

84
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:37,867
Having two kids is a lot.

85
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,172
She just needs some time.
She's going to be okay.

86
00:03:40,257 --> 00:03:41,577
- I know, let's hope.
- All right?

87
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,733
Everyone looks amazing.

88
00:03:44,906 --> 00:03:46,438
Such a beautiful wedding.

89
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:48,282
Not gonna lie,
you really missed out.

90
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:49,403
Who's that?

91
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:52,008
That is Bell's stepson Jake.

92
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:53,086
He's awesome.

93
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:56,006
He's a plastic surgeon,
has an amazing voice.

94
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,312
He asked me to accompany him,
but, uh,

95
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:00,044
I just didn't feel like it.

96
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:01,664
- Right.
- No, I didn't.

97
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:05,117
Aw, look at their dresses.

98
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:06,578
They're so adorable.

99
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,288
Mm-hmm.

100
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:12,297
That is not what it looks like.

101
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:13,717
Everyone was dancing together.

102
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:15,835
Hell, I also danced with Conrad.

103
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,485
And he looked at you like that?

104
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:21,389
Mm-hmm.

105
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:33,085
I've known Bobby for ten years.

106
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:35,758
He's one of my favorites.

107
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,342
We play hoops, lift weights.

108
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:39,512
He's always asking me
about my kids,

109
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:40,789
telling me the crazy things
he learns about

110
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:42,827
in those books he reads.

111
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:45,085
But he also killed a woman
for her wallet.

112
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,804
Smashed her with a brick
until her brain exploded.

113
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,225
Everyone in here deserves
decent medical care.

114
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,028
So do your best in ten minutes.

115
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,783
Hey, Bobby,
you've got visitors.

116
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:08,294
I'm Dr. Austin,
and this here is Dr. Hawkins.

117
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,342
We're here to examine you.

118
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:12,639
I've examined him,
I know what's wrong.

119
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,100
He's got a case
of "desperate for a field trip."

120
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:21,421
Jana ya asked us to see you.

121
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,327
Hey, man, your sister

122
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:28,499
was my rock
when my mother was dying.

123
00:05:29,436 --> 00:05:31,143
She was our hospice nurse.

124
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:32,741
And I'm telling you,
I don't know

125
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:35,085
how I would have managed
without her.

126
00:05:37,014 --> 00:05:38,902
You and me both.

127
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,553
She's taken care of me
my entire life.

128
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:46,944
Now she's stuck
visiting me here.

129
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:52,225
People cut her when they hear
her brother's a killer.

130
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:56,405
Her reward for being the only
one left who believes in me.

131
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:00,753
What the...?

132
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:02,717
Grand mal seizure.

133
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:04,711
Protect his airway.
Protect his airway.

134
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:07,288
You, call 911, now!

135
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:39,687
I want to believe Governor Betz
called this private meeting

136
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:40,882
because he's ready to listen.

137
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:44,392
What he's thinking about is his
rich donors who want a tax cut.

138
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:48,554
Randolph, we're not gonna get
anywhere by attacking him.

139
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:51,889
- He holds the power over Chastain's future.
- Okay.

140
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:54,514
If we do this right,
we enter as enemies

141
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:57,202
and leave with the governor
on our side.

142
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,296
- Let me do the talking.
- Okay.

143
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:01,467
All you see here is
the CEO's arm candy.

144
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:08,909
The intense pain comes and goes.

145
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:11,212
So you're on vacation?

146
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:12,585
The trip of a lifetime.

147
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:14,210
We saved our money for ages

148
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:15,597
so we could take a year off
from the Tate.

149
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,515
- That's where we work.
- And travel the world.

150
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,033
Camping out, cheap hostels,

151
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:21,546
- railway passes made it all possible.
- Yeah.

152
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,518
So when did
your stomach start hurting?

153
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:26,719
It was about two weeks ago?
Yeah?

154
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,836
Ibuprofen did the trick
for a bit, till it didn't.

155
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:31,772
So your blood pressure
is slightly low,

156
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:33,108
and your heart rate is high.

157
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:35,768
Why haven't you seen a doctor?

158
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:39,896
In this country?

159
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,331
Yeah, we can't afford it.

160
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,361
I only came now
'cause I thought I was dying.

161
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:47,455
We wanted to wait
until we got home to the NHS...

162
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,867
Our National Health Service,
which is entirely free.

163
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:53,452
You know, we complain about
waiting a bit in England,

164
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,264
but if we had to pay
actual money to see a doctor,

165
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:57,749
there'd be bodies
in the streets.

166
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,000
Corpses in the canals.

167
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,129
Cadavers in the...

168
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:02,961
Um, castles?

169
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:08,288
It bloody kills!

170
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,901
- Wh-Where am I?
- Bobby,

171
00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:36,625
you passed out at the prison.

172
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,781
You're at Chastain Park
Memorial Hospital,

173
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,906
and we're going to take care
of you here, all right?

174
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,171
- Bay 12.
- Bobby Purcell.

175
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,132
He's an inmate
at the Georgia State Prison.

176
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:48,841
He's presenting
with acute onset hemiplegia

177
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,093
after having a seizure.

178
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,499
His sats and BP are low.

179
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:57,090
- He aspirated, as well.
- Let's load him with AEDs.

180
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:58,733
You go ahead.

181
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:00,526
I paged Billie
for a code stroke.

182
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:05,506
- What do you need?
- I'm concerned about stroke,

183
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:06,894
seizure
and aspiration pneumonitis.

184
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,320
And time of symptoms onset?

185
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:11,072
- Uh, 30 minutes.
- He's still in the window for TPA.

186
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:13,583
- Page me when you get a head CT.
- Okay.

187
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,687
His sats are improving.

188
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:23,358
Yeah, looks like we can hold
on intubation for now.

189
00:09:23,526 --> 00:09:26,037
Let's order a full panel
and a tox screen

190
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:28,271
so we can figure out
exactly what's going on.

191
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:30,454
Push, push, push. Good.

192
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,626
- Jana ya.
- Bobby, hold on. I'm here.

193
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,954
- Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
- How is he?

194
00:09:35,038 --> 00:09:36,149
Better but still unstable.

195
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:38,657
- Let-let me know what I can do.
- Yeah. We'll come get you

196
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:40,923
- after we get a head CT, okay?
- Hey.

197
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,687
Let's get you settled
in the waiting room, all right?

198
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:51,854
You couldn't be
more prepared if you tried.

199
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:53,845
There's so much riding on this.

200
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,764
If Betz slashes our budget,

201
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,824
- we'll be a third-rate hospital.
- Right this way.

202
00:09:57,908 --> 00:10:00,592
All the hard work we've done to
make Chastain a great facility

203
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:02,639
that serves rich and poor alike
will be gone.

204
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:05,345
Kit, you got this.
It's a one-on-one. It's private.

205
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,009
It's low pressure.
It's a perfect scenario for you.

206
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:09,641
From your lips.

207
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,924
- Dr. Voss!
- Dr. Voss! - Dr. Voss!

208
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:13,902
- Dr. Voss, over here!
- Excuse me, Dr. Voss!

209
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:16,179
If we could just
ask a brief question, Doctor...

210
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,496
Anything to add, Governor?

211
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,765
- Dr. Voss!
- Excuse me, Kit.

212
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,674
Dr. Voss, welcome.

213
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:32,877
Thank you. I thought
this was a private meeting,

214
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:34,572
- not a media event.
- Oh.

215
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:36,107
I think it's good
to pull the curtain back

216
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:38,358
for the people of Georgia,
don't you?

217
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,852
And you are?

218
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,511
Randolph Bell,
a surgeon at Chastain.

219
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:44,321
One of our finest
and a former CEO.

220
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:46,415
Here to give you more
information about the effect

221
00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:48,351
of budget cuts
on our surgical floor.

222
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,610
Well, I'm glad
you could join us, Dr. Bell.

223
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,114
Here. Help yourselves.

224
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,633
There's coffee and tea.

225
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:56,595
I got rid
of the espresso machine.

226
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,479
It's not really my style.

227
00:10:58,564 --> 00:11:00,756
Well, I'm sure
we'll muddle through.

228
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,668
How's the pain now, Claire?

229
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:12,559
The pain comes and goes.

230
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:14,211
Maybe it was just a cramp.

231
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:17,907
Ah. Kidney stones, actually.

232
00:11:17,992 --> 00:11:20,383
They're some of the most painful
little things in the world.

233
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:22,236
But why aren't
the pain meds working?

234
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:24,080
The stones have become
too large,

235
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:25,360
and they're stuck
in the ureter.

236
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:28,428
And if we do not get rid of
them, you will feel a lot worse.

237
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:29,661
Hello.

238
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:32,078
Um, this is my colleague
Dr. Devi,

239
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,172
and I have discussed your case
with her.

240
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:37,022
Oh, I'm so sorry
you're going through this.

241
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:39,812
We are going to have to do

242
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:41,248
a procedure
to break up the stones

243
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:42,709
to make them easier to pass.

244
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:44,841
- Procedure?
- It's noninvasive.

245
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,526
You'll be out of here
shortly afterwards.

246
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,162
It'll still cost
an arm and a leg.

247
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,786
I'll wait till England.

248
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:53,547
Listen, it is dangerous to fly
with kidney stones this large.

249
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:54,951
You could have an attack,

250
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:57,044
and they'd have
to divert the flight.

251
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,709
Claire, you're suffering.

252
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,951
W-Whatever the cost,
we'll deal, yeah?

253
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,263
Even if it means
selling the car.

254
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:09,958
I think
we'll be selling the flat.

255
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,766
Baby brother.

256
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:25,294
- Jana ya.
- Are you okay?

257
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:27,566
Oh, I was so worried.

258
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,567
It was touch and go,
but these docs kept me kicking,

259
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:32,622
much to Leo's dismay.

260
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:34,708
- Glad you're okay, Bobby.
- Well,

261
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:36,561
- what do you think happened?
- His head CT

262
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:39,063
is negative for hemorrhage.
Start him on TPA?

263
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:42,058
I suspect you suffered
a transient ischemic attack.

264
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:43,650
What is that?

265
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:46,419
That's when parts of your brain
don't get enough blood.

266
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,302
Right, it's usually
temporary and resolves

267
00:12:48,386 --> 00:12:50,149
on its own, which is why you're
getting your strength back.

268
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:52,294
- But why did it happen?
- Mm.

269
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:53,934
That's the question
we're facing.

270
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,794
Bobby had leukemia as a child.

271
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,469
Our mom was always working.

272
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:02,036
Jana ya saw me through it,
cared for me,

273
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:04,654
even though
we were both just kids.

274
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,808
It was so long ago, but could
the leukemia be related?

275
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:12,011
We'll look into it. I want
to check your neck, all right?

276
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:14,606
It's all yours.

277
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:26,451
I hear a right-sided bruit.

278
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:30,386
Oh. That's when
there's some kind of obstruction

279
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:31,556
inside the artery in your neck.

280
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,140
Could be high-grade stenosis?

281
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:34,566
But that wouldn't
cause headaches.

282
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,316
It may be responsible
for the TIA.

283
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,839
Let's get an MRI and find out.

284
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:44,425
Governor, I know
you and I are both committed

285
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,644
to the same thing...

286
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:47,463
The well-being
of the people of Georgia.

287
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:50,317
But can I just say
I love your accent?

288
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:53,180
Is that inappropriate?

289
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,785
Where are you from?
I'm Georgia born and bred.

290
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:58,378
I've lived in
Atlanta for 40 years.

291
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,055
I care about the people here
as much as anyone.

292
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:04,473
I'm certain
a conscientious person

293
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:05,964
like yourself wants
to understand

294
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:08,956
the effect your budget cuts
will have on our patients.

295
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,068
Yeah, sometimes
we all need tough love.

296
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:13,886
I-I campaigned on lower taxes.

297
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:17,231
Chastain Park has got
to operate within its budget,

298
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,722
without help
from public funding.

299
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,824
But, Governor Betz,
we are a public hospital,

300
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:24,636
which means
we require public funding,

301
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,402
something Governor Randall
understood when she instituted

302
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,105
a sales tax
to help cover our expenses.

303
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:32,488
Well, that sales tax
must now foot the bill

304
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:34,128
for more pressing issues.

305
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:37,292
- More pressing than health care?
- Crime.

306
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:39,331
Crime is soaring.

307
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:42,847
We need more cops on the streets
to ensure law and order.

308
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:44,353
Well, you know, you're talking

309
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:47,175
about taking away
hundreds of millions of dollars

310
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,426
being used to save lives.

311
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:49,946
There's no way
Chastain will be able

312
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:52,222
to provide
the most basic level of care.

313
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,049
Well, for basic care,
you bill Medicare and Medicaid.

314
00:14:55,134 --> 00:14:56,785
I bet you know all about that.

315
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,730
Well, maybe not as much
as you do.

316
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,251
I mean, you made your fortune
running one

317
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:02,221
of the largest hospital groups
in the country.

318
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:04,582
Yes, and we maximized profits

319
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,385
without sacrificing
patient care.

320
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,378
Is that what you call
Medicare fraud these days?

321
00:15:08,463 --> 00:15:11,198
You billed for home health care
visits that never happened.

322
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:13,485
You subjected patients
to dangerous

323
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,510
and invasive procedures
they didn't remotely need,

324
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:19,197
overdosed people on chemo.
Medicare paid for all...

325
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:22,260
Just remind me, how much did you
scam the taxpayers for?

326
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:23,581
Wait. I remember.

327
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,401
- $1 billion.
- Lies. It's all lies.

328
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:29,026
All right, we're done here.

329
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,355
But it's in the public record
and deserves more attention.

330
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:32,799
All right, turn the cameras off.

331
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:34,800
No, in fact, your hospitals
committed the biggest

332
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:36,402
Medicare fraud in history.

333
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:38,952
They got caught
and had to pay a huge fine

334
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:41,714
while you walked away
with a $300 million parachute

335
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:44,983
that you used to finance
your campaign for governor.

336
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,036
<i>Governor, what do you
have to say about these allegations?</i>

337
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,786
I don't have
to put up with this.

338
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,534
But we're pulling back
the curtain, right?

339
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,721
That went well.

340
00:15:57,806 --> 00:16:00,276
That had to happen. Right?

341
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:02,970
Yeah.

342
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:09,783
Find me every ounce of dirt
on that Dr. Bell.

343
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:11,861
I'm gonna destroy him.

344
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,713
It's just hard to imagine

345
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:18,078
he committed this kind of crime,

346
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:24,326
but his DNA was all over
the scene and murder weapon.

347
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:28,329
It's not always easy to know
what people are really like.

348
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:30,714
What's that supposed to mean?

349
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,092
I saw Irving's photos
from the wedding.

350
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:38,696
And?

351
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,807
There's one of you

352
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:45,124
slow-dancing with Billie.

353
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:48,688
And the look on your face was...

354
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,311
It feels like
there's something between you.

355
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:56,057
We're friends, good friends.

356
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:58,251
Is that all?

357
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:03,079
We share something that's...

358
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:06,033
It's-it's hard to describe.

359
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:08,215
I guess...

360
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:11,193
it's a sense of what we lost.

361
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:14,003
That's it?

362
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,395
Yes.

363
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,534
Truth is important to me.

364
00:17:23,518 --> 00:17:25,259
Bobby's labs came back.

365
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,182
There's nothing remarkable.

366
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:30,127
Well, maybe
we'll find some answers here.

367
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,948
- Wow.
- Looks like a mass

368
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:39,699
traveling along his carotids
into the skull base.

369
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,800
A carotid body tumor.

370
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,696
I've never seen one
this extensive.

371
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,014
It's spread to his lymph nodes.

372
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,182
They're usually detected

373
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,357
early when people get
the proper care,

374
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:52,712
but now it's compressing
his vessels and cranial nerves.

375
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:54,652
That explains the TIA,
aspiration,

376
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:57,050
difficulty swallowing,
even his hoarse voice.

377
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:59,527
This would be an extremely
complicated resection.

378
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:02,799
The tumor is entangled with his
internal and external jugulars.

379
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:04,018
We'll have to talk to AJ,

380
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:06,207
but surgery could cause
irreparable disability,

381
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,720
- even death.
- We haven't even talked

382
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:11,230
about his execution
being scheduled for next year.

383
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,549
Does it make sense

384
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:15,476
to put him through something
this dangerous

385
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,062
and invasive right now?

386
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:20,589
He'll likely die before the
year is out without the surgery.

387
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:22,817
But recovery is long
and difficult

388
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,806
with months
of chemo and radiation.

389
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:27,082
It could ruin
the time he has left.

390
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,824
Surgery gives Bobby a chance
at a better life,

391
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:32,045
no matter how long.

392
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,254
Well, it's his choice to make.

393
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,971
Isn't it?

394
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:09,504
Thank you for meeting me,
Donald, on such short notice.

395
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:12,924
Yeah, sure. What can I do
for you, Governor?

396
00:19:13,076 --> 00:19:15,426
Well, Jerrod mentioned
we need some help.

397
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:19,439
And you are in a
perfect position to provide it.

398
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:22,049
I don't follow.

399
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:23,644
How long have you worked
at Chastain?

400
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:25,575
Not long.
Uh, this is my second week.

401
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:28,595
And have you had a chance to
work with Dr. Randolph Bell yet?

402
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,679
No. I-I hope to.

403
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:33,899
So, let's make that happen.

404
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:37,421
Does this have anything to do
with what happened this morning?

405
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:40,948
- 'Cause I saw the video...
- Well, let's just say

406
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:42,426
that there have been
some concerning reports

407
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,444
which put Dr. Bell's competency
in doubt.

408
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:46,603
Now, I'm sure, as a scrub tech,

409
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:48,363
patient safety is
your first priority.

410
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:52,285
I've only heard good things
about Dr. Bell.

411
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:54,444
I wish I could say the same
about you, Donald.

412
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:58,114
Jerrod filled me in on what
happened at Yates University.

413
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:04,128
How he helped that little mess
of yours go away.

414
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:07,307
For now.

415
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:13,188
What is it you need?

416
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:18,393
<i>They got caught
and had to pay a huge fine</i>

417
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:22,397
<i>while you just walked away with
a $300 million golden parachute</i>

418
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:25,510
<i>that you used to finance
your campaign for governor.</i>

419
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,494
Any calls or emails?

420
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:29,748
Letters laced with anthrax?
Not yet.

421
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:32,240
Dare we hope something good came
of that rant?

422
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:34,668
At least the problem's
in the public eye now.

423
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:37,153
Maybe Governor Betz
will feel the pressure.

424
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,159
No, you had him.

425
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:41,412
I just charged in there,
I'm sorry.

426
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:42,992
Couldn't stop myself.

427
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:44,651
You spoke from the heart.

428
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:46,440
There was never any chance

429
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,385
of winning the governor
to our side.

430
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:50,494
He brought me there
to humiliate me.

431
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:52,824
I'm proud you stood up to him.

432
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:54,863
And a little scared
of what may come at us next.

433
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:57,980
- Yeah, I really put my foot in it.
- All right, Attila.

434
00:20:58,065 --> 00:21:00,355
Don't you have an army
of kidney stones to conquer?

435
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,716
Yeah, I think
I can probably get that right.

436
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,757
Dr. Bell? Sorry to bother.

437
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:08,035
Uh, I'm the new scrub tech.
I just wanted to say

438
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,696
I look forward
to working with you in the OR.

439
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,276
- Great. What's your name?
- Uh, Donald Killian?

440
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:15,221
I look forward to working
with you also, Donald.

441
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:27,946
This is quite comfy.

442
00:21:28,526 --> 00:21:31,810
It feels like I ended up in
some weird science experiment.

443
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:34,261
So there you see
the kidney stones.

444
00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:36,372
And we position
the head of this machine

445
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:39,292
so that the crosshairs
are right above the stones.

446
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,068
How does it work?

447
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:42,793
Well, shock waves... they move

448
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:44,746
through the water, and
they break up the kidney stones.

449
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,498
2,000 shock waves, each
a fraction of a second long.

450
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:48,822
Shattering them into fragments,

451
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:50,331
which will then pass
on their own.

452
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:53,321
Ah, the NHS might be free,

453
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,141
but these American gizmos

454
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,316
might be worth the price
of admission.

455
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,512
Well, spending big on technology

456
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:03,157
does have
the occasional benefit.

457
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:10,515
Our uncle
died of something similar.

458
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,351
Bobby, I'm so sorry.

459
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:14,435
I should have caught this.

460
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,262
Carotid body tumors
are very rare.

461
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:18,847
And Bobby had a constellation
of symptoms.

462
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:21,442
This isn't on you.

463
00:22:22,352 --> 00:22:23,852
How long do I have?

464
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:27,948
Given where the cancer
has spread, a few months

465
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:30,617
if left untreated.

466
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:32,704
Surgery and chemo
could buy you some time,

467
00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:34,706
but it's complicated.

468
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:37,752
Side effects, huge risks.

469
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,021
I appreciate the efforts

470
00:22:43,114 --> 00:22:45,023
and care.

471
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:48,772
It means a lot to me.

472
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,196
But I'm done here.

473
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:54,296
Don't say that.

474
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:57,062
I live alone in a cage
for a crime I didn't commit.

475
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:59,973
We're gonna keep fighting
to prove your innocence.

476
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:03,558
I gave up on that long ago.

477
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:06,561
Now we move on.

478
00:23:06,728 --> 00:23:08,294
Both of us.

479
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:11,971
I won't suffer anymore,

480
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:15,097
and you'll be free
of the brother who shamed you.

481
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:17,488
I have never been ashamed
of you.

482
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:20,919
This is a blessing
and a relief in some ways.

483
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:25,839
Ending it all soon
is a welcome way out.

484
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,677
I am so sorry.

485
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:39,261
He didn't kill her.

486
00:23:40,706 --> 00:23:43,424
- The DNA evidence...
- Yeah, I know.

487
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:44,943
Case closed.

488
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:48,195
But I will never believe
it's right.

489
00:23:49,714 --> 00:23:51,116
You mentioned earlier

490
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,807
that your uncle died
of something similar?

491
00:23:57,114 --> 00:24:00,222
Um, a neuroendocrine tumor.

492
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:02,957
Seems like cancer runs
through our family.

493
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,286
Have you been tested?

494
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,293
No, I haven't had symptoms,
so I never thought to go there.

495
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:10,824
We can run a genetic test on
you and Bobby, cross-reference

496
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:15,332
the disease markers,
and if they match...

497
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:18,784
Keep an eye on you,
we can catch anything early.

498
00:24:22,823 --> 00:24:25,247
Yeah. At least
something positive can come

499
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:27,123
- from all of this.
- Yeah.

500
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,004
As soon as she feels better,

501
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,879
and she will soon,
you can get out of here.

502
00:24:43,964 --> 00:24:46,671
But have her stay hydrated for
the remainder of your travels.

503
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:48,535
I'll make sure of that.
This has been one part

504
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:51,042
of our adventures that will not
make the photo album.

505
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:52,487
- Mm-hmm.
- Hello.

506
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:55,425
Dr. Pravesh tells me
you reside in England.

507
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,028
- Oh, yeah.
- How is our soggy little island?

508
00:24:57,112 --> 00:25:00,221
Oh, thanks to global warming,
less soggy than you remember.

509
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:02,762
This is my wife
and our CEO, Dr. Voss.

510
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:06,665
And I told Dr. Voss about your
anxieties over American billing.

511
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:08,257
Have a look.

512
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,733
My team spoke
with your insurance, and

513
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:14,347
- it looks like they'll cover the majority of it.
- Wow.

514
00:25:14,432 --> 00:25:15,891
This is an incredible relief.

515
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,374
Thank you.

516
00:25:18,405 --> 00:25:21,632
Oh, excuse me. Hello.

517
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:26,119
She's become more hypotensive
with a low-grade fever,

518
00:25:26,204 --> 00:25:27,520
and she's sweaty.

519
00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:29,381
- Looks like an underlying infection.
- Or sepsis.

520
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:30,856
Could be a number of things.

521
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:33,726
- Everything okay?
- Aziz,

522
00:25:33,811 --> 00:25:36,054
c-can you get me some water?

523
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:39,202
There seems to be
a complication, something new.

524
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,969
Claire, we're going
to get you on more fluids.

525
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:42,944
We're gonna start
you on antibiotics and send off

526
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:46,732
a set of cultures just
to figure out what's going on.

527
00:25:58,163 --> 00:25:59,522
If I ever caught you looking

528
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:01,334
at Nolan like that,
I'd spontaneously...

529
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:02,577
- Nolan?
- No?

530
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:04,874
Oh, really?
That's where your mind goes?

531
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,908
- I don't know. Dr. Paul Chu?
- Hmm.

532
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,327
George Clooney in his<i> ER</i> days.

533
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:11,397
- That's more of my sweet spot.
- Oh. Touché.

534
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,203
Jessica. Just
who I was looking for.

535
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:14,468
- Donald, hi.
- Hi.

536
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:16,569
Oh, Irving,
this is Donald Killian.

537
00:26:16,654 --> 00:26:18,538
He's been making my life
so much easier

538
00:26:18,623 --> 00:26:20,430
- since he joined the team.
- Happy to hear that.

539
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:22,434
- Keep up the great work.
- Thank you. -

540
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:27,358
You know, I haven't had a chance
to work in Dr. Bell's OR yet.

541
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:29,039
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'd love the opportunity.

542
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:30,890
I see you're scheduled with him
tomorrow, and...

543
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:32,776
Yeah, Dr. Bell's
pretty particular.

544
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:34,279
He's kind of a creature
of habit.

545
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,140
- Have you worked with Dr. Sutton?
- No.

546
00:26:37,225 --> 00:26:38,665
She's lovely to assist.

547
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,108
I can arrange that.

548
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:42,528
Yeah, okay. Um,

549
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:45,188
you know,
if you're ever busy or tired,

550
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:46,958
you keep me in mind
for Dr. Bell's cases, too?

551
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:50,419
Yeah, sure. Uh, how about we go
check out Dr. Sutton's schedule?

552
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:57,217
I hear you've got
quite the photo collection.

553
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,396
It seems that way. Uh...

554
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:04,230
I hope I didn't get you
in trouble.

555
00:27:07,547 --> 00:27:10,807
I always thought there might
be something between you two.

556
00:27:11,912 --> 00:27:14,342
Billie was Nic's best friend.

557
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:17,979
Which explains what exactly?

558
00:27:18,073 --> 00:27:21,390
You know, it's possible for us

559
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:25,601
to care about each other
and be friends without...

560
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:29,307
- Benefits?
- Dr. Feldman?

561
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,896
Discharge papers
for your patient in Bay 11.

562
00:27:32,146 --> 00:27:34,612
Just in time.
Thank you very much.

563
00:27:36,701 --> 00:27:38,007
You okay?

564
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:40,257
What were you looking at?

565
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,745
Ah, just photos
from the wedding.

566
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:45,963
Well, it was a lovely wedding.

567
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:49,144
And dance.

568
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:53,569
I woke up a little confused.

569
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:57,360
Yeah, I'm confused, too.

570
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:02,774
Well, you seem really happy
with Cade.

571
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:05,487
Am I wrong?

572
00:28:05,572 --> 00:28:07,564
Are you happy?

573
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:10,158
Yeah, we're happy.

574
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:16,564
Then I'm not confused.

575
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,252
I got to go.

576
00:28:31,303 --> 00:28:33,536
I want you to be happy.

577
00:28:41,264 --> 00:28:44,858
Hey, uh, Dr. Hawkins, yeah?
James Yamada.

578
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:46,584
I look forward
to working together.

579
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:48,586
See if the man lives up
to the legend.

580
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:51,013
Oh, hope I don't disappoint.

581
00:28:56,995 --> 00:28:59,253
I've got great news,
Chief Sutton.

582
00:28:59,347 --> 00:29:01,773
That killer place where
all the chefs go after work?

583
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,768
I scored reservations.

584
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:06,528
It's harder to get than tickets
to the Super Bowl.

585
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:13,045
Oh, um... well, unfortunately
I'm working late, so...

586
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:14,983
It doesn't open until 10:30.

587
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:18,197
Look, they have this, uh,
Spanish octopus with jalapeño.

588
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,451
I know it sounds kind of weird,
but it's... it's incredible.

589
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:24,264
Oh, and a-a drink
called Vieux Carré with...

590
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:32,722
Unless I'm overstepping
and there's someone else.

591
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:34,973
- Is it Hawkins?
- I'd love to go.

592
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,308
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

593
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,202
Okay.

594
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:42,397
- Great.
- See you later.

595
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:48,878
- This is incredible.
- Wild.

596
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:50,229
What did you find?

597
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:51,816
Brother, you are not going
to believe this.

598
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,992
I thought
it was a contaminated sample,

599
00:29:54,077 --> 00:29:56,269
so I ran his genetic test again.

600
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,421
Oh, my God. Bobby has chimerism.

601
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:06,663
That's right. Two sets of DNA
as if he's two different people.

602
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:09,217
- I never thought I'd see a case of this.
- You and me both.

603
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:11,546
Only a hundred cases
have ever been recorded.

604
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:13,753
Bobby was convicted
with DNA evidence.

605
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:16,897
- DNA that may not have been his.
- Jana ya might be right.

606
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,090
He could be an innocent man.

607
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:25,834
Like<i> the</i> chimera,

608
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,202
the mythical beast with
the lion's head, goat's body,

609
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,749
and serpent's tail,
except in your case

610
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:33,514
- it is not a myth.
- In medicine,

611
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,450
chimera refers
to having two sets of DNA.

612
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:36,869
How's that possible?

613
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,913
Did you have
a bone marrow transplant

614
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,303
to treat your leukemia?

615
00:30:41,443 --> 00:30:43,515
- Yeah, I did.
- When he was ten.

616
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,147
My childhood friend
was my donor.

617
00:30:46,232 --> 00:30:48,521
- He saved my life.
- Well, it's quite possible

618
00:30:48,606 --> 00:30:51,163
that your childhood friend
committed a murder,

619
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:52,413
and you took the fall.

620
00:30:52,498 --> 00:30:54,719
Bobby, you
must have acquired his DNA

621
00:30:54,804 --> 00:30:58,414
when his bone marrow started
making blood cells in your body.

622
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:00,959
Cells which have his DNA.

623
00:31:01,217 --> 00:31:06,305
So it was Martin's DNA found
at the crime scene, not Bobby's?

624
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,029
Yeah.

625
00:31:11,387 --> 00:31:14,572
For 15 years
I dreamed of a miracle.

626
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:20,078
But this...

627
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:23,057
Do you know where Martin is?

628
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:25,835
In prison

629
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:28,336
for armed robbery.

630
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:34,765
We are going to appeal and win

631
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,678
and get your life back, Robert.

632
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:38,912
But is there time?

633
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:42,158
If we do the surgery,
it's possible.

634
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:44,978
Then I'll do it.

635
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,706
Please.

636
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:51,809
Save my life.

637
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:03,312
It hurts!

638
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,049
Claire, hang in there.
We're taking you to surgery.

639
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,225
Her pain is getting worse.
What is happening?

640
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,652
We'll know more in the OR.

641
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:12,447
We think it has something
to do with her infection.

642
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,624
Repeat labs just came back.
Lactate is sky-high.

643
00:32:14,775 --> 00:32:17,027
Cultures show florid gram
negative bacteremia.

644
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:18,862
The antibiotics aren't working.
She's in refractory shock.

645
00:32:18,946 --> 00:32:21,689
Well, that's probably what's
causing her acute abdomen.

646
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:23,366
- We have to hurry.
- We got her from here.

647
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,794
I'm waiting for you, Claire.

648
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:27,970
I love you so much.

649
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:32,433
Let's find you a place
to sit, okay?

650
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,019
Come on.

651
00:32:43,988 --> 00:32:47,132
Looks like I got my wish
sooner than I thought.

652
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,909
No offense,
but I asked for Jessica.

653
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:51,786
I know,
but she's tied up in OR Four.

654
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:57,074
- I promise to do my very best.
- Your name again?

655
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,994
Donald.

656
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:01,754
This is a tough one.
You better keep up.

657
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,015
Hope the damage isn't too bad.

658
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,155
Me, too. We just told her
she'd be leaving here soon.

659
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:17,340
Retractors.

660
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:28,357
- Dead bowel. She's ischemic already.
- How the hell

661
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:30,343
did that happen so quickly?

662
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:32,010
- Pressure's dropping fast.
- She's too sick.

663
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,139
- We don't have that much time.
- We're gonna have to do

664
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:35,831
a colonic resection.
Stapler to me.

665
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:53,299
You heard
about Bobby's chimerism?

666
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:55,686
Dr. Austin told me.

667
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:58,733
- I can't believe it.
- Nah, it's unbelievable.

668
00:33:58,818 --> 00:34:01,330
He survives this surgery,
he clears his name.

669
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:10,965
You said
the truth was important to you.

670
00:34:11,487 --> 00:34:13,913
What did you mean by that?

671
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:16,460
Losing Nic crushed me.

672
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:18,296
I'm just...

673
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:23,104
doing my best
to figure out things as I go.

674
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,238
I get that.

675
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,344
I think we both have
to be honest with each other.

676
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,587
And transparent.

677
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,097
I have been,
and I totally agree.

678
00:34:36,548 --> 00:34:38,417
<i>I see the tumor
eroding into the lumen</i>

679
00:34:38,502 --> 00:34:40,335
<i>- of the carotid artery.
- It's also</i>

680
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,315
invaded
into the intracranial space.

681
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,591
This tumor is way more extensive
than we expected.

682
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:49,573
<i>Don't tell me it's inoperable.</i>

683
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:51,627
It might be.

684
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,275
Wait.

685
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:57,269
Let's try and debulk
as much of the tumor as we can

686
00:34:57,354 --> 00:34:59,752
- and reconstruct the carotid artery.
- To do all that,

687
00:34:59,837 --> 00:35:02,425
we'd have to stop the blood flow
to the brain.

688
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,644
And finish everything

689
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:06,011
in 20 minutes,
or else risk a fatal stroke.

690
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:07,871
Sounds impossible.

691
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,183
Bobby was given a second chance.

692
00:35:10,268 --> 00:35:12,109
We have to give it a shot.

693
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:14,267
Clamping.

694
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:18,224
Time starts...

695
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:20,477
...now.

696
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,558
Hey.

697
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:39,328
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

698
00:35:42,097 --> 00:35:44,206
How you holding up?

699
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,878
Nauseous, a little numb.

700
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,750
How bad is this?

701
00:35:55,034 --> 00:35:57,996
The doctors are working
very hard, but it's serious.

702
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,338
I wish I had better news.

703
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:05,752
If she doesn't make it...

704
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:09,484
...I'm not sure I will either.

705
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,356
<i>- Hey, what's the update?</i>
- Still working

706
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,911
- on the anastomosis.
- We had to remove

707
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:25,909
more of the bowel.

708
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:28,114
It's taking longer than expected.

709
00:36:28,384 --> 00:36:29,769
V fib! She's coding!

710
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,440
- I'm starting compressions!
- Prepare to shock!

711
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,040
On it.

712
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:40,799
Clear!

713
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:46,706
- Again!
- Charging! Clear.

714
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,018
This tumor
is too damn hypervascular.

715
00:36:53,103 --> 00:36:54,228
I can't see a thing.

716
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,696
Increase suction.

717
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:57,260
Hang another unit.

718
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:59,784
They still have
to do a carotid reconstruction.

719
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:02,152
If they don't,
Bobby could end up brain-dead.

720
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:03,997
But if they continue...

721
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:07,018
Brain death versus fatal stroke.

722
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:08,650
<i>We're not going to make it.</i>

723
00:37:08,735 --> 00:37:11,126
It was impossible to begin with.

724
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:13,030
Let's try COOL AID.

725
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:14,283
I'm not sure

726
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,852
a therapeutic hypothermia alone
is going to cut it.

727
00:37:17,923 --> 00:37:22,765
<i>What if we couple it with
systemic induced hypertension?</i>

728
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,804
<i>Plus an infusion of Ketamine.
That could buy more time.</i>

729
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:30,932
So we make him sicker
to make him better?

730
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:34,017
I love when a medical
and surgical mind meld.

731
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,852
Let's start reconstruction.

732
00:37:35,947 --> 00:37:37,187
Four of pro line to me.

733
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,773
Activate
Triple Neuroprotection.

734
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,315
Prepare the infusion.
Get cooling blankets,

735
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,674
ice packs, alcohol rubs.

736
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:44,790
Anything that can bring
his temperature way down.

737
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:46,759
Let's move.

738
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:20,848
Mr. Has an?

739
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:24,940
Despite our best efforts,
we were unable...

740
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:51,087
What happened?

741
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:55,587
She developed ischemic bowel
in the setting of shock,

742
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,940
and in the OR,
just too much was necrotic.

743
00:38:59,025 --> 00:39:01,128
She must have already been sick,
and no one recognized it.

744
00:39:01,212 --> 00:39:03,065
And maybe
when she first came in,

745
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,494
the tachycardia, which we
thought was due to her pain...

746
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:07,433
Or the slightly low blood
pressure, which we thought was

747
00:39:07,517 --> 00:39:08,424
because she hadn't had
anything to drink.

748
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,682
It was sepsis all along.

749
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,111
And by the time we gave
antibiotics, it was too late.

750
00:39:13,196 --> 00:39:16,190
The kidney stones must have
masked the earlier signs.

751
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:18,174
Which progressed
into an acute abdomen

752
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:19,807
- needing surgery.
- It was my fault. I...

753
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,509
I should have seen
the signs earlier.

754
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:25,962
Even if you had, it would
probably have been too late.

755
00:39:27,212 --> 00:39:30,143
Claire avoided American
health care because of the cost,

756
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:32,061
and it killed her.

757
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:27,650
How are you feeling?

758
00:40:29,423 --> 00:40:33,615
Still here... thanks to you.

759
00:40:34,454 --> 00:40:37,835
And my voice...
It's back to normal.

760
00:40:39,077 --> 00:40:40,835
I have more good news.

761
00:40:41,532 --> 00:40:45,532
Rebecca's already working
on a petition for a new hearing.

762
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:49,480
So she can present
the new evidence to the judge?

763
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:54,351
I look forward to hanging out
with you on the outside, Bobby.

764
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:06,565
Well, that outcome was better
than we had any right to expect.

765
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,104
Patients pull off miracles

766
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:09,301
when you give them
a reason to live.

767
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:10,567
And now he has a good one.

768
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,143
Yeah, but the wheels
of justice are slow,

769
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:15,013
and his expiration date
is short.

770
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:18,433
Well, we gave him some time.
There's hope.

771
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:22,307
Spontaneous Triple
Neuroprotection in the field?

772
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:24,994
Dr. Sutton,
you are quite the powerhouse.

773
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,751
Oh, it was a team effort,
but you're not wrong.

774
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:32,080
Hey, I was thinking
maybe we could grab a drink

775
00:41:32,165 --> 00:41:35,048
at the tiki bar first before
hitting up the restaurant?

776
00:41:35,337 --> 00:41:36,726
That sounds like
just what I need.

777
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:40,722
Great. Uh, shall we?

778
00:41:42,048 --> 00:41:43,314
See you tomorrow?

779
00:41:43,454 --> 00:41:46,896
Yeah. Have a good time.
You deserve it.

780
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,408
Who's the new guy?

781
00:41:49,493 --> 00:41:53,720
Just met the dude.
James, uh, Yamada,

782
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:55,714
interventional cardiologist
from Boston.

783
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:59,002
Oh, so he specializes
in placing stents?

784
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:01,643
Apparently he did
a thousand of them last year.

785
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:06,190
Whoa. At $13,000
per procedure. Wow.

786
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,584
That explains the brand-new
red Porsche in the parking lot.

787
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:11,846
You're cool with them together?

788
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:13,329
Eh, she can do better.

789
00:42:15,103 --> 00:42:17,675
No doubt. Look,
I just want her to be happy.

790
00:42:18,376 --> 00:42:19,510
Me, too.

791
00:42:28,444 --> 00:42:29,504
He missed it.

792
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:33,030
She got worse
and died on the table.

793
00:42:33,421 --> 00:42:35,693
Oh, you really think
there's enough for a lawsuit?

794
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:37,609
Yeah, no doubt about it.

795
00:42:37,694 --> 00:42:39,164
Well, it sounds to me

796
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:41,199
like there's a lot more
where that came from.

797
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,709
I asked around.

798
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:46,241
Um, Dr. Bell seems to have
some skeletons in his closet.

799
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:49,710
What kind of skeletons?

800
00:42:50,014 --> 00:42:52,203
It might take me a little while
to find out.

801
00:42:52,288 --> 00:42:55,048
They don't tell the new guy
their secrets right away.

802
00:42:56,485 --> 00:43:00,221
Well, we will take
whatever you can get, Donald.

803
00:43:14,484 --> 00:43:16,780
Bell, you picked
the wrong enemy.
