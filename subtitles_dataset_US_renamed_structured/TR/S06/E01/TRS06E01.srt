As you know, Dr. Sullivan,

140
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:04,685
pancreatic cancer
is usually fatal.

141
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,170
But your tumor was operable,

142
00:07:06,194 --> 00:07:07,302
your nodes were clear

143
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:09,971
and there's no evidence
of metastasis.

144
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:11,305
But there could still be

145
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,360
residual cancer cells
that no test can see.

146
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:17,036
Yes, but you've had post surgical
chemo and radiation,

147
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:19,721
uh, you haven't
developed diabetes,

148
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:21,815
your weight is good, so I think

149
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:23,963
that, for
the foreseeable future,

150
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:25,487
you're all clear.

151
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:29,214
This couldn't
be better news, Dad.

152
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:32,096
You missed
the best reason I have for hope.

153
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,714
I have a great support system
right here.

154
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:35,975
Well, there's nothing

155
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,079
I can prescribe
that's better than that.

156
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,334
Thank you.

157
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,413
I love your barbecue ribs,

158
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,228
but they aren't worth this, Ciara.

159
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:50,345

168

- Ataxic gait.
- Slight confusion.

This is the second time
we've treated her in a month.

170

It's time we talk about

171
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:26,956
Sorry, my friend,

172
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,918
but we have a few more things
to check out.

173
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,543
What? Um...

174
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:31,612
Let's go.

175
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:35,091
We should get Billie on board
for a neuro exam.

176
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,615
Mm, that won't be necessary.

177

Chefs have

178
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:40,947
We should start

00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,437
Okay.

180
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:49,381
And this edema
in your legs... is this recent?

181
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,107
No, but it has gotten worse,

182
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,868
and she's been complaining
of headaches.

183
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,220
Maybe it's preeclampsia.

184
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:55,703
- What's that?
- It's a, uh,

185
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:58,486
a condition during pregnancy
that requires monitoring,

186
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,679
but it's manageable.

187
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,249
Thank you, Dr. Austin,

188
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,900
but I'm gonna dig a bit deeper
before I make a diagnosis.

189
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:06,144
Ah. Sure.

190
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:09,479
Uh, I see you missed
your last prenatal appointment.

191
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:10,575
You did what?

192
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:11,833
Padma.

193
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,003
I'm sorry, okay?

194
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,966
Oh, God, there's
just so many appointments,

195
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,817
and I didn't want
the ultrasound.

196
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:20,745
You know what, no one really
knows what those electronic

197
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,328
vibrations or whatever
do to tiny brains, so...

198
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:25,501
I'm going to be the bigger man
right now

199
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:27,682
and pretend
my head is not exploding.

200
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:30,094
Padma, you cannot

201
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:31,816
miss any medical tests
or appointments.

202
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,466
Twin pregnancies
often have complications.

203
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,760
It's dangerous
for you and the babies.

204
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,009
Let's take a look.

205
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:41,080
I promise
no brains will be harmed.

206
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,039
Okay.

207
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:52,852
Here's baby one.

208
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,447
Good size.

209
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:56,711
Look, he's waving at you.

210
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:01,216
And baby two

211
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,961
is...

212
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:05,562
Right here.

213
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,018
One is...

214
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,129
much bigger than the other.

215
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:12,070
I can see that.

216
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:13,804
What?

217
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,490
That... that can't be right.

218
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,491
It's fine. Deep breaths.

219
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,835
Their hearts
don't sound the same.

220
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:39,495
They're... they're identical.

221
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,159
Their-their hearts
should be identical.

222
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,499
What's going on?

223
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:45,836
I'm gonna go discuss this
ultrasound with Dr. Sullivan.

224
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:48,063
- What?
- I'll be right back.

225
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:53,610
♪ ♪

226
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:58,347
Who's the president right now?

227
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:02,035
Um, I don't really follow
politics, to tell you the truth.

228
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:04,613
I'm... I suffer
from fragile sanity.

229
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,039
Eh, take a guess.

230
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,267
Uh, I know
it's not Jimmy Carter.

231
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,876
Do I get a point for that?

232
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:11,264
No. No, I'm afraid not.

233
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:15,027
Oh, um, I forgot
to tell you, um...

234
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:17,552
lately, I've had the memory
of a goldfish

235
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:19,590
- with a drinking problem.
- Squeeze my hands. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

236
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,974
And I've been chalking it up
to not getting any sleep.

237
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,443
- Do you have insomnia?
- No.

238
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:26,436
I don't want to sleep
because of the nightmares.

239
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,273
- What kind of nightmares?
- Uh...

240
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:34,476
usually I'm trapped

241
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,644
in this water,

242
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,551
no sound.

243
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:53,123
Why didn't you page me
for a consult sooner?

244
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:53,995
We were waiting for

245
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:55,216
the tox screen to come back.

246
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,793
Then Ciara decompensated
rapidly.

247
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,720
It wasn't initially
clear it was neurological.

248
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:00,001
Conrad thought it was.

249
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,638
It's my bad.

250
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,636
We've got this
if you're needed in the ER.

251
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,605
- I hate to go. Keep me posted?
- Yeah.

252
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,264
- How's Gigi?
- The same.

253
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:21,764
She had another nightmare.

254
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:23,578
- Oh. I'm worried.
- Me too.

255
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,798
I know when I was alone
with her on Saturday,

256
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:27,288
she refused to nap.

257
00:12:27,438 --> 00:12:29,583
I tried to get her to talk
about the bad dreams

258
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:31,437
and what they're about,
but she wouldn't say.

259
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:33,628
Do you think this could
have anything to do

260
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:34,796
with Nic's death?

261
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:36,609
Yeah, maybe. It's possible.

262
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:40,042
But Gigi was a tiny baby
when Nic died. I mean,

263
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,687
she thinks of Nic
as her guardian angel

264
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:43,689
- looking out for her.
- Yeah, but trauma

265
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,213
can take years to manifest.

266
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,285
I don't know any other reason
why she'd be afraid.

267
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,884
Yeah, I mean, you control
her screens and play dates.

268
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:51,961
Turn off the news.

269
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:53,648
I protect her with my life.

270
00:13:01,307 --> 00:13:02,783
- Conrad.
- This is brutal,

271
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,051
seeing her like this.

272
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:09,312
I can't stop it. Can't help.

273
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:12,833
Fixing things like this
is supposed to be my job.

274
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:15,586
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

275
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:22,062
You're a great dad
and a great diagnostician.

276
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:24,564
You'll get to the bottom
of this.

277
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:26,471
Thank you.

278
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,270
I don't know what I'd do
without your support.

279
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:41,437
Okay, well, there's our problem.

280
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:44,105
Our talented chef has a mass
roughly the size of a marble

281
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:47,033
located between the temporal
lobe and the cerebellum.

282
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,404
- Causing all her symptoms.
- Yeah, we're gonna

283
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,014
have to operate
to figure out what it is.

284
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,927
It's dangerously situated
near the brain stem.

285
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,761
Let's get informed consent.

286
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:57,544
Yeah.

287
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,296
Thank you.

288
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,943
Wow. You've all done
an incredible job

289
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:12,301
with the resources we have.

290
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,447
Everybody has been working
around the clock

291
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:16,804
to meet our deadline
for the diabetes trial.

292
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,231
Well, thank you.

293
00:14:18,384 --> 00:14:20,787
As you know, clinical trials
are crucial, not just

294
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:23,171
for our patients, but for the
health of the hospital, too.

295
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:25,274
And there's
an election coming up.

296
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,219
We may get a new governor
who plans

297
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:30,135
to slash our budget
$200 million.

298
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:33,139
Imagine voting for someone
who attacks health care.

299
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:35,115
Yet he's polling to win.

300
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,078
Well, the steady stream
of clinical trials...

301
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:38,730
It'll help keep us solvent.

302
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,479
I can't pretend I don't wish

303
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:42,923
we had the kind of facilities
other labs offer.

304
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,076
Kit, I am confident
in what we created here,

305
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:48,072
and I know that we're gonna
get the job done.

306
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:52,767
It's Lewis Varner
from Varner Scientific,

307
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:55,413
- sponsor of our trial.
- Oh. Okay.

308
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:59,493
I'm so glad you called, Lewis.
I have great news.

309
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:03,443
The lab is up and running,
and we can't wait to start.

310
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:10,024
Uh, Lewis, this is a mistake.

311
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,787
Can we at least discuss it?

312
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:15,272
I see. Well, thank you

313
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,085
for letting me know
in a timely fashion.

314
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:18,937
I-If anything changes,

315
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,831
if there's anything
I can say or do, uh...

316
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,506
Yes. I hear you.

317
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,688
Well, good luck with everything.

318
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:30,356
What is it?

319
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,785
For this trial,
they've decided to partner

320
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,811
with Baltimore Advanced Sciences

321
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:38,939
because of their
superior facilities.

322
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:41,056
So they're cancelling our trial.

323
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,043
Yes. There will be
other trials, I hope.

324
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:45,711
I-I'm sure.

325
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:47,948
We have to talk
about this later.

326
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:49,525
I have to go. There's a

327
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,658
problem with Padma's pregnancy.

328
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:53,067
Oh, no. What is it?

329
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:54,912
I'm on my way to find out.

330
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,869
The ultrasound is diagnostic,
there is no doubt,

331
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:00,408
but I can help.

332
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:03,389
Well, given how bad this is,
I'm having trouble handling it.

333
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,730
And this is gonna
be brutal for Padma.

334
00:16:05,823 --> 00:16:06,985
She's quite fragile.

335
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,894
You have to be careful
how you tell her.

336
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:10,638
Breaking the news
is just the beginning.

337
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:13,179
I've done it many times.
You can trust me to handle it.

338
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,423
- With your help.
- Hey.

339
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:18,404
I came as fast as I could.
What's happening?

340
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:21,272
Dr. Sullivan is getting ready
to explain.

341
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:32,274
Hi, Padma. I'm Dr. Ian Sullivan,

342
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:35,847
a pediatric surgeon
specializing in fetal medicine.

343
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,515
Oh, my God.

344
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,620
Please don't let there
be anything wrong.

345
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:43,711
Dr. Sullivan is an expert
in exactly what the twins need.

346
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:46,547
Tell me. What's happening?

347
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,885
Sometimes when babies
are growing in the womb,

348
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:54,279
the process takes a wrong turn.

349
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,413
And in the past,
when this happened,

350
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:59,393
we couldn't intervene
to help the babies.

351
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,544
And, too often...

352
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:04,042
they would die
before they were born.

353
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:07,142
- No. No.
- No, it's okay. Just let me finish.

354
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:08,903
That was the past.

355
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:11,883
Things are different now.
Your twins have

356
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,391
something called twin-to-twin
transfusion syndrome.

357
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:16,911
It only affects identical twins,

358
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:19,729
because they...
they share the same placenta.

359
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:21,915
You see, what's happening

360
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,803
is there are
abnormal connections

361
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:24,948
between the blood vessels

362
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,065
going from one twin
to the other.

363
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,067
So, blood is not flowing
evenly between them.

364
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:30,793
One twin... the larger one...

365
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,312
Is getting too much blood, which
will cause his heart to fail.

366
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:35,988
The heart of the other twin
is not getting enough blood,

367
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,673
which is why he's so small.

368
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,302
We have to use lasers

369
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:42,586
to cut the blood vessels
linking the babies.

370
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,753
Like this.

371
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,182
See? So they can each have
their own blood supply.

372
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,038
And so the
pregnancy can continue.

373
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:52,947
And if all goes well,

374
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,340
the babies will thrive
to be healthy kids,

375
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,693
and then, ultimately,
healthy adults.

376
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:01,346
You're making it sound simple,

377
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,435
- but I don't think it is.
- You're right. I have to

378
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,459
tell you that
no matter what we do,

379
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:10,256
the smaller baby is in grave
danger and may not survive.

380
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,618
I shouldn't have missed my
appointment. This is my fault.

381
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:18,622
There is no way
that this is your fault.

382
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:22,351
Most likely, no one would have
been able to see this earlier.

383
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:26,721
Just do whatever you have to do.

384
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:29,650
Please save my babies.

385
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:46,724
Odds.

386
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:50,412
There is an 80% chance
that the smaller twin will die.

387
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,155
- And the larger baby?
- Fifty-fifty.

388
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,485
If we don't do the procedure,

389
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,751
it's certain
that both twins will die.

390
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,732
I didn't want to put too much
on the mom so soon,

391
00:18:59,757 --> 00:19:02,557
but you're doctors,
you should know everything.

392
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:10,910
You've helped perfect
this procedure, correct?

393
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:12,336
Yes, I have.

394
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,246
And I've performed it
many times.

395
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,582
We're incredibly lucky
to have you here at Chastain.

396
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:20,011
But the equipment
I need to do it isn't here.

397
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:23,019
It requires
very specialized tools.

398
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:25,355
The closest fetal surgery center

399
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:27,708
is in Orlando.

400
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:30,262
We need to transfer Padma
as soon as possible,

401
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:33,271
and the surgery will have
to be done by a doctor there.

402
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:34,917
But we want you
to do the surgery.

403
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,607
Well, and I would love to.

404
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:40,127
I am incredibly frustrated
that I can't, but...

405
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,448
public hospitals very rarely

406
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,784
have the capability
to do fetal surgery.

407
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:47,613
Let's focus
on what we have to do.

408
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:50,115
- How quickly must this happen?
- As soon as possible.

409
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,101
The smaller baby could die
within hours, and if that

410
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,734
happens, the other twin
will die too.

411
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:59,073
Okay, doctors, well then,
let's call Orlando right away.

412
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:02,576
I'll get Kit
to order a helicopter.

413
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:15,172
A mass in my brain.

414
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,426
My aunt's husband, uh,
died from glioblastoma.

415
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,171
It was... horrible.

416
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:27,319
We don't know this is cancer,
much less a GBM.

417
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:29,678
What else could it be?

418
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,324
Dr. Sutton
has to operate to find out.

419
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:34,590
The surgery is dangerous

420
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:36,835
with many
possible complications.

421
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:39,195
- We need to go over them.
- No, I...

422
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:46,452
I grew up homeless.

423
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:48,955
I never graduated high school.

424
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,345
I apprenticed in kitchens,
and I learned my trade,

425
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:57,372
and I won a James Beard Award
at 28.

426
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,303
I love my life,

427
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:04,805
and I will take any risk.

428
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,120
You're a badass.

429
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,648
- I've got to go.
- Let's book an OR.

430
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,067
We'll be back.

431
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,531
Hey.

432
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:33,000
We can't stay long. I don't want
to leave Padma alone.

433
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:34,335
She's not alone.

434
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:36,566
I just paged Conrad.
He's gonna monitor her.

435
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:38,797
Are you okay?

436
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:44,493
My heart is breaking for her.

437
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:46,846
I know. Poor AJ.

438
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:49,090
So soon after he lost
his mother.

439
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,185
This is how life is.

440
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:53,854
Everything's perfect,

441
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:56,856
and you think you have it
figured out...

442
00:21:56,933 --> 00:22:00,152
Just yesterday,
we were all celebrating.

443
00:22:02,346 --> 00:22:03,507
The problems never stop coming,

444
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,515
and we all have to
live with that.

445
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:08,754
But things are different
for us now.

446
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:10,703
We have each other.

447
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,686
Yeah.

448
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:18,170
And we always will.

449
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:24,960
What's the helicopter's ETA?

450
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:27,778
Okay, we'll have the patient
waiting.

451
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:29,948
Half an hour.
Orlando is prepared.

452
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,443
Get Padma ready for transport.

453
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:33,095
- I want to go with her.
- Of course.

454
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,114
I-I'll get someone
to cover your surgeries.

455
00:22:35,138 --> 00:22:38,731
- You and Leela must both be there.
- Thank you.

456
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:52,653
Hello, my dear.

457
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,230
So, I have some good news.

458
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:56,452
They're trying me on a new
anti-CD20 antibody

459
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:58,229
that's been shown to reduce
relapse rates,

460
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,662
and so far, I'm tolerating it
really well.

461
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,756
Oh, that's wonderful news.

462
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:05,150
Bless your new doctors,
Randolph,

463
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:06,910
because I needed some good news.

464
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:09,314
- What's wrong?
<i>- Everything.</i>

465
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:11,984
Padma's twins have TTTS.

466
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:13,009
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

467
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:15,417
- So is Ian gonna operate?
<i>- He can't.</i>

468
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:17,081
We have to send them
out of state

469
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,991
because we don't have
the right facilities here.

470
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:20,751
<i>Well, Chastain
needs more funding</i>

471
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,328
<i>- if it's gonna stay a first-class hospital.</i>
- Yeah.

472
00:23:23,353 --> 00:23:24,922
And if this idiot
becomes our new governor,

473
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,406
we'll have less than
we ever had.

474
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:27,499
<i>He's polling ahead.</i>

475
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:29,782
It's just so hard
being away from you.

476
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:31,451
I wish I was there to help.

477
00:23:31,603 --> 00:23:35,266
<i>No. You're exactly
where you need to be.</i>

478
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,682
<i>You don't have to worry
about me or Chastain.</i>

479
00:23:37,776 --> 00:23:41,180
<i>Just concentrate on
finishing the treatment.</i>

480
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:44,275
It's just, a few more months
just seems like forever.

481
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,525
<i>Hmm. But it'll be worth it.</i>

482
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:49,447
When you come back home
you'll be healthy and strong

483
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,471
for our wedding.

484
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:52,357
<i>I can't wait.</i>

485
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:53,723
Love you.

486
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,207
I have to take a quick listen.

487
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,893
It's hard... to breathe.

488
00:24:05,045 --> 00:24:07,372
Try to stay calm.

489
00:24:07,396 --> 00:24:08,448
I'll give you some oxygen,

490
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:11,210
make you feel better, okay?

491
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:21,585
Here we go.

492
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:32,846
Better?

493
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:35,089
You have fluid
building up in your lungs

494
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,590
and the rest of your body.

495
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,667
Sometimes with TTTS,

496
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:41,762
the mom starts mirroring
the symptoms of her babies.

497
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:46,567
That's probably what caused you
too faint in the bar.

498
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,177
Helicopter's here.

499
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:50,841
That's a good thing.

500
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:53,115
She's mirroring.

501
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:04,527
I'm sorry. They barely managed
to land safely.

502
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:07,525
- Now they're grounded. They can't take off in this.
- What?

503
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,715
It's okay.
It's just a small delay.

504
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,594
All right, we have to
take her back.

505
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,777
Padma can't afford
to wait any longer.

506
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:21,372
She's showing signs
of maternal mirror syndrome.

507
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,615
Mom's life is now at risk, too?

508
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,898
Surgery's the only way
to save Padma and the babies.

509
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,215
We're out of time.

510
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,611
We have to find a way
to do the surgery here.

511
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,890
- Devon.
- Hey. We're headed into the ICU.

512
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,283
Okay, good. I'll page Cade.

513
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,040
Have her meet us there.

514
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:46,161
Kit. How can I help?

515
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:48,422
Is there any way
to do the surgery

516
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:51,051
- with what we have at Chastain?
- No.

517
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:52,719
But when I saw the weather
coming in,

518
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:54,238
I-I made a few calls.

519
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,648
Lundsford College of Medicine
is teaching surgical residents

520
00:25:56,673 --> 00:25:58,650
how to operate on fetuses
in their sim lab.

521
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:00,911
They may have
the equipment we need.

522
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,895
Bell's been teaching
at Lundsford.

523
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:05,771
I'll get him involved
immediately.

524
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,748
<i>What's going on?</i>

525
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:24,159
A lot. Can you get the
Lundsford College of Medicine

526
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,667
to do us a favor?

527
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:31,038
Blood pressure's spiking.

528
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:34,282
- O2 sats are dropping.
- I'm scared.

529
00:26:34,377 --> 00:26:35,801
The alarms...

530
00:26:35,953 --> 00:26:39,381
It's just telling us
your oxygen levels are low.

531
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:46,698
Hey, let's give
'em some space to work.

532
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:47,833
We'll watch from outside.

533
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:50,040
If she needs you,
you're right here.

534
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,152
- I'll be right outside, okay?
- Okay.

535
00:26:52,302 --> 00:26:54,663
The diuretic and blood pressure
meds will keep you stable

536
00:26:54,806 --> 00:26:55,989
until we do the procedure.

537
00:26:56,141 --> 00:26:59,474
Are these medications
safe for the baby?

538
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:00,971
Absolutely.

539
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:02,698
In fact, ten out of ten babies

540
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:05,406
prefer blood pressure
to be lower than 140.

541
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,335
It makes for more excellent
swimming conditions.

542
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,002
Hey.

543
00:27:10,154 --> 00:27:11,556
Good news.

544
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,375
Bell pulled some strings
at Lundstrom.

545
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,509
They're gonna send over
the fetoscope

546
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:17,919
and some minimally invasive
fetal surgery tools

547
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,070
via police escort.

548
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:20,732
So Ian will be able
to do the surgery.

549
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:23,494
Okay, good. I'll go let
the OR circulating nurse know,

550
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,070
make sure everyone's
on deck and ready.

551
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:26,428
All right.

552
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:29,748
- Hey, how's it going in here?
- Mm-hmm.

553
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,191
How's her pedal edema?

554
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:33,693
How much proteinuria
is on her dip?

555
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:41,276
You're not the doctor or surgeon
now, you're the father.

556
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,703
Here to support the mom.

557
00:27:43,855 --> 00:27:47,017
Okay, well, in that capacity
is my next question.

558
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,375
Should we wait for
the weather to clear

559
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,246
instead of trying
to jury-rig this thing?

560
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,582
- No.
- There's no one else in this time zone

561
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:56,758
more qualified to make
this call. Look.

562
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:00,961
He's done the science,
had the outcomes.

563
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:03,140
You're in the best hands.

564
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:09,689
Thank you all
for your high energy

565
00:28:09,713 --> 00:28:10,708
in the middle of the night.

566
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:11,709
Well, we're honored

567
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:12,768
to be a part of Chastain's

568
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,453
first fetal procedure.

569
00:28:14,478 --> 00:28:17,053
The fetoscope has arrived.

570
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:18,882
Dr. Sullivan,
are you confident

571
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:22,241
you can make the GI tower
compatible with the fetoscope?

572
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:24,221
Doing surgery in small spaces

573
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:27,224
has made me a bit of an AV whiz.

574
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,375
The light post is smaller,
but that just means

575
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,786
we'll white balance
ahead of time.

576
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,010
And we'll-we'll pressure limit
the suction port

577
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,474
to account for the smaller
luminal diameter.

578
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:37,481
The cavalry has arrived,

579
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:39,644
though I can already sense
there are way too many

580
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:41,669
advanced degrees in my OR.

581
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,907
And it looks
like we have more company.

582
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:45,243
Dr. Voss said the
surgical residents learning about

583
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,674
fetal surgery at Lundsford
are going to watch

584
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:51,248
the famous Dr. Sullivan
do his magic tricks.

585
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:54,348
Ian, have you met
our night anesthesiologist?

586
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,667
- Dr. Lee.
- Nice to meet you, Dr. Lee.

587
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Three lives in our
hands tonight. Pressure's on.

588
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:02,574
I'll go scrub in.

589
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:38,192
♪ ♪

590
00:29:58,507 --> 00:29:59,891
Hi, sweetheart.

591
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:01,634
Hey, they're ready for you
in the OR.

592
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:04,396
Just getting my good glasses.
You gonna watch?

593
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:07,556
- Oh, yes.
- Great. After you.

594
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,840
Can you see the mass yet?

595
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,583
Almost there.

596
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:27,642
The tissue surrounding it
appears enflamed.

597
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:29,661
Dissecting down carefully.

598
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:33,707
Does it seem like a malignancy?

599
00:30:33,857 --> 00:30:35,584
Too soon to tell.

600
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,003
All right, hold on, I feel it.

601
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:43,133
That's odd, it's...

602
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:46,260
It's encapsulated.

603
00:30:49,707 --> 00:30:50,964
So, no glioblastoma.

604
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:53,800
Could it be a teratoma?

605
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,229
No. I think...

606
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,976
it's an egg.

607
00:31:03,797 --> 00:31:05,113
That's not a tumor.

608
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:09,701
Nope.

609
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,305
A parasite.

610
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:17,060
Which means our patient
is gonna be fine.

611
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:20,310
That is such great news.

612
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:21,922
I'm gonna go check on Padma.

613
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:24,153
Okay, I'll join you
when I'm done here.

614
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:34,083
They haven't started yet.
Ian just got here.

615
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:35,487
I heard he saved triplets once.

616
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:36,805
No one thought using a laser

617
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:38,473
inside the uterus would work.

618
00:31:38,498 --> 00:31:42,016
He's a miracle worker.
Touched by the hands of God.

619
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,069
<i>All right, Padma.</i>

620
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:50,472
Why don't you take
your sister's hand.

621
00:31:52,769 --> 00:31:56,513
And why don't you hold my arm
with your other hand.

622
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,865
All right?

623
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,753
If at any point
you feel any pain,

624
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:03,112
you stop me. Okay?

625
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:05,839
Why don't we start
with some Lidocaine.

626
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:15,717
Okay.

627
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,051
You're gonna feel
some pressure now.

628
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:21,199
This is the tube through which

629
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:25,067
I will insert the fetoscope.

630
00:32:31,308 --> 00:32:33,028
Problem. Mom's
BP is spiking again.

631
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:36,203
I'm nearly maxed out
on nicardipine.

632
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,333
What's happening?

633
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:42,904
Her mirror syndrome
is getting worse.

634
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:44,130
Do we need to stop?

635
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:45,299
Yes. Take her back to the ICU.

636
00:32:45,323 --> 00:32:46,541
Her heart could fail.

637
00:32:46,566 --> 00:32:48,151
- We'll lose the twins.
- No!

638
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,045
When the problem is the heart,

639
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,396
you page Dr. Austin.

640
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:52,657
Let's get IV furosemide hanging.

641
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:56,067
And I need an ultrasound wand.

642
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,856
AJ, please.

643
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:07,192
Don't want to die.

644
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:09,581
Don't want babies...

645
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:10,922
Padma, look at me.

646
00:33:11,015 --> 00:33:12,974
No one is dying today,
you hear me?

647
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:15,785
We're keeping
all three of you alive.

648
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:19,091
He's just managing
your pressures

649
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:21,926
so we can continue
with the procedure, okay?

650
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:25,211
Right, and you should start
to feel better in a moment.

651
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,695
No, no, it's not working.
Her heart could still fail.

652
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,921
Another minute, Devi.

653
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:34,554
I will not risk Padma's life,

654
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,472
I promise you that.

655
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,143
We-we can't wait.

656
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,885
Blood pressure's coming
back down to normal range.

657
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:56,076
Of course it is.

658
00:33:58,654 --> 00:33:59,987
I can breathe.

659
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,616
Of course you can.

660
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:03,451
You watch that
heart like a hawk.

661
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,516
I'm gonna keep her stable,
you just do

662
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:08,213
what you need to do, all right?

663
00:34:09,907 --> 00:34:12,311
You're doing great, Padma.

664
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:14,312
Now, we're going to insert

665
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:18,472
the fetoscope, okay?

666
00:34:19,509 --> 00:34:21,579
This will give us the best look

667
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:23,081
we have of your babies.

668
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,144
Take a look at that monitor
to your left.

669
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,525
140. Strong.

670
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,536
That's the larger twin.

671
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,798
You're losing him, Sullivan.

672
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,380
I'm now inserting the laser

673
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:04,309
to burn the connecting
blood vessels.

674
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:17,543
The uterus
is filling with blood.

675
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,137
Bleeding upon entry with
the transplacental approach

676
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,719
can happen.

677
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,624
This is a
known risk of the surgery.

678
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:26,718
All that blood
will make it difficult to see.

679
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:28,242
She's bleeding out.

680
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:31,336
Heart rate's at
62. Can I have one liter

681
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:32,838
of Lactated Ringer's, please?

682
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,675
And infuse
the uterus with fluid,

683
00:35:35,826 --> 00:35:38,229
and clear the field.

684
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:40,323
This is awful.

685
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:44,184
Mother and twins are crashing.

686
00:35:44,411 --> 00:35:46,092
Come on.

687
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:49,105
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

688
00:35:57,532 --> 00:35:59,092
All clear.

689
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:01,845
Now ablating

690
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,244
the remaining blood vessels.

691
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:11,619
Incredible.

692
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,954
He barely blinked.

693
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,525
How did he do that?

694
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,717
I don't know.

695
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:30,541
And the smaller one's heart rate

696
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:32,306
is climbing to 103.

697
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:41,574
Ah...

698
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,577
Yes! Yes! Yes!

699
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:51,251
You did great.

700
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:04,505
- Ian.
- Hey.

701
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:05,822
I want to thank you.

702
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:07,410
- You were masterful yesterday.
- Oh...

703
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,918
Well, you have been
every day since I've hired you.

704
00:37:10,012 --> 00:37:11,496
You're too kind.

705
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:12,847
No, it's the truth.

706
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,827
You're a terrific addition
to the hospital.

707
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:17,501
Well, Bell played a huge role,
even in absentia.

708
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:19,853
Hard to believe
in the middle of his treatment

709
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:22,172
in Minnesota, he was able
to score that equipment

710
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:23,673
we needed from Lundsford.

711
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:25,653
Yeah, I wanted to
discuss that with you.

712
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,195
It's killing me that
we don't have what you need

713
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:29,454
here at Chastain.

714
00:37:29,606 --> 00:37:31,677
Everything goes back
to Lundsford today,

715
00:37:31,701 --> 00:37:33,086
and we're right back
where we started.

716
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,295
Well, maybe I could help
raise some money

717
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:38,108
so we could
build an intrauterine

718
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:39,632
surgical center of our own.

719
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,111
That would be amazing.

720
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:44,172
I have a pretty fair
track record at raising funds.

721
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:48,715
- Grateful parents often become faithful donors.
- Dr. Sullivan,

722
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,143
you're needed in OR Three.

723
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:53,371
- We'll talk later.
- Appendectomy on a teenager.

724
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:54,664
There's no one else on call?

725
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:56,983
I just finished that four-hour
biliary atresia.

726
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,854
I'm sorry, they tried,
but it's an emergency.

727
00:37:58,878 --> 00:38:01,237
- Be right there.
- Thank you.

728
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:30,407
You see that?

729
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:31,977
Steady as a rock.

730
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:35,521
And Biden is president.
And he won.

731
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:39,007
The best news
is you don't have cancer.

732
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:41,338
- I had a cute little worm.
- Which you got

733
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:43,028
from eating undercooked pork.

734
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:45,197
I can't believe I did that.

735
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:47,585
My kitchen test experiments
with undercooked sausage

736
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,760
will not be repeated.

737
00:38:49,853 --> 00:38:51,681
Well, at least now

738
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:54,081
you have an unusual pet.

739
00:38:55,525 --> 00:38:57,262
I thought about naming him,
but I think

740
00:38:57,286 --> 00:39:00,128
I'm just gonna
flush him down the toilet.

741
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,385
How's Gigi?

742
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:07,572
She had another nightmare
last night.

743
00:39:07,704 --> 00:39:09,367
I'm so sorry.

744
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:11,776
- Two nights in a row?
- Yep.

745
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,134
I know a good child psychologist

746
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:15,097
if you want to talk to someone
about how to handle this.

747
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:17,081
It may come to that,
but I've been

748
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:18,563
doing some reading.

749
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,878
First, there are a few things
I can try at home.

750
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,454
Hey, you.

751
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:26,457
Hey. Guess who got off early.

752
00:39:26,481 --> 00:39:27,718
I convinced Irving
to take my shift.

753
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:30,650
Do you want to get Gigi
and go for some pizza?

754
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,282
- Oh, Billie, you should come with.
- Yeah.

755
00:39:33,306 --> 00:39:35,822
You're so kind, but, uh,

756
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,324
I have two more surgeries today.

757
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:39,251
Have fun.

758
00:39:39,402 --> 00:39:41,586
All right. See you later.

759
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:44,481
I can't go either. I got to
pick something up for Gigi

760
00:39:44,574 --> 00:39:46,833
and work on this nightmare
situation.

761
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,981
But I want to see you tonight.

762
00:39:49,005 --> 00:39:51,315
She goes to bed at 8:30.
Come by after?

763
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,766
- I'll bring the pizza.
- Mmm.

764
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,253
Okay, so I don't get it.

765
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,092
Why didn't you tell him
how you felt about him?

766
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:06,648
- Maybe I did.
- No.

767
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:08,947
'Cause if you did,
he would be with you right now.

768
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:10,766
I doubt that.

769
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:13,155
At Kit and Bell's
engagement party,

770
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:14,679
I had my speech prepared.

771
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:16,749
Conrad left with Cade
before I could get a word out.

772
00:40:16,773 --> 00:40:20,626
Ah, that's painful.
You missed the moment.

773
00:40:20,777 --> 00:40:22,680
- But there's an upside.
- Yeah?

774
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:24,824
Conrad and I are closer
than we've ever been.

775
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:28,175
- Best friends.
- Ouch.

776
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:31,045
My take.

777
00:40:31,197 --> 00:40:33,197
Conrad chose Cade

778
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:34,526
thinking you weren't interested

779
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,510
because you were
Nic's best friend.

780
00:40:36,552 --> 00:40:39,456
He figured that was a line
you wouldn't cross.

781
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:41,365
And you allowed him
to think that

782
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:43,773
because you never crossed it.

783
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,378
- Now it's too late.
- No.

784
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:51,324
It's never too late to win
the love of your life back.

785
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:59,481
It's dark out here, Daddy.

786
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,724
Oh, I know.

787
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:02,461
I want you to see
something beautiful

788
00:41:02,485 --> 00:41:05,545
that you can only see
in the dark.

789
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:15,072
What kind of moon is it?

790
00:41:15,164 --> 00:41:18,184
- A crescent moon.
- Mm-hmm.

791
00:41:19,762 --> 00:41:21,911
It's beautiful, isn't it?

792
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:24,081
Yes, Daddy.

793
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,914
- You hear that owl?
- Yeah.

794
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:32,364
Yeah, yeah. Owls love the dark.

795
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,108
That's when they come out.

796
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,586
Aren't owls beautiful?

797
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,094
I love owls.

798
00:41:38,188 --> 00:41:40,184
Yeah, there are so many
beautiful things in the dark.

799
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,541
- What else is there?
- Stars?

800
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:44,242
Ah, stars.

801
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:47,170
Yeah, we love stars, right?
What else?

802
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,936
Can we read<i> The Runaway Bunny?</i>

803
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,094
We can.

804
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:56,054
But I got you a new book.

805
00:41:56,206 --> 00:41:58,782
This one is called...

806
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,788
<i>There's a Nightmare
in My Closet.</i>

807
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,623
No, Daddy, that sounds scary.

808
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:09,068
Well, it's not. It's about
being brave at bedtime.

809
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:12,697
Turns out the nightmare
isn't scary at all.

810
00:42:13,983 --> 00:42:15,983
What do you say?
You want to hear it?

811
00:42:16,077 --> 00:42:19,286
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

812
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:25,166
Get in tight. Snuggle up.

813
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,733
Okay, now I want you
to go to sleep

814
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:31,315
and have good dreams.

815
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:33,052
I know you've had some bad ones,

816
00:42:33,077 --> 00:42:35,719
but that's over now.
You know you're safe.

817
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:40,392
There's nothing
that can hurt you.

818
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:43,988
I'll go to sleep
if you stay with me.

819
00:42:44,012 --> 00:42:46,606
Okay, I will.
