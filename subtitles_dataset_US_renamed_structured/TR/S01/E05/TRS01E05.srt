Concurrent surgeries are

I have cancer.

43
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,133

00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,385
Now that's a keeper.

179
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:56,101
<i>This happens all
over the country.</i>

180
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,154
<i>There are entire Web
sites dedicated to it.</i>

181
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,488
- Well, it's horrifying.
- Irving,

182
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,912
sign up our young intern here

183
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,049
- for your anal objects updates.
- No. -

184
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:06,667
It's time to educate him
on both the frequency

185
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,820
and creative nature
of these situations.

186
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,149
Yeah, that's a "no,
thanks" from me.

187
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:12,307
Too late.

188
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:16,460
- Isn't it your day off?
- Bell paged.

189
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,730
- What's in the garment bag?
- Something of mine.

190
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:21,282
Mina, just a heads-up,
I think you might be

191
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:23,217
surgically removing

192
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:24,647
- a syrup bottle from someone's...
- York's rectum?

193
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,287
Oh, so you know him, too?

194
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,174
He gave her the only
good Yelp review she has.

195
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,437
- Very well-written.
- Are you trying to hand York off?

196
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,045
No, no, no, no, no. Not so fast

197
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,430
turfing this one.
You'll be trying several

198
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,750
non-surgical
methods first, Doctor.

199
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,486
There is no way that thing
is coming out without surgery.

200
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,416
It's family-size.

201
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,275
That's what we thought when
York got frisky with a bottle of...

202
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:48,776
Steak sauce.

203
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:52,247
So, go spend some quality
time with our friendly professor

204
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:54,127
and don't forget to
show Ed his new balls.

205
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,673
20 bucks says you can't
figure out what that is.

206
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,919
It was the only way I could
think of getting her here.

207
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,510
I mean, when I'm
sick, she cares.

208
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,500
And when she's
sick, she doesn't.

209
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:10,665
- Socks off, please.
- Oh, come on.

210
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,454
- What the hell for?
- Mom.

211
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:16,420
Stop fighting everything,
and this'll go a lot faster.

212
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,689
When he's right, he's right.

213
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,391
Which is most of the time.

214
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,389
I thought you said I
was gonna get the best.

215
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:25,897
- He...
- Is the best, yes.

216
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,463
- How long has it been cold?
- I don't know.

217
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,715
- A couple days. Sometimes my feet are cold.
- Both?

218
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,534
- Or just the left one?
- Just the left one.

219
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,224
So what?

220
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,519
You have high blood
pressure and abnormal

221
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,544
pulsation in your abdomen.

222
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,178
So, is she gonna be okay?

223
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:45,015
Yeah. Just ordering a CT
scan to see what's going on.

224
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,934
Come here, baby.

225
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,436
Did you see him
touching my feet?

226
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,527
I hope it's not
what I think it is.

227
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,424
- What do you think it is?
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

228
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:00,815
Could be.

229
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,196
- Really didn't want to hear that.
- She should be fine.

230
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,781
As long as it's not
increasing in size,

231
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,549
and she doesn't
escape before it ruptures.

232
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,156
I need a minute.

233
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:10,302
I really don't want
to get stuck in a room

234
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:12,176
with my pants down again.

235
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:13,494
I'm willing to risk it.

236
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:15,375
- No, is that all you're willing to risk?
- Nic.

237
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,132
- I'm trying.
- This was never our problem.

238
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,485
- Then what was?
- Not here, not now.

239
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,603
Okay.

240
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:25,640
I took this at Lane's clinic.

241
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,772
Look at these dosages,
they are extremely high.

242
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,640
That's not just dose
intensification protocol.

243
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,626
I mean, there's
something else going on.

244
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,369
Cary Michaels, 2015, diagnosed
with stage IV liver cancer,

245
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,703
three months to live.

246
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:42,490
Still alive today thanks to
Lane's high dosage protocol.

247
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,287
I don't get your
obsession with this.

248
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,155
Well, I do get that
you're loyal to her,

249
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,124
but we both know
oncologists make a huge profit

250
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,580
from the drugs they prescribe.

251
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,432
More chemo, more money.

252
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,084
That's an awful accusation,

253
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,233
and it'll never stand
up to her outcomes.

254
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:58,406
I'm worried about Lily.

255
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:04,045
Technology is making
everything easier

256
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,781
and yet, valuable traditions
are being abandoned.

257
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,784
The Bell 2.0 is...

258
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:12,520
the perfect marriage.

259
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,105
Is there such a thing?

260
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,386
This tool will prove invaluable

261
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,428
in all forms of
surgery, even neuro.

262
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,396
Now, in terms of...

263
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:25,416
<i>In terms of...</i>

264
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,440
In terms of market potential...

265
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,611
Dr. Bell, I don't want to waste
any more of your time or mine.

266
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,447
Perhaps this tool will
be a great legacy for you.

267
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:42,567
Legacy is not my objective.

268
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,686
Improving surgical
conditions is.

269
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,955
It's too risky of an
improvement for my tastes.

270
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:49,951
Oh, surely you
know the biggest risk

271
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:51,637
- is not taking any.
- You can talk to me

272
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:54,379
- about risk when it's your money on the line.
- Right.

273
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,942
What do I know about
risk? I'm a surgeon.

274
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,700
The good news is
that we have a number

275
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:01,503
of hospital wings that
could bear your name.

276
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,549
Well, vanity investments
aren't as attractive to me

277
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:06,641
as judicious ones.

278
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:08,259
Cancer.

279
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,677
Tell me about it.

280
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:11,730
A group of diseases involving

281
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,948
abnormal cell
growth with the ability

282
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:16,917
to invade or spread to
other parts of the body.

283
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,964
I'm quite sure he
knows what cancer is,

284
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,355
but did you know it was our
number one revenue stream?

285
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,691
I'm listening.

286
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,788
I'll contact Dr. Lane
Hunter, Head of Oncology,

287
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,629
and have her give you
a tour of our new facility

288
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,864
and tell you more.

289
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:34,335
Best of luck with
your tool, Dr. Bell.

290
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:37,138
I hope cancer treats
you well, Marshall.

291
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,425
Impressive, right?

292
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,239
It has a thin silicone
elastomer shell.

293
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,279
- Groovy.
- So, Doctor,

294
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,326
will Ed's package
look the same or...?

295
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,549
Exactly the same.

296
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,663
- Well, not if I choose this one here.
- Oh, God.

297
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,687
Happy Easter.

298
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,440
It might actually throw off
your anatomical balance.

299
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,691
- So...
- It's kind of like bad wheel alignment.

300
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,288
You'd be drifting to the left.

301
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,678
You know, I have an idea.

302
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,575
Why don't I just get,
like, a triple "D" implant,

303
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:04,765
but only in my right
boob. That way,

304
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,546
we'd always be moving
towards each other.

305
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,002
Sort of like...

306
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,388
Okay, now that hurts.

307
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,758
We got this.

308
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,726
Of course we got this.

309
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,865
Doc, how'd I get so lucky?

310
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:32,572
Everything okay, Doctor?

311
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,429
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

312
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,998
I don't care what Dr. Hawkins
says, I want a second opinion!

313
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,295
I understand that surgery's
scary, but your CT scan confirms

314
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,935
- Dr. Hawkins' diagnosis.
- A seven centimeter

315
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:43,666
aortic aneurysm
needs surgical repair.

316
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,517
Hey, Ma, Ma, you're
gonna be okay.

317
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,476
Okay?! Okay how?!

318
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:51,278
Calm down. Calm down.

319
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,930
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

320
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,482
I am.

321
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:56,734
I'm gonna be fine. I
just, I don't know how

322
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,786
I'm gonna afford
a freaking surgery.

323
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,940
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

324
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,458
Christine, let me walk you
through everything, okay?

325
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,260
Okay.

326
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,079
Hey, I've got an idea.

327
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,859
You want to come up and
see the medevac helicopter?

328
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,315
You have one of those?

329
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:14,335
Yep. And you can see it,
if it's okay with your mom.

330
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:17,805
Yes. Baby, go.

331
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,674
Go ahead.

332
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,788
My kids need me.

333
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,989
I know.

334
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:41,629
You know, I thought
about going into medicine.

335
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,731
Mm-hmm.

336
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,268
Ear, nose and throat... or feet.

337
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:49,887
Tops and tails are
sort of my thing.

338
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:53,007
Oh... 'kay. Okay.

339
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,994
And then I found Aristotle

340
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,547
and I just never looked back.

341
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:04,085
Tell me, did you
always want to be a doc?

342
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:08,339
Yes, York.

343
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,957
Yes.

344
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,213
You know, I feel like you're
not really present, Dr. Pravesh.

345
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,030
Like your mind is elsewhere.

346
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,433
Exhale, please.

347
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,651
Ex...? Okay.

348
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,671
Ooh-ee.

349
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,379
- York?
- That's my name.

350
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,692
Did the syrup
queen start her day

351
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:34,465
with or without her crown?

352
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,801
With.

353
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,671
Free at last. Hello.

354
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:41,834
Finally get to go home, Bradley?

355
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,457
Finally, yes.

356
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,077
I can't wait to get home
and take a long hot shower

357
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,062
and then sleep.

358
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,881
Followed by, you
know, more sleep.

359
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,662
- You're not driving, are you?
- Oh, hell no.

360
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:53,895
Bradley, I'll need you

361
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,631
in one of my surgeries
later this afternoon.

362
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,466
Whoa, wait, he just completed

363
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,589
a 30-hour shift.

364
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,491
I'm sorry.

365
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:03,940
Bradley, do you need
to go home and rest?

366
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,563
No. No, sir, Dr. Bell.

367
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,349
- I, uh...
- Okay.

368
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,822
So, that happened.

369
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,640
Sorry.

370
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,864
Bell's doing Christina and
Ed's surgeries at the same time?

371
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:27,051
Not if I have
anything to do with it.

372
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,392
Are you kidding, Doc?

373
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,193
I couldn't be prouder.

374
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,945
Mike's in the 82nd Airborne.

375
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:40,514
1st Brigade Combat Team.

376
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,027
- Paratroopers, right?
- Uh-huh.

377
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:44,347
And this is a kid who was
scared of heights growing up.

378
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,470
Hey, uh, do you have a minute?

379
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,133
Yeah. I'll see you
inside, okay, Gus?

380
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,406
Sure thing, Doc.

381
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,960
What's going on?

382
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:54,839
Do you have time
for a triple "A" repair?

383
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:57,144
Bell scheduled my patient
concurrently with another.

384
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,944
I don't know; I'm
pretty jammed up today.

385
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:00,951
How urgent is it?

386
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,821
Nic, I already told you, we
transfer Christine to St. Joe's.

387
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,439
I reached out to Dr. Reyes.

388
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,819
He has an opening, no
HODAD, everybody wins.

389
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:08,854
You can't make
crazy moves like that.

390
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:10,789
You send a patient
to another hospital

391
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:12,825
and Claire will swallow
your medical career whole.

392
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,969
No one needs to know;
my plan is bulletproof.

393
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,796
Unless you get shot
down in the process.

394
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,730
You're getting awfully
cautious these days, brother.

395
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,516
You're getting awfully
reckless, brother.

396
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,284
A little reminder, we'll all
on the same team here.

397
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,886
Look, it sounds like
Christine's stable,

398
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,688
so I'll do her
surgery after Gus.

399
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,523
It'll be tight, but it's doable.

400
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,891
She's gonna need
to request a switch

401
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,859
- or Bell will come for my head.
- Of course.

402
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,150
All right, sounds good?

403
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,669
- Yeah, thanks.
- No. "Tight" sounds like

404
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,066
- a disaster waiting to happen.
- Well, I wasn't asking you.

405
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,689
Well, I'm telling you

406
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,736
that making medical
choices for the wrong reasons

407
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,837
isn't very smart, Silva.

408
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:42,904
And what exactly
does that mean, huh?

409
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,039
Conrad, it's the right call.

410
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,596
He's just trying to help.

411
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,175
I'll see Christine in surgery.

412
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,811
Thanks.

413
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,582
What's going on with you?

414
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,960
This is incredible.

415
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,045
All funded by cancer patients?

416
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:19,313
And an early investment

417
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:20,910
in a groundbreaking
drug for lymphoma.

418
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,532
I love breaking ground.

419
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,734
Well, that's encouraging.

420
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,503
As I tell all investors,

421
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,072
you need to be driven by
the desire to care for patients

422
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,040
as well as for the return,

423
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,544
since most of these drugs
never really make it to market.

424
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,963
Dr. Lane, I don't
like many people,

425
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,032
but I like you.

426
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,734
So I'll be brutally honest.

427
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,921
I'm driven by one thing:
betting on the right horse.

428
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,992
It requires my full focus
and a lot of personal sacrifice.

429
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,121
Just ask my ex-wife and son.

430
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:52,079
Success comes with a price.

431
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:55,116
And sometimes,
that price is family.

432
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:58,269
But, Doctor, you have
my undivided attention.

433
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,853
It doesn't happen often.

434
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,255
What do you have to offer?

435
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:02,902
I'm happy to give
you a breakdown

436
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:04,966
of all the drugs we
have in development.

437
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,597
Company?

438
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,471
I'm sorry about earlier.

439
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,875
I just... I got a
lot going on and...

440
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:23,910
but now I'm all good.

441
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,724
Really? 'Cause
about an hour ago,

442
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,081
you looked like you were
gonna punch Jude in the face.

443
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,784
Oh, I just was trying to do
the best thing for Christine

444
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:32,497
and you and Jude,
you weren't into it,

445
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:35,306
- so I let it go.
- You know it's okay to talk

446
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,709
about things other than
patients and medicine.

447
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,894
We can talk about our lives.

448
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:42,044
Not a sign of weakness.

449
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,138
You get that, right?

450
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,516
Okay, okay.

451
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,252
Go ahead.

452
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:49,569
Fire away.

453
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:51,088
Tell me about your mom.

454
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,141
- Nic.
- Mom or Dad, you pick,

455
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,970
because, honestly,
after all this time,

456
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,106
I still don't know much
about either of them.

457
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,848
My parents split. My
dad kept me from my mom

458
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,966
and then she passed
away. You know that.

459
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,601
Dad, well...

460
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:12,142
I hate him.

461
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,446
You would, too.

462
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,198
Why?

463
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,965
Because he's the last guy

464
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,535
anyone would want as a
father in every conceivable...

465
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:23,837
But why?

466
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,228
You know I'm not a kid.

467
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,864
I don't need you to hold my hand

468
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,883
and talk me through
all my feelings

469
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:38,652
about all the bad stuff, okay?

470
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:41,038
Not everyone needs that.

471
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,440
Okay.

472
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,554
How you doing today, Lily?

473
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,157
Awful.

474
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:04,227
I feel like a girl trapped
in an old woman's body.

475
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,250
Have you ever thought

476
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,637
about getting a second opinion?

477
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,008
You know, Dr. Hunter
caught my cancer

478
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,359
when other doctors missed it.

479
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:23,147
She's the only
person that I trust.

480
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,923
Nic, I need your help

481
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,259
smoothing things over with York.

482
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:38,262
I think he blames me for
needing surgery, which is insane.

483
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,931
I mean, am I the one who

484
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,461
put a syrup bottle up
his butt? No, I'm not.

485
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:44,852
I just...

486
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:46,187
Nic, is everything okay?

487
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:50,407
Nurse Nevin, a word.

488
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,726
- I'll leave you guys to it.
- Uh, no, stay.

489
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:54,077
This concerns you, too.

490
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:57,197
Christine, abdominal
aortic aneurysm,

491
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:59,550
specifically requested
Dr. Jude Silva.

492
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:02,202
Apparently, he's done quite
a few of these surgeries.

493
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:04,366
But perhaps you're intimately
aware of those details.

494
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,168
Well, I'm aware that Dr. Silva

495
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,759
has an impeccable track
record with these surgeries, yes.

496
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,121
Come on.

497
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:11,878
Sorry.

498
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:13,314
Someone put...

499
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:15,049
it's not important.

500
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:17,028
Well, here's something
that is important:

501
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:18,332
I have an opening in my schedule

502
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:21,104
which will be filled
by York Evans.

503
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,639
And you, Dr. Pravesh,

504
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,076
will present the case to
me. It better be flawless.

505
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:31,465
So now, Bell's doing
Ed and York's surgeries.

506
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,168
So everything is not okay.

507
00:22:37,306 --> 00:22:40,157
- Ooh...
- Mr. Evans, please meet Dr. Bell.

508
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:43,327
As distinguished
in person as in print.

509
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,746
A pleasure to finally
meet you, Dr. Bell.

510
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:48,081
Well, thank you. I'll be running

511
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:51,118
your procedure
today, but, uh, first...

512
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:55,339
Dr. Pravesh will
review the facts for us.

513
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,318
The CT scan confirms
that the foreign body

514
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,262
is approximately
four centimeters

515
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,362
above the rectosigmoid junction,
uh, with surrounding free air,

516
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:04,564
and has damaged the intestine.

517
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,643
And run us through
the particulars

518
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,084
of how this occurred.

519
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,138
Bu...

520
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:13,240
Well, well, he...

521
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:16,460
Put the thing...

522
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,046
<i>He</i> left it in there.

523
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:28,221
Thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

524
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,178
I'll get it out.

525
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,247
I know you will.

526
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,165
Okay.

527
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,699
Yeah, that would be great.

528
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:41,368
Her teacher is Mrs. Ashford.

529
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:42,864
No, I already cleared
it with the school.

530
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,204
That won't be a problem.

531
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,385
Oh... Jenna will be
happy to see you.

532
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,828
I'll just, I'll just come get
her when I leave here.

533
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,195
Thanks, Maggie.

534
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,216
Is Jenna your sister?

535
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:59,019
Yeah.

536
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:01,255
You're a good brother.

537
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:04,542
And you?

538
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,243
What do you need?

539
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,728
"An aortic aneurysm
repair can be complicated

540
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:10,425
"by a leak and
cause life-threatening

541
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,232
internal bleeding."

542
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:17,454
I need that not to
happen with my mom.

543
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:18,238
She's in good hands.

544
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:19,740
You made sure of that.

545
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,419
If there's a mistake
during surgery,

546
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:24,511
if the aneurysm
ruptures, will she die?

547
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,851
I'm not gonna
lie to you, Trevor.

548
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,136
With surgery,
there's always a risk.

549
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:37,007
But no matter what, I
want you to remember

550
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,156
that you're stronger
than you think, okay?

551
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,113
Thank you.

552
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,366
<i>So once timeout has concluded</i>

553
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:48,513
and surgery begins in
OR One, you'll take over,

554
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,471
- and I'll return to Two.
- Great.

555
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:52,439
Sorry, Bradley, am I boring you?

556
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:54,074
No, of course not.

557
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:56,054
I was just wondering
what the plan is

558
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,778
in the event of complications.

559
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:01,481
Well, I'll be there to ensure
everything goes smoothly.

560
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,550
You okay, Dr. Bell?

561
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,885
Yeah, I'm fine.

562
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:07,454
Wake up.

563
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:10,157
Yes, sir.

564
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:12,337
"Some might acquire
fancy Ivy League degrees,

565
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:14,189
"but if they don't have
the inherent instincts,

566
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,513
they may not be cut out
for a life in medicine..."

567
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,022
Dude, stop sending
me these pictures.

568
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:22,936
What's... what is that?

569
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:26,177
Someone got his
first York review.

570
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,263
Even Mina got four stars.

571
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,175
"Inept? Unfocused?"

572
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,660
Seriously, York?

573
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,133
"Not to mention
easily distracted."

574
00:25:53,202 --> 00:25:55,886
"Is it the collective attention
deficit of a generation,

575
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,548
or is it one Harvard
grad who..."

576
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:59,105
I will confess. I was nervous.

577
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:00,474
It was the first time that...

578
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:02,409
That you had extracted

579
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:06,179
an object from the
colon of an adult male?

580
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,198
Yes.

581
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,566
Yes, York.

582
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,551
- That.
- Well...

583
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,221
Next time, I hope
you'll be more careful,

584
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,640
conversational and considerate.

585
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:20,027
Does there really
have to be a next time?

586
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:27,767
I'm hearing whispers

587
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,956
that York is unhappy
with your performance.

588
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,190
The one patient

589
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,593
that loves everyone
else hates me.

590
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:39,112
A lot of this review is
nonsense. I'm having it removed.

591
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,515
It's a stupid review.

592
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,978
If you're looking for
approval, you chose

593
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,546
the wrong path
in life. Do your job,

594
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,869
you do it well, and that's it.

595
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:52,559
Uh, what's going on?

596
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:53,793
Lily is my patient.

597
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,111
Not anymore.

598
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:59,683
I think we should talk.

599
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:02,168
I'm gonna make this short

600
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:04,238
and just as sweet as you.

601
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:05,616
Turns out, I don't
have an appetite

602
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,669
for a nurse snooping
around my clinics,

603
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:10,560
harassing my personnel,
questioning my methods,

604
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,929
making my vulnerable
patients paranoid.

605
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,643
I think that's a little extreme.

606
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:15,777
I didn't ask what you thought.

607
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,351
As of this moment,

608
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,797
you are no longer
going to be assigned

609
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:20,570
to any of my patients.

610
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,217
And if you don't
watch how you tread,

611
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,540
you won't be anyone's nurse.

612
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:24,741
And that's not a warning.

613
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,443
It's not a threat.

614
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,128
It's a promise.

615
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,078

What's happening to her?

682
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,850
Trevor, I'm gonna need you
to stay here, sweetie, okay?

683
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,251
- No! What's happening?
- Listen to me. I'm gonna be

684
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:17,852
- right back. They're gonna take care of your mom.
- No.

Adrian, will you look after
Trevor? I'll be right back.

686
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,411

Ma!

689
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,044
- Talk to me.
- Her pressure tanked.

690
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:27,600
Didn't respond to fluids.

691
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,504
She went unconscious when
her systolic dropped below 80.

692
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,701
Her aneurysm burst. She's
bleeding into her abdomen.

693
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,845
- Is Jude out of surgery?
- No. Complications.

694
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,627
He's not available.
So plan B: Mina.

695
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:44,371
Scalpel.

696
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:47,799
They're bringing
Christine into OR Three.

697
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,783
- Now?
- Aneurysm burst.

698
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,479
Go with Dr. Bell. Go.

699
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:57,597
Go, go!

700
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:04,921
- Christine's crashing here in OR Three.
- You're kidding.

701
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,518
- I don't do that.
- Well, go!

702
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:08,892
Start getting control,
and page Jude, stat!

703
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:22,121
Um... there we go.

704
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:28,511
I've got control of the
