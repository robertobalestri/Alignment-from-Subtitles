1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,663
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- I had a question for you.

2
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:04,898
<i>Old friend's developed
a bit of a tremor.</i>

3
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,655
<i>What about benzodiazepines?</i>

4
00:00:06,724 --> 00:00:08,568
<i>Dr. Hunter, if there's
ever an opportunity</i>

5
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,319
to help you with your
research, count me in.

6
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,761
<i>I saw Lily earlier.
She didn't look good.</i>

7
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:15,813
<i>I went to check Lily's files,
and they were missing.</i>

8
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,127
<i>Dr. Hunter keeps her
patients' records separate</i>

9
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,261
<i>on her own server
at her clinics,</i>

10
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,868
not at the hospital.

11
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,147
The operation came
off without a hitch.

12
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:23,155
You had a spectacular surgeon.

13
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,907
- Cake.
<i>- Louisa will be taken care of.</i>

14
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:29,311
But I have to pull two
million dollars out of thin air.

15
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:30,657
Be prepared to be
woefully understaffed

16
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:33,965
for the next 12 months.

17
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,896
Hi. Patient in bed six

18
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:48,764
was triaged as acute.

19
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,983
Uh, he said his pain was a ten.

20
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,786
Ear pain is always rated
the lowest priority: basic.

21
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:59,874
Certainly not acute, which
means "big deal emergency."

22
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,344
When is Nurse Hundley back?

23
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,811
Oh, she's at St. John's now.

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,847
Budget cuts or something.

25
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,716
I got your back.

26
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,019
Tachy, intra-abdominal
bleeding, possible liver lac,

27
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,642
and a right-sided pneumothorax.

28
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,962
- Acute?
- Bus overturned on I-85, multi casualties.

29
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,975
- Ambulances are stacking up outside.
- Page Dr. Hawkins.

30
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,131
We need help down here.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,311
Bilateral femur fractures.

32
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,734
Hypotension, JVD,

33
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,870
and muffled heart sounds
indicate cardiac tamponade.

34
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,689
Both acute... uh, Trauma
Bay Two and, uh, bed eight.

35
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,645
Where is everyone?

36
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:37,924
It's all blowback
from helping Louisa.

37
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:39,364
Our budget was cut.

38
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,477
ER staff nearly halved
midnight-to-noon shift.

39
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,796
Right, well, we have
Claire to thank for that.

40
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,285
Nurse Hundley was let go.

41
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,366
Too experienced, too
good, too expensive.

42
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,310
New triage nurse
is a bubblehead.

43
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:51,437
- All right, let's go.
- Urgent?

44
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:53,489
Look, I-I don't want to
tell you how to do your job,

45
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,846
but she's awake and breathing.

46
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,183
- Uh... basic. -My hand hurts.
- Yes, ma'am.

47
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,717
Hey.

48
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,903
Hey, I need to see
a doctor, I think.

49
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:04,540
I wiped out on my skateboard,
I wasn't wearing my helmet.

50
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,908
- Um... Yeah, um...
- My head hurts a little bit.

51
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,972
- Little road rash.
- Okay, a headache, uh, road rash.

52
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,140
Uh, still breathing. Basic.
Please, just, uh, take a seat

53
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,165
in the waiting room.

54
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:27,507
Charge.

55
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:28,597
Clear.

56
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,032
Shock.

57
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,750
Still no pulse.

58
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:34,753
Hair acts as an insulator,

59
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,800
and prevents the shock
from getting to the heart,

60
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,024
which is the point of
the defibrillation, so...

61
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,808
we remove it.

62
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:44,145
Then we reapply
directly to the skin.

63
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,132
Charge.

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,483
Clear.

65
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:49,567
Shock.

66
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,121
Sinus rhythm.

67
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,311
Where's your ID bracelet?

68
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,945
Didn't get one.

69
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,716
Think I could get an
aspirin? Head's killing me.

70
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,144
Not until you see the doctor.
I'll get you an ID, though.

71
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,492

- It's okay.

Dislocated shoulder.

I've got it.

79

Good news is we fixed it.

Better?

00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,367

Hey, Irving, bed seven's

85
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,579
in A-fib with RVR, I'm
giving ten of diltiazem.

86
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,943
- Whatever, man. Just do it.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

87
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,811
- Excuse me.
- Yes, we'll be right with you, ma'am.

88
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,434
Doctor, please.

89
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,736
Oh.

90
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,656
Sir?

91
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,891
Hey, sir.

92
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,504
Let's get this
guy to acute, now!

93
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,194
Get his vitals, start an IV.

94
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:25,366
Let's have the intubation
cart standing by.

95
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:27,910
He's unresponsive.
Pulse is weak.

96
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,046
Double access, wide open
fluids, peripheral neo for now.

97
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,236
Dr. Okafor, tube him.

98
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,785
On it.

99
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,892
Damn it. Left pupil is blown.

100
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,604
Looks like we have a brain
bleed. Do we have images?

101
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,873
There's no ID bracelet, so
there's no way to know if there

102
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:42,458
- are tests.
- Is he gonna be okay?

103
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,261
Where is this
patient's ID bracelet?

104
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,962
- Has he even been checked in?
- I-I didn't have time.

105
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,464
- Um...
- What's his name?

106
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,138
Find his name.

107
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,005
Uh, Ian. His name
is Ian Robinson.

108
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,590
- Ian, can you hear me?
- He can't hear you.

109
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:59,291
My best guess is a
subdural hematoma.

110
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:01,143
The bleed must be
compressing his brain stem.

111
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,862
Well, is there another
way to relieve the pressure?

112
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,647
- Burr holes?
- Not without scans to know where the bleed is.

113
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,398
I can't just blindly
drill into a brain.

114
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:08,068
But he's gonna be okay,
right? Because he-he said

115
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:09,774
he just had a headache.

116
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:48,724
Please.

117
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,799
Please, no, he...

118
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,867
He can't...

119
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:57,088
He has no ID bracelet.

120
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,051
You didn't even
admit him properly.

121
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,843
So we have to learn his
name in the middle of a code?

122
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,013
Ian.

123
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,747
His name is Ian.

124
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:09,216
I found him.

125
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,513
Just lying over
there, unattended,

126
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,270
in basic.

127
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,422
Why didn't you
triage Ian properly?

128
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:16,024
It's my first day.

129
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,327
Oh, man.

130
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,646
He had a head injury.
That's, at minimum, urgent.

131
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,025
- Always.
- We were so busy...

132
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,250
and he-he seemed okay.

133
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,920
With brain bleeds, there
aren't always symptoms at first.

134
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,473
He had a head injury.

135
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,925
He should be on
concussion protocol...

136
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,361
in urgent.

137
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,030
The patients, they
just... they kept coming.

138
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,682
And I-I didn't want to him to be

139
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,361
marked as urgent
if he was basic.

140
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:45,286
It's better to be overly
cautious with a head injury.

141
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:46,849
Now you know what
happens when you aren't.

142
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,417
Next time your
patient won't end up

143
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,008
like Ian, dying alone, in basic.

144
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,610
All right, everyone,
let's get back to work.

145
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,373
Someone is dead
because of her mistake.

146
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:58,866
Yeah. And she'll always
carry that with her.

147
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:03,020
He's right.

148
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,622
We need to move on,

149
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,891
and focus on the
patients that we can help.

150
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,730
Abdominal pain.

151
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,682
Bed two.

152
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,351
All you.

153
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,269
Heart rate is 120.

154
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:26,077
Blood pressure is 110/60.

155
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,546
That's bad.

156
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,764
Well, it just means
your body's working hard

157
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:31,332
to fight off this infection.

158
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:34,085
Okay, well, Dr. Hunter just
gave me mega antibiotics,

159
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,970
so it should start working soon.

160
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,239
I'm so sorry you're
going through this, Lily.

161
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:40,086
Your immune system
was not strong enough

162
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,687
the last time you
left the hospital.

163
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,027
We should've kept you longer.

164
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,263
No, it's not Dr. Hunter's fault.

165
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,899
I mean, she knows
what she's doing.

166
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,267
Of course.

167
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,936
Dr. Hunter has a
great reputation.

168
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,239
Yeah. She's the best
oncologist in Georgia.

169
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,210
Hey, how long have
you had this rash?

170
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:01,479
Um, just since this morning.

171
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,865
It really itches.

172
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:05,134
As I remember, you don't have

173
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,096
any allergies to any
medications, right?

174
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,270
Uh, honestly, I-I
can't remember.

175
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,356
Sorry.

176
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,373
The chemo's trashed my memory.

177
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:14,675
But, i-it should be
in my chart, right?

178
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,428
Well, Dr. Hunter likes to keep
your paperwork at her clinic,

179
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,631
but, um, let me
see what I can do

180
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,311
to get the information
sent over here, okay?

181
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,235
- Okay.
- All right, I'll be back.

182
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,377
Ian's father Paul's here.

183
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,931
We're gonna go talk to him.

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,566
You need to learn how to do

185
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,796
one of the hardest things
we have to do as doctors.

186
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,804
Let's go.

187
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:51,278
Mr. Robinson, I'm
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

188
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:54,616
Your son Ian suffered a fall,

189
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:56,851
and it led to a
subdural hematoma,

190
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,887
which is a massive brain bleed.

191
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:04,543
This was not a
survivable injury.

192
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:09,097
Ian's dead?

193
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,664
Yes.

194
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:24,412
Are you ready?

195
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,614
Yeah.

196
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,708
That...

197
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,376
That-that's not Ian.

198
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,983
That's not my boy.

199
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:58,513
How's your day going?

200
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:00,782
Could use a do-over.

201
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,149
Yeah.

202
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:03,785
We took his picture.

203
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,554
We'll ask everyone who
comes in if they recognize him.

204
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,806
I'll circle back
later in the day.

205
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,419
Let me know if
you find anything.

206
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,444
You bet.

207
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,901
I dropped off the John Doe
report with risk management.

208
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,353
- Now what?
- Go upstairs and see our patients.

209
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:26,157
Triple-check that anyone
who was admitted from the ER

210
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,970
was properly
diagnosed and treated.

211
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,495
Who knows what mistakes
are coming our way.

212
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,215
I'm counting on you.

213
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:35,917
What about you?

214
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,418
I'm staying here.

215
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,470
I'll take over triage.

216
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,545
Great.

217
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,408
Show it to all the
patients and everyone

218
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:51,460
in the waiting area... Ask
if anyone knows who he is.

219
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,269
One thing we know for
sure is he isn't Ian Robinson.

220
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,333
Has the real Ian
Robinson showed up yet?

221
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,391
No. Mr. Robinson isn't even
sure that his son was on that bus.

222
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,995
Right now, we have no idea
how that backpack even got here.

223
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,532
<i>Lily's rash is really
bothering her.</i>

224
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,179
It's probably a
superficial phlebitis.

225
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:13,187
Change her IV and give her 25

226
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,722
of diphenhydramine.

227
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,685
Of course. Also,
would it be possible

228
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,594
to get her complete chart
sent over from your clinic?

229
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:21,596
What's wrong with
her record here?

230
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:22,859
Well, we weren't able to find it

231
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,494
when she was admitted...
It seems to have...

232
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,069
- completely vanished from our system.
- Huh. That's odd.

233
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:30,621
And since Lily's
multiresistant infection

234
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,657
is so difficult to
treat, I figured

235
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,759
you'd probably be
more comfortable

236
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,278
if we had her
entire history here.

237
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,432
Of course. You're right.

238
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:43,525
I'll have the clinic
send it right over.

239
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,371
Great. Thank you.

240
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,641
So, how long till Shirley
passes the gallstone?

241
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,521
We're trying to get
out of town for vacation.

242
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,673
Well, it really depends on
how many stones there are.

243
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:56,797
Any decreased
appetite or weight loss?

244
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,366
Shirley hasn't been eating much.

245
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,501
Have you lost any weight?

246
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,487
Not much. A pound?

247
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,855
More like 15.

248
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,324
Your husband is very attentive.

249
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,125
Howie worries.

250
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,178
But he's not my husband.

251
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,398
He's my boyfriend.

252
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,469
We met six months ago at
an aero-modeling convention.

253
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,065
We were both
building exact replicas

254
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,473
of the Wright brothers' plane.

255
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,609
Yeah. For us, it was love

256
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,741
at first Wright Flyer.

257
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:29,592
- Okay.
- Please, Doctor,

258
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,109
- please help her.
- Oh, no, my... -Okay.

259
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,884
I'll increase your pain med dose

260
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,935
- and frequency.
- Okay.

261
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,133
As long as you're here,
we'll run a few more tests.

262
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,884
- Thank you.
- I don't want Howie to worry.

263
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:42,159
Then you better get
these gallstones out quick,

264
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,762
so we can go on
our trip and relax.

265
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,601
Deep breath.

266
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:54,405
Oh, hey, Dr. Pravesh, I, uh...

267
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,509
I want to touch base with you.

268
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,496
I hope I didn't alarm you
by ordering more tests.

269
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:03,564
It's probably just gallstones.

270
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,416
Good.

271
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:09,169
See, we're on our way
to Kitty Hawk and, uh...

272
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:11,589
I'm gonna propose,

273
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,569
in a big romantic
plane-themed gesture.

274
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,693
- That's great.
- See, when you get to 80

275
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:19,513
without a wife, you figure
nobody could ever love you.

276
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,866
Then along comes my Shirley.

277
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,103
She... she's my everything.

278
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,022
And if I should propose early,

279
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,325
you let me know.

280
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,528
I'm a practical man, and
I don't want to be morbid,

281
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:35,396
but...

282
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:38,549
we're old.

283
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:40,601
So please take good care of her.

284
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:47,942
Things seem less chaotic.

285
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:49,505
Made our way
through the worst of it.

286
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,794
Any word on the identity

287
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,464
- of the John Doe we lost this morning?
- Not yet.

288
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,416
This is a new patient of ours.

289
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:56,595
Shirley Harris.

290
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:58,937
Take a look at the ultrasound.

291
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,256
The ER doc diagnosed gallstones.

292
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:05,426
I'm afraid he missed a mass.

293
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:07,728
What does the blood work show?

294
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:09,029
Slight anemia. Weight loss.

295
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,699
Let's get an EUS to better
characterize the mass

296
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,646
and a CT for the
surrounding areas.

297
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,587
And we'll hope for the best.

298
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,605
Yeah. Let's hope.

299
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,129
Kelly.

300
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,002
- What are you doing?
- Preparing for the dissection.

301
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,404
You aren't doing the
dissection; you're a resident.

302
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,472
I do it for Dr. Bell.

303
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,607
Well, he's not here.

304
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,392
When I was a resident,

305
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,195
they wouldn't let me
tie a knot unsupervised.

306
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:42,513
Give me the Kelly.

307
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,317
Watch and learn.

308
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,285
I have nothing to learn.

309
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,655
You are barely halfway
through training...

310
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,674
There is plenty
for you to learn.

311
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,263
Any action on this? How
much you gonna give me

312
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:07,654
- if I make the putt?
- Huh. You haven't mentioned money

313
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:10,491
- since you got a case of the yips.
- How much?

314
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,844
- Hundred.
- You sure?

315
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,613
Downhill, very slippery.

316
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,217
- How about five?
- Easy money.

317
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,912
You haven't even
two-putted in six months.

318
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,770
Thousand?

319
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,005
Fine.

320
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,675
You miss, you donate
a thousand bucks

321
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:29,510
to my son's school fund-raiser.

322
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,829
Wonderful. For the kids.

323
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,832
I miss the putt, thousand
bucks to your son's school.

324
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:38,669
I sink it, thousand bucks to...

325
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,205
me.

326
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:48,646
♪ ♪

327
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,371
Damn it! Man!

328
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,323
I'm back.

329
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,949
She made me hold the
retractors the entire time.

330
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:10,551
- Like I was... an intern.
- Insanity.

331
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,086
20-something male, John Doe,

332
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:13,866
fractured left femur,
bruising to the right chest,

333
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,740
- neck injury with possible crushed larynx.
- John Doe?

334
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,975
I thought we had

335
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,538
all the casualties
from the bus accident.

336
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,157
He's the last one... found
him way off in some shrubs.

337
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,408
He must have been
thrown on impact.

338
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:24,160
Okay, this could be
our guy, Ian Robinson.

339
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,210
Take him to Trauma Two.

340
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,612
Let's hope it's
him... It'd be nice

341
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:29,153
- to tell Paul we found his son, alive.
- Barely.

342
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:32,590
He's desatting.

343
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,626
Attending, get a GlideScope.

344
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,195
Airway.

345
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,748
Oh, no. No, no, that's surgery.
You can't do that in the ER.

346
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:42,044
Not without
attending supervision.

347
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,768
By the time someone gets here,

348
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,869
he'll be brain-dead.

349
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,436
Get the trach kit.

350
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:49,323
- Are you sure?
- There's no choice.

351
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:51,752
There is a choice... you
could choose to follow protocol.

352
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,973
- The patient would die.
- I'm not telling that father

353
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:56,037
his son is dead for
a second time today.

354
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,050
Don't do this.

355
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,887
Stop!

356
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:05,906
That's normal.

357
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,680
I'll take this photo
up to Paul Robinson

358
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:15,048
and confirm he's his son.

359
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,271
Not to point out the
obvious here, but you...

360
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,323
are a badass.

361
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,677
Let me see this badass's work.

362
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,714
Surgery performed in the ER

363
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,984
by an arrogant, overconfident,
unsupervised resident.

364
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,791
Flawless technique.

365
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,693
Mm, you know how to cut.

366
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,029
But you don't know when not to.

367
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,081
I'm benching you
for the day. Clear?

368
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:51,118
Get him up to my OR.

369
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:53,721
That's unfair... You
saved the patient's life.

370
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,022
Why didn't you say something?

371
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,524
I want to cut tomorrow.

372
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:03,981
Thank you.

373
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,016
Yeah, we'll work
on both of those.

374
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,719
My office sent over
Lily's file... did you get it?

375
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,204
Not yet.

376
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:12,940
Are you sure? Did you check?

377
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,092
- Did they e-mail it?
- We don't e-mail

378
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,805
patient files;
they're not secure.

379
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,696
Well, let me check the fax.

380
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,567
No fax.

381
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,885
Is the paper tray empty?

382
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:30,408
Nope, it's full, just
waitin' for a fax.

383
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,843
Well, my office sent it over.
The problem is on your end.

384
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,412
It's a miracle people make
it out of this place alive.

385
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,832
There's one person
I wish wouldn't.

386
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,386
Yes, that's my son.

387
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,538
Thank you, Dr. Hawkins.

388
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,408
He's in surgery; you can see
him just as soon as he's out.

389
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:49,993
- Okay.
- We need his medical history.

390
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,847
Is he allergic to anything?
Medications, food allergies?

391
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,576
Any health conditions
I should know about?

392
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,917
- Heart condition, diabetes?
- Let's see,

393
00:18:56,986 --> 00:19:00,271
his doctor said that
he has low calcium.

394
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,800
Too much tension on my
carotid repair. Hold him still.

395
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,947
- Hold him still.
- Baseline is hypocalcemic!

396
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:17,115
The blood transfusion made
it worse... he needs calcium!

397
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,073
Okay, well, add
calcium to his IV.

398
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:22,076
What IV? It tore
right out of his arm.

399
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:24,478
We don't have access.

400
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:28,399
I'll put in a new
IV. Hold his arm.

401
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,595
- I'll rip his arm out of the socket.
- The seizure won't stop

402
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,770
until we get calcium
into his veins.

403
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,461
Don't let go, no matter what.

404
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,031
I need access now.
There's too much tension...

405
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,049
Almost there. Almost there.

406
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,202
- We're about to have a blowout on our hands.
- I'm in.

407
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:53,240
Pushing calcium now.

408
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,936
Thank you.

409
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,784
It's gonna help

410
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,136
with your breathing, Lily, okay?

411
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:24,939
- Page Dr. Hawkins.
- I already paged him.

412
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,069
- Give me the epi.
- Nurses can't administer meds

413
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,143
without orders.

414
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,365
Looks like they can.

415
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,401
Oh, my God.

416
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:40,866
- Where have you been?
- In a stuffy room

417
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,567
with stuffier administrators
trying to get them to rehire

418
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,136
Nurse Hundley.
Once I pointed out

419
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,954
they could be looking
at a lawsuit, they caved.

420
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,330
She'll be back in the ER
within the hour. She's wheezing.

421
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:50,575
- What's hanging?
- Saline and imipenem.

422
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,566
I just gave her epi.

423
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,769
Stop the imipenem.
Open the saline wide.

424
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,866
Lily, you're gonna be all
right. I'm gonna sedate you

425
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,556
and put in a breathing tube

426
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,042
- to keep your airway open.
- What's happening?

427
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,895
I'm here, Lily, and I'm
gonna take care of this.

428
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:09,155
<i>I have to figure out which one</i>

429
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:11,030
of her meds is
causing the reaction.

430
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:12,764
- There's... there's so many.
- Well, I don't remember

431
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:14,433
her having any
sensitivity, so whatever it is,

432
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:15,789
it's got to be something new.

433
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,569
Her only new med
is the imipenem...

434
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:19,026
If it is that, we're screwed.

435
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:21,040
Is she allergic to
any other antibiotics?

436
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:22,908
- Well...
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

437
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:25,110
Her chart only goes back as
far as this current admission.

438
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:27,401
I know, and I've been
trying to get it sent over

439
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,181
from Dr. Hunter's
clinic since this morning.

440
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,449
They keep insisting they
sent it, but it never arrived.

441
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,807
With Lily's infection, I
don't want to keep her off

442
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,560
the broad-spectrum antibiotic
for long. We need her chart.

443
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,223
Hey, Debbie, can
you cover for me

444
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:41,198
- for an hour? Can you stay?
- Where you going?

445
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,817
Lane's clinic. We
obviously can't trust them

446
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,570
to get us her chart, so
I'm gonna go get it myself.

447
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,559
Just enhance that a bit more.

448
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:53,243
- What have you found?
- Shirley Harris's EUS,

449
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,363
CT and supporting lab work
confirm gallbladder cancer.

450
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:58,899
But the good news
is it's early stage

451
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,701
and confined in the gallbladder.

452
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,919
So there is a real chance

453
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,031
the treatment could
be curative for her?

454
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:03,971
Well, we can certainly reduce

455
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,972
the chance of recurrence.

456
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:05,973
The tumor's located

457
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:07,707
in the neck of the gallbladder.

458
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,338
In order to get clean
margins, some of her liver

459
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,456
- will have to be removed as well.
- It is tricky.

460
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,063
Tricky?

461
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,559
It's a minefield
of blood vessels

462
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,600
and bile ducts,
and she's anemic.

463
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,647
Clip the wrong vessel,
once the bleeding starts,

464
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,315
we might not be able to stop it.

465
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,117
At her advanced age,
there's a real chance

466
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,152
she won't make it through
surgery... why risk it?

467
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,610
I highly recommend
a palliative consult.

468
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,678
Shirley's 80 is a young 80.

469
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,964
More like 60, full of life.

470
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,176
Her boyfriend's about
to propose to her.

471
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,967
She has a lot to live for.

472
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:35,068
If she makes it off the table.

473
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:37,955
It has been done
successfully before.

474
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,076
Cancer?

475
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:45,279
Gallbladder cancer?

476
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:47,915
Yes. But because
we caught it early,

477
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:50,601
there's a real chance
for a total cure.

478
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,436
With surgery and radiation.

479
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:56,139
That sounds simple, but
I'm guessing maybe it isn't.

480
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,292
The surgery itself
is-is complicated.

481
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,227
How complicated?

482
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,229
Could the surgery kill Shirley?

483
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,099
This is a highly
aggressive cancer.

484
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:08,852
Without the surgery, you
could have less than a year.

485
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:12,473
But with the surgery, you
can have many more years.

486
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,942
Are you okay?

487
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,021
Shirley, say something.

488
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:19,179
I might be dying.

489
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:22,582
And there's only one
thing I want to know.

490
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,736
Howie Green...

491
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,340
will you marry me?

492
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,142
You're not supposed to
ask me that, Shirley Harris.

493
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:35,596
- I'm gonna ask you.
- Don't be difficult.

494
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,182
- Answer me.
- Yes.

495
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:41,318
I will marry you,

496
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,071
- only if you marry me.
- Yes!

497
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,900
I will marry you.

498
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,030
So, how do we make sure

499
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,233
this lifesaving surgery
doesn't kill me?

500
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,047
- 'Cause I got a wedding to go to.
- Yeah.

501
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,699
In the hands of
a lesser surgeon,

502
00:24:00,723 --> 00:24:03,156
I wouldn't be as confident,
but you're getting the best.

503
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:06,093
Dr. Randolph Bell has
the highest success rate.

504
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,239
The man on the billboards?

505
00:24:07,263 --> 00:24:09,107
Yes. He's our chief of surgery.

506
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:10,459
<i>Are you sure Dr. Bell</i>

507
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,249
is right for this case?

508
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,568
He's done hepatobiliary
surgeries many times.

509
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:18,071
There's no one else here
who can touch his record.

510
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,108
It's his record
I'm worried about.

511
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:23,088
His complication rates
have risen dramatically lately.

512
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:24,939
And I only bring this
up because I know

513
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,624
attendings aren't always
aware of their colleagues.

514
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,248
Every doctor makes mistakes.

515
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:30,768
Of course, but
this is far beyond.

516
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,420
Conrad, hold on.

517
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,674
I'm gonna speak to you now
as a dear friend and mentor.

518
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:39,927
You're one of the most
gifted young residents I know.

519
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:42,329
Don't sabotage a career
that's just beginning.

520
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:46,267
Doctors must support each
other through good times and bad.

521
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:48,046
You, of all people,
should know that.

522
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,181
I'm grateful for all you
did for me in the past,

523
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,783
but I have to speak

You can unbench me.

Wait, you're not here for...

567

Oh, no, no, not a patient.

No, I'm just waiting

You can treat so many

Dr. Hunter doesn't want

That's industrious. I like that.

00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,904
They would have tied it off
like a bleeder, not realizing

703
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,984
they're cutting off the entire
blood supply to the liver.

704
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,153
Because I've seen it before,

705
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,743
now I routinely look for it,

706
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,480
and that habitual
extra precaution,

707
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,810
well, that just helped me
avoid a deadly complication.

708
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:28,501
And now, I believe she
has a honeymoon to go on.

709
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,437
Well, I'm certainly happy
we had you today, Dr. Bell.

I hear you went to my clinic.

00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,399
I did.

721
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,883
I did. I was impressed.

722
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:04,320
Beautiful architecture.
Inspiring, really.

723
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,806
Mm. You're very dedicated.

724
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,843
A real gem.

725
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:30,797
Tumor margins clean.

726
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:33,667
Clear nodes.

727
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:36,035
With my hands
and your radiation,

728
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:38,638
we didn't just buy her
more time, we cured her.

729
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,892
You know, I've
been married twice.

730
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,879
Had my share of affairs,
but I've never really...

731
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,580
had love like that.

732
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,610
But that right there
is why I do this.

733
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,234
Really?

734
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:54,003
Would you have done the surgery
if Medicare had refused to pay?

735
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:58,357
No, of course not. I'm
not some gung ho resident.

736
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,859
Would you?

737
00:37:59,928 --> 00:38:02,845
Top Ramen got me
through my residency.

738
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,347
I'm serious.

739
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:08,034
- It took me years to pay off my student loans.
- Yeah.

740
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:09,368
Now...

741
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:11,854
we're the best at what we do.

742
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,023
We save lives.

743
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,592
We deserve to be paid for it.

744
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,993
Amen.

745
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:25,017
Great to see you back.

746
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:27,504
It's good to be
seen, Dr. Hawkins.

747
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:31,056
Don't know what you said
to convince them to rehire

748
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:34,611
some old ER nurse, but
thanks. I owe you a beer.

749
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,030
Ah, I'd say it's the
other way around.

750
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:39,048
This place is a
wreck without you.

751
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,566
I heard today was a rough one.

752
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,497
It's a good thing you
were here to take over.

753
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:45,271
Which reminds me.

754
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,073
A janitor turned this in.

755
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,091
He found it on the floor.

756
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,277
Might belong to your John Doe.

757
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,290
Thank you.

758
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:06,076
You're welcome.

759
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:31,584
Hello?

760
00:39:31,653 --> 00:39:34,987
This is Dr. Conrad Hawkins
at Chastain Park Memorial.

761
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:36,823
Is this Erik's mom?

762
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:42,094
I have some bad news.

763
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:46,115
Your son came into our ER today

764
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,718
after an accident.

765
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:52,589
He had a head injury
that was very serious.

766
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,191
We did everything possible,

767
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,661
but unfortunately,
we couldn't save him.

768
00:40:05,053 --> 00:40:07,703
What do you say we get
away together for a few days?

769
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,338
Just us.

770
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,940
That sounds nice.

771
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,925
Where are you thinking?

772
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,177
I don't know.

773
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,512
Kitty Hawk.

774
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,148
If we're gonna
take time off work,

775
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,616
we have to go someplace good.

776
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:23,085
All right. Wherever
you want to go.

777
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:26,505
As long as I'm with you.

778
00:40:26,574 --> 00:40:28,074
Kauai.

779
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:30,276
Just tell me when.

780
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:40,652
Oh, don't leave.

781
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:43,239
- Come back here.
- Let me get my computer.

782
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,423
I need to work.

783
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:46,893
So what are you working on?

784
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,662
This is my own thing.

785
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:53,165
A group of people not far from
here got some rare sickness.

786
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:55,718
They think it has something
to do with the drinking water.

787
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,070
Who knows.

788
00:40:58,139 --> 00:40:59,884
Could be the next
Flint, Michigan.

789
00:40:59,908 --> 00:41:03,092
If it is, I'm going
to find the story.

790
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,312
I'm proud of you.

791
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:11,400

798

I get to help my

799

I was gonna ask you, um,

800
00:41:31,606 --> 00:41:33,739
what it's like to
work for Dr. Hunter.

801
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:39,261
We just had massive budget
cuts at Chastain, so you know,

802
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,364
just checking to see if
there's any greener grass.

803
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,050
I heard. That sucks.

804
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:46,385
Um, I like working for Hunter.

805
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:48,498
I mean, the pay is
good, so are the benefits.

806
00:41:48,522 --> 00:41:50,484
She doesn't freak out if
I have to take the day off

807
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,241
'cause my kid's sick.

808
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,077
And it looks like a health spa.

809
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,795
The patients love it.

810
00:41:55,864 --> 00:41:57,563
Well, as much as they can.

811
00:41:57,632 --> 00:41:59,298
Cancer's brutal.

812
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:03,619
You know, I noticed working
with her patients at Chastain...

813
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:08,373
- Mm-hmm?
- The chemo dosages she uses are really high.

814
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:13,479
I'm not a doctor, but I know

815
00:42:13,548 --> 00:42:14,976
she puts a lot of
thought into coming up

816
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,894
with the protocol
for each patient.

817
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:19,268
Everyone is unique.

818
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,437
That's terrific.

819
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:23,873
Yeah.

820
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,275
If you do decide you
want to work for Dr. Hunter,

821
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:28,294
one thing I can tell you is,

822
00:42:28,363 --> 00:42:31,297
she likes everyone who
works for her to be discreet.

823
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:33,310
Maybe that's why
it was so difficult

824
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:36,201
to get a patient
file from your office.

825
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,442
I just remembered that my sitter

826
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:45,795

827
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:48,330
Oh, well, maybe another time.
