00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:52,480
Remember, we want the hospital

death was untimely

179
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,726
and unfortunate, and I know
that everyone in this room

180
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,595
is grieving, but it is
important for the hospital

181
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:31,414
to understand exactly
what happened.

182
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,704
Her heart failed. That
much we know for certain.

183
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,774
But she was getting
massive chemotherapy, and...

184
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,360
an autopsy will tell us if that

185
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:40,806
played a role. We need to
make sure the doses she received

186
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,296
were appropriate.

187
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,365
Of course.

188
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,515
I absolutely agree.

189
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:48,519
An autopsy is 100% warranted.

190
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,189
Great. Then we're all

191
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,340
on the same page.

192
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,508
I'll call Pathology right away.

193
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,976
Claire,

194
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:58,812
please let me know the
minute you receive the results.

195
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,781
Of course.

196
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,533
Hey, Arthur.

197
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,370
- Randolph. Hey. How are you doing?
- Good.

198
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:26,257
Listen, I want to talk to you
about my friend with a tremor.

199
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,843
Enough. Let's be
honest with each other.

200
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:32,163
We both know your friend is you.

201
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,060
Look, it happens
to the best of us.

202
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,818
We get older, our hand shakes.

203
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,553
I'm on your side.

204
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:41,605
You've tried a
bunch of solutions.

205
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:42,769
You should consider
the possibility

206
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:44,259
that it might be stress-induced.

207
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,904
Lot of things coming
at you at once.

208
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:48,313
Chief of surgery,
face of the hospital.

209
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:49,582
Not to mention your divorce.

210
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,415
What is it, number four?

211
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,833
Two.

212
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,303
Two. Feels like four.

213
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:56,611
That's a boatload of pressure.

214
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,040
Yeah, well, what
do I do, Arthur?

215
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:00,608
Long term? Jog.

216
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:03,127
Swim. Learn to meditate.

217
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,130
Figure out a way to blow
off some of that anxiety.

218
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,299
Short term? Take a Xanax.

219
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,608
It's a benzo. I've tried those.

220
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,869
Mm. Nah...

221
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,403
This one will take the edge off.

222
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,432
Let you focus on
what really matters.

223
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,152
Come up to my office,
I'll give you a sample.

224
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,408
Works wonders.

225
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,277
Check it out.

226
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,947
And I'm paying for two kids in
college and a kitchen remodel.

227
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,472
This is between us, okay?

228
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,558
We look out for our own.

229
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:49,735
Full results are gonna
take at least a week,

230
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,503
but I might have a
preliminary cause of death

231
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:53,428
in less than 24 hours.

232
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:55,964
Blood drawn before
the code should help.

233
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,118
One question.

234
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,689
Why would Lane
agree to this autopsy?

235
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:17,864
You paged me?

236
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:19,320
I need you on the VIP wing.

237
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,271
Are they short-staffed?

238
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,339
New patient.

239
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,518
Ted Zhou, high security.

240
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,958
Driving the nurses nuts.

241
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:25,704
I'm a nurse practitioner,
I have my own patients.

242
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,695
The VIP wing's
coddling rich people.

243
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,531
That's why I want you up there.

244
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:30,548
Not a request.

245
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,200
An order.

246
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,699
I want a list of error
rates at every hospital

247
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,418
in the Southeastern
United States.

248
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:42,494
If Chastain Park can't
accommodate what my needs are...

249
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,773
Mr. Zhou, I hear you're
nervous about your surgery.

250
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,797
Who are you?

251
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,443
There were white
flowers in my room.

252
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,378
Now, in China, white
flowers for dead people.

253
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,868
Details matter.

254
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,004
Cultural sensitivity is a
marker for overall competence.

255
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,618
Everybody gets
anxious in a hospital.

256
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,091
Lack of control, strange place.

257
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,159
I understand, but
you're gonna be fine.

258
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,713
I am a nurse, not an assassin.

259
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,544
If you don't trust us, then
you can leave Chastain.

260
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:06,712
But if you put your hands on
me again, I will have you arrested.

261
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,585
It's okay.

262
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,759
I like your attitude, Ms...?

263
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,744
- Nevin.
- Ah.

264
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:19,713
What's a lucky number
in China, Mr. Zhou?

265
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:21,648
In this instance, three.

266
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,084
Three means "life."

267
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,955
Come with me.

268
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,211
- Better?
- Very clever.

269
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,014
Now, if you worked for me,
I'd promote you immediately.

270
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,233
Well, I can't wait to
discuss my new salary,

271
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:40,785
after your surgery.

272
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,518
I want to see if the
hallucinations are a result

273
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:47,675
of encephalitis.

274
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,461
I'd like to think
that having done

275
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:56,784
a few thousand of these myself

276
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,634
would make it hurt less,

277
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,420
but it doesn't.

278
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,726
No whites, no reds?

279
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:07,762
Everything's normal?

280
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,457
Dr. Bell, do you still
want me to take over?

281
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:26,124
Yeah, I was gonna
supervise the anastomosis.

282
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:27,482
I think I'll finish up.

283
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,733
2-0 silk.

284
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:32,698
- Mina.
- I know.

285
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:33,799
I have Dr. Jacoby's
test results.

286
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:35,034
Tag along if you
want to meet her.

287
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:36,624
I've prepared a speech.

288
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:40,728
This is too important of a
meeting to forget a single word.

289
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,631
Fair warning: do you know
why Dr. Jacoby's here?

290
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,833
No.

291
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:47,902
Let's just say she's
not her old self.

292
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:54,074
Dr. Jacoby.

293
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,688
I'd like to introduce
you to someone,

294
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:58,011
our star surgical
resident, Dr. Mina Okafor.

295
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,466
It is a great honor to
meet you, Dr. Jacoby.

296
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,535
I've followed your career,
starting when I was a child.

297
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,104
I used to read about you in
my uncle's medical journals,

298
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,373
I collected a video
library of your surgeries.

299
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,877
I've played them over and
over to learn your technique.

300
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:16,814
Your retromastoid and
curvilinear incisions are...

301
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,866
remarkable.

302
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,117
Well, I'm honored.

303
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,753
Thank you.

304
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,857
What are you looking at?

305
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,794
Mrs. Hamilton... had
a spinal cord injury.

306
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,113
Compressed fracture
between T7 and T8.

307
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,166
Car accident.

308
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,786
I transgressed the cord
with a titanium screw.

309
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,321
She never walked again.

310
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,100
Your test results... EEG

311
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:44,491
and spinal tap... They
both came back normal.

312
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:46,360
So I am losing my mind.

313
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,896
Let's focus on other
possible diagnoses first.

314
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,893
I read in your chart
that you're a vegetarian?

315
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,750
A lifelong vegan.

316
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,896
Vegetarians often suffer
from B12 deficiencies.

317
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,838
A B12 deficiency can
cause people to hallucinate.

318
00:15:57,907 --> 00:15:58,839
In some people; it's rare.

319
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:00,941
One in 1,000, but it happens,

320
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,895
- so we'll give you...
- High-dose B12 injections.

321
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,608
You really think
that will do the trick?

322
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,777
Honestly, I'm not sure, but
it's a quick and easy gamble,

323
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,201
so why not?

324
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,803
I'll take that gamble.

325
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,877
Time to turn that off. No cell
phones in the operating suite.

326
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,199
I was talking to my lawyer.

327
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,735
Making preparations
in case I die.

328
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:29,971
You know, I'm gonna
give all my money away.

329
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,583
I don't want to
spoil my children.

330
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,924
- They have to learn to stand on their own.
- Well,

331
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,037
I'm definitely on board with
your parenting, Mr. Zhou,

332
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,172
but you are not going to die.

333
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,895
At least not here, not today.

334
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,242
So nothing bad ever happens
to patients under your care?

335
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,416
Mr. Zhou.

336
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:43,917
So nice to see you again.

337
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,148
Are we making you feel welcome?

338
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,938
Dr. Bell. The man on the poster.

339
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,659
Nurse Nevin assures me
I'm in good hands here.

340
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:52,960
The very best.

341
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:17,435
Alan Wyatt.

342
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,971
It's a craniotomy

343
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,441
and a facial nerve transection.

344
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,610
It was Mass General,

345
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:29,763
spring of 1983.

346
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,618
I-I should have
cut a little higher.

347
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,031
This is Supervisor
Stevens, fifth floor.

348
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,404
I need extension 43.

349
00:17:57,793 --> 00:17:59,926
What the hell's
he doing in here?

350
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,062
We thought he might have a gun.

351
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:03,359
Oh, so you just
let him in the OR?

352
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,666
Mm-hmm.

353
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,563
Dr. Butler, can we run
through the checklist, please?

354
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,970
Yes, sir. One, uh,

355
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,249
please confirm the
name of the patient.

356
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:14,659
- Ted Zhou. Male, 55.
- Confirmed.

357
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:15,771
Two, please confirm
the procedure.

358
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,861
Caudate lobectomy.

359
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,830
Confirmed.

360
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:23,662
See the way she neatly accesses

361
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,503
the superior temporal lobe.

362
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,488
Gives you goose
bumps, doesn't it?

363
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:30,858
Not how I would describe it.

364
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:32,560
I heard she sees ghosts.

365
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,212
Conrad already found the
biological basis: low B12.

366
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,080
There's no such thing as ghosts.

367
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,050
Not true. I've seen a
ghost right here at Chastain.

368
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,669
Room 1313.

369
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,671
Lot of people died in that room.

370
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:45,773
Totally haunted.

371
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,107
Don't be an idiot.

372
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,121
I read that ghosts were
big in Nigerian culture.

373
00:18:49,145 --> 00:18:50,745
This is America.

374
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:52,291
The Garuda Purana says

375
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:55,049
it takes 13 days for the
soul of a dead person

376
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:56,934
to transition to the eternal.

377
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,898
If the deceased's
desires aren't satisfied,

378
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:00,788
they get stuck in limbo.

379
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:04,007
They become Prayt
Yonee, a ghost.

380
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,096
I was thinking about Lily...

381
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:11,182
how she didn't die
on her own terms.

382
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,777
Something to say, Dr. Butler?

383
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,164
I'm-I'm sorry. It's just,

384
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,976
it looks like the caudate
lobe is encircling the IVC.

385
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,401
Should we tie off the
small hepatic veins?

386
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,004
In case they bleed when
we excise the tumor.

387
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,124
Not necessary. That's a
backup in case of error.

388
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:39,026
This is flawless.

389
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,328
Yes, sir.

390
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:45,833
Where's Dr. Jacoby?

391
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,718
Sent for psych eval.

392
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,153
What? Why?

393
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,343
She was roaming the
halls talking to herself.

394
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,094
So you want me to lie?

395
00:19:57,146 --> 00:20:00,147
They'll keep her in the
psych ward for 72 hours.

396
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,815
She's a frail, old woman.

397
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,283
So, yes, lie.

398
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:05,285
Just get the point across.

399
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,633
Given your multiple knee
surgeries, you should really...

400
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:08,956
Did you pull my medical history?

401
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:10,669
Johnson in Orthopedics
has this boot...

402
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:11,925
No!

403
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:14,878
Fine, but I won't quit.

404
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,142
She's grossly psychotic.
We're putting her on a hold.

405
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,667
Conrad. MRI results. Brain
bleed in her frontal lobe.

406
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,186
Well, that could explain
her hallucinations.

407
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,204
She needs surgery.

408
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:26,223
ASAP.

409
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,775
I have a brain bleed?

410
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:30,094
I had to tell 'em something.

411
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,646
B12 shots didn't
do a damn thing.

412
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:33,997
You have not changed.

413
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,816
Not at all.

414
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,150
Sometimes we wish he would.

415
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,169
Who is this handsome young man?

416
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,971
Devon Pravesh, Dr. Jacoby.

417
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:41,955
I've heard a lot about you.

418
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,190
All scandals, I hope.

419
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:47,043
Ah, lurid but very enjoyable.

420
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,479
We need to consider
a different diagnosis.

421
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,216
Another test, huh?
A PET scan or MRI?

422
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,201
No, no more tests.

423
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,970
You and I need to discuss
what's really going on.

424
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,790
How you feeling, Mr. Zhou?

425
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,722
Can you hear me?

426
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:03,243
Dr. Bell's surgery went well?

427
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:07,214
Well... the patient survived.

428
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,833
Am I missing something? Were
you expecting a different outcome?

429
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:11,396
Mr. Zhou, can
you look over here?

430
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:16,891
Get back.

431
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,244
-Hey, out! -BP 70/30.

432
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,446
- I need two units of PRBCs.
- Cycling again.

433
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,932
His pulse is getting weak.

434
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:26,511
Systolic is down to 50.

435
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,996
Can someone tell me
what's happening, please?

436
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,886
Page Dr. Okafor and Dr. Silva.

437
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:29,981
Patient needs the OR, stat.

438
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:31,266
Why Silva and Okafor?

439
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,434
That's Dr. Bell's patient.

440
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,624
He's bleeding internally.

441
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,876
My guess is it's
Dr. Bell's fault.

442
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,322
Now, you can
let him try to fix it,

443
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:39,266
or would you prefer
Mr. Zhou lives?

444
00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:49,523
Ladies and gentlemen, if I
could have your attention.

445
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:51,074
I'm Dr. Randolph Bell,

446
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,643
Mr. Zhou's surgeon.

447
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,111
We completed the
operation at about 2:50.

448
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,323
Blood pooling behind the IVC.

449
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,791
Yeah.

450
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,526
Clamps for me and Dr. Okafor.

451
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,095
No one tied off
the hepatic veins.

452
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,264
Who removes the
caudate without...?

453
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,261
Dr. Bell said it was
a waste of time.

454
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:20,237
He should've known better.
In over his head, as usual.

455
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:22,756
Okay, infrahepatic
clamp's in place.

456
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,286
- Suturing now?
- What's going on?

457
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,590
Hey, how many people have to die

458
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,239
before you turn in
your scrubs, huh?

459
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,312
It doesn't matter
how great you were,

460
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,826
it's how great you
are, here and now.

461
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,316
You don't have it
anymore. It's time to retire.

462
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:36,203
How dare you? You
question my ability?

463
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,983
Not in my OR.
Not in my hospital.

464
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:41,308
I see incompetence, I
call it out. End of story.

465
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:42,594
And this isn't your hospital.

466
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:44,173
I've operated on
more patients...

467
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,324
You didn't tie off
the hepatic veins.

468
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:47,114
You caused a tear in the IVC.

469
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:49,260
Now, a second-year resident
doesn't make that mistake,

470
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,417
but you did.

471
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:03,830
Ted Zhou is my patient.

472
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:07,651
No. Not anymore he's not.

473
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,956
- I wanted you to see this place.
- Mm-hmm.

474
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:17,795
Have a simple conversation.

475
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:22,316
- I know it would do me some good.
- Fine. About what?

476
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,784
Ghosts.

477
00:23:24,854 --> 00:23:26,814
You think the ones
you see are real?

478
00:23:26,856 --> 00:23:30,340
Oh. Now, that's a
complicated question.

479
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,810
They...

480
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:36,347
They're as real as
human regret or guilt.

481
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,382
I keep thinking they
want something.

482
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,051
Are they angry?

483
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,154
Or do they blame me?

484
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:47,357
Sadly, they can't speak.

485
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,393
So what I want most of all

486
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,379
is to undo the mistakes.

487
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:55,216
And I can't.

488
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,206
Dr. Jacoby.

489
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,859
Depression is a
very powerful illness,

490
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:07,394
we both know that.

491
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,413
Would you consider
the possibility

492
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,676
that depression with
psychotic effect could lead to...

493
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,200
Hallucinations. Yeah.

494
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:15,536
Yes.

495
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:17,415
Well, I have good
reason to be depressed.

496
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:20,223
My career is over, my best
years are behind me, and...

497
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,875
You've had a wonderful career.

498
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,579
Broken down barriers.
Trained so many great doctors.

499
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:29,366
You are an inspiration.

500
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:34,020
- And you saved so many lives.
- But I lost so many as well.

501
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,774
I carry around a small
cemetery in my brain.

502
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:40,227
You took on the riskiest cases
and had so many triumphs.

503
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,262
Yeah, well, joy
leaves too quickly

504
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,264
and sorrow rudely overstays.

505
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,582
Over the course of 40 years,

506
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,278
not every outcome
is gonna be perfect.

507
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:49,335
The only thing any
of us can hope for

508
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,822
is the good we do far
outweighs the harm.

509
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:04,835
No amount of talk is going
to change the past, Conrad.

510
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:09,323
There are some
memories you can't escape.

511
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:22,536
He's still Chief of Surgery.
He could have you fired.

512
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,125
Dr. Bell,

513
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,293
I, uh...

514
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:31,528
I lost my temper earlier.

515
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,614
Heat of the moment.

516
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:36,116
We could use a hand.

517
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:39,486
Maybe you can run
the patient's bowel.

518
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:42,472
Hey, Dr. Silva, you don't invite
me back into my own surgery.

519
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,424
I'll make that call.

520
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:46,338
But you're right,
you do need help.

521
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:47,927
You crossed a line.

522
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:50,130
Duly noted.

523
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,499
Step aside.

524
00:26:08,351 --> 00:26:11,752
There's an obstructive mass.

525
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:16,423
We'll have to resect it and
look for other metastasis.

526
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,310
I'll save his life.

527
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:30,303
Dr. Silva.

528
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:36,493
Another tour of duty
or another hospital.

529
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,362
That's your future.

530
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:43,099
The board will be revoking
your privileges at Chastain.

531
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,391
What was that all about?

532
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,028
You know, in 1980 the
Shah of Iran was sick.

533
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:59,215
Had to have his spleen removed.

534
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,566
They brought in the most
famous doctor in the world,

535
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,587
Michael DeBakey.

536
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,200
Now, DeBakey
was a heart surgeon.

537
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,202
You know, he'd only done
a handful of splenectomies

538
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:08,475
his entire career.

539
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,211
But operating on the Shah, well,

540
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,081
that was an honor
he just couldn't resist.

541
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,383
He botched the operation,

542
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:19,603
and ten days later, the
Shah died from complications.

543
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,441
DeBakey never once
admitted his mistake.

544
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,843
That was 40 years ago,

545
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,895
and nothing's changed.

546
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,323
Mina, I need your help.

547
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:46,129
You tried your best,

548
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,464
and I appreciate it,
but enough is enough.

549
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,801
Dr. Okafor has a favor
to ask before you go.

550
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,453
There is an operating microscope

551
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:55,872
in OR Three that I
cannot rebalance.

552
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:58,625
I've tried a dozen times.
They were your specialty.

553
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,528
I was wondering if
you might help me.

554
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,581
Oh. Well, I suppose
I have the time.

555
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:07,968
Not like they're knocking my
door down to do a TED Talk.

556
00:28:08,037 --> 00:28:10,370
Shall we?

557
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,101
Really?

558
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,469
So the way I see it,
you have two options.

559
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,239
One, you continue to hobble
around here like an ass.

560
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,035
Eventually you'll
completely tear your ligament

561
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:32,359
and require surgery.

562
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:35,062
Or two, you pick one of these.

563
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:39,733
Conrad.

564
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,671
You didn't listen
to Nic about Lane.

565
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:46,807
I believed her.

566
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:48,475
You didn't.

567
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:51,645
I saved Lily once. You lost her.

568
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:54,481
But you get to be the only
one around here in pain?

569
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,966
Uh-uh.

570
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,535
Don't malign me as a doctor,

571
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,564
keeping me from
treating your foot.

572
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:05,559
For Lily, I was a better
doctor than you were.

573
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:15,335
It's been weeks since
anyone's been able to use it.

574
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,861
I tried to rebalance, but the
stabilizer arm won't sit still.

575
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,676
Oh. Ooh.

576
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,474
- That's not good.
- Yeah.

577
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:28,799
Perhaps you could give it a try?

578
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:35,505
It's been quite a while. I'm
not sure I remember how.

579
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:37,924
Well, what harm
could it do, huh?

580
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:44,764
Okay. No...

581
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,601
- Was it me? Not the machine?
- No, the counterbalance is off.

582
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:53,740
We have to raise
the arm like so.

583
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,409
And...

584
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:03,083
And then refocus the optics.

585
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:04,767
There.

586
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,786
That should help.

587
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,755
There.

588
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,109
Poetry.

589
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,744
Oh, my.

590
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,612
Strange how good this feels.

591
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:20,801
I always used to be terrified
at the start of an operation.

592
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:25,538
You know, in neurosurgery,
the margin of error is so slim.

593
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:29,393
But as soon as I felt
these controls in my hands,

594
00:30:29,445 --> 00:30:32,245
the fear would just disappear.

595
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,681
I'm sorry.

596
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,501
I'm a silly old woman getting
emotional over a machine.

597
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:43,056
I am very emotional
about machines.

598
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:46,926
People, not so much.

599
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:48,177
Thank you.

600
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:51,715
Oh. Oh, my dear.
Fixing it was nothing.

601
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:55,335
No. For being my hero.

602
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,825
Mr. Zhou, you came through
the surgery with flying colors.

603
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,597
But there was a complication.

604
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:26,895
During the course
of removing the tumor

605
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,886
- from your liver...
- Is there something wrong?

606
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:34,207
I found a single metastatic mass

607
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:37,210
in your intestine causing an
obstruction, which I removed,

608
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,845
all of it.

609
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:40,792
Now, we're still waiting
on the pathology,

610
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,515
but you should be in the clear.

611
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,734
You truly are a great
surgeon, Dr. Bell.

612
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:53,574
A small token of
my appreciation.

613
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:01,768
Is this...?

614
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,053
It's real, of course.

615
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:06,039
24 karats.

616
00:32:06,108 --> 00:32:08,709
I would be insulted
if you didn't accept it.

617
00:32:08,777 --> 00:32:11,194
Well, if you insist, I...

618
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,838
I'd like to stay for a
moment if that's all right.

619
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,840
Of course... but I have surgery.

620
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,942
I'll close up the room,

621
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,105
and I'll make sure the
lights are off, I promise.

622
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:29,813
Okay.

623
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,348
Thanks.

624
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:46,680
I'm sorry.

625
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:57,374
I did my best.

626
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:19,896
How's the patient?

627
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,165
Resting peacefully,
thanks to you.

628
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:28,988
So, I kind of got
into a bit of a thing

629
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,856
with Bell in the OR earlier.

630
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,992
I know. It's all
anyone's talking about.

631
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:35,728
Hmm. I'm done at this hospital.

632
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:38,014
Jude, you're one of the best.

633
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,843
- You'll survive.
- No, not this time.

634
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:43,569
No, the bridge is
burned... for good.

635
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:46,773
I just wanted to tell you, um,

636
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:48,642
how sorry I am about Lily.

637
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,862
Thank you.

638
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,583
I'll see you around, Nic.

639
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:59,886
See you around, Jude.

640
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:12,848
You really need to get
that looked at, Conrad.

641
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:14,951
Spoke to our head of psychiatry.

642
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,388
She offered to start seeing
you herself next week.

643
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,008
Depression needs
to be fought head-on.

644
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:24,088
The world needs
more doctors like you.

645
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:27,680
Which is why I've decided
to go back to teaching.

646
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,199
That sounds like a perfect
way to let go of the past.

647
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,834
Live forward with purpose.

648
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,921
And forgive ourselves.

649
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,509
You lost someone as well, hmm?

650
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,812
Recently?

651
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,885
Then you need
to live forward, too.

652
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:07,754
Come in.

653
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:09,172
Hey.

654
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:12,775
So, I, uh, heard
you had a bad day.

655
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,097
Listen, you saved
a man's life today.

656
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,734
You're an incredible
surgeon, Randolph.

657
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,302
People are jealous.

658
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,281
The higher we
rise in this world,

659
00:35:24,305 --> 00:35:27,907
the more the little people
want to bring us down.

660
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:31,127
But you, my friend,
you can fight it.

661
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:34,114
I have, believe me.

662
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:41,103
Could get ten grand
for this... maybe.

663
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:44,007
You don't need the
money, a man like you.

664
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,876
I sunk two million bucks
into a motel in Conyers,

665
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:49,762
a million and a half on the
Bell Tool, and the divorce...

666
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:53,132
That was...

667
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:55,802
the most recent blow.

668
00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:59,906
Oh, I'm good at a lot of
things. Money isn't one of them.

669
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:03,276
Unbelievable.
After all the billing

670
00:36:03,344 --> 00:36:05,339
you generate for
Chastain every year.

671
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:08,281
- None of it in my pocket.
- You know where it ends up.

672
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:10,149
In the pocket of our CEO.

673
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:12,296
Claire Thorpe makes
three million dollars a year.

674
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,971
Yeah. She's not even a doctor.

675
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,018
She's a complete
incompetent, if you ask me.

676
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:19,408
I mean, all that nonsense
about transparency.

677
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,144
Exposes us to lawsuits,

678
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:24,297
forces us to practice
defensive medicine.

679
00:36:24,366 --> 00:36:26,343
You know, she's
destroying this hospital.

680
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:29,852
We need to have a
physician running Chastain,

681
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,838
not an MBA.

682
00:36:31,907 --> 00:36:34,090
I mean, you could
do the job, Randolph.

683
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,125
You'd be great at it.

684
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,928
I mean, not that you'd
want to do it, of course.

685
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,984
Let's have that drink.

686
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:54,277
Cheers.

687
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,818
What?

688
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,873
What are you thinking?

689
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:09,676
Nothing.

690
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:13,546
♪ You remember ♪

691
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,835
♪ You remember my love... ♪

692
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,052
Really getting into this, huh?

693
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:26,475
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's a good look on you.

694
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,211
You and Bell kiss and make up?

695
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,648
Uh, you ever checked out
Doctors Without Borders?

696
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:34,484
They send you to hot
spots all over the globe.

697
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:36,185
Yeah, I know about 'em.

698
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,121
What are you talking about?

699
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,067
Saving lives while
people shoot at you...

700
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,024
It's kind of my speed.

701
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,343
They're doing real
good in the world.

702
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:48,014
Jude, I'll walk into
Bell's office right now...

703
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:49,815
No, no, no, no.

704
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:52,785
I stayed at Chastain
for the wrong reasons.

705
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:53,931
And I should have
gone with my gut

706
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:56,455
a long time ago and moved on.

707
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,559
That's the truth.

708
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:01,961
We both know it.

709
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:08,584
You said... Nic deserves me.

710
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,133
You said I can give
her what you can't.

711
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,174
Yeah, and?

712
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:17,159
Lily's death.

713
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,245
She's hurting pretty bad.

714
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:22,015
You see, I want to
help her, but I can't.

715
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:25,101
I'm not the guy that's
gonna make it better for her.

716
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,089
Only you can do that.

717
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:34,126
Hey.

718
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,716
Stay safe.

719
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,268
Brother.

720
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:07,643
Nic.

721
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,753
You never got X-rays, did you?

722
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,641
I'm not here to
talk about my ankle.

723
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,759
Your ankle's getting worse.

724
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,345
Honestly, it's killing me.

725
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:36,289
Come on, I'll drive you.

726
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:39,976
Take you three days to get
home on that stupid scooter.

727
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:49,935
Been a while since
I've been here.

728
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:52,171
The stairs were fun.

729
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,191
Well, we made it. Go sit down.

730
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,629
Ice pack's in...

731
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,599
First aid kit's still
on top of the...

732
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:07,353
Right, you know.

733
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:22,885
Give me your foot.

734
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,290
I'm not a doctor. I'm
not gonna hurt you.

735
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,213
Oh, my God.

736
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,565
You know, if you would have
let me do this this morning,

737
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:43,322
it wouldn't have gotten so bad.

738
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:46,142
But things are never that
simple with you, are they?

739
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:53,282
Nic?

740
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:56,536
I should have
listened to you sooner,

741
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:59,939
believed what you said
about Lane, but I just...

742
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:04,059
I didn't.

743
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:08,414
Keep it elevated,

744
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:10,466
ice it every hour,

745
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:13,036
take an anti-inflammatory.
You know the drill.

746
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:15,221
Please.

747
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,324
I don't want to do this.

748
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:22,861
I just... I can't.

749
00:41:24,432 --> 00:41:26,448
What do you want me to say?

750
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:28,817
Nothing.

751
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:32,438
Because it's not your fault.

752
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:35,458
It's mine.

753
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:42,297
And Lily's gone.

754
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,235
It's killing me.

755
00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:49,338
But that is no excuse
not to see your pain.

756
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:57,112
