You're the only one who
can keep an eye on them

162

I've been thinking a
lot about that case, too.

177
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,770
I always say, never give
up, but sometimes, I ought to.

178
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,371
I don't agree.

179
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,974
You've pulled off
some miraculous cures.

180
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,310
I've also seen a lot of people
that should have gone home

181
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,715
die alone in our ICU, getting
chemo that wasn't working.

182
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,785
The tricky part is that
you just never know

183
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,319
who can beat the odds.

184
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,748
Trying to make that call
must be incredibly hard on you.

185
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,392
It is... actually.

186
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,463
No one thinks about
the effect on doctors

187
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,077
when they have to
watch their patients suffer.

188
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,335
That bone marrow transplant
I almost gave to Lily...

189
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,722
I wake up in a cold sweat
every night thinking about it.

190
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,891
- No one is perfect.
- I have to be.

191
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,843
There's too much at stake.

192
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,779
I cannot make
mistakes like that ever.

193
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,083
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
for getting emotional.

194
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,818
Not at all.

195
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,587
You care.

196
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,874
That's why you're
a great doctor.

197
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,443
Oh. Thank you.

198
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:34,816
Thank you, Conrad.

199
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,553
I'll see you later.

200
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,269
I lost two pounds.

201
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,338
That was the foot, Chad.

202
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:18,443
Comfort food.

203
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,894
You're diabetic.

204
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:23,681
This isn't on your
approved diet.

205
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,217
You're my doctor, not my nanny.

206
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,486
I can't help you if you
don't help yourself.

207
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,787
Look, I'm not married.

208
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,288
I don't have a girlfriend.

209
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,790
I live with my mother.

210
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,171
There's only one thing that gets
me out of bed in the morning...

211
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,956
A Belgian waffle with
whipped cream on it.

212
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,914
Food can be an addiction.

213
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:41,727
It is my job to get
you on a diet plan

214
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:43,484
and a new exercise program.

215
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,653
Um...

216
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:47,739
maybe next time.

217
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,658
Where's my foot?

218
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,723
Come on, Edna,
where's the puppy?

219
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,229
I don't know what you mean.

220
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,665
I saw you put Cookie
under your lap blanket.

221
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,684
I found her in the hall.

222
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,837
But when Harold took me outside
to the courtyard, she got away.

223
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:05,923
I couldn't catch her.

224
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,753
All right. I'll call security

225
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:09,338
and see if they can
look for her outside.

226
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,979
This is just awful.

227
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,272
Oh!

228
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,957
Precious. Mm.

229
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:24,726
Hey!

230
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:29,213
Yes. We love you.

231
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,715
Do you understand
how serious this is?

232
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,719
I'm the healthiest fat
guy you've ever seen.

233
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,187
You aren't healthy,
Chad. You have diabetes

234
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,001
and worsening peripheral
vascular disease.

235
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,937
When am I cutting
off your other foot?

236
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,773
- Never.
- We'll get it for sure
if you don't shape up.

237
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,942
Might have to take the
next one above the knee.

238
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,965
Start picking out a wheelchair.

239
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,902
She always like that?

240
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,420
Pretty much.

241
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,824
Check out these puppies.

242
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,844
You could take one home.

243
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:02,513
A dog is a great way to
start a walking program.

244
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,548
He needs a forever home.

245
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,084
- You need an exercise buddy.
- Oh.

246
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:11,605
Oh! Well, either he likes me
or he tastes chocolate frosting.

247
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,325
His name is Donut.

248
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,977
Karma.

249
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:20,998
They'd've named
him Quinoa, no deal.

250
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,000
How you feeling?

251
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,736
I'm flying high on
some pretty fine drugs.

252
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,056
We'll have to adjust those,
because I have some news.

253
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,644
You're pregnant.

254
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,326
Are you sure?

255
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,867
I'm positive.

256
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,904
Oh, my God, that's fantastic.

257
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,990
We've been trying
for almost two years.

258
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,920
We even tried IVF,
but nothing worked.

259
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:51,162
I cannot wait to...
tell my husband.

260
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,097
Excellent.

261
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,150
The OB team is coming in to
make sure all is well with the baby.

262
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:58,819
They'll do an ultrasound,
see how far along you are.

263
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:00,688
Check the baby's heart.

264
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,935
I'm also ordering an X-ray
to check your abdomen.

265
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,125
Is that... is that
safe for the baby?

266
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:06,827
Absolutely.

267
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:12,800
Conrad...

268
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,069
you have no idea
what this means to me.

269
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:17,071
I have a damn good idea.

270
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,018
We both came
from broken families.

271
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,075
You always wanted
kids of your own.

272
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:25,980
I'm so happy for you.

273
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,853
Go on.

274
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,122
Ask me anything.
I know you want to.

275
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,029
Why didn't you marry her?

276
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:47,952
She left me after I punched
my father in the nose

277
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:50,103
- at the rehearsal dinner.
- Wow.

278
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,051
He told Catherine I
didn't really love her

279
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,959
and that the marriage was gonna
be a disaster, so I decked him.

280
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,411
Right in front of the
guests, including her family.

281
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,879
No, you didn't.

282
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:01,299
I did. And I had a
fine time doing it, but...

283
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,554
Kate was afraid he was right.

284
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:09,857
And how do you
feel about her now?

285
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,460
I did love her.

286
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:14,245
I don't love her anymore.

287
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:18,048
But I care about her very
much, and I want to fix her.

288
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,845
Congratulations.

289
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:33,347
Your divorce is final.

290
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,383
Highway robbery.

291
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,295
Well, I hope you made
a bundle on the house.

292
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,054
I barely paid off the
mortgage. I bought it in 2008

293
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,723
at the height of the market, and
now I'll be shelling out alimony

294
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,725
for the next ten years.

295
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,148
What's this?

296
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:54,251
My bill. It's three
months past due.

297
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,953
I'm sorry, Randolph, but...

298
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,142
we're gonna have to
start charging interest.

299
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,580

OB says she's six weeks

All her symptoms

Now, tell me, what do you see?

307

Dilated bowel loops

Surgery?

310
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,753
Standard of care is
non-op management first.

311
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,622
And abdominal surgery on a
pregnant woman? That's risky.

312
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:13,547
Priya's here.

313
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,461
I don't think you've
formally met yet.

314
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:18,119
Priya, this is Dr. Conrad
Hawkins and Nic Nevin.

315
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:20,516
- Thank you for helping us,
Priya.
- Of course.

316
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,356
Priya is a journalist, and she's

317
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:25,092
researching a cancer
cluster for a story.

318
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,472
I asked her if she could
find any information

319
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,073
- on Dr. Hunter's patients.
- I used

320
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:31,015
social media posts to find
people Dr. Hunter treated,

321
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,062
and I ended up talking
to about 15 people.

322
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,986
- What did you find?
- All of them

323
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,104
had good things to
say about Dr. Hunter.

324
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:39,573
Many repeated the same
line. "She saved my life."

325
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,837
Did any of the patients
have health problems

326
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,276
that were caused by the doses?

327
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:45,312
Two had heart damage.

328
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,315
One was infertile.
Bone density decreased.

329
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,151
One man lost all his teeth.

330
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,156
None of that is
unusual with chemo.

331
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,649
The most amazing thing I found

332
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,251
was four patients
had a total remission

333
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,209
for cancers that are
considered incurable.

334
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,323
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

335
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,547
Total remissions for
cancers that are incurable?

336
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,048
I mean, it sounds incredible.

337
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,229
And it does show we
have a steep hill to climb.

338
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,098
Miraculous cures can be
used to justify her doses.

339
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,055
I get it. She's your mentor.

340
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,224
- But you got to trust me.
- I talked to her,

341
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,271
and she seemed genuinely
crushed by the error

342
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,375
she almost made with
Lily. She cried, Nic.

343
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,281
- She cried? She is an excellent liar.
- Yes.

344
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,484
And she will be just that good
on the stand if we get that far.

345
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:25,614
We have to be careful.
Lane is highly respected.

346
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,483
She makes millions
of dollars for Chastain.

347
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,224
If we take her on and lose,
our careers will be over.

348
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,243
I can't believe you're worried
about your career right now.

349
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,890
All I'm saying is,
if by some chance

350
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,892
that second opinion
comes back in Lane's favor,

351
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,894
don't do anything until
we get more information.

352
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,879
People could be dying,
Conrad, and you want me to wait

353
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:43,343
for more information? I thought
you knew me better than that.

354
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:46,040
But then again, why should I
be surprised? Since, apparently,

355
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:48,075
I never really knew you either.

356
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,896
<i>It's too good to be true.</i>

357
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,897
Something's wrong here.

358
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,700
Then I'll dig deeper.

359
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,401
And I'll cheer you up at dinner.

360
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,071
Do you have anything
special planned?

361
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,872
Today's the 28th, right?

362
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,875
30th.

363
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,194
Oh, Priya, you
should've said something.

364
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:08,128
I've been so busy at work

365
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:10,330
I completely lost track of time.

366
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,633
Happy birthday.

367
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,253
Whoa.

368
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,289
Mina,

369
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,958
where can I get an
amazing present for Priya

370
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,004
that I can have
delivered in two hours?

371
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,507
You're so asking
the wrong person.

372
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,397
I could order flowers, but...

373
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:28,410
I don't know... it's not
enough. It's her birthday.

374
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,262
I don't understand
about birthdays.

375
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:32,197
What does it matter
what day you were born?

376
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,305
It matters to every
woman I've ever known.

377
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,639
Not this one.

378
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,458
Mina, have you
ever been in love?

379
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,272
Don't do that. Don't
ask stupid questions.

380
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:42,379
- Too personal?
- No, no, not personal.

381
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,715
I said "stupid." You're a
doctor. You should know

382
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,745
that romantic love is just a
trick the brain plays on you

383
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,036
to get you to pump out babies.

384
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,289
Thank you for coming to
meet with me, Randolph.

385
00:19:57,313 --> 00:19:59,007
It's always a pleasure,
Claire. What can I do for you?

386
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,009
Well, after our last board
meeting, I did some digging

387
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,377
and found out we're
doing a really poor job

388
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,401
at monitoring our own errors.

389
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,005
Surgical errors can be easily
covered up just by saying that

390
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,985
- they're complications.
- Well...

391
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,176
I think you can trust
the doctors at Chastain.

392
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,244
Apparently not.
According to Medscape,

393
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,513
21% of physicians feel it's okay

394
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,527
to hide a mistake
that harms a patient

395
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,584
under certain circumstances.

396
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,789
- That is shocking.
- Isn't it?

397
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:27,007
So I have decided

398
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:28,787
to shine a light
on the physicians

399
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,362
that have the highest
rate of complications

400
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,963
and get rid of them.

401
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,348
That's a radical move.

402
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,712
You know, to be brutally honest,

403
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,252
we cannot handle
one more lawsuit.

404
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:44,208
How can I help?

405
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,310
I have installed
recording devices

406
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,362
on every camera in every OR.

407
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,426
Starting today,
there will be no hiding

408
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,951
from problematic
performances or outcomes.

409
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,401
After you've rested a bit,
Dr. Pravesh is gonna place

410
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,557
a nasogastric tube

411
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,554
that will empty the
contents of your stomach.

412
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:03,877
It should relieve the pain

413
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:06,313
and hopefully
resolve the blockage.

414
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:08,699
It's not a pleasant procedure,

415
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,613
but there is a good chance
that it'll make it possible

416
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,186
for you to avoid surgery.

417
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:14,415
Let's redraw another
set of labs, and page me

418
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,206
as soon as we have the results.

419
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,259
Nic is gonna take
great care of you.

420
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,694
- Thank you so much.
- We'll catch up more later.

421
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:22,046
Okay.

422
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,264
Devon.

423
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:31,421
Conrad is so different.

424
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,024
He's nothing like the guy

425
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,771
<i>I</i> almost married.

426
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,295
Oh, yeah? What was he like?

427
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,281
He was a wild man.

428
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,483
A real rebel.

429
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,737
Which was, um,
part of the appeal.

430
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:50,541
But he was always
emotionally distant.

431
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:53,627
He, um... wouldn't let me in.

432
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:56,613
Sounds like he
hasn't changed at all.

433
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,448
No, he has.

434
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,567
He's so, um...

435
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:03,037
so grown-up

436
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:06,573
and, um, responsible and...

437
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:08,925
- gentle.
- Well, that is because

438
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,260
you're his patient.

439
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,262
Okay, you're gonna feel...

440
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,064
a little prick here.

441
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,432
There we go.

442
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,285
How long have you
been in love with him?

443
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,323
What makes you say that?

444
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,626
You're, um...

445
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:31,164
you're wearing the
ring he gave you.

446
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:40,340
Belonged to his mother.

447
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:41,658
Did you know that?

448
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:45,562
No.

449
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:48,432
He loved her very much.

450
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,381
You must mean
a great deal to him

451
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,170
if he gave it to you.

452
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,798
Lane Hunter.

453
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,194
<i>Dr. Hunter.</i>

454
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,517
This is Dr. Mary Osder.

455
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,397
I think we met
once at a conference

456
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,166
on advances in breast
cancer management.

457
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,484
<i>Of course. You were the keynote.</i>

458
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,341
How can I help you, Mary?

459
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,738
<i>I've just had a call
from one of your patients</i>

460
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:17,694
who's looking for
a second opinion.

461
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,964
<i>Okay. Happy to help. Who is it?</i>

462
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,249
Uh, Lily Kendall.

463
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,584
Well, that's surprising.

464
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,387
I mean, Lily's had a rough
road, but she's in the middle

465
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:29,400
of what we expect is
her final round of chemo.

466
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:30,641
<i>Rough road, indeed.</i>

467
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:32,237
I'll do a full
review of her case,

468
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:33,460
so I'll need her records.

469
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:35,395
Of course.

470
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:38,616
I'll get you everything from
her current treatment plan.

471
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,679
Well, you know as well as
I do that won't be sufficient.

472
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:42,269
I'll need everything

473
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,183
<i>going back to her
original diagnosis</i>

474
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:45,850
<i>and the doctor who
first referred her.</i>

475
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:48,041
Absolutely. Not a problem.

476
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,612
You know, Mary, I am
so glad she came to you.

477
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,498
Um, who can I
thank for this referral?

478
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,661
I believe she got my
name from a terrific nurse

479
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,725
I've known for several
years, Nic Nevin.

480
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:08,362
Are you ever in surgery?

481
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:10,425
You've been playing
with that dog all day.

482
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,628
I am in love with Lifesaver,
and I'm taking him home.

483
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:15,436
Puppies are way
better than boyfriends.

484
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,974
I'll take that one.

485
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,926
Jellybean?

486
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,778
This will definitely work.

487
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,644
- What's going on?
- Catherine's labs.

488
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,512
Not good. Her white
count and lactate.

489
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,919
Her bowels are
being strangulated.

490
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,774
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

491
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,476
Help me.

492
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,239
- Right here. I'm right here.
- Okay.

493
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:43,680
She's tachy at 137.

494
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,249
BP's dropping.

495
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,483
Diffuse guarding.

496
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:47,862
I think her intestines
are getting ischemic.

497
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,498
She needs emergency
exploratory surgery.

498
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:50,454
Who's on call for gen surg?

499
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:52,255
- Dr. Bell.
- Damn it.

500
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,808
And now they're calling
me to the ER. Devon?

501
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:56,276
I got it. Nic.

502
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:57,756
- Okay.
- Got it.

503
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,096
You're good. You're
good. You're good.

504
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,063
It's Lily Kendall. They
were called to her home.

505
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,603
She's hypotensive, vomiting.

506
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,238
They're having a hard time

507
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,667
getting her blood
pressure up with fluids.

508
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:10,768
She thinks it's a reaction

509
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,104
- to the chemo this morning.
- Lily.

510
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:14,361
It's Dr. Pravesh. We're
here for you, okay?

511
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,941
- What's her IV access?
- She got a 22 in her hand.

512
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:17,692
It's going really slow. We
couldn't get another line.

513
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,027
She feels cold.
Place a large bore

514
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,662
antecubital line and
bowl us two liters.

515
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,330
Send off a lactate
and blood cultures.

516
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,565
Grab cefepime
to cover for sepsis.

517
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,899
I need a warming
blanket over here.

518
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,790
- How is she?
- She's in shock.

519
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,376
We're waiting on labs, but she's
hypotensive and hypothermic.

520
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,456
We need to know exactly what
drugs she got and the dosages.

521
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,841
Of course. She's on HiDAC chemo.

522
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,666
Cytarabine, 3,000
milligrams per meter squared.

523
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:43,991
Catherine's being prepped
for surgery. What's going on?

524
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,526
It's Lily.

525
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:47,806
She had a severe reaction
to her chemo this morning.

526
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,364
We're admitting her.

527
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,538
Oh, God.

528
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,376
- Dr. Bell.
- I have to scrub in.

529
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,192
Who's the first woman
you ever fell in love with?

530
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,365
You on drugs?

531
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:26,628
What kind of question is that?

532
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:27,712
Your first great passion.

533
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:29,102
The one who changed your life.

534
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,154
- My first great passion...
- Mm-hmm.

535
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:32,851
Was surgery. My
father took me to see

536
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,636
an operation when
I was ten years old.

537
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,104
It's the only
love that's lasted.

538
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,061
My first great passion

539
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,397
is the woman you're
about to operate on tonight.

540
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,602
Who are you?

541
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,215
'Cause you're not
Conrad Hawkins.

542
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,890
Must be one of your
ham-fisted manipulations.

543
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,343
'Cause we don't talk like this,

544
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,655
and we're not
about to start now.

545
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,839
I understand why you can't

546
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,462
walk away. I get it.

547
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,409
But this woman is
deeply important to me,

548
00:26:58,433 --> 00:26:59,962
and she's pregnant.
Two lives are at stake.

549
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,296
Well, let me spell
this out for you.

550
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,553
It's emergency surgery.

551
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,321
I contacted Jude.

552
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,474
He's already here.

553
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,426
He'll take it.

554
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,817
I have 30 years of
experience you can't match.

555
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:20,404
A lifetime of work
to testify to my ability.

556
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,821
You're a rank amateur

557
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,534
who deludes himself
that he's learned

558
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,953
to play the game, but
you just break things,

559
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,761
and that is gonna catch
up with you in the end.

560
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,579
I've done probably...

561
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,882
a thousand similar procedures.

562
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:33,700
Do I need to do one tonight?

563
00:27:33,768 --> 00:27:36,570
Not particularly.

564
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,777
You owe me.

565
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,279
It was too much.

566
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,248
I-I don't want

567
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,684
any more chemo.

568
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:07,929
Hush, honey.

569
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:09,073
Every one of my patients

570
00:28:09,138 --> 00:28:11,822
has said that at some point.

571
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,673
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

572
00:28:13,742 --> 00:28:14,958
Devon, come with me.

573
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,528
I'm going to stay with her.

574
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,988
Dr. Pravesh,

575
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,340
please help me.

576
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,958
I'm scared.

577
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:35,962
It's okay. You're safe now.

578
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:40,167
Nurse Nevin. Can
we talk for a moment?

579
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,769
- Sure.
- I was wondering

580
00:28:42,838 --> 00:28:45,238
if you would take over
supervising Lily's care again.

581
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,774
Starting immediately.

582
00:28:47,842 --> 00:28:49,309
I don't understand.

583
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:50,661
I-I know.

584
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,773
We started off
on the wrong foot,

585
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,580
and it was entirely my fault.

586
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,199
These last few weeks,
I've come to realize

587
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,979
that you're one of the
finest nurse practitioners

588
00:28:58,003 --> 00:28:58,835
we have at Chastain.

589
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,004
Lily needs you.

590
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,740
And she deserves to have you.

591
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,112
Well, I'd do anything for Lily.

592
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:10,930
Thank you.

593
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,524
Thanks for coming in

594
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,105
- on your day off.
- Yeah, of course, man.

595
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:24,806
She's about six weeks
pregnant, so you'll need

596
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,040
to be extra careful
around the uterus.

597
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,698
I know what I'm doing.

598
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,744
Nic told me all about
her, okay? Don't stress.

599
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,984
I looked at the imaging.

600
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:32,385
I'll lyse the adhesions,

601
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:33,949
remove any of the
unhealthy segments,

602
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,840
and she can be
home in a couple days.

603
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,775
Wait.

604
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,780
About Nic...

605
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,718
Two women left me
for the same reason.

606
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,786
You deserve Nic.

607
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:53,857
You can give her what I can't.

608
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,985
Thank you.

609
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,657
All right.

610
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,092
Incise the peritoneum.

611
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,726
I'll fix this sucker.

612
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:15,012
Opening now.

613
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,399
Her-her abdomen.
It's filled with blood.

614
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,084
All right. Find where
it's coming from.

615
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:27,908
I can't tell.

616
00:30:27,977 --> 00:30:29,109
I can't see a thing.

617
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:33,141
- Pressure's dropping.
- All right, stay calm, everyone.

618
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,809
I need lap pads, and
hook up more suction.

619
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,015
Call the blood bank now.

620
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,090
Suction.

621
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,692
What's happening?

622
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,827
She's bleeding internally.

623
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,112
It's not the bowel.

624
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,181
No ischemia.

625
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:51,898
Packing to find the source.

626
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,296
BP's down to 65.

627
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,160
Hang two units wide open.

628
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:17,052
Come on, come on. Go, go.

629
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:18,076
Come on.

630
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,087
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

631
00:31:21,864 --> 00:31:23,524
We need more blood.

632
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,848
Call for the rapid infuser.

633
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,997
Activate the massive
transfusion protocol.

634
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,327
Checked the liver.
No, no bleeding.

635
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,236
No bleeding in the aorta

636
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:40,880
or IVC, either.

637
00:31:47,189 --> 00:31:48,254
Come on.

638
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,712
Damn it.

639
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:13,380
Come on, we're losing her.

640
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:16,066
She has an ectopic.
It must have ruptured.

641
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,196
You said it was an
intrauterine pregnancy.

642
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,787
She has both. There's a second
pregnancy in the right tube.

643
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,016
I just saw it on the
ultrasound. OB missed it.

644
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,225
Check the pelvis.

645
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,362
He's right.

646
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,126
I see bleeding at
the right mesosalpinx.

647
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,866
Clamp.

648
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,259
Bleeding is controlled.

649
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,669
Pressure's back up to 95.

650
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,152
Make sure to continue
the transfusion protocol.

651
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:59,108
I'll page GYN.

652
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:01,027
Thanks.

653
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:04,114
And we will continue
to fix the obstruction.

654
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:06,716
That was a close one.

655
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,218
Yeah.

656
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:22,516
Hey.

657
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,767
I heard there was a
complication. Is she okay?

658
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,135
We almost lost her.

659
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:28,788
What happened?

660
00:33:28,857 --> 00:33:30,990
She presented with an
ectopic ready to burst.

661
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:32,859
OB missed it, and it did.

662
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,128
In their defense, it was
entwined with the bowel.

663
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,397
That's super rare.
One in a 100,000?

664
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:40,150
Mina's gonna write
it up as a case report.

665
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:42,636
- Lily?
- She's doing better.

666
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:44,337
You here all night?

667
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:46,423
Yeah, I'll stay for them both.

668
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,454
Dr. Borden wanted
in Labor and Delivery.

669
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:53,580
Hey, Conrad?

670
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:56,115
Yeah.

671
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,302
When did your mom
give you this ring?

672
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,194
When I left for Afghanistan.

673
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:12,043
Why didn't you tell
me it belonged to her?

674
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:15,101
I wanted you to feel
like it was yours alone.

675
00:34:16,505 --> 00:34:18,665
She said, "Give it to
the love of your life."

676
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,416
You want it back?

677
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,088
No.

678
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,126
You earned it.

679
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,084
Pulmonary nurse dial 3665.

680
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:11,074
Look at you sitting up.

681
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,225
And is that a smile?

682
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,877
Please, can I hold it?

683
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,514
Oh, my God, Cookie.
I've been looking

684
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:19,243
for this little girl all day.

685
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:20,884
Hello. Come here, baby.

686
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,886
That's her name? Cookie?

687
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,171
Yeah.

688
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,176
Well, this goes against
all rules, but I don't care.

689
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:32,078
Here you go. There you go.

690
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:33,707
Hi.

691
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:35,648
Hi.

692
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,117
Can I keep her?

693
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:40,270
You can. She's all yours.

694
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:47,877
Hi.

695
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,366
Uh, Nic, I need you to give Lily

696
00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:58,004
a liter with 40
milliequivalents of potassium.

697
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,540
You sure you want
to give her that much?

698
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,520
Her renal function just
started trending toward normal.

699
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:05,211
Thank you for being so vigilant,

700
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,591
but low potassium levels
are not good for Lily's heart.

701
00:36:07,615 --> 00:36:09,215
Just give it to her slowly

702
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:11,312
over the entire shift
so she can handle it.

703
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,304
Okay. Got it.

704
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,039
I'm on my way out for the night.

705
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,685
Are you gonna be
around for a while?

706
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:20,176
Uh, I'm done in
the next 15 minutes,

707
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,189
but I'll make sure I
do this before I go.

708
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,830
Great. Thank you.

751

She's in V tach.
Pulse is thready.

752
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:27,724
- We need a crash cart now.
- Get her up.

753
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,916
Okay. Okay.

754
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:33,552
I'm dying. Please.

755
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:34,966

Stay with me. Stay with me.

758
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:39,692
Stay with me.

759
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,111
Let's get the pads on her.

760
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,514
Possible chemo-induced
cardiomyopathy.

761
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,716
Uh, go get her admission EKG.

762
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:51,170
Bolus 150 of amio
and start a drip.

763
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:55,491
We lost her pulse.

764
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,378
Charge to 200.

765
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,647
- Ready.
- Clear.

766
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,784
She's in V fib.

767
00:40:05,854 --> 00:40:07,804
Continue CPR, push one of epi.

768
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:13,592
Her EKG was normal. This is...

769
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,422
Call for a stat echo. Hold CPR.

770
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,864
- No pulse.
- Still V fib on the monitor.

771
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:21,934
Charge to 300.

772
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,354
- Ready.
- Clear.

773
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:36,165
Charge to 360!

774
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,528
- Ready.
- Clear.

775
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,570
That was our third round.

776
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,839
Push 100 of lidocaine

777
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:45,541
and shock again at 360.

778
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,461
Shock again at 360!

779
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,687
Come on, come on, come on.

780
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:00,306
Come on with that
lidocaine, come on.

781
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,277
Come on.

782
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,247
- Ready.
- Clear.

783
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:20,927
Asystole.

784
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,613
I got it. I got it, I got it.

785
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:51,824
Dr. Hawkins?

786
00:41:51,893 --> 00:41:53,826
Asystole for 20 minutes.

787
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:57,763
You got to call it.

788
00:41:57,832 --> 00:41:59,232
You have to stop now.

789
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,744
Time of death...

790
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,063
21:58.
