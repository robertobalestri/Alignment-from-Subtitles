<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- So I wanted to go out with you.

2
00:00:03,153 --> 00:00:04,619

5

<i>Closed off. Until I
learned to use that emotion</i>

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,662
- as fuel.
<i>- You were born</i>

7
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:16,898
to be a surgeon, Randolph.
But you're a damn good CEO.

8
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:18,578
<i>I think Lane's committing</i>

9
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,752
insurance fraud by
overtreating her patients.

10
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:22,465
- We have to do
something about Lane. <i>Nic,</i>

11
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,639
can we meet at the
clinic at 4:00 a.m.?

12

15
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:35,651

myself in a place like this,

with a man like you.

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,558
It just feels so... right.

18
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:47,162
You know, I sold my
house in Buckhead at a loss.

19

In debt. I was floundering.

20

me to go after that CEO job,

- Micah,

00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,397
you're a heart
transplant patient.

What was I supposed to do?
We both know Lane killed Lily.

shortness of breath,
thready pulse.

- More than a day?
- On three, two...

102
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,835
- Any chest pain?
- It started this morning.

103
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:48,544
- After...
- Exertion.

104
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,065
He needs inotropic support.

105
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:50,855
Start a dobutamine drip
at two and a half mics.

106
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,024
And add dopamine

107
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,654
for blood pressure support;
he needs a blood gas.

108
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:56,727
- I'll do it.
- Getting an EKG.

109
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,712
- We should add milrinone.
- Do it.

110
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,047
Start it peripherally,

111
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:01,232
and I'll add a central
line in the CCU.

112
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:02,662
Micah, we need your
heart beating stronger.

113
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:04,970
The drugs we're
giving you should help.

114
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,784
Could his body be
rejecting the heart?

115
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,408
Always possible.

116
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,742
Infection of the heart muscle?

117
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,106
- Myocarditis?
- We won't know

118
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,812

119
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,067
BP's 110/70.

120
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:20,501
He's tachy,

121
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,854
but no ST elevations
to suggest an infarction.

122
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,605
Get him to the cardiac ICU.

123
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,326

kidney failure,
post-hemodialysis.

138
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,578
He's delirious,
ataxic and aggressive.

How long has this been going on?

140
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,954
He has been worsening
progressively for three days.

141
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,951
Tests were inconclusive.

142
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,242

Right eye's fixed.

145
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,765
Ophthalmoplegia,
ataxia, confusion.

146
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:09,818
All signs of Wernicke's
encephalopathy.

147
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,671
The dialysis is causing him
to lose water-soluble vitamins.

148
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,500
He has acute
thiamine deficiency.

149
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,002
Give him 500
milligrams of thiamine

150
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:17,303
three times a day for two days.

151
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,592
A few weeks, he'll be fine.

How the hell does he do that?

153
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,598
It's infuriating.

154
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,600

- How we doing?
- You tell me.

180
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,915
He's not saying anything.
He's making me nervous.

181
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,573
Well, you look a damn sight
better than you did an hour ago.

182
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,058
This is just like a bump in
the road, right, Dr. Hawkins?

183
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,795
I was due some blowback
from that transplant.

184
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,664
I'll be right back.

185
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,287
I'll find out what's happening.

186
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,257
Okay.

187
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,266
Images from the echo.

188
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:06,912
What's this here, where
the heart's attached

189
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:08,514
- to the aorta?
- Aortic root dissection.

190
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:12,274
A complication of the
original transplant procedure.

191
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:15,577
Exertion caused a-a
rise in blood pressure,

192
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:18,446
which worsened a small tear.

193
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:20,248
So, surgery.

194
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,450
We repair the aortic
root before it worsens.

195
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:24,758
We try to avoid operating
on a transplanted heart.

196
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:26,532
Sometimes it
doesn't start again.

197
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,434
But it's possible.
It's been done.

198
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,224
Yes, but the mortality rates

199
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,271
from this type of surgery
are extremely high.

200
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,963
It's likely to kill him.

201
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,454
Obviously, this
is very bad news,

202
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,142
but... I don't accept it.

203
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,178
Excuse us.

204
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:52,113
Dr. Okafor?

205
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:01,289
I'll tell Micah.

206
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:03,491
What will you tell him?

207
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,859
He has no chance?

208
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:05,968
He's gonna die soon?

209
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:07,128
In the OR, or at home?

210
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:08,479
You're too emotionally involved.

211
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,949
I don't know what
you're talking about.

212
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,345
Uh, Mina, okay,
whatever you say, I just,

213
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:14,147
I think you should take a
step back, let me do my job.

214
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:15,103
Let me do mine.

215
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:18,305
Dr. Peterson isn't a surgeon.

216
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,174
Before you take all hope away,

217
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:21,571
let me get a
cardiothoracic consult.

218
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,645
Fair enough. I just don't think

219
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:27,165
you'll like what they tell you.

220
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,885
Nicolette Nevin's
bail has been paid.

221
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,732
They'll release
her within the hour.

222
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,233
I told you, all I needed
was ten percent

223
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,301
to pay the bail bondsman.

224
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,159
This was cleaner and faster.

225
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,696
Money makes problems
disappear in our legal system.

226
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,899
It's not a level playing field.

227
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,767
It's just like medicine.

228
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,238
Obviously, I'm grateful.

229
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,192
You're my son.

230
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:13,127
I'd do anything for you.

231
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,347
This is a...

232
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,350
new beginning between us.

233
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,053
And I have a plan in the works

234
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,354
for our future.

235
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,860
So, Mina and Micah.

236
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,628
That's a shock, huh?

237
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,164
Is it possible that
she's in love with him?

238
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,910
In love? Are you joking?

239
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,200
Mina doesn't do relationships.

240
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,389
She's just getting laid.

241
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,387
The sex must have been amazing.

242
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:41,072
It did give him a heart attack.

243
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:42,423
It's the way I'd want to go out.

244
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:43,591
Death by coitus.

245
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,160
Preferably with Mina.

246
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,779
Oh.

247
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:51,599
No. Olivia. Long time no see.

248
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:54,185
I feel like it's only
been a couple weeks.

249
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,387
- Eight days, actually.
- Olivia.

250
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,174
- Yes?
- You're not sick.

251
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,937
I most definitely
am very seriously ill.

252
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,711
The disease you
have is hypochondria!

253
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:05,797
I can arrange a
psych appointment.

254
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,431
I have a rash

255
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,451
- and a persistent cough.
- Okay.

256
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,631
- I...
- Just come here.

257
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,438
It's all good.

258
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,318
I will check her out.
Give me the chart.

259
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,342
- All good.
- Thank you. My hero.

260
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:20,245
Okay. Lay it on me.

261
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,613
I have rat-bite fever.

262
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,326
Have you been in close
proximity to rodents?

263
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,283
I hear them in the
wall sometimes.

264
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,362
Okay, it's called
rat-bite fever.

265
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,480
The operative word is "fever."

266
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:28,647
Your temperature is normal.

267
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:30,104
Can it be hantavirus?

268
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:31,605
Again, you would have a fever.

269
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,357
Leptospirosis?

270
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,970
Leptospirosis is contracted
by swimming in water

271
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,539
in which animals
have recently urinated.

272
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,290
Have you been
river rafting in Kenya?

273
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:39,664
Well, I read online

274
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,511
that there was a
factory worker in Arizona

275
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,618
who got it when he drank from a
rat-urine contaminated soda can.

276
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,421
Did you drink

277
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:48,822
from a contaminated soda
can in a factory in Arizona?

278
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:51,442
There's one more possibility.

279
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,445
Can this rash be
caused by lymphoma?

280
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:57,314
Because I just had
my first round of chemo.

281
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,484
Chemo? You had chemo?

282
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,135
Mm-hmm.

283
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,670
Who diagnosed you with lymphoma?

284
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,772
Dr. Lane Hunter.

285
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,450
Hey. Conrad... where is he?

286
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,451
Over there.

287
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,773
Hey, Conrad. Look at this.

288
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,486
Nevin, Nicollete. Let's go.

289
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,654
- Where to?
- Just hurry up.

290
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,756
Come on, come on, come on.

291
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:43,088
Your boyfriend
said you're a nurse.

292
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:44,528
He's not my boyfriend.

293
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,097
Well, maybe he is.

294
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,298
I saw him.

295
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,166
Nice problem you got there.

296
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,417
Let's go.

297
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,354
Name's Jenny.

298
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:55,956
She's been like that
for the last 30 minutes.

299
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,659
Confused, can barely speak.

300
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,411
And when it started, she
got really light-headed.

301
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,296
She's not my girlfriend.

302
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,382
Well, maybe she is.

303
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,632
Sounds like low blood sugar.

304
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,021
Hypoglycemia.

305
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,389
Are you diabetic, Jenny?

306
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,792
Are you taking any
new medication?

307
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,410
Antibiotics.

308
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,512
A sinus infection.

309
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:20,981
SMX-TMP. It's a sulfa drug.

310
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,100
Sulfa drugs can
sometimes make the body

311
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,130
produce too much insulin.
It's rare, but it happens.

312
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,754
You need glucose.

313
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,067
Do you have anything
sugary? Any candy?

314
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,541
- I have orange juice.
- Perfect.

315
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,093
You're gonna be fine.

316
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:33,272
You just have to get
your prescription changed

317
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:34,545
and then maybe go see a doctor.

318
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,413
It could be a kidney issue.

319
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,832
That should help.

320
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,357
Thank you.

321
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,227
What she said.

322
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,496
Oh, and you're free to go.

323
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,731
- What?
- You made bail.

324
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,567
Let's get you your clothes
and get you out of here.

325
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,129
<i>Extremely high risk.</i>

326
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,371
As in "bleed out, die
on the table" high risk.

327
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,590
Even if you manage
to get in safely,

328
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,654
the scar tissue makes
it hard to see the heart.

329
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:24,628
At that point, odds are you
could cut the wrong vessel.

330
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,747
Only someone with
a God-given talent

331
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:28,896
and an ego the size
of Texas would try it.

332
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,520
Well, well, well.

333
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,276
What do we have here?

334
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,340
You're not, uh, looking
to have lunch, are you?

335
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:44,382
Because I don't believe
crow is on the menu.

336
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:48,602
Don't fret, princess.

337
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:50,437
I can save your patient.

338
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,507
You know about Micah Stevens?

339
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:53,886
Whole hospital is
talking about him.

340
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,444
Apparently, the brother
has quite a fan base.

341
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:58,274
I spoke to three top
cardiothoracic surgeons

342
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,497
and they all say

343
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,577
operating on Micah
is likely to kill him.

344
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,016
Yeah, well, you spoke to hacks.

345
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,085
I wouldn't trust
them to cut cheese.

346
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,022
Micah is a gentle, decent man,

347
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,684
a great teacher
who loves his kids.

348
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,053
He has more integrity
in his little finger...

349
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,044
Blah, blah, blah,
spare me. Whatever.

350
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,523
I don't care that
he's Mother Teresa.

351
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,725
I think it's an interesting
case and I'll take it.

352
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,294
Micah's not a
science experiment.

353
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,578
If you don't believe
he has a chance...

354
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:21,202
Well, his odds do suck,

355
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,354
but in my hands,
they're not zero.

356
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,640
Besides that, I can't
give you a number.

357
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,509
I mean, we're all guessing
every time we scrub in, right?

358
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:31,663
I mean, there's always
art balanced with science.

359
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,532
And fortunately, I
happen to be Rembrandt.

360
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,667
Kill me now.

361
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,313
You know what I like
about you, Okafor?

362
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,537
You're arrogant, just like me.

363
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,123
What I don't like about
you is you're not me.

364
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,359
We'll schedule for
surgery if Micah agrees.

365
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:46,894
He already has.

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,383
Let me guess.

367
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,485
You're all-in because if he dies

368
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,187
within a year of his surgery,

369
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,906
it's a black mark on
Chastain's transplant program.

370
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,743
And without surgery,
that baby is going to blow.

371
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:03,611
I looked at the imaging.

372
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,580
It's sooner rather than later.

373
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:10,151
So, let's give Micah a chance.

374
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,036
And Chastain.

375
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:15,706
That's what you wanted, right?

376
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,344
Rembrandt, baby.

377
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:26,100
- Nic, hi.
- Hey, Jess.

378
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:27,534
What are you doing here?

379
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:28,870
Are they letting you come back?

380
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,699
Nic. We've been
jonesin' for you.

381
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,289
Hey, um, not yet.

382
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,724
Um, but look, where's Conrad?

383
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:34,937
- Nic.
- Oh, I...

384
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,511
- I'll see you later. Hey, Devon.
- Bye.

385
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,580
Hey, Nic.

386
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:41,660
How the hell did
you pull that off?

387
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:43,618
Later. This is more important.

388
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,290
What's going on?

389
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:51,808
Look at these labs.

390
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,022
Blood work from my
patient in the ER, Olivia Tan.

391
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,859
- Our frequent flier
hypochondriac?
- Yes. You see anything abnormal?

392
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,750
Nope. Perfectly
healthy, as usual.

393
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,397
Well, last week, Dr. Hunter

394
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,771
diagnosed Olivia with lymphoma.

395
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,000
And she just received
her first round of chemo.

396
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,274
She has no cancer
markers at all.

397
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:15,199
Lane's giving chemo to patients
who don't even have cancer.

398
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,772
Nic warned us that Dr. Hunter
was overdosing cancer patients

399
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,986
- with aggressive chemo.
- Which is Medicare fraud.

400
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,427
Tough to prove,
particularly since Dr. Hunter

401
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,273
keeps all of her patient
records at her clinics.

402
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,282
And Dr. Pravesh just discovered
that she's also been diagnosing

403
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,150
healthy patients with cancer,

404
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,179
which explains her
miraculous cures,

405
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,432
because some of her patients
were never sick to begin with.

406
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,701
Including Lily Kendall.
She had a form of cancer

407
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,775
that you can get from
aggressive chemo.

408
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:42,460
Look, th-this is absurd.

409
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,994
You're trying to tell me

410
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,296
Dr. Hunter gave
Lily Kendall cancer

411
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,448
and then killed
her to cover it up?

412
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:49,862
Lily was in the process of
getting a second opinion.

413
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:52,503
That oncologist would
have demanded her records.

414
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,866
Which would have shown
her original diagnosis.

415
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,274
Dr. Hunter consistently
refused to share them.

416
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,237
And Nic tried to get her
records after Lily died

417
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:00,222
and Dr. Hunter set her
up and had her arrested.

418
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,846
You're accusing Dr. Hunter
of cold-blooded murder,

419
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,843
one of the best
doctors in the hospital.

420
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,561
Wouldn't believe
that in a million years.

421
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,747
It's not necessary that you
believe us because we've already

422
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,337
contacted the FBI

423
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,685
and they're getting a warrant
to seize Lane's records.

424
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:14,703
The truth is gonna
come out, Dr. Bell.

425
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,427
You called the FBI?

426
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,995
Without telling me?

427
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,863
It's required by law,

428
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,660
considering what
Dr. Pravesh discovered.

429
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,228
We're here to make
sure you remove

430
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:25,130
all of Dr. Hunter's
patients from her care.

431
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,521
And if you don't,
moving forward,

432
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,723
both you and
Chastain will be liable.

433
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,835
Okay, well, this...
It's shocking.

434
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,410
And I don't know
what to believe.

435
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,082
But I will suspend
Dr. Hunter's privileges,

436
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,517
pending a full investigation.

437
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:58,719
And I would ask you
not to say anything.

438
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,687
This is her career

439
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:03,890
and Chastain's reputation
that is on the line.

440
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,360
These accusations will
have to be backed up

441
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:07,895
with hard evidence.

442
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:10,431
They will be.

443
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:25,062
You ready?

444
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:28,900
I'll be with you in
surgery all the way,

445
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,135
looking out for you.

446
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,706
I may not see you again.

447
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:39,560
Of course you will,
on the other side.

448
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:42,963
What other side? The
really, really far other side?

449
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:46,733
In recovery.

450
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:49,570
You can be honest with me, Mina.

451
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:52,172
I know a Hail Mary
pass when I see one.

452
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,274
Whatever happens,
I'm at peace with it.

453
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:55,926
Don't talk like that.

454
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,996
I've had one miracle...
My new heart.

455
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,249
If God gives me another miracle,
then this will be a great day.

456
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:05,919
If not,

457
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:07,938
His will be done.

458
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,808
I'm ahead already.

459
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,751
- My man, Harold.
- Hey.

460
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,619
Let's do this.

461
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:57,070
♪ ♪

462
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,987
We still on for dinner tonight?

463
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:15,956
Um, close the door.

464
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:23,831
- What's wrong?
- Um...

465
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:27,601
The FBI is getting a warrant

466
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,002
to search your offices.

467
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:32,856
The FBI?

468
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:36,410
Have you diagnosed healthy
patients with incurable cancer

469
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:38,012
in order to treat them?

470
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:40,263
What? No.

471
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,910
Why would you even
say such a thing?

472
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,962
'Cause there's a patient
in our ER right now

473
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:47,020
that you diagnosed
with lymphoma.

474
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,589
She doesn't have cancer.

475
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,025
Well...

476
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:54,044
I know, and you should, too,

477
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,832
that the difference between
a low white blood cell count

478
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,984
and actual leukemia
can be really small.

479
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,082
I mean, if an error was
made, or a judgment call...

480
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:06,456
How bad are the mistakes?

481
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:09,727
And how many
others like this one?

482
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,848
Is Chastain vulnerable?

483
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:19,853
I've told you over
and over again

484
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,055
that I'm on your side.

485
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:24,524
I have been there for you.

486
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:28,312
You've made terrible mistakes,
and I've helped you fight back.

487
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,663
Whose side are you on, Randolph?

488
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:32,649
I'm on your side.

489
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,692
Now, the FBI can't get a
warrant until tomorrow morning.

490
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,362
What are you thinking?

491
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:53,087
Go to your clinic
right now and...

492
00:22:53,156 --> 00:22:55,790
get any records that
could be misconstrued,

493
00:22:55,858 --> 00:22:57,124
and don't shred them,

494
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:59,593
'cause they can
be reconstructed.

495
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:00,973
And bring any files
you don't want found

496
00:23:00,997 --> 00:23:02,979
back to my apartment.

497
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,665
And we'll-we'll burn them

498
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:06,967
in my fireplace, together.

499
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:26,019
You're protecting me.

500
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:33,527
I'm protecting us.

501
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,012
Quickly.

502
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:51,361
All right, please confirm

503
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,562
the name of the patient.

504
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,165
Micah Stevens, 11-22-85.

505
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,078
Attending physician, AJ Austin.

506
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,147
Procedure: aortic
root dissection repair.

507
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:00,082
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow your roll, Beauregard.

508
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,039
I am not cutting anybody open

509
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,902
with the cast of<i>
Deliverance</i> assisting.

510
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:06,693
Where is Okafor?

511
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,315
Ah. Well, hello, Dolly.

512
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:33,203
Ah, I love that sound.

513
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,572
So sexy.

514
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,856
Median sternotomy.

515
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:39,042
We are cracking open the chest.

516
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,079
Stop. He has to go on pump.

517
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,925
If you go through the
bone and hit the heart,

518
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,282
the pump will save him.

519
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,435
You know, the
longer he's on bypass,

520
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:51,105
the more chance for poor
blood flow to the brain.

521
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:53,118
You want him to wake
up with pump head?

522
00:24:53,142 --> 00:24:56,443
Nah, I say he
flies without a net

523
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:58,395
while I slice and dice.

524
00:24:58,464 --> 00:24:59,874
And maybe hit his
heart and kill him.

525
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,443
Let's just make this
a smoother case.

526
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,999
Not tempt fate.

527
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,438
Fine.

528
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,906
We're goin' pump.

529
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,743
Hey.

530
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:32,045
Listen, Olivia, you
don't have cancer.

531
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,731
No, I-I have to have cancer.

532
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,116
It explains everything,
all my symptoms.

533
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:38,168
The stiff neck, I mean,

534
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,157
I'm pretty sure
that's meningitis.

535
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,441
You have been a victim

536
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,443
of a wide-ranging medical fraud.

537
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:50,146
I need you to expose
the doctor that did this.

538
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,984
There is a reporter here
right now tracking the story.

539
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,219
No, I ca-I can't.

540
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,254
You'll be famous.

541
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,228
Yeah, okay.

542
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:11,118
My name's Priya Nair.

543
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:14,070
I want to hear your story.

544
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,208
Finally.

545
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:34,190
- Be careful.
- Be quiet.

546
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:40,313
All right. Retract
dermis and rib cage.

547
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:42,066
Retractors.

548
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:46,586
There's too much scar tissue.

549
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:48,355
We can't crack open his chest.

550
00:26:48,423 --> 00:26:51,158
All right. Then I will fix that.

551
00:26:51,227 --> 00:26:54,194
Bovie cautery
and tissue forceps.

552
00:26:54,263 --> 00:26:55,762
Thank you.

553
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,003
Please go slowly.

554
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:05,417
You can hit an
artery or the aorta...

555
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:07,218
Please contain your
emotions, Okafor.

556
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:08,626
I know what I'm doing.

557
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:30,597
Chest retractor.

558
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,456
Metz.

559
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,261
Heart is intact.

567

Dr. Okafor,

568
00:28:21,984 --> 00:28:23,684
please clamp the aorta.

569
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,409
Starting cardioplegia.

570
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,520
Deader than a doornail.

571
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,193
That is, until I bring
Lazarus back to life.

572
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:13,800
Hmm.

573
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,639
Ah. Hello, trouble.

574
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:21,408
Meet the solution.

575
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:32,368
Get that to Pathology.

576
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,739
And then Dacron
graft to Okafor, ASAP.

577
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,092
Me?

578
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:41,345
Well, you're the
famous seamstress

579
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:42,779
of Chastain, aren't you?

580
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,969
I can't.

581
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,536
What do you mean you can't?

582
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:53,373
I just... can't.

583
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:55,325
Then what are you doing here?

584
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,621
Making sure you don't
behave like a madman

585
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:58,378
and risk Micah's life.

586
00:29:58,446 --> 00:29:59,641
- Would you like me
to take over...
- No.

587
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,181
She's gonna do it.

588
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,521
You broke the
cardinal rule of the OR.

589
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,540
You are emotionally
involved with this patient.

590
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,560
Is that why you can't
operate, Dr. Okafor?

591
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:15,595
Or are you just
not up to the task?

592
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:18,732
Don't be mad.

593
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:20,551

594
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,786

595
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:26,473
Ah, that's the first time
you've called me by my name.

596
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,760
Admit it:

597
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,731
you have feelings.

598
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,768
You care.

599
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,137
You can have passion, you
can love somebody, even.

600
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,839
It does not make
you less of a doctor.

601
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,257
No, in fact,

602
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:47,560
it makes you a better one.

603
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:49,562
You can help fix Micah

604
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,849
if you can harness that
passion to elevate your art,

605
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,401

606
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:57,987

we work so hard to earn,</i>

708
00:37:06,508 --> 00:37:08,441
<i>between patients and doctors.</i>

709
00:37:08,509 --> 00:37:10,343
<i>But I must emphasize that</i>

710
00:37:10,412 --> 00:37:13,363
these crimes were
committed at her clinic,

711
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,232
not at Chastain Park Memorial,

712
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,061
which is why she eluded
detection for so long,

713
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:18,985
and we had no idea

714
00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:20,537
<i>what was happening.</i>

715
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,667
<i>But two of our heroic
young residents</i>

716
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:25,441
<i>and a very determined
nurse practitioner were the first</i>

717
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,360
to see the warning signs,

718
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:28,939
and the moment they
brought it to my attention,

719
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:32,048
<i>of course, I called the FBI.</i>

720
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,635
Oh, well, that's amazing,
he's taking all the credit.

721
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:37,181
<i>Is it true that you
personally helped</i>

722
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:38,988
<i>the FBI catch Dr. Hunter</i>

723
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,435
as she was attempting
to destroy evidence?

724
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,858
Well, anyone with a conscience

725
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,211
would've done the same.

726
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:48,014
He's like a cat that
always lands on his feet.

727
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:49,209
<i>Now, I'd encourage you to direct</i>

728
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:50,733
<i>the rest of your questions</i>

729
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,530
<i>to law enforcement.
Thank you very much.</i>

730
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:12,605
I see he's off the vent.

731
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:14,924
They're going to do a head CT.

732
00:38:16,912 --> 00:38:20,413
Well, we're all pulling for him.

733
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:22,481
And for you.

734
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,084
You see?

735
00:38:59,153 --> 00:39:02,889
I told you I was right.

736
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:05,725
I knew we were a thing.

737
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,153
Yeah.

738
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:36,756
- There.
- Pancreatitis?

739
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:39,153
- I think so.
- Mrs. Arby, we're gonna
admit you just so we can

740
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,320
- run a few more tests, okay?
- I-I'm worried

741
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,989
about this place.
I saw the news.

742
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,679
A-Am I safe here?

743
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:49,152
You're absolutely
right to ask, Mrs. Arby.

744
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,748
You should always
keep a sharp lookout.

745
00:39:50,772 --> 00:39:52,805
Because doctors,
they're like cops.

746
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,775
Some are heroes
here to save your life,

747
00:39:55,843 --> 00:39:57,977
and others, you
need to be careful of.

748
00:39:58,045 --> 00:39:59,423
Dr. Pravesh?

749
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,698
Rookie of the year. MVP.

750
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,032
He's one of the best.

751
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,636
But watch out for Dr. Feldman.

752
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,373
He's funny, right?

753
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:12,424

Well played. Bravo.

Making you CEO was the

I want to introduce

794
00:42:41,342 --> 00:42:43,609
Marshall Winthrop.

795
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,530
I think you know each other.

796
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,100
We've crossed paths.

797
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:55,334
Marshall is our new
chairman of the board.

798
00:42:58,026 --> 00:42:59,754
McKEE: Marshall
holds a majority stake

799
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:01,360
in several huge corporations

800
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:04,547
that could boost
our bottom line.

801
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:07,333
You navigated a PR
nightmare very cleverly.

802
00:43:07,402 --> 00:43:09,134
Congrats.

803
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:11,136
Now it's time to
put this hospital

804
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:15,274
on a firm financial footing.
