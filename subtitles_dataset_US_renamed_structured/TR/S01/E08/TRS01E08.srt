1
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:12,672
Costs us about $2,200

2
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:16,931
per bed a day just to
keep Chastain open.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,352
Now, that's roughly
$160 million a year.

4
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:21,782
Have-have you ever experienced

5
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:23,305
the Serengeti, Randolph?

6
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:24,818
No, Gordon, but
much more rewarding

7
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,386
than waiting for
the rains in Africa

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,187
might be to help
us make it rain here.

9
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:30,813
Mm-hmm, like funding
your new surgical center?

10
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:33,315
Well, in order to keep
brilliant, young surgeons

11
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:35,651
like Dr. Okafor here
happy, we need the...

12
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,420
Is that why you were invited
here tonight, Dr. Okafor?

13
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,639
To, um, help persuade us?

14
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,576
I was invited because I'm black.
Apparently diversity matters.

15
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,232
Ah, look at poor Mina.

16
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,863
I wish we could
throw her a lifeline.

17
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,253
Why don't you go down
there? Help her out?

18
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,506
I'll go if you go.

19
00:00:57,574 --> 00:00:59,808
I'd rather have a colonoscopy.

20
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:08,450
They're in my ear. Can
you... Can you get them out?

21
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,002
All right, let's
get back to work.

22
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,021
Wait.

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,189
Please.

24
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:16,924
It hurts.

25
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,861
Can you get them
out? It hurts. Please?

26
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:23,348
Too loud.
They're-they're in my ear.

27
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,518
Please, can you
help me get them out?

28
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,533
Oh, is that right?
Yes, that's... Yeah.

29
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,034
They're in my
head. Get them out.

30
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,624
Excuse me.

31
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:33,916
They're in my ear. Get 'em out.

32
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:41,996
- Excuse me.
- Call for help.

33
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,593
How did she get in here?

34
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:55,847
She's got a pulse,
it's very slow.

35
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,700
Pupils are equal and reactive.

36
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,019
Scattered rhonchi, but
she's moving good air.

37
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,022
Okay, everybody, just
step back, step back, please.

38
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,757
Everything's gonna be fine.

39
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:06,936
Let's just give these
doctors some room to work.

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,822
I need a C-collar
and backboard now.

41
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:12,313
Okay, well, let's get this-this
poor soul to our ER, and, uh,

42
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,900
just keep me posted
on how she's doing.

43
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,085
It's okay.

44
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:19,287
She'll be all right.

45
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:27,295
♪ ♪

46
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,121
They're in here.
They're in here.

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,785
- All right, let's get you checked out.
- They're in here.

48
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:41,004
- What's your name?
- Are you having pain anywhere?

49
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,127
Too loud.

50
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:46,064
In my head, get
them out. My ear...

51
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,034
Get them out.

52
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,419
Here, I'll take the bags.

53
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,070
- No.
- Ready.

54
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,606
One... two... three.

55
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,115
When I asked you to bring me
something from the fundraiser,

56
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,710
I meant, like, a crab cake.

57
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,795
- What do we got?
- Jane Doe, 20s.

58
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:02,797
Collapsed from syncopal episode

59
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:04,878
with blunt head trauma,
multiple abrasions,

60
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:06,167
and a forehead laceration.

61
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:08,620
- Plus one hell of an ear infection.
- Not seeing an I.D.

62
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,866
She needs an altered
mental status workup

63
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,090
- and a lac repair.
- Trauma panel, EKG,

64
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,087
- chest X-ray and head CT.
- I'll take care of the lac.

65
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,979
And risk getting blood on
that dress? I'll do the sutures.

66
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:20,715
It's not that, I-I can't see!

67
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,895
No, I can handle the pain,

68
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,918
I just, I can't see
out of this eye.

69
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,406
Keep working
here. I'll grab that.

70
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,843
- Talk to me.
- Channing Brewster, 25-year-old male.

71
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,189
Ran through a glass
door. Facial lacerations,

72
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,790
multiple small cuts
to his arms and torso,

73
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,181
shards of glass in his left eye.

74
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,777
Two episodes of
vomiting en route.

75
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,146
- I can't see out of this eye.
- Okay, easy, Mr. Brewster.

76
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,214
I'm Dr. Feldman, I'll
be taking care of you.

77
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:44,367
I just want to take a
look at your eye, okay?

78
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,657
- Okay.
- Everything's gonna be okay.

79
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,944
Let's transfer him
and prepare to irrigate.

80
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:54,132
Micah, hey. Sorry we had to
change your echo to tonight.

81
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,901
It's been crazy around here.

82
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,620
Yeah, I noticed. I was
rerouted from the front entrance.

83
00:03:58,689 --> 00:03:59,987
How's the new ticker?

84
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:01,601
That's what I'm
here to find out.

85
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,053
Admit him to the floor

86
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,676
on antibiotics and we'll
take him to the OR tomorrow.

87
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,163
Mm-hmm. Right away.

88
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,999
Wow, Dr. Okafor, I almost

89
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,628
didn't recognize you
all supermodeled up.

90
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,204
In for your 1,000-mile checkup?

91
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:18,193
A patient who
actually follows up.

92
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,659
Yeah.

93
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,196
I will leave you two to it.

94
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,900
I hear your heart donor's
family wants to meet you.

95
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,570
They reached out through
the recovery program.

96
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,550
Just not sure I'm
ready for that yet.

97
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,275
So don't meet them.
It's your heart now.

98
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:44,110
No, actually, we'd like to
keep the guest list to 150.

99
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,367
Nonsense.

100
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:48,253
So few? That would
barely cover my cousins.

101
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:49,621
Well, it's important

102
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,208
to us that we pay
for half the wedding,

103
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:55,221
- so we need to stick to our number.
- Yes.

104
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:58,213
But the groom's family
can also contribute,

105
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,215
- not just the bride's.
- Of course.

106
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:02,228
We can pay for more than
just flowers and the<i> mithai.</i>

107
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:03,429
It's okay.

108
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:07,239
Like I said, we got it covered.

109
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,092
Besides, we want to
keep it small and intimate.

110
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,898
Let's talk about something else.

111
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:24,773
So, uh, Priya, your father
is a barrister in London, yes?

112
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:25,990
That's right.

113
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,804
How does he feel
about you marrying

114
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,960
the son of a taxi driver?

115
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,296
- Tejan.
- My parents are very fond

116
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,698
of your son, Mr. Pravesh.

117
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:38,103
They don't discuss things
like this in their family.

118
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:42,440
Well, judgments
get passed in silence.

119
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,429
Your occupation
has never come up.

120
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,197
And it is my decision who
I marry, not my father's.

121
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:59,290
Uh...

122
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,293
- And the check, sir.
- I have to get back.

123
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:04,262
Do you have to leave now?

124
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,815
The hospital is short-staffed
and they need me.

125
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,135
No more questions,
Dad, and... We got it.

126
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,904
Let me.

127
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,123
We discussed this.

128
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:17,358
It's okay.

129
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,186
Her head CT and drug and
alcohol screen came back normal.

130
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,239
Thinking she's altered from
an underlying psych disorder.

131
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,986
We need a medical
reason to admit her.

132
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,404
She does have an area
of pneumonia on her X-ray.

133
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,388
Plus the ear infection,
but, technically,

134
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:38,390
we should just discharge
her on oral antibiotics for that.

135
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:40,059
- Yeah, no, we can't do that. That's not right.
- Yeah, I know.

136
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,416
Well, admitting her,
I'm just trying to...

137
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:47,333
I remember her saying
she felt severe chest pain

138
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:50,308
before she collapsed, don't you?

139
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,378
That'll buy her an admission.

140
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:56,214
I mean, I'm not sure it's
gonna fly with admin, but...

141
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,484
Yeah, too bad.
We're out of options.

142
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,521
These drops will sting

143
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,368
for a few seconds but
then numb the pain.

144
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,092
- Okay.
- Look down.

145
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,000
Ow.

146
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:11,146
- Blink. Good.
- Yeah. Thanks.

147
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:13,614
We'll try irrigating,
and if this doesn't work,

148
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,384
then we'll pull those little
suckers one at a time.

149
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:17,552
Look down.

150
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,155
Wh-What about the face?

151
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:23,324
I mean, is it gnarly?
Do I need stitches?

152
00:07:23,393 --> 00:07:25,560
That's a no to the
gnarly and the stitches.

153
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:28,163
You got lucky.

154
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,409
How in the world did you
run through a glass door?

155
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,633
Occupational hazard.

156
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,003
I was trying to get away
from my client's husband.

157
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:38,907
Oh, yeah? You, like, a
private eye? Divorce lawyer?

158
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,820
No. Although, in
my line of work,

159
00:07:40,844 --> 00:07:42,077
I definitely run into both.

160
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:43,344
Uh...

161
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:46,213
I'm in the, um,
service business.

162
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,199
Oh. Oh!

163
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,414
You're a gigolo?

164
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,139
Well, we prefer "male escort."

165
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:57,258
Huh.

166
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,217
Pretty. So pretty.

167
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,575
The painting.
Yeah, it is pretty.

168
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:16,344
Here.

169
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,686
Were you at another hospital?

170
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,087
Huh?

171
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,325
Did you come from
another hospital?

172
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:35,903
I'm gonna get you something
to eat. I'll be back, all right?

173
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:42,237
I think our Jane Doe was
dropped off by another hospital.

174
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,500
Hospitals dumping
homeless patients

175
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,124
not only pisses
me off, it's illegal.

176
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,971
We sure she didn't
elope on her own?

177
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,460
It's not likely.

178
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,864
I know exactly what hospital
this EKG lead comes from.

179
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,384
They've done it before, Conrad.

180
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,293
A little overdressed for work.

181
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,095
I was at dinner.

182
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:08,474
I'd say I'm sorry for
interrupting date night,

183
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,831
but I'd be lying.

184
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,343
It wasn't a date
as much as it was

185
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,067
an interrogation by my father.

186
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,881
You got me confused
with someone who cares.

187
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:17,305
I need you to head down to
the ER. Irving's short-handed.

188
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:19,674
Needs help with the gigolo.

189
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:21,109
Wait.

190
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:22,476
Did you say "gigolo"?

191
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,505
It's really about
the little details.

192
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:27,482
Personal touches in
every patient's room.

193
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,118
Personal menus.

194
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:32,287
We also keep a
full-on staff of nurses,

195
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:34,889
make sure everyone

196
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,291
has that one-on-one feeling...

197
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,960
Why was this woman admitted?

198
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:41,310
Just following through on
your promise to the donors

199
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:43,485
that we'd get her the
best care in the city.

200
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:45,299
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

201
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:48,519
Randolph, is
everything all right?

202
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,140
Yup. Everything's fine.
Be with you in one second.

203
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:53,385
We don't know what's
wrong with our Jane Doe.

204
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:55,409
We had to admit
her to run more tests.

205
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:56,694
And before you ask,

206
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,574
she tested negative
for any drugs or alcohol.

207
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,543
Okay, wouldn't she be more
comfortable in the psych ward

208
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,066
on an involuntary hold?

209
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,413
Trent from Psych
already examined her.

210
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,547
He doesn't think
she's mentally ill.

211
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,581
That's why we're
doing more tests.

212
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,571
We're not running
a charity here.

213
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,401
Well, you're the
Chief of Surgery.

214
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:10,859
You know it's not your call.

215
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,588
I'm the highest-ranking
member of the board

216
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,011
currently on the premises.

217
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,058
And it sure as hell
isn't a resident's call.

218
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,242
Treat her for the bare
minimum and street her.

219
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,329
That makes us no better
than Atlanta General.

220
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,402
Atlanta General?

221
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,521
This lead goes with a new

222
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,924
all-digital EKG machine
from Cardiosure.

223
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,604
Atlanta General has
the only one in town.

224
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,072
I've been trying to get
one here for months.

225
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,529
Yeah, but, Nic, we got that
fancy cappuccino machine

226
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,442
- up in the VIP wing.
- Just call Atlanta General

227
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,267
and tell them to come
and pick up their problem.

228
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,170
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

229
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:43,024
Well, you know, I just, I
forget who I'm talking to.

230
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:44,558
I'll do it.

231
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:46,438
How are you gonna get
Atlanta General to do anything?

232
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:48,007
No, it's simple.
We just call them,

233
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:49,575
tell them to come pick
up their responsibility,

234
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:51,959
unless they want to be the
lead story on the 10:00 news.

235
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,586
"Atlanta General unwilling
to treat homeless patients,

236
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,489
- now dumps them on Chastain's door."
- All right.

237
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:02,226
They're just going to dump
her on the street again.

238
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,796
- Uh, the one-on-one...
- We can't let that happen.

239
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,499
Very important to us that
patients feel comfortable.

240
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,634
Nice, nicely done.

241
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:28,665
Sorry, it wasn't my
idea to call you back.

242
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,689
It was Conrad's.

243
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,573
It's okay, he did me a favor.

244
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:33,658
Not that Priya was thrilled.

245
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,504
Your parents and your
fiancée don't get along?

246
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,872
No, no, no. Priya loves them.

247
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,163
It's just my old man
who's got the issues.

248
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,798
He gets all squirrely and weird

249
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,117
when it comes to
his money and pride.

250
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,237
Has a lot to do with how
he was brought up in India.

251
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,474
Great. So, how's the pain?

252
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,642
It's, uh, great.

253
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,670
As in, I don't feel any.

254
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,279
It sounds like your dad's all
caught up in the caste system.

255
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,692
Is your fiancée in
a different caste?

256
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,384
Is that the-the problem?

257
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,947
What do you know about
the Indian caste system?

258
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,198
It's a paradigmatic,
ethnographic

259
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,671
social stratification

260
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,106
that determines the behavior

261
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:07,241
of one member of
society over another.

262
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,445
I was an International
Studies major. Yeah.

263
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:12,680
I took a special interest
in Southeast Asia.

264
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:16,617
The whole caste
system thing, it's archaic.

265
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,631
So, uh, the whole,
uh, male escort thing,

266
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,898
is that to pay off
student loans?

267
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,400
I don't carry student loans.

268
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,258
Job pays well.

269
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,461
I mean, that could change if I
end up looking like Leatherface.

270
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,830
Nah. Battle wounds.

271
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:30,264
Gives you character.

272
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,301
Mm, the news is good, Micah.

273
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:34,519
No sign of rejection,

274
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,421
your EF's up to 54%.

275
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,189
The valves are functioning well,

276
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,092
limited view of the aortic
root from shadowing,

277
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,705
but, overall,
everything looks good.

278
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,689
I knew that. Wasn't
worried at all.

279
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,532
Oh, you're laughing.

280
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,712
That's always a good sign.

281
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,652
We're all done here, Micah.

282
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:53,382
I'm going to leave you in
Nurse Nevin's capable hands.

283
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,717
- See you next month.
- All right.

284
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:55,918
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,174
That has to be a huge relief.

286
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,543
Let's get you out of here.

287
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,389
You know, actually,
my surgical scar's

288
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,712
been a little irritated.

289
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,392
I'm worried it's not
healing properly.

290
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,516
Oh. Looks okay, but
better safe than sorry,

291
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,229
- I'll see if Dr. Peterson can come back.
- It's okay.

292
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,320
Can Dr. Okafor check it out?

293
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,739
I mean, since she's here

294
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,175
and she was on
my surgical team...

295
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,764
I got to go, but I'll
see if she's available.

296
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,332
Okay.

297
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,748
- What happened?
- Found her hypotensive

298
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,706
and coughing up large
clots. Sats are dropping.

299
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:29,907
I think it's her lungs.

300
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,654
We need pulmonary.
Page Dr. Hoffman.

301
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,456
And activate massive transfusion
protocol with the blood bank.

302
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,528
Paging Dr. Hoffman.

303
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,450
Dr. Hoffman's in the
middle of an ER bronch.

304
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,829
It says he'll be here
in 15 to 20 minutes.

305
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,254
She'll drown in her
own blood in ten.

306
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,640
Then I'll intubate her myself.

307
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,744
Infiltrate's on the left,

308
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,007
that's probably what's
causing the bleeding.

309
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,563
Hurry, her sats are dropping.

310
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:58,719
Airway's filled with blood.

311
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,332
I need to intubate
just the right lung.

312
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,090
Sats are down to 74%.

313
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,882
Okay, through the cords.

314
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,586
Rotating 90 degrees.

315
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,872
Hoping I can block the
bleeding from the left

316
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,016
and still ventilate her.

317
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,641
No breath sounds on the left.

318
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,527
Blow up the balloon.

319
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:47,201
Sats are coming back up.

320
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,670
This is just a Band-Aid.

321
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,204
Page Mina.

322
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,490
She needs a
bronchoscopy right away.

323
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,491
Paging Dr. Okafor.

324
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,469
Bleeding has stopped.
The cautery worked.

325
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,505
Let me get a tissue sample
for biopsy while I'm here.

326
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,187
So, this is where the lesion

327
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,763
eroded the bronchus,
causing her to hemorrhage?

328
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,333
Doesn't look like pneumonia.

329
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,852
It can be any number of things,

330
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,888
including cancer.
Got the sample.

331
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,167
We need to start narrowing
down the differential.

332
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,107
Get her to imaging for a CT

333
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,421
and send the
biopsy off to the lab.

334
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:30,845
That's expensive.

335
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:32,891
Since when do you care
about the cost of tests?

336
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:35,149
Not tests. This bag.

337
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:38,803
This is an Xavier
Mellino original.

338
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,572
It's worth $148,000.

339
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,873
What... How do you know that?

340
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,676
I know stitching. Probably
found it in a Dumpster

341
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,178
or snatched it from the owner.

342
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,125
Nic already looked
for an I.D. in there.

343
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,394
One-of-a-kinds like this
usually have the owner's name

344
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,200
inscribed on the inside.

345
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,057
Sara Ravenscroft.

346
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,893
Her name even sounds rich.

347
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,761
I'm sure she'll be happy to hear

348
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,741
that we found her
$100 grand purse.

349
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,898
Maybe there's a reward.

350
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,232
Maybe.

351
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,738
Or maybe...

352
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,728
our Jane Doe is
Sara Ravenscroft.

353
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,094
<i>She's the daughter</i>

354
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:21,974
of Lawrence and
Veronica Ravenscroft.

355
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:24,198
They're wealthy
philanthropists out of Savannah.

356
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,944
How does the daughter
of one of the most

357
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,502
prominent families in Georgia

358
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,214
end up sick and
living on the street?

359
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,783
According to one of the
Savannah gossip blogs,

360
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:32,907
Sara is estranged
from her family.

361
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:34,953
She left town a couple
months ago to become an artist.

362
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,789
Is she out of imaging yet?

363
00:16:36,813 --> 00:16:38,579
Was just about to check.

364
00:16:38,648 --> 00:16:40,598
You get that, I'll
check on Sara.

365
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,012
- Mina, you've got something else to deal with.
- What?

366
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,902
Pressing surgery?

367
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:46,336
A certain lovesick transplantee

368
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,338
has something
wrong with his scar.

369
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,275
This is a waste of my time.
You know his scar is fine.

370
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,022
Mina, you know Micah
has feelings for you.

371
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,040
If you want them to go away,
you've got to deal with them.

372
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:56,341
Be gentle.

373
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,943
The poor guy just
got a brand-new heart.

374
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,933
I'm always gentle.

375
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:01,936
A little swelling is normal.

376
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,788
I'll prescribe some
vitamin E ointment

377
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,908
to help with the healing.

378
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:09,621
I wasn't really
worried about my scar.

379
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:12,613
I was too embarrassed
to tell anyone

380
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:14,660
- what I actually wanted to discuss.
- Look, Micah...

381
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:16,695
It's-it's my heart donor.
Turns out he was a convicted

382
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,597
car thief who was
let out on parole.

383
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,489
- You have a felon's heart?
- Ironic, right?

384
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:22,923
Me, a minister's son.

385
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:25,159
Anyway, I went online, right?

386
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:27,173
And there's this thing
called cellular memory,

387
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:29,024
where the person who
receives a donor organ

388
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,026
sometimes takes on the
characteristics of the donor.

389
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,617
You know, like their
taste in music and food...

390
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,997
No, I'm serious. Look,
what if I develop a taste

391
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,999
for aggravated assault
or armed robbery?

392
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,656
Okay, calm down, Idi Amin.

393
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,904
I'm sure there are studies
from reputable medical journals

394
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,394
to dispute this nonsense.

395
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,990
I will look into it and get
back to you tomorrow.

396
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:47,481
Why not tonight? I'm stressed.

397
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,345
- That could be bad for my health.
- My shift is...

398
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,001
I can wait until you're done.

399
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,191
Maybe we can discuss
it over a cup of coffee.

400
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,642
Fine.

401
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:02,113
One cup, black, to go.

402
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,804
So how long till I can
see out of this eye?

403
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:12,039
Depends on how quickly
the swelling goes down,

404
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:13,841
but I'm optimistic.

405
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:15,976
The injuries seem superficial.

406
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:17,906
I've paged an ophthalmologist
to take a second look.

407
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,697
And once he gives you
the okay, you can go.

408
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,484
Hmm.

409
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:30,374
Uh, so your fiancée, is
she Kshatriya or Vaishya?

410
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:37,431
She's, um, she's Kshatriya.

411
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,050
And, uh, your parents,
they-they immigrated here, right?

412
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,852
Uh, what's your dad do?

413
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,499
He owns a medallion cab
in Queens, and I'm done

414
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,801
- talking about this.
- So you are the successful son

415
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,891
of an honest,
working-class family.

416
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,328
I'm guessing your
family is Vaishya.

417
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,431
As a gigolo, shouldn't you
be a man of action, not words?

418
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,699
Okay. First, male escort.

419
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,145
Second, m-most of my
clients just want to talk.

420
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,986
Look here.

421
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,850
So your fiancée's
in the higher caste,

422
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,619
which probably makes
your dad feel insecure.

423
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,387
Or is it her family
that has issues?

424
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,328
Our families haven't even met.

425
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,866
You're not gonna wait for them
to meet at the wedding, are you?

426
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:14,035
Ah.

427
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:16,871
You got to be kidding me.

428
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,944
What are you guys doing here?

429
00:19:24,013 --> 00:19:25,093
Where's-where's Priya?

430
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:26,814
She dropped us at the hotel.

431
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:29,099
Our flight leaves early
tomorrow morning.

432
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,649
We were worried that we wouldn't
get a chance to say good-bye.

433
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,782
We barely got to
see you this trip,

434
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,139
so we took a cab over here.

435
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,169
Pleasant driver
from Belize. Nice car.

436
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:39,137
Little too chatty.

437
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:41,106
We know you're
busy, we'll just sit.

438
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,282
And whenever you get a coffee
break, you just come and visit.

439
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,961
Is there a gift shop?
Maybe I'll get a book.

440
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,329
The gift shop is
closed and we don't,

441
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,570
we don't have coffee breaks.

442
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:53,140
Honey, we haven't
seen you in months.

443
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:56,143
Just watching you
work makes me happy.

444
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:57,478
You can't watch me work, Mom.

445
00:19:57,547 --> 00:19:59,157
There are rules
about these things.

446
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,959
We'll grab a bite
and wait, then.

447
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:04,418
The cafe is closed, Dad.
The gift shop is closed.

448
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:07,087
Everything is closed
but the saving-lives part

449
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:09,723
of this building, okay?

450
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,093
You should have called first.

451
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:15,329
Do you not want us to be here?

452
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:17,193
Do you not want us
meeting your colleagues?

453
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:21,018
What? No. Okay,
that-that's ridiculous.

454
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,939
Look, I'm sorry. Okay?

455
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,153
You can stay. There's a-a
nice waiting area upstairs

456
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:29,677
and I will drop by when I can.

457
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:32,112
But right now I have to go.

458
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:34,432
I have patients that need me.

459
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,951
All right?

460
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:45,626
He's under a lot of pressure.

461
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,845
Excuse me.

462
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,980
Where did you get that?

463
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,049
Uh, on the buffet tables.

464
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,901
<i>Oh, my God, you
have to turn that off.</i>

465
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,658
<i>You're making me so nervous.</i>

466
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,012
<i>Hi. Hi. Um, wow.</i>

467
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:09,015
<i>Uh, I can't believe that
you guys are all here</i>

468
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:11,485
<i>to see this dream come true.</i>

469
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:16,457
<i>Painting has been a passion
of mine since I was a child.</i>

470
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,476
<i>So, thank you.</i>

471
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:22,029
<i>To all of you, to the
Thackery Gallery and, uh,</i>

472
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:25,566
<i>especially to my parents.</i>

473
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,612
<i>Okay, uh, sorry. That
is enough out of me.</i>

474
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:29,414
<i>I'm so nervous, I might
actually run the risk</i>

475
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,738
<i>of talking all night.</i>

476
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:32,156
<i>So, enjoy the show.</i>

477
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,191
<i>Which we know</i>

478
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,193
<i>will be the first of many.</i>

479
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,828
<i>Thank you, Dad. Thank you.</i>

480
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,030
<i>Thank you, Dad. Enjoy the show.</i>

481
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,173
Hello?

482
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,392
Hi, um, my name's,
uh, Nic Nevin.

483
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:54,539
I'm calling from Chastain Park
Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.

484
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,231
<i>Uh, your daughter, Sara,
is being treated here.</i>

485
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,100
Is she all right?

486
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,446
Well, she's safe, but
I'm-I'm afraid she's quite ill,

487
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,437
- which is why I'm calling.
<i>- Yes...</i>

488
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:07,875
Uh, I know. She has...
paranoid schizophrenia.

489
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:09,454
<i>She refused to
take her medication,</i>

490
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:11,807
<i>and we told her if she was
going to live in this house,</i>

491
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,064
she would have to.

492
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,083
That was the last
time we saw her.

493
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,968
Mrs. Ravenscroft...

494
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:21,472
<i>I-I assume you're putting
her on a psychiatric hold.</i>

495
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,908
Um, we'll cover
all of her expenses.

496
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:28,078
Maybe you will have more luck
getting her on anti-psychotics.

497
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,991
Mrs. Ravenscroft, the
doctors don't believe

498
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,582
that she's mentally ill.

499
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:34,084
Forgive me if I
can't take the word

500
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,936
of some random ER

501
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,133
<i>over the diagnosis of a
world-renowned psychiatrist</i>

502
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,556
<i>that examined her.</i>

503
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,958
Maybe if you just, if you
just came to see Sara.

504
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,960
She's scared and alone.

505
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,340
I-I really think
it would help if...

506
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,596
<i>She's schizophrenic.</i>

507
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,466
She needs to accept it.

508
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,369
Please don't fill her head
with a lot of false hope.

509
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,355
<i>Just give her the
meds that she needs.</i>

510
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,157
Thank you.

511
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:13,173
- You guys reach her parents?
- Yeah, they're not coming.

512
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:15,053
Her mom's convinced
Sara's schizophrenic.

513
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,190
We need to figure out
what the real diagnosis is.

514
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:20,781
Well, that's not gonna happen.

515
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,167
She's getting sent
back to Atlanta General.

516
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,214
They'll just treat her for a
pneumonia she doesn't have,

517
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,738
load her up with olanzapine
and turf her again.

518
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,874
Or worse, banish her
to their psych ward.

519
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,048
Where you going?

520
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,155
- This place feels pricey.
- Mm-hmm.

521
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,662
- Champagne, Dr. Hawkins?
- No, thank you.

522
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,365
Dr. Hawkins, could it be?

523
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,017
H-Himaya, this is
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

524
00:23:57,086 --> 00:24:00,353
The mentor. So nice to meet you.

525
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:02,656
I didn't catch a name.

526
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:03,935
Oh. I'm Tejan,
and this is Himaya.

527
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,325
We're Devon's parents.

528
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:07,238
Right, yes, you're
in town. Oh, wow.

529
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:08,924
It's... It's so
nice to meet you.

530
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,347
So nice to meet you, too.

531
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,216
- Thank you for everything you've done for our son.
- Yes.

532
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,535
You should be very
proud of him. Excuse me,

533
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:17,349
- I have to talk to someone.
- Of course.

534
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,383
- He's so nice.
- Very nice.

535
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:20,640
Who are they?

536
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,577
Uh, I think I heard
telecom billionaire. I just..

537
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:25,312
- Oh.
- Yeah.

538
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,381
I have some news.

539
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:30,017
We just admitted a
VIP, Sara Ravenscroft.

540
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:31,651
Of the Savannah Ravenscrofts?

541
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,598
The very wealthy
and philanthropic

542
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:36,357
Savannah Ravenscrofts. Correct.

543
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:38,592
You put her on the
16th floor, I hope.

544
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,228
That's a good idea. I
should... I'm, I just...

545
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:42,807
I had her flying coach,
but let's upgrade her

546
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:44,381
to the VIP wing immediately.

547
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,782
Okay, well, I should go see her.

548
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,284
Well, you've already met her.

549
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,353
She was here at
the fundraiser earlier.

550
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:52,590
Five-seven, blonde
hair, dark roots.

551
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,025
Carrying a $100,000
Xavier Mellino bag.

552
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,112
I'm not gonna lie, she
could use a shower.

553
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:03,216
Sara Ravenscroft is...

554
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:07,449
Well, get her up
on the 16th floor,

555
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,151
and I'll be up
there in a minute.

556
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,495
Sure. But you have to deal
with Atlanta General first.

557
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:16,263
You did call them to come
get their Jane Doe, right?

558
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,483
Yeah.

559
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,098
I appreciate the call, Randolph.

560
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,334
Listen, I am sorry
about the Jane Doe.

561
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:41,054
Apparently, she ran off when
personnel just wasn't looking.

562
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,308
Right. And walked three
miles to the closest hospital

563
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,521
despite a severely
compromised sense of direction.

564
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,412
Denying someone proper
treatment when they present

565
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,176
with a clear emergency
medical condition

566
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,467
is a violation of
federal law, Gavin.

567
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:54,546
Listen.

568
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,470
If one of our people turfed

569
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:58,116
a homeless patient
to your hospital,

570
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,472
they will be terminated.

571
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:00,551
Look, the only reason
you're here is because

572
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:01,842
we threatened to tell the media

573
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,521
Atlanta General
dumps its undesirables.

574
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:05,646
You're lucky we
didn't call the cops.

575
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:07,892
Randolph, if you came to
us with the same problem,

576
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,545
we would handle
it with discretion.

577
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,535
Well, unlike your hospital,

578
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:14,504
we treat everyone who
walks through these doors.

579
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,139
So, what's really at play here?

580
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,374
At play?

581
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:18,975
You played us, Gavin.

582
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,545
We're done here. You won.

583
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,400
Listen, I promise you, they're
gonna have you back up

584
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,189
dancing the salsa with, um,

585
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,436
what's your
boyfriend's name again?

586
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,527
Joe, but he doesn't dance much.

587
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,773
Oh, I'm telling you right now.

588
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,541
You could teach him
how to dance, right?

589
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,610
How did you get
here from your bed?

590
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,362
Oh, the nurse was nice
enough to help me out.

591
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,586
You see, Mrs. Reed's a little

592
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,165
nervous about
her fractured ankle,

593
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,585
so I'm just keeping her company
till the doctors come back.

594
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,236
- I am better.
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,360
- Thank you. Carry on.
- Mm.

596
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,290
What's up?

597
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:58,715
- He's working the room pro bono.
- Hey,

598
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,584
you guys save lives,

599
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,419
I save people from loneliness.

600
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:05,138
It's like my superpower.

601
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,384
Are you all right? Your
voice sounds different.

602
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:07,507
And his breathing.

603
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:10,343
My chest feels tight.

604
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:12,812
Having a hard time breathing.

605
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,594
- Palpable air under the skin.
- Subcutaneous emphysema.

606
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:18,397
Do you think he
swallowed some glass?

607
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,298
- What's going on?
- Get up. Let's get you up.

608
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:23,424
Your vomiting en route may
have been forceful enough

609
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:25,452
to cause an
esophageal perforation.

610
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,571
Air is leaking into your chest.

611
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:28,044
We need a STAT CT chest,

612
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,963
esophagram, and call the OR.

613
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,783
So, if it's not mental illness

614
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:40,757
and it's not drugs, what is it?

615
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,471
No definitive answer yet.

616
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,139
How did Sara Ravenscroft
end up like this?

617
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,381
Well, this is her chest CT.

618
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:52,786
Multiple lesions.
They're too small

619
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:54,382
to have shown up
on previous X-rays.

620
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,856
Wow, the disease is extensive.

621
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,602
It could be TB, it
could be cancer.

622
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:59,637
I'm just waiting on
her biopsy results.

623
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:01,128
Okay, well, I'll call the lab,

624
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:02,623
see if I can get
them to speed it up.

625
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,498
Thank you.

626
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:11,205
Let's just wait and see.

627
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:16,610
Uh, we got a problem.
They've come to take Sara.

628
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:18,656
- I took care of Atlanta General.
- No, not Atlanta General.

629
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,482
Her parents are here, with
their doctor and their private jet.

630
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,515
Look, we can't
let them take her.

631
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,289
Sara is their daughter.

632
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,608
And since she can't
speak for herself,

633
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:33,939
they get to decide her course of
treatment and where she has it.

634
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,340
Okay, but they
want to medicate her

635
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:36,841
and put her in a
psychiatric facility.

636
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:38,659
That is not what
is best for Sara.

637
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,117
What if you're both wrong?

638
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,365
What if her respiratory
issues and her mental health

639
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,533
are unrelated, and what
if she is schizophrenic?

640
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,718
What if we're right and her
two issues are connected?

641
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:50,310
All I'm asking for is
a little bit more time.

642
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,173
If we can really figure
out what's wrong with Sara

643
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,630
and cure her,

644
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,744
think about how much
more financially grateful

645
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,968
the Ravenscrofts will be
to Chastain and to you.

646
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,156
Okay.

647
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,676
Okay. I can buy you, I
don't know, maybe an hour.

648
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,979
But the minute they demand it,

649
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:11,348
I have to discharge her.

650
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:21,725
Forgive me for the delay.
Um, please take a seat.

651
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:23,493
We're fine, thank you.

652
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,161
When can we see her, Doctor?

653
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,647
Well, i-in addition to
her mental disorientation,

654
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:30,367
your daughter had
bleeding in her lungs.

655
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,168
And we've identified the lesion,

656
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,782
which we're
cauterizing as we speak.

657
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:35,750
So it shouldn't be
too much longer.

658
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,118
The bleeding in her
lungs, is it serious?

659
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,675
For someone her age,

660
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:41,678
it's probably from a
bronchitis or pneumonia.

661
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,591
Soon as she's back in
Savannah, I'll have a pulmonologist

662
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,232
assess her while we treat her

663
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,711
for the schizophrenia
concurrently.

664
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:49,302
We will need copies
of all of her records

665
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,748
- and tests from tonight.
- Yeah, of course.

666
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:52,092
Now, are you...
are you confident

667
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,784
with the schizophrenia
diagnosis?

668
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:55,720
We've had her diagnosed
by the best in the field.

669
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:58,979
Would you object to sharing
that physician's name with me?

670
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,348
Do you have any
idea what it's like

671
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:04,517
to watch the child that
you love just fade away

672
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:06,419
piece by piece, Dr. Bell?

673
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:09,189
We're supposed to
protect our children.

674
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:13,026
It almost killed me that I
couldn't protect her from this.

675
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:15,255
But now Sara can't
speak for herself.

676
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:18,531
So we finally have
the legal power

677
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,744
to do something
about her condition.

678
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:21,768
We've waited a long time

679
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:23,715
to get her mental
disorder treated.

680
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,506
I'm in no mood
for further delays.

681
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:31,144
You know, I did some research

682
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:34,381
- on cellular memory and transplants.
- Uh-huh.

683
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,750
As it turns out, there
is a reason for you

684
00:30:36,818 --> 00:30:38,818
to be concerned
about your heart donor.

685
00:30:38,854 --> 00:30:40,765
I found some studies out
of Singapore showing that

686
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:43,624
the human heart can
actually store memory

687
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:46,793
through combinatorial
coding of nerve cells.

688
00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:48,595
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

689
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:51,798
There was one case, uh,
where an engineer in Iowa

690
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:54,934
received a murderer's heart
and stabbed his buddy in the head

691
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:56,370
with an ice pick.

692
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,372
Wait, wait a minute.
Are you sure?

693
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,758
Yeah. In another case, a
God-fearing high school teacher

694
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:05,628
from Conyers, Georgia
received the heart of a car thief

695
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,998
and suddenly fabricated
medical symptoms

696
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:10,767
just to get his doctor
to go out with him.

697
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,681
One can only wonder
what perverted intentions

698
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:14,771
he had in mind.

699
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,808
- So I wanted to go out with you.
- You lied.

700
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,410
Yes, but my brain wanted
to do the right thing.

701
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:24,480
My criminal heart held
it hostage. I'm sorry.

702
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,130
I like you. All right?

703
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,970
I know you're a good man.

704
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,974
But I don't date patients.

705
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,458
My career is my focus.

706
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,455
Anything else is an
unnecessary distraction.

707
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,412
What you want, I can't give.

708
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,780
I don't believe that.

709
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:41,849
Believe it.

710
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,461
And if you try to
prove otherwise,

711
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,784
I will guarantee you one thing.

712
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:46,786
I will break your
brand-new heart.

713
00:31:46,855 --> 00:31:49,655
Oh, I'll risk it. Turns
out they're replaceable.

714
00:31:49,724 --> 00:31:51,775
Good night, Micah.

715
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,672
- Oh, you're weakening.
- I'm not.

716
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:56,479
Yes, you are. Yes,
you are... Hey, wait.

717
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,548
Hey, oh. My heart
just skipped a beat.

718
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,003
It just skipped another one.

719
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:08,357
Come on, you're killing me.

720
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,177
You can't just leave me here.

721
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,599
- Any progress?
- I'm missing a puzzle piece.

722
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:22,889
I just don't know what it is.

723
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:27,327
What if we can't
diagnose her in time?

724
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:29,613
Then we go to plan B.
Try to get through to Sara.

725
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,841
Get her lucid enough to make
her own medical decisions.

726
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,920
Sara?

727
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,771
Sara.

728
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:47,247
Hey. Hey, I brought
you something.

729
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:49,849
These are tidal
marshes. You painted this.

730
00:32:49,918 --> 00:32:51,284
It has your name right there.

731
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,889
You're very talented, Sara.

732
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,218
Nic has a great eye.
If it weren't for her,

733
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,843
I'd still have Bruce Lee
posters on my walls.

734
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,096
Look, there's this one, too.

735
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:04,765
See?

736
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,890
Sara?

737
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,879
Sara?

738
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:18,895
Blood pressure's dropping.

739
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:21,564
Give her a 500cc bolus.

740
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:22,793
There's blood in her urine.

741
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,187
Disorientation, ear infection,
pulmonary bleeding...

742
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,823
Lung lesions, hematuria...

743
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,959
Any skin lesions?

744
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,020
Hey.

745
00:33:45,874 --> 00:33:47,523
I'll call the lab.

746
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:51,978
How will we know if we're right?

747
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:53,313
You'll see it in the blood.

748
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:54,859
Reminder, I'm a
nurse practitioner,

749
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:55,963
not a histopathologist.

750
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:56,933
You don't have to be.

751
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,268
You'll see.

752
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,203
Chris, can you put it up?

753
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,959
- Wow.
- See the staining pattern of the granular white cells?

754
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:09,579
Anti-neutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies.

755
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,448
Sara has Wegener's.

756
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,294
I've-I've read about it,
I've just never seen it.

757
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,701
The disease attacks blood
vessels in multiple organs.

758
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,615
I've never seen it attack
blood vessels in a brain,

759
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,639
but it makes sense.

760
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:19,972
It explains the psychosis.

761
00:34:21,443 --> 00:34:22,992
What?

762
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,962
Schizophrenia is not
curable, but this is.

763
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,631
I mean, that's news
any family would pray for.

764
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:33,025
- We can treat her.
- If she hasn't been discharged.

765
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:40,176
Sara has a very rare
autoimmune disease

766
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,711
called Wegener's.

767
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,257
It's what caused the bleeding
in her lungs and kidneys.

768
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,633
Which also, likely,
caused her erratic behavior,

769
00:34:46,702 --> 00:34:49,035
making her seem
mentally ill when she wasn't.

770
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:53,172
You understand how we still
find this news hard to believe.

771
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:54,986
The biopsy results

772
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,610
confirm the diagnosis, Lawrence.

773
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:57,978
The doctors are right.

774
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:59,813
She isn't schizophrenic.

775
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:01,526
Look, given the lack of research

776
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,260
on Wegener's affecting
the brain this way,

777
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:04,729
you know, I'm not surprised
Sara was misdiagnosed

778
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:06,319
at that early stage.

779
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:08,065
She's being treated
with medication

780
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:09,751
to stop the body
from attacking itself,

781
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,007
but it may take hours

782
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,054
- before we see any change.
- Dear God.

783
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:15,245
We almost had her committed.

784
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,747
She could have died.

785
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,719
What if she never forgives us?

786
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,612
The surgery was successful.

787
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,713
Your face is gonna be fine.

788
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,737
It'll heal without a scar.

789
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,675
You seem stressed.

790
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,260
Your parents.

791
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:49,062
Are they still here?

792
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,548
- It's that obvious, huh?
- Yeah.

793
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,900
Hey, you know what I think?

794
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:56,097
No, and I know that's not
gonna stop you from telling me.

795
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,498
I think your father's
not the only one

796
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,021
with money and pride issues.

797
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,907
I think it's you, too. Yeah.

798
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:03,243
I think that you're
anxious that your in-laws

799
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:05,795
won't think your
family measures up.

800
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,898
- Excuse me?
- Hey, bro, listen, I get it, man, I get it.

801
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,979
I'm-I'm the kid of
immigrants, too, all right?

802
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:16,639
I-I know how it feels to... to be
embarrassed by your parents.

803
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,143
God...

804
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,778
When I was in high school,
I would just get so frustrated,

805
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,314
you know, they couldn't grasp

806
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:27,049
- simple Western mores.
- Yeah.

807
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,570
You got it worse than me;
your dad's just a cab driver, so...

808
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,599
Dude, you have no
idea about my dad.

809
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,957
Folks hear the accent

810
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,671
and assume that
he's beneath them.

811
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:41,097
They have no idea that he
is a self-made entrepreneur.

812
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,765
That he speaks three languages.

813
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:46,102
Not to mention the courage
and the confidence it took him

814
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:50,340
to uproot his family and start
all over in another country.

815
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:53,793
Hey. I don't
think I could do it.

816
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,998
Your parents?

817
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:02,068
They sound great.

818
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,004
Yeah.

819
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:09,108
Yeah, they are.

820
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:16,115
- Okay, get some rest.
- Yeah.

821
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:18,985
And, uh, for the record, you're
not so bad at talking to people.

822
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:22,622
You ever consider a
career in psychotherapy?

823
00:37:22,691 --> 00:37:24,524
No, no, no. Too pretty.

824
00:37:24,593 --> 00:37:26,403
You know, but if the
looks fade, maybe.

825
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:28,160
- Channing.
- Ha.

826
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:29,696
Ready to get back to work?

827
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:31,008
I got to go check on my parents.

828
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:33,800
Is your tuxedo pressed?

829
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:36,002
Don't tell me they're
at the fundraiser.

830
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,054
Okay. I won't.

831
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,123
But Conrad says they are.

832
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:49,259
I have to say,

833
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:51,016
your sari is stunning

834
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:52,819
and such a breath of fresh air.

835
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:55,472
This traditional Indian
dress is really very simple.

836
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,173
An untailored length of cloth.

837
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,208
And yet so elegant.

838
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,505
Traditionally, the sari was seen

839
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:04,731
as a sign of purity,
because cloth, when cut

840
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,799
and pierced with
needles, was impure.

841
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:07,878
- Fascinating.
- Mm.

842
00:38:07,902 --> 00:38:09,201
You know, I love to travel.

843
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,881
I'll have to put India
on my bucket list.

844
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:13,389
Uh, I wanted to
thank you personally

845
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,157
for your support of Chastain.

846
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,010
Perhaps I could give you a tour,

847
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,307
let you see where your generous
donation gets put to good work.

848
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:21,213
- Donation?
- Dr. Hunter,

849
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:23,232
I'm sorry for the confusion.

850
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,280
- These are my... parents.
- I'm Tejan Pravesh,

851
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:27,737
and this is my wife Himaya.

852
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,689
- Oh.
- Devon is our son.

853
00:38:29,758 --> 00:38:31,223
Oh, s... I'm so sorry.

854
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,760
I was told that you were
in the telecom business.

855
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:36,863
I-I'm in... transportation.

856
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:39,766
My father owns his own cab.

857
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,601
He put me through medical school

858
00:38:41,669 --> 00:38:43,681
working seven days a
week, very long hours,

859
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:45,905
and I'm very proud of him.

860
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:49,191
You know, I-I don't have
any children of my own,

861
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,488
but if I did, I would hope
they'd be as proud of me

862
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:54,280
as Devon is of you.

863
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:58,118
Really, such a pleasure
to meet you both.

864
00:38:58,186 --> 00:39:00,402
- If you'll excuse me.
- Of course.

865
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,741
I-I'm sorry we couldn't
spend more time together,

866
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,310
but we had a lovely evening.

867
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:10,196
I hope we weren't
too much in the way.

868
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:14,267
No, I... I owe you
both an apology.

869
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,102
I was...

870
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:21,124
I was very dismissive of you
and your feelings at dinner.

871
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:24,126
No... I was wrong to
ask about Priya's parents.

872
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,029
No, you weren't.

873
00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:29,281
They've wanted to come visit,

874
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,750
and I've been pushing back.

875
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:32,919
I was...

876
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:34,887
I was...

877
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,723
I was worried about...

878
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:39,937
I was worried that
they were gonna take

879
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,494
creative control of the wedding.

880
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:43,340
But it's more than
that; I just didn't know

881
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:46,766
if you all were gonna get along.

882
00:39:46,835 --> 00:39:49,969
But I think it's important
that we all meet,

883
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:54,941
and we-we... we honor
family traditions on both sides.

884
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,476
We would like that very much.

885
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:58,578

No one's gonna
put you away, Sara,

- You have an autoimmune disease

that's been untreated
for a long time.

And the medicine that
they're giving you now,

911
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,372
it's reversing the disease.

912
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:35,341
You were right, Sara.

913
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,492
We were wrong.
