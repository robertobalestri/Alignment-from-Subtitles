00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:03,635
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- Hey, Noni.

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,970
You are looking
lovely today, as always.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,941
<i>Every reputable hospital
is trying to recruit Carver.</i>

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,993
How are your surgical
error and complication rates?

5
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:13,774
- Excuse me?
- Transparency and accountability force us

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:15,359
to weed out the bad
and grow the good.

7
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,244
- I need Bell.
- You know what to do.

8
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:20,218
<i>I pushed Dr. Okafor to
exceed my expectations,</i>

9
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:21,865
<i>and, sadly, on this
day, she wasn't ready.</i>

10
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,489
So you are finally cleared for
your bone marrow transplant.

11
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,453
We can start your
conditioning today.

12
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:28,455
Lily's in acute renal failure?

13
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:30,290
If we proceed with the
transplant, she'll die.

14
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:31,314
What's going on?

15
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,814
You were right.

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,900
<i>We have to do
something about Lane.</i>

17
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:39,020
<i>Have you thought
about the wedding?</i>

18
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,773
<i>No. It stresses me out.</i>

19
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:44,927
150 guests is well
within our budget.

20
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:46,995
150 guests<i> is</i> within our budget,

21
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:50,815
but none of these 150
guests include friends,

22
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,645
- only our families.
- Well,

23
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,147
we got to have
our families there.

24
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:57,639
Mmm, but do we, really?

25
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,659
Okay, maybe not yours.

26
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,929
This is why I want to elope.

27
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,949
- Lunch later?
- Sure.

28
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:09,718
Or...

29
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:11,230
we could just stay home, okay?

30
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:13,638
No. I'll be late for work.

31
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:15,811
- Yeah. I don't care.
- I know you don't care,

32
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,027
but I need you to care.

33
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,663
I'm serious, Devon.

34
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:24,299
It's my job...

35
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,641
That was nice.

36
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:36,811
Yeah. Yeah, very much.

37
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,385
You don't have to stay.

38
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:48,073
You trying to get rid of me?

39
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,541
Let's just call this
what it is, Conrad:

40
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,411
a rebound thing.

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,379
It's not.

42
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,682
It's not a rebound thing, I...

43
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,596
Nic and I, we split
up a while ago.

44
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,321
No, I meant it's...

00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,973
it's<i> my</i> rebound thing.

00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,560
Oh, yeah, right. You and Tucker.

47
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,061
All right. Okay.

48
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,699
I should go.

49
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,002

50
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,116

Hey, when you get a minute?

72
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:59,287
- Yeah.
- You had a chance to talk to Conrad about Lane

73

and her near-miss with Lily?

74
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,859

That's kind of what

Yeah, but wouldn't
it be nice if your job

It would be my first choice.

82
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,055
Yeah.

83
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,107
What's on your mind?

84
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,660
I want to report Dr. Hunter
to the state board

85
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:23,511
for overly aggressive treatment,

86
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,442
but if we could just
get a closer look

87
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,876
- at her patients files...
- She keeps all

88
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,745
of her patient
records at her clinic.

89
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,530
She doesn't even let
Lily's doctors see them.

90
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:33,321
I know... but
what if you told her

91
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,671
that you were interested
in writing a research paper

92
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:37,458
on her protocols?

93
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,594
What's up?

94
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:41,179
Hey, um, just talking about,

95
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:44,165
uh, Hunter's patient,
Darryl Phillips.

96
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,312
Judy called in sick,
so I'm helping her out.

97
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,214
I thought Lane banned
you from her patients.

98
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:49,871
Yes, so I'll keep a low profile,

99
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,073
and you'll keep your voice down.

100
00:04:52,142 --> 00:04:55,243
70, retired postal worker,
just got some bad news.

101
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:57,195
"CT scan and tumor markers

102
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,308
"are highly suggestive
of small-cell lung cancer

103
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,265
with obvious mets to the liver."

104
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,768
Lane didn't give
him a prognosis.

105
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,171
He has maybe six months or less.

106
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,556
And she wants to do a
biopsy, chemo, radiation.

107
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,787
She might be able to buy
him a couple extra months.

108
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,645
Look, I was just hoping
you could talk to him

109
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,915
and help him figure
out his priorities.

110
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,450
How was your evening?

111
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,084
Stayed in. Watched TV.

112
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,586
Hmm.

113
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,239
Oh, Mary. Why don't you shut up?

114
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:27,208
No, you shut up, you old toad.

115
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:29,861
Nicki, please get this
stoop lady out of here,

116
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,596
or I'll get a restraining order.

117
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,714
Well, aren't you two adorable?

118
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:35,917
Darryl, Mary. This is
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

119
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:38,070
He's gonna ask you
a series of questions

120
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:40,249
designed to help you figure out
where you want to go from here.

121
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,991
Well, I know where
I'm going. Home.

122
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,226
Okay, that's a beginning.

123
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:47,612
Tell me what
you're most afraid of.

124
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,132
Well, besides dying and going
to hell, I'm not a fan of snakes.

125
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,484
He's afraid of being serious.

126
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,198
Oh, I'm serious.

127
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,872
I'm serious as
stage IV lung cancer,

128
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,341
which I have, apparently,

129
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,929
even though I still feel
pretty damn good, right now.

130
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:05,880
I'm guessing that'll change

131
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,434
if I start all these treatments
Dr. Hunter wants to do.

132
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,753
But Darryl, what if
those treatments work?

133
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:13,321
Where you been, Mary?

134
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,352
There's nothing
that's gonna fix this.

135
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,009
Dr. Hunter says she
can extend your life.

136
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,578
It's possible.

137
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,113
She's had success
with many patients,

138
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,033
- but there are no guarantees.
- I know too many folks

139
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,801
who've been through this hell.

140
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,655
All this will do is rob me of
the few good months I have left.

141
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,658
Isn't that the truth, Doctor?

142
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,712
- It's a possible scenario, yeah.
- Well, I don't want that.

143
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,832
I don't want a few more
days in the hospital.

144
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,619
I've accepted there's not enough
time to drive across country,

145
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:49,057
so I'll settle on just
cleaning out the garage.

146
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:51,943
The garage? Why you keep
bringing up that damn garage?

147
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,212
The man asked me
what scares me, Mary.

148
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,364
What scares me is leaving you

149
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,313
with hospital
bills you can't pay

150
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,268
and a hoarder's garage.

151
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,370
There's a lot of
crap to sort through.

152
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,857
Tons of boxes, old paint cans...

153
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,893
and a certain VHS
tape you misplaced.

154
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,328
Shush.

155
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,064
Peter will help me.

156
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,367
I want to help you,

157
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,819
and that means
skipping the treatment.

158
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,388
Dr. Hunter wants to do a biopsy.

159
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,406
Why? We know
what's wrong with me.

160
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,076
To identify the type of
tumor and target therapy.

161
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:28,596
Well, no therapy,
so no biopsy. Simple.

162
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:34,436
Okay.

163
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,404
That's clear to me.

164
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,308
Great. More time at home
with the ball and chain.

165
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,121
All right, I'll have Dr. Hawkins
talk to your doctors

166
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:43,745
and we'll get you discharged.

167
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,033
Well, I was hoping
to start this meeting

168
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,935
with some good news.

169
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,237
However, it seems that
Chastain has fallen out

170
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,555
of the Top 50 Hospitals

171
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,757
on the<i> U.S. News & World Report.</i>

172
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,487
Well, maybe that's
one of the reasons

173
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,989
that we couldn't convince the
best surgeon in the northeast

174
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,112
to leave St. Grace

175
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,480
and come to Chastain.

176
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,999
Yeah, what happened
to Carver, anyway?

177
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,612
I thought Randolph
here was a closer.

178
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,090
Well, we were
miles apart in salary,

179
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,376
and Dr. Carver was also

180
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:18,446
pushing for publicly
disclosing complication rates,

181
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,282
- which leave us susceptible to lawsuits.
- True.

182
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,513
But I have been thinking
it's time that we consider

183
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,181
more transparency
here at Chastain,

184
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,304
on our own terms.

185
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,606
Some of the same hospitals

186
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,986
that are beating
us in the rankings

187
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,109
are doing just that.

188
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,355
Like tracking and identifying

189
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,262
offending physicians.

190
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,491
Just get rid of
repeat offenders.

191
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,131
Like Dr. Mina Okafor.

192
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,468
Okafor is not a problem.

193
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,487
She removed the wrong
testicle from a patient.

194
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,334
Terminating Dr. Okafor
will send a message

195
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,574
to coasting physicians

196
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:49,043
without resorting to a
disagreeable amount

197
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,623
- of public transparency.
- Okay, look.

198
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,525
If we terminated doctors
based on medical errors,

199
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:53,576
this room would be empty.

200
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,100
But if our CEO prefers,

201
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:59,120
I will send Emory the
more challenging cases

202
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,305
that made Chastain famous,

203
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,607
and we can focus on becoming

204
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,693
the tonsillectomy
capital of the world.

205
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:10,331
- Dr. Smooth?
- That's his nickname.

206
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,434
His real name is
Spalding Massero.

207
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,622
He's a concierge doctor
who practices out of New York.

208
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:17,367
His patients are
rich high-profiles

209
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,290
from all over the world.

210
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,827
He charges the big
fees, we do all the work.

211
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,574
First time I've been
in the VIP wing.

212
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,675
I haven't even stayed
in hotels this nice.

213
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,317
There they are. Come
on over, gentlemen.

214
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:31,886
Conrad, you remember
Dr. Spalding Massero.

215
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:34,989
Our residents,
Dr. Hawkins, Dr. Pravesh.

216
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,920
I remember Conrad Hawkins
via the U.S. Marine Corps

217
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,560
in Afghanistan. How's your dad?

218
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,980
- The same.
- Devon Pravesh.

219
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:43,581
Harvard Medical and Yale?

220
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,184
- Or is it the other way around?
- You got it right.

221
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,552
Dr. Massero was just telling me

222
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:48,965
about his hole in
one at Spyglass.

223
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,639
Oh, was it official?
Any witnesses?

224
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,219
Ah, well, you insult him.

225
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:54,458
And Steph Curry.

226
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,761
- And Larry Ellison.
- Oh, okay.

227
00:09:58,382 --> 00:09:59,914
We done fluffing here?

228
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,219
As will all of
Dr. Massero's patients,

229
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:07,339
- this has to be handled discreetly.
- Yes.

230
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,995
Bobby, get off that leg.

231
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:15,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

232
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,882
That is Bobby Singer.

233
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,084
The first baseball
game I ever went to

234
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,803
with my dad, Bobby pitched.

235
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,208
I am looking at the two doctors

236
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:29,321
who stand between
my patient and his dream

237
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,879
to finally pitch in
a World Series.

238
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,798
I had knee surgery a couple
years back, so I figured

239
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:42,173
- I tweaked it, but...
- Team doctors don't think

240
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,786
- it's structural.
- Yeah, it looks like

241
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,510
- deep vein thrombosis.
- That sounds bad.

242
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,880
DVT is a blood clot.
It's good you're here.

243
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:51,210
Yeah, he'll need blood
thinners and a surgical consult

244
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,501
- for a possible thrombectomy.
- Like surgery?

245
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,249
- We're in the middle of a pennant race.
- Yeah, I know.

246
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:57,617
Surgery's good.
You want surgery.

247
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,585
Surgery's quick, and
so is the recovery time.

248
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:01,687
Before we address his return
to the game, let's figure out why

249
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,355
Mr. Singer's leg is swelling...
We'll need ultrasounds

250
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,508
of his upper and lower
extremities and a CT pelvis.

251
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,400
- What else, Harvard?
- If he has a clot,

252
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,329
he'll need a full
hypercoagulable workup,

253
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:14,906
including factor V Leiden,
protein C, and S levels.

254
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,458
If all goes well, we'll
get you out of here

255
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,655
- in a couple of hours.
- No. We'll keep him overnight,

256
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,146
- just for observation, hmm?
- We're gonna do

257
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,615
everything we can to get
you back on that mound.

258
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,817
All right. Thanks, man.

259
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,451
I mean, Dr...

260
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,453
Devon.

261
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,657
- Just... you know what, just call me Devon.
- Devon.

262
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,759
All right. Thanks.

263
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,566
So why do they call
him "Dr. Smooth"?

264
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,512
Massero hates
conflict, he hates drama

265
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,748
and he really hates
delivering bad news to patients

266
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,517
who pay him a lot of
money not to hear it,

267
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,775
so he outsources the
tough love to grunts like us.

268
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:54,028
Which makes me think
Bobby has a big problem.

269
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:58,433
- Hey.
- Hey.

270
00:11:58,502 --> 00:11:59,667
So, Noni?

271
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:01,936
We've got a DVT consult on Six.

272
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:03,649
He might need
surgical management.

273
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:05,873
- Can you see him?
- Yeah, I'll check my schedule.

274
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:08,909
Fair to say you're over Nic.

275
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,967
Our clinical volume
is growing so fast,

276
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,619
we're having difficulty moving
them through the system,

277
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,399
which is probably what
happened to Mrs. Shea.

278
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:22,656
Okay, and Darryl Phillips?

279
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:25,677
I need someone to
perform his biopsy today.

280
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,414
Excuse me. Uh, regarding
Mr. Phillips's biopsy.

281
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,815
Are you following Mr. Phillips?

282
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:32,050
He is not.

283
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,762
I am now. I was
asked to speak with him

284
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,554
after he had second
thoughts about his treatment.

285
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,101
As you know, his
prognosis is terminal.

286
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,691
And how would you know
that for sure without the biopsy?

287
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,371
CT scan and tumor
markers are suggestive

288
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,695
of small-cell lung cancer
with mets to the liver,

289
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,765
stage IV.

290
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,016
His prognosis is extremely poor.

291
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,668
Yes,

292
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,865
and with what little
time he has left, he'd like

293
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,767
to get his affairs in order
and be at home with his wife.

294
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,074
Well, a biopsy helps
us definitively tailor

295
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,243
his treatment,
especially in the event

296
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,257
that it's not
small-cell lung cancer.

297
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,515
Mr. Phillips doesn't want the
biopsy, since he doesn't want

298
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:06,796
a treatment that's unlikely
to change his outcome.

299
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,919
Unlikely?

300
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,521
We punt on unlikely
outcomes now?

301
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,423
We do not.

302
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,108
Even if it is small-cell,

303
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:16,460
chemoradiation is still
an option worth exploring.

304
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,714
I will speak to the patient,
make sure he understands

305
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:22,550
- the upside of chemo one more time.
- O-Okay,

306
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,363
so i-in the future, just so I'm
clear, in these tumor board

307
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,065
meetings, we don't factor
in what the patient wants?

308
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:27,699
I'm just asking,
so I don't waste

309
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,140
any more of your valuable time.

310
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,558
That's enough, Conrad.

311
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:32,587
All right, I need
someone to perform

312
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,045
Mr. Phillips's biopsy today.

313
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,363
Where is Vincent?

314
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:38,716
I'm free this afternoon.

315
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,496
- I can do it.
- Thank you, Jude.

316
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,737
But I think we should
wait for Dr. Vincent.

317
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,272
Okay, thank you, everyone.

318
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,424
Conrad.

319
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,812
I want you there when
I talk to Mr. Phillips,

320
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,519
so there's no more confusion.

321
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,440
What was that?

322
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,154
The patient doesn't
want the biopsy.

323
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,477
Well, I didn't argue for one.

324
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,024
I just volunteered
to do the procedure.

325
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,092
Darryl Phillips just
wants to go home and die,

326
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,210
but there's no money in
it for Chastain if he leaves

327
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,835
- without more treatment.
- Okay, calm down.

328
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,638
What is this?

329
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:18,289
Is this about me and Nic?

330
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,825
This has nothing to
do with you and Nic,

331
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,571
and everything to
do with Darryl Phillips,

332
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,862
whose dying wish is to go home.

333
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,930
Okay, don't you forget:

334
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,766
I'm the attending, and
you're the resident, brother.

335
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,870
So, technically, you outrank me,
but that doesn't change the fact

336
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,716
that you don't know
what you're talking about.

337
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,274
You and I aren't in the
military anymore, brother.

338
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:40,060
I don't even need to salute you.

339
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:49,337
You're here to tell me
you saved my job today

340
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:51,538
at the board meeting.

341
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,224
Word gets around fast.

342
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,826
Oh, it does, when you're
the one spreading it.

343
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,241
They were looking
for a scapegoat,

344
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,681
I made sure it wasn't you.

345
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:03,701
That should make you
the opposite of angry.

346
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,147
No, I'm here to tell
you we'll be able

347
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,682
to work together
again as partners.

348
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:10,041
I think we had some
nice momentum going.

349
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,326
I'm not ready.

350
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,196
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,215
I am not ready to work with you.

352
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:22,169
You were right, what you
said at my M&M hearing.

353
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,390
I wasn't ready.

354
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,541
I want to be ready next time.

355
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,662
Well, we won't put
you in a position

356
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,862
to fail again.

357
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,731
No, thanks.

358
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,533
I'll serve my penance studying,

359
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,920
and doing prostatectomies
on the Titian.

360
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,855
Well, y-yeah. You
need permission...

361
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:45,243
I sought and received permission
from the residency board

362
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,995
to work under Dr. Kays
for the next three months.

363
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,815
Excuse me.

364
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,089
What kind of research project?

365
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,852
On your promising treatment
regimen at your clinic.

366
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,954
A retrospective review
focused on outcomes

367
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:03,745
and disease-free intervals.

368
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:06,547
When it's published, it could
bring in even more patients,

369
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,299
- and save lives.
- And you think you're the first resident

370
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,835
to approach me about
writing a research paper?

371
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,238
Of course not,
but they're not me.

372
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,174
Hmm.

373
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,176
Well, thank you,

374
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,161
but a manuscript for
a prestigious journal

375
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,631
is already in progress.

376
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,367
Anything else?

377
00:16:27,437 --> 00:16:29,036
No.

378
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,472
Appreciate your time.

379
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,530
She definitely wasn't into it.

380
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,560
Doctors don't mind multiple
papers published, as long

381
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,013
as they're favorable. She just
doesn't want you poking around.

382
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,947
Yeah, maybe it's time I
quit thinking like a doctor,

383
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,971
and start thinking
like a journalist.

384
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,012
Darryl, I know my aggressive
regimen can seem daunting,

385
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,448
but cancer is a
relentless enemy,

386
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,495
and you have to fight it
with extreme prejudice.

387
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,397
You have to fight
it with fire and fury.

388
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,421
You can't just give up.

389
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,007
That's why people from all
over the world come to my clinics,

390
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,542
because I never give up.

391
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:12,079
Yes, the survival rate for
your prognosis is not great.

392
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:13,447
Not great?

393
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:15,649
- It's nil.
- You're wrong.

394
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:18,752
There's always a chance
that you can be the outlier,

395
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:21,471
someone who beat the odds.

396
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,757
I told you, honey.

397
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:25,893
But I need to know
my enemy to fight it.

398
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,962
What do you think, Doc?

399
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:30,564
Dr. Hawkins is an
incredible doctor,

400
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,383
but he's an internist.

401
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,602
He doesn't treat cancer.

402
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:36,487
I'm your oncologist,

403
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,123
and I know what I'm doing.

404
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,125
Okay, I guess.

405
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,777
Do the biopsy.

406
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:44,912
Oh, okay.

407
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:45,981
Yes.

408
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:47,381
Thank you.

409
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,154
I saw you pitch a two-hitter

410
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:57,841
against Chicago
in 2014 and lose.

411
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,676
Yeah, on a throwing error.

412
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,724
- What are you testing for?
- Find out what's causing

413
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,130
what's causing the clot.

414
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,344
You've been through
Tommy John surgery.

415
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:07,067
You can come back from this.

416
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:08,035
All right, so after you fix it,

417
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:09,753
when can I start throwing again?

418
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,272
- That's up to your team doctor.
- And you,

419
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,119
- but you can't come back too soon.
- Why?

420
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,738
- What would happen if I did?
- Well, that depends.

421
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:19,163
- It depends on the results of the test.
- Yeah.

422
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,552
This conversation's not
really constructive right now.

423
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,245
Bobby, I want you to meet
the chief executive officer

424
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,147
of Chastain. She wanted
to come up and say hello,

425
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,703
and, uh, see how you're doing.

426
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,038
We've actually met before.

427
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,187
You helped us raise
awareness and finances

428
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,025
for our children's hospital.

429
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,032
That's right. It's
good to see you.

430
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:36,341
- Well, thank you, Doctor. I'll take it from here.
- Right.

431
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,394
- And can I speak to you for a second?
- Absolutely.

432
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,550
Thank you again for
choosing Chastain.

433
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,019
Of course.

434
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,572
And, uh, we'll be back
to check on you later.

435
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,136
All right, man.

436
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,804
Hey, is this a bad time?

437
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,222
Yeah.

438
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:51,178
All right, I'll come back.

439
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:52,312
Hey, it's all right.

440
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,748
Come on in.

441
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,998
I can sign those for you.

442
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,367
Oh, uh, not for me.

443
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,696
Some of the kids
in the pediatric ward

444
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,020
heard you were up here.

445
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:01,789
That's great. Here.

446
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:04,408
- I'm happy to help.
- Thank you.

447
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,260
I can get some swag

448
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,277
for the kids.

449
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,796
Hats, jerseys.

450
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:10,564
Aw, that's really sweet.

451
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,901
Here. Let me get
your phone number.

452
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,336
It's fine.

453
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,755
Look, if you want, I can
just give you my number,

454
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,001
- and you can contact me when...
- Oh, no, no, no.

455
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,124
It's fine, sorry. Here,

456
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,075
I'll just punch it in, here.

457
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,028
There you go.

458
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,679
Thanks again for these.

459
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:33,420
Oh... this has peppers.

460
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:36,574
I think it's yours.

461
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:39,559
So how's it going with
that, um, that Pinetree story?

462
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:41,028
Pinewick.

463
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,891
I told you, there's not
enough evidence yet

464
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,182
to link the toxic
landfill to the clusters.

465
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,933
Right.

466
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,198
Hey, uh, just curious... Were
any of the cancer patients

467
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,789
you interviewed
treated by Dr. Hunter?

468
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,291
Your Lane Hunter?

469
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,492
Yeah.

470
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,261
No. Why?

471
00:19:57,313 --> 00:20:00,247
Uh, just wondering. If
they'd been treated by her,

472
00:20:00,316 --> 00:20:01,844
maybe there'd be evidence
that could link their cancer

473
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,467
with the landfill.

474
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,586
Evidence I could help you get.

475
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:09,406
That's nice of you.

476
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,625
Just trying to be supportive.

477
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:13,839
I suppose there could be
patients in the cluster study

478
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:17,180
that I didn't interview who
were Lane Hunter's patients.

479
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,882
I could try to find them.

480
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,984
Why?

481
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,454
Is there a story here?

482
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:26,107
Maybe.

483
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:27,441
For sure, there would be

484
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,238
a conflict of interest
for the both of us,

485
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:33,196
and the possibility of
bad publicity for Chastain,

486
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:37,134
so... I would ask
you to just, please,

487
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,870
tread lightly?

488
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:49,647
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

489
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,251
Everything okay?

490
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,964
Your baseball player
just sent me a picture

491
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,988
of a swollen appendage
that is definitely not his leg.

492
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,591
- Okay, thanks. Yeah, I got it.
- I mean...

493
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,354
Thank you.

494
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:03,822
I'm gonna talk to
Bobby. He can't do that.

495
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,145
No, don't. I can handle it.

496
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:06,291
It's not the first time
this has happened.

497
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,232
Jude send one too?

498
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:13,065
- Very funny.
- All joking aside,

499
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:14,688
I'm talking to Bobby Singer.

500
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:18,592
Conrad, I'm serious. I don't
want you going up there.

501
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,578
And, for the record,

502
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,947
Jude and I are just
friends, unlike you and Noni.

503
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:25,599
Hey.

504
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:26,733
Yeah, okay. Fine.

505
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,036
Everything all right?

506
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,182
I need a surgeon to do
the Darryl Phillips's biopsy.

507
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,556
Hastings signed in.

508
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,341
He got pulled into a Whipple.

509
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,610
- Well, Mina's the on-call resident.
- Mm, she's in

510
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,543
the penalty box. I'll get Jude.

511
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:51,024
Yeah, don't bother
knocking. Come on in.

512
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,248
Is there anything
else I can get you, sir?

513
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,895
He's good.

514
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,569
Can I have a moment, please?

515
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,721
Go ahead.

516
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,790
Mm.

517
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,250
Bad news?

518
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,618
That little selfie you
sent to one of our nurses?

519
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:21,338
I know you think
it's all in good fun,

520
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,224
like sending over a drink

521
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,820
to a woman you don't
know, but you're wrong.

522
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,911
It's harassment.
So before you leave,

523
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:30,247
apologize to her.

524
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,567
All right.

525
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,994
If that nurse got a problem...

526
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,186
then she can come
and tell me, all right?

527
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,702
Oh.

528
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,121
- Oh.
- Sit down.

529
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,284
Don't tell me to sit down.

530
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,459
Sats are dropping. He's
acutely short of breath with

531
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:02,029
pleuritic chest pain. We
need to rule out a PE.

532
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:05,282
- I'm drawing an ABG.
- Am I having a heart attack?

533
00:23:05,334 --> 00:23:06,745
Doubtful, but we need
more tests to be certain.

534
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:08,485
First test will be drawing blood

535
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,354
to check its oxygen content
to see if the clot in your leg

536
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,418
traveled to your lungs,
but it starts with you

537
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:15,626
sitting the hell down!

538
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:19,246
Fine. Don't sit. We'll
do this the hard way.

539
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:23,684
- Oh! Oh!
- Put him on oxygen and get him to CT stat.

540
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,670
- You enjoyed that.
- Just a little.

541
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:34,573
What the hell happened?

542
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:37,982
CT shows a pulmonary
embolism with a small segmental

543
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:42,002
filling defect. We may have
to switch his anticoagulant, but

544
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,354
this should be treatable
without surgery.

545
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,840
He said you two
got in an argument.

546
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,760
Bobby throwing a clot from
his leg to his chest is unrelated

547
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:52,074
to our discussion of how
he sexually harasses nurses,

548
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:55,348
and has everything to do
with his deep vein thrombosis.

549
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,690
We have to treat everyone,
from sexists to Nazis.

550
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,887
- That's the gig.
- Yeah, and we can still treat him,

551
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,723
but nowhere is it written
that patients are allowed

552
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:09,541
to send pics of
their junk to nurses.

553
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:12,783
Well, this isn't
just any patient.

554
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:15,719
Too bad for Chastain,
I'm not just any doctor.

555
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:22,175
So you didn't get the
name of this big shot

556
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:23,911
VIP Massero's sending us?

557
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,907
He didn't want to tell me
the name of his patient,

558
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,476
just that it's some wealthy
Chinese businessman

559
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,278
who's gonna be in
the U.S. next month,

560
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,901
so we have to keep it quiet.

561
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,605
Well, shouldn't be too hard.
You haven't told me much.

562
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,418
Massero wants a
headliner for the surgery.

563
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:39,593
Face of the hospital.

564
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,128
I suggested you.

565
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:43,330
That's wonderful. I
look forward to that.

566
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,748
I suggested you, even though

567
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,883
you challenged me
at the board meeting.

568
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:50,804
Claire, I was just
speaking truth to power.

569
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:53,774
Truth? I'm not so sure of that.

570
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,360
Massero also has
one other condition.

571
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,473
He doesn't want Conrad near
any of his patients anymore.

572
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,448
Not the Chinese
billionaire next month,

573
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,750
nor Bobby Singer,
starting right now.

574
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,354
I'm happy to talk to Conrad,

575
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,733
but we need to
have a conversation

576
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,741
about transparency.

577
00:25:10,793 --> 00:25:13,860
I'm about to get on
a call. We'll do it later.

578
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:24,421
Definite compression in the
left iliac vein, causing the clotting

579
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:26,806
- in the iliofemoral vein.
- May-Thurner Syndrome.

580
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,260
Treatable with anticoagulants
and surgery, but...

581
00:25:29,312 --> 00:25:31,089
Your idol gets hit
with a line drive

582
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,913
while he's on a blood thinner...

583
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:34,892
Uncontrollable
internal bleeding.

584
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:37,751
Bobby's not gonna pitch
this year, maybe even next.

585
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,386
Well, let's pull it together.

586
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,588
Let's come up with a
path that might save

587
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:43,123
the rest of Bobby's career,

588
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:46,426
and then put a plan together
to present it to Dr. Smooth.

589
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:47,894
Conrad, I need to speak to you.

590
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:54,218
The guy sent Nic a picture...

591
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,014
- Yeah, it's called sexting.
- It's called harassment.

592
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,322
Look, we need Massero
funneling his high-profiles

593
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,624
to our VIP wing.

594
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,237
And membership
has its privileges?

595
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,005
You confronted one
of Massero's patients,

596
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,991
and he thinks you
aggravated his condition.

597
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:08,276
- Seriously, you believe that?
- Doesn't matter what I believe.

598
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,617
And you know what, if
Nic doesn't want to invite

599
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:12,230
this type of behavior,
she shouldn't be giving

600
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:13,665
her number out to a
professional athlete.

601
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:15,889
Oh, come on. Did you
just say that out loud?

602
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,602
Yeah, and I'm gonna
say this even louder.

603
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:19,876
We don't want you in a
room with Bobby Singer.

604
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:22,412
Or any of Massero's
patients ever again.

605
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,585
First assist, you
can close up now.

606
00:26:45,654 --> 00:26:47,294
Yes, Doctor.

607
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:55,595
I have, uh, some good news.

608
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:58,465
I've been asked to perform
a very delicate surgery

609
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:02,269
on a foreign VIP next
month... Very hush-hush...

610
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:04,154
And I've chosen you to assist.

611
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,906
What's in it for me?

612
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:10,477
In success, your skills will
have international exposure,

613
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,179
and, more importantly
for the short-term,

614
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:16,683
it will impress your doubters
on the board of directors.

615
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,938
Thank you, but I'm happy here,

616
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,572
and my attending

617
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:25,359
is very pleased with my work.

618
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,080
Well, that's nice.

619
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,118
But any doctor who handles
a scalpel at Chastain Park

620
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,886
answers to the Chief of Surgery,
which happens to be my title,

621
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,924
and that means you're
back assisting me.

622
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,060
Is that understood, Dr. Okafor?

623
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,035
Welcome back.

624
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,297
- Bell's leveraging you.
- I refuse to do all the work

625
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:05,277
for no credit while
he gets all the glory.

626
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:07,100
I'm not the damn help.

627
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:09,114
I'll tell the board I'm
not ready for surgery,

628
00:28:09,138 --> 00:28:11,605
that I am a menace to medicine.

629
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:12,968
Council of elders
will never believe you.

630
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,558
You come off as too arrogant

631
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,371
to fool anyone that
you're incompetent.

632
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,672
Thank you.

633
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,145
Anytime.

634
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,496
Okay...

635
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,760
advancing through the carina

636
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:27,320
into the right main bronchus.

637
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:34,027
And now into the right
upper lobe bronchus...

638
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:37,798
and into the lung.

639
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,984
Yeah, I can see the tumor. Okay.

640
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,653
Collecting sample.

641
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,773
Got you.

642
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,628
Here we go.

643
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,663
All right.

644
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:58,719
And withdrawing the scope.

645
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:01,107
You can go ahead and call
for my next patient, please.

646
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:09,746
Oxygen sats are
acutely dropping.

647
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:10,815
Stethoscope.

648
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,972
I got decreased breath
sounds on the right side.

649
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:22,275
Give me a 28 French tube, now.

650
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,443
Collapsed the lung.

651
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:27,781
Scalpel.

652
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:49,853
Who do you think you
are? You confronted Bobby?

653
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:51,738
God, you just had to be a hero,

654
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,802
- after I told you<i> not</i> to go up there.
- He's a VIP.

655
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,504
I went to talk to him
because I knew you couldn't.

656
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:56,787
Couldn't or wouldn't?
Because I can, and I will.

657
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:58,440
If you complain
to your supervisor,

658
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,141
they'll just blame
you for being up there

659
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,726
- in the first place.
- So let 'em.

660
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,316
What did you accomplish, Conrad?

661
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,514
- Now you can't take Massero's patient.
- Win-win.

662
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,132
I don't care if I ever see
Massero again, and guys like

663
00:30:07,156 --> 00:30:08,400
Bobby have to learn they
can't get away with that.

664
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:09,756
And guys like you have to learn

665
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:11,319
that sometimes, we want
to take care of ourselves.

666
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,409
You just can't help yourself.

667
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,451
Darryl.

668
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,669
That's unbelievable.

669
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:28,141
Jude perforated his
lung pulling out the scope.

670
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,987
Great, so now Darryl is
stuck with a chest tube

671
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,846
and the drainage system
until his air leak heals.

672
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,018
He's fine.

673
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:42,422
We can start radiation
mapping tomorrow, as planned.

674
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:46,076
I disagree, respectfully,
with that approach.

675
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,811
The biopsy results came back.
It's everything that we thought.

676
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:52,249
Stage IV. Small-cell.
Statistically hopeless.

677
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,817
Now Darryl can go home.

678
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,845
No, now Darryl
can start radiation.

679
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:58,288
Once he's mapped, I've
got him pre-scheduled

680
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,823
for twice-a-day treatments.

681
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:01,536
He'll need 30 over
the next three weeks,

682
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,038
and he'll alternate that
with his chemo cycles.

683
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:04,778
He doesn't want it, Lane.

684
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,708
Patients don't know
what they want, Conrad.

685
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,966
It's up to doctors to
frame their care in a way

686
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,879
so they understand
what's best for them.

687
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:13,719
Or frame it in a way that hides
everything that's bad from them.

688
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,756
Bottom line, no one's
hopeless in my world.

689
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:20,276
I look forward to the day when
you're proud to be a doctor.

690
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,594
This was the easy part?

691
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,300
Where's Jude?

692
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:45,433
In the call room. Why?

693
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,839
I missed a layup.

694
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:14,648
You're not the first doctor
to cause a pneumothorax.

695
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:19,870
That air leak will take
two weeks to heal.

696
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,858
Not exactly like he
had a lot of time left.

697
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:31,814
Well, we need
you out there, so...

698
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,868
you just... you
just got to forget it.

699
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,073
Everything okay in here?

700
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,260
Yeah.

701
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,416
You all right?

702
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,491
You know, Conrad
coming at me today,

703
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,044
and then laying
into Bobby Singer?

704
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:04,497
That's about you.

705
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,300
No, it is not about me.

706
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:08,529
It's just what Conrad does.

707
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,886
He'd do it for anyone here.

708
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:12,004
That's true.

709
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:15,341
I think he still loves you, Nic.

710
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,560
You need to decide if
you're still in love with him.

711
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,435
Drinks are on me.

712
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,787
That's what she said, right?

713
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,183
I think I paid
last time, didn't I?

714
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,890
I'm sorry to interrupt.

715
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,592
I am Dr. Okafor.

716
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:33,960
We know who you are, Mina.

717
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:36,613
I just wanted to
personally thank all of you

718
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:37,997
for my second chance.

719
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:40,866
- Second chance?
- The opportunity

720
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,047
to assist Dr. Bell in
the important surgery

721
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:45,638
of the top secret foreign VIP.

722
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:48,091
I am grateful for the confidence

723
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,642
the board is showing in me.

724
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:51,928
I have learned from my
mistakes, and I promise

725
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,213
to make Chastain proud.

726
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:57,350
I will never again remove
the wrong organ from a patient,

727
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,819
VIP or otherwise.

728
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,405
Thank you again.

729
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,642
Excuse me.

730
00:34:08,997 --> 00:34:11,097
Hey.

731
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,565
Finally.

732
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,529
- Where's Wilmot?
- You got to do this alone.

733
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,119
I'm off the case.

734
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,033
Dr. Smooth doesn't
want an intern telling him...

735
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,818
First of all, don't call him
Dr. Smooth to his face.

736
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:20,990
Second, Wilmot,

737
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,070
our dedicated attending...

738
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,343
He split for the weekend.

739
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,295
- It's Tuesday.
- Yeah.

740
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,444
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Uh, Dr. Massero.

741
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,179
<i>Hey, we're about to
make our approach.</i>

742
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:32,714
<i>I don't have a lot
of time. What's up?</i>

743
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,882
Okay, first, Bobby is
stable on blood thinners,

744
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,906
and his PE symptoms

745
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,624
are in control.

746
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:39,159
But, uh, the bigger concern

747
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:41,327
is that Bobby has May-Thurner.

748
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,391
<i>- Damn it.</i>
- Uh, we are suggesting an angioplasty

749
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,226
of the iliac vein
with stent placement.

750
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,210
<i>- Excuse me?</i>
- Followed by six months

751
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,702
of anticoagulation until
the stent incorporates.

752
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,220
<i>Where the hell's the attending?</i>

753
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:53,840
Yes.

754
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:57,376
Dr. Wilmot was pulled into a...

755
00:34:57,463 --> 00:34:58,829
emergency consult.

756
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:01,042
Would you like to wait,
or should I get Conrad?

757
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,082
<i>No. Uh, no, not him.</i>

758
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:04,968
If we start

759
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,798
the treatment plan now,
Bobby could be ready

760
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:07,999
to play by midseason next year.

761
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,056
<i>- Next season?</i>
- Yes.

762
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,536
<i>So you're telling me
Bobby's gonna miss</i>

763
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,421
<i>this postseason and
most of next season?</i>

764
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,755
- Yes.<i>
- This might have been his last shot</i>

765
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,899
<i>to play in the Series.</i>

766
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,964
<i>He's gonna be devastated.</i>

767
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,299
I'm sorry.

768
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,911
<i>I, uh... If only I could
tell him in person,</i>

769
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:23,214
<i>but I got Banksy waiting
in a Seattle hotel room</i>

770
00:35:23,238 --> 00:35:24,804
<i>with carpal tunnel.</i>

771
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,010
If you want, I could
tell the patient.

772
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,663
<i>Yeah? Oh, that'd be
great, and then I'll follow up.</i>

773
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,772
<i>Devon, next time
you're in New York,</i>

774
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,028
<i>you're sitting with
me at a Knicks game.</i>

775
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,412
Oh, great. I'm a big Knicks fan.

776
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,630
<i>You're not a Knicks fan?</i>

777
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:41,771
No, no. I said I<i> am</i>
a big Knicks fan.

778
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,401
<i>- That's too bad, 'cause they're courtside.</i>
- No, wait.

779
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:45,169
<i>Listen, they're telling
me I got to shut this down.</i>

780
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:47,727
- No, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

781
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:48,995
Massero.

782
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,748
Welcome to the club.

783
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,032
You just got Smoothed.

784
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,820
We have to tell Bobby
Singer that his season is over?

785
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,806
No. Not we. You.

786
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,094
Hey, Conrad.

787
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,762
Massero doesn't want a resident

788
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,899
telling Bobby the bad
news. He could go off on us.

789
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:11,529
Massero wouldn't
care if a candy striper

790
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:14,137
told Bobby the bad news,
as long as it wasn't Massero.

791
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:25,181
Hey.

792
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,517
I found four new
patients of Lane Hunter.

793
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:29,052
You're kidding. How?

794
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,237
Social media. I was
able to flag posts

795
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:32,705
from five new cancer patients

796
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,352
asking for prayers for
their upcoming treatments

797
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:36,075
at Lane's clinic.

798
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:38,144
- You're amazing.
- I kind of am.

799
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:39,841
I'll get contact
info on the patients

800
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,142
and call them saying I'm working

801
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,182
on the cluster story and ask

802
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:45,196
about their treatment
regimen with their oncologist.

803
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,254
Good, but keep this on the DL.

804
00:36:48,323 --> 00:36:50,200
We don't want to make
anyone suspicious.

805
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:52,458
Suspicious of Lane?

806
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:55,212
Should they be?

807
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,163
Devon, you know how much

808
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:58,397
I respect what you do

809
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,650
for a living.

810
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,346
But if there's a story
here, I'll chase it.

811
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,953
There's no turning back.

812
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:06,906
You understand?

813
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:12,846
Go for it.

814
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,542
You will eventually be
working there with me

815
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,326
- in surgery...
- Randolph.

816
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:18,351
Yeah? Excuse me for a second.

817
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,520
I've spoken with Massero.

818
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,216
According to the Chinese
government, no doctor

819
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,085
below an attending can
assist in the operation.

820
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:25,508
That means no residents.

821
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,210
Are you okay with that?

822
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:29,095
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

823
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,164
Good.

824
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,217
Excuse me.

825
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,920
Listen, we'll
pick this up later.

826
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:43,954
Bobby, you're not
gonna be able to play.

827
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:46,145
A contusion

828
00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:48,076
from a hard-hit ball while
you're on blood thinners

829
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,117
could cause internal
bleeding, and you could die.

830
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,086
So that's it, huh?

831
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:58,675
It all ends here.

832
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:01,061
No. No, not necessarily.

833
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,346
It is not unrealistic to think

834
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,249
that you could be back
midseason next year.

835
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,834
But...

836
00:38:07,903 --> 00:38:10,169
I'll be 38.

837
00:38:10,238 --> 00:38:13,139
This was supposed
to be my last season.

838
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:19,245
Didn't Massero tell you that?

839
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,932
No.

840
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,284
No, he didn't.

841
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:28,287
All right.

842
00:38:28,356 --> 00:38:30,222
Okay.

843
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:33,226
All right, so when can I
start having sex again?

844
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,879
Four to five weeks.

845
00:38:36,932 --> 00:38:40,016
Oh, and by the way,
somebody wants to see you.

846
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,374
Do you really think women
are turned on by stuff like this?

847
00:38:48,443 --> 00:38:49,987
I mean, come on,
you guys are the ones

848
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:51,572
who are fascinated
with body parts, not us.

849
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:55,181
But you know who does
get turned on by them?

850
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,649
Gossip Web sites.

851
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,562
So, if you send
one of these to me

852
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,848
or one of my colleagues
again, I will blast this picture out

853
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,817
with your name on
it to<i> Page Six, TMZ,</i>

854
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,341
<i>The New Yorker, Deadspin...</i>
you see where I'm going with this?

855
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,976
Yeah.

856
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:11,214
I'm sorry.

857
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,916
Good.

858
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,385
It's a start.

859
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,668
<i>Time for your radiation mapping,</i>

860
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,325
Mr. Phillips.

861
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,177
I'm ready, I guess.

862
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:28,297
Honey, relax.

863
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,799
I'll be fine.

864
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,334
What could go wrong?

865
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:44,831
Well, I guess if I get
more time with Mary,

866
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:47,150
- this will all be worth it.
- But will it?

867
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:51,237
Dr. Hunter says we can
increase his survival time 25%.

868
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,457
What does 25%
longer survival mean?

869
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:56,275
Months? Years?

870
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:58,911
It's an estimate based on
patients with similar cancers

871
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,447
using Dr. Hunter's protocol.

872
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:04,116
She's saying they lived
an additional five weeks.

873
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:05,429
Five weeks? Stop this thing.

874
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:09,188
Someone has to
talk to me straight.

875
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:11,057
You're elected.

876
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,525
Give me a sec, guys.

877
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,179
Dr. Hunter could be talking

878
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,059
about new radiation techniques
that I don't know about.

879
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:21,884
I'm an internist, but all
treatments and tests have risk.

880
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,886
Chemo and radiation are toxic.

881
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,349
They have to be,
to kill the cancer.

882
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:28,091
Just tell me if these treatments
will make me die sooner.

883
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,994
They will make you
feel sicker, nauseous,

884
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:33,757
and will weaken
your immune system

885
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:36,883
and that means you're more
in danger of getting infections.

886
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:41,153
And some of those
infections can kill you.

887
00:40:41,223 --> 00:40:42,699
Why didn't anybody
tell us this before?

888
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:46,459
No one wants to
take away hope, Mary.

889
00:40:48,563 --> 00:40:51,264
What would you
do if you were me?

890
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:56,069
I wouldn't want to
spend the time I have left

891
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,903
at Dr. Hunter's clinic.

892
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:00,270
I'd want to spend every
minute I have left with her.

893
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,079
Start the paperwork now.

894
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:09,348
Discharge me or I'll
walk out of here myself.

895
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,417
Honey, you can't do that.

896
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,469
Can he?

897
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,021
It's a hospital, not a prison.

898
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:16,451
We can't hold
him against his will.

899
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:19,909
It's called eloping,

900
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,179
when a patient slips away
without being discharged.

901
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,453
What about this,
uh, chest tube thing?

902
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:33,389
Well, we changed you
to a portable system

903
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,392
to make it easier for you
here. Mary knows how it works.

904
00:41:36,444 --> 00:41:39,478
It's easy and your
dressing is changed, so...

905
00:41:39,547 --> 00:41:40,730
you're good to go.

906
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,510
We're gonna have
Hospice check on you

907
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:43,900
when you're settled back home

908
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,552
if you choose to leave now.

909
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,489
Honey, what do you think?

910
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:53,376
That garage ain't
gonna clean itself.

911
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,395
It's been fun.

912
00:41:55,463 --> 00:41:57,024
Come on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

913
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:59,448
- Take that off.
- Help Mr. Phillips back to his room

914
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,718
- and take out his IV, please.
- Easy, easy, easy.

915
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,470
- You all right?
- Yeah.

916
00:42:11,146 --> 00:42:12,478
Thank you.

917
00:42:13,548 --> 00:42:15,648
Oh, uh, by the way,

918
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:17,416
you two make a very cute couple.

919
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:20,052
Hustle, Mary. In
case you missed it,

920
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:24,156
my end of the hourglass
is very low on sand.

921
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:26,185
Shut up or I'll
leave you right here.

922
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,020
I slept with Noni.

923
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:43,543
Well, I haven't slept with Jude.

924
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:45,762
Maybe I did it to get over you.

925
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,531
That kind of sucks for Noni.

926
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,566
No, she's fine
with it. Believe me.

927
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:53,319
So, how'd that work out for you?

928
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:57,189
What do you think?

929
00:43:06,868 --> 00:43:09,234
Dr. Lane Hunter.

930
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:12,571
What about her?

931
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,659
Tell me everything.

932
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
