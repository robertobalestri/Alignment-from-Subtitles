you need to admit him.

39
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,869
Why? Irving, why?

40
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:20,255
Because I'm Lennon
and you're not McCartney.

you got there, D-Bear?

Helping Irving with
a broken weenie.

50
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:38,502
Oh, heck yes. But
what about this, huh?

51
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,125
What about helping me out

52
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:41,126
with that double date
we were talking about?

53
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,544
Hmm? Pick a night.

54

I will. Sorry. I've
been slammed.

- Don't you burn me on this.

- The very same.

Now, tell Dr. Pravesh
what you told me.

feels like a hamstring,

71

72
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:20,799

This looks urgent.

- Yeah.

Oh!

75
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,131
- Did I pass out?
- Yep.

76
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,999

Bradley, I love you like the
little brother I always wanted,

100
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,826
but I can't right now.

101

Later, though.

102
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:24,372
You and me, we are
hanging and talking about,

103
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:26,447
you know...

104
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,067

105
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,036
Okay. Yes. I love stuff.

106
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,905
- Um, Mina...
- What he said.

107
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,118
Wait. Wait. Are you
saying that I'm the brother

108
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,741
that you always wanted, too?

109
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,093
Not that part.

110
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,832
It's, like, the main part.

111
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,150
This is the beginning
of a new era.

113

And, as your new
CEO, I'm grateful.

114
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:56,678
I'm humble. I'm eager
to work with each of you,

people in the OR.

119
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,821
It's Bell.

120

He'll make time.

121
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:09,485

128
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,091
Why?

129
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,178
Because his CEO
is also a surgeon.

130
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,148

hospital is a doctor...

147
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,830

apply pressure from within

control bleeding.

chest tube. We have time.

176
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,794
That metal could be
tamponading a major vessel.

177
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,412
- Could rupture at any moment.
- We need to figure out

178
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:33,963
what caused Bradley's fall
before we rush off to the OR.

179
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,397
Yeah, great, and
while we discuss that,

180
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,400
- he dies on this gurney.
- Or he dies under anesthesia

181
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,501
from a pre-existing
medical condition.

182
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,407
He took a header off the roof.

183
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,009
It's a suicide attempt.

184
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:42,138
You hear hoofbeats,
it's a horse, not a zebra.

185
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,028
Stop. I don't think he jumped.

186
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:45,563
What are<i> you</i> doing?

187
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,610
- The OR is ready for him.
- He's not ready for the OR.

188
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,000
He's a trauma patient.

189
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,202
Trauma attending
makes the call, Conrad.

190
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:53,354
Take him to the OR.
I'm gonna scrub in.

191
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:54,517
Let's go.

192
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,224
Wait. Look at his
hands and feet.

193
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,759
He's posturing.

194
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,233
Right pupil's blown.

195
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,419
Send him for a scan
of his brain and chest.

196
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,489
Quickly.

197
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,022
All right, let's go.

198
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,484
Is he even gonna fit
into the CT machine

199
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:13,708
with that thing in his chest?

200
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,898
Here you go.

201
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,446
Thanks.

202
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,603
It's on me.

203
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,939
Nic. What are you doing?

204
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,507
Don't you love this place?

205
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,487
Wouldn't it be ironic if
we suddenly discovered

206
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,393
we had something in common?

207
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:35,446
Especially today, of all days.

208
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,231
Okay, I'll play along.

209
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:38,645
See, I have a way
of never giving up

210
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,401
when I put my mind to something.

211
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,481
The good news is I
have no distractions,

212
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:44,283
so I get to focus
all of my attention

213
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:46,491
on one very important task.

214
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,410
You surprise me.

215
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:52,163
I didn't realize you had
so much fight in you.

216
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,416
Too bad it didn't show up till
the week<i> after</i> you got fired.

217
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,751
Tell me about Nashville.

218
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,753
This conversation's over.

219
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,384
I don't think so, Dr. Derzius.

220
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,458
Oh, sorry, that was
your married name.

221
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,522
It took you a minute to change
back to your maiden name

222
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,145
when you landed in
Atlanta to start over.

223
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,725
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

224
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,449
No, I'm good, thanks.

225
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:13,868
I'll find out what I need
to know on my own.

226
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,337
All of it.

227
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,977
Don't let it shift.

228
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,507
Did they teach you
this in medical school?

229
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:28,566
No. You teach yourself on
the red route in Kandahar

230
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,885
after an IED sends shrapnel

231
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:33,805
into a soldier's
head, neck and chest.

232
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:35,417
Did he survive?

233
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,758
No, he did not.

234
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,071
We're good. You're up.

235
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:54,543
How's he doing?

236
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,044
We're about to find out.

237
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,566
But why the hell did he jump?

238
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,569
He didn't. He fell.

239
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,538
We don't know what happened.

240
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,252
We do know he's a
surgeon, and surgeons cut.

241
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,853
But he's been
benched for six weeks.

242
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:14,245
I was benched for a day,
and<i> I</i> wanted to kill myself.

243
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,758
No. Even after he was benched,

244
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,876
he was asking everyone
else if they needed anything.

245
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,735
This guy is strong.
He's resilient.

246
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,037
He was planning a double
date with me and Priya.

247
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,417
Said Noni might even be the one.

248
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:26,374
She is not the one.

249
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,970
The point is, he was living

250
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,343
and planning his life.

251
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,746
This was not an
attempted suicide.

252
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:34,415
<i>Well, this was clearly
an attempted suicide.</i>

253
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:38,386
And it's not our fault
that the suicide rate

254
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,633
for male physicians is
nearly one and a half times

255
00:10:40,657 --> 00:10:42,585
higher than for the
general male population,

256
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:43,886
or that it's the
second-leading cause of death

257
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,359
for young doctors.

258
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:48,562
28% of residents
experience depression,

259
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:51,382
which, left untreated,
increases the likelihood

260
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:54,869
of this kind of... catastrophe.

261
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,622
Let's be honest, doctors
don't go to therapy.

262
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,758
Bradley sure didn't, not even
after falling asleep in the OR.

263
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,761
That's tragic, there's no doubt.

264
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,197
But...

265
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,133
this was a personal decision

266
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,170
made by a mentally
unstable resident.

267
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,642
Chastain will not
be held accountable.

268
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:23,247
Our insurance won't pay a dime.

269
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,216
And...?

270
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,734
And?

271
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,324
And...

272
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,459
I will make it publicly known

273
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,956
that we want to
be a leading voice

274
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,413
and a powerful influence

275
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:42,617
with an issue that plagues
hospitals nationwide.

276
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:45,487
You were born to be
a surgeon, Randolph,

277
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:48,572
but you're a damn good CEO.

278
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:51,837
- I gotta go.
- Mm-hmm.

279
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:53,478
I gotta go.

280
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,724
I gotta, I gotta go.

281
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,647
I gotta go.

282
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,661
Subarachnoid hemorrhage
with intraventricular extension

283
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,284
and hydrocephalus.

284
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,530
If we would have put
Bradley under anesthesia,

285
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,504
he would have
herniated and died.

286
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,201
His brain is bleeding, so if
you don't get the pressure

287
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,241
down immediately, he still will.

288
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,527
He needs an
extraventricular drain now.

289
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,596
Let's get him to Neuro.

Dr. Austin, I'm glad

294
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,683
I see you're late for
your own recruitment.

295
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:40,357
Forgive me, this is
a hell of a morning.

296
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,544
There are 3,200
types of bacteria

from 150 species

298

Let's spare ourselves
the risk of illness

299
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:52,720
until we've established
a mutual respect.

300
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:02,564
Dr. Bell, your
reputation precedes you.

301
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:05,499
That's a lie. I know
nothing about you.

302
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,668
Though I assume
you are a surgeon

303
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:10,688
whose passion for cutting
was snuffed out by his fondness

304
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,707
for the good old American green.

305
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:15,777
Well, in addition to my
expanded responsibilities,

306
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,979
I'll retain the title
of Chief of Surgery.

307
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,747
I still plan to cut.

308
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,732
Why bother?

309
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,919
Passion, love and discipline.

310
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:27,321
This is good. You
want some of my pie?

311
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,600
You won't shake my
hand, but you're willing

312
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,503
- to share your pie?
- Let me rephrase that.

313
00:13:30,527 --> 00:13:32,405
You can have the rest of
my pie, I'll order another one.

314
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:33,677
No, thank you.

315
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,763
I'm here to talk about Chastain,

316
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:39,483
and how much we
want you in our OR.

317
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,779
Let's just do this
as colleagues,

318
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:41,847
one great surgeon to another.

319
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,355
Yeah, Chastain is on my list.

320
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,756
Buried somewhere in the middle.

321
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,626
But I do like a good
underdog story.

322
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:53,297
<i>Seabiscuit.</i> You like that movie?

323
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,301

327
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,132
But I don't like smoke
anywhere near my ass.

328
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,900
Once the cerebrospinal
fluid's drained,

329
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,819
we've got to get
him to an OR stat.

330
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,643
Yep, that's the plan.

331
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,796
So...

332
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,767
Bell is claiming mental illness.

333
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,563
You need to tell me if
there's any truth to that.

334
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:32,853
I know Bradley was your friend,

335
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,472
- but...
- No.

336
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,590
He was at the end
of a 30-hour shift.

337
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,093
But a depressed doctor who
couldn't handle the pressure

338
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,681
and jumps off a building sounds
better than an overworked doctor

339
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:44,782
- who collapsed on Bell's watch.
- Okay.

340
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,267
Well, you know what's
great about being an internist?

341
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:48,820
We get to protect patients.

342
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,732
Which means we're
gonna get to the real reason

343
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,568
behind Bradley's fall, no
matter what story serves

344
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:53,608
our new CEO best.

345
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,146
<i>Who is it?</i>

346
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,666
Hi, uh, my name's Nic Nevin.

347
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,178
I'm here to speak
with Anthony Ewen.

348
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,180
Yeah, look, I don't
want any solar panels

349
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:23,771
or whatever you're selling.

350
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
And I'm an atheist.

351
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:26,554
You're a doctor.

352
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,442
No, not anymore.

353
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,590
And I'm not a nurse
practitioner anymore

354
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:33,947
because of Lane Hunter.

355
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:40,821
Lily Kendall. 26.

356
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,324
She was my patient.
She died recently.

357
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:46,594
Because of Lane.

358
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:50,714
Does Lane know you're here?

359
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,750
No one knows I'm here.

360
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:56,904
Come on.

361
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:09,851
Dr. Okafor.

362
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,719
Please, sit down.

363
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:14,305
I'm about to scrub in to
assist with a mass casualty.

364
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,074
I covered you with
another resident.

365
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,627
Which means
you're now available.

366
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:24,632
I would like your observations
on a recruiting matter.

367
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:26,166
I'd like you to give a guest

368
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,635
the grand tour of Chastain Park.

369
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:30,054
Do I look like a
welcoming committee?

370
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,609
You hear that?

371
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,897
That's the sound of
the keys to this castle

372
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,815
jingling in my pocket.

373
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,986
- Who is the guest?
- AJ Austin.

374
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:48,439
Top of his class, studied
minimally invasive surgery,

375
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,908
nominated top CT surgeon
by<i> US News & World Report</i>

376
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,760
six times... he won four.

377
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,991
- Fine, but why me?
- Talent recognizes talent,

378
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,464
and his attitude leaves
a lot to be desired.

379
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,653
Mina, uh...

380
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,623
don't forget to smile.

381
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,816
She was my mentor in Nashville.

382
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:18,669
When rumors started about
her overtreating patients,

383
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,838
I didn't believe it.

384
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,658
Then one of her patients
died of chemo OD.

385
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,845
What did the hospital do?

386
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,764
They let her resign in
exchange for silence.

387
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,767
So she came here
with a clean slate.

388
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:36,770
Then she offered me
a position at a clinic.

389
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,623
I was loyal.

390
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:41,876
But then the same thing
started happening again.

391
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:47,447
This time I asked questions.

392
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:50,818
Yeah, next thing I knew,
my shifts were reduced.

393
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:54,055
I was accused of
self-prescribing,

394
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:56,057
of patient negligence.

395
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,592
Did you ever report her
to the medical board?

396
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,875
Are you crazy?
Who is gonna believe

397
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:04,164
a disgraced doctor?

398
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,667
By then she was already
building a stellar reputation.

399
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:09,670
Was anyone at the
clinic on your side?

400
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:11,883
I mean, what about
Allie? She's a nurse there.

401
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,675
- I mean, if the three of us go together...
- Lady...

402
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:17,295
there is no "us."

403
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:21,949
The best advice I
can give you is run.

404
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,952
Run away from Lane Hunter.

405
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:38,199
- Dr. Austin.
- That is the rumor.

406
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:40,718
Dr. Bell pulled me
from a mass casualty

407
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,067
to give you the royal treatment.

408
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,921
Is that what this is?

409
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,124
I don't know what this is.

410
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:56,267
I like you already. You like me?

411
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,070
Early days, but probably not.

412
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,033
Well, I find your
honesty off-putting.

413
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,440
Most do.

414
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,074
Well, let's keep it going, then.

415
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,109
That guy. Go.

416
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,945
Bret Kilborn. Vascular
surgery attending.

417
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,976
- Fifth best at Chastain.
- Out of how many?

418
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,567
Five.

419
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:16,253
Redhead. Man hips. Go.

420
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,256
Joyce. Orthopedics.
Average at best.

421
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,074
Bitchy.

422
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,944
Why are we doing this?

423
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,439
Well, if I'm gonna
come to Chastain,

424
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,308
I need to know how many
clowns are in the circus.

425
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,598
I'm already accredited here.

426
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,768
- I'm sure you know.
- Are you going to come?

427
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,353
Not likely.

428
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,159
He... Hey. Where you going?

429
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:41,962
Pre-op on a patient
with a broken penis.

430
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:47,212
<i>Devon...</i>

431
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,502
what are you doing?

432
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:50,971
Same as you,
trying to figure out

433
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,973
Bradley's last moments.

434
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,141
What really happened.

435
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,943
What the hell was
he doing up here?

436
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,113
Our lounge sucks. Look around.

437
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:01,026
This is where a lot
of us interns hang out.

438
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,130
Particularly the ones
addicted to nicotine.

439
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:05,118
Wait, Bradley smoked?

440
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:06,431
Every doctor has
some sort of vice

441
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,141
to survive the
pressures, the hours.

442
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,059
This isn't gonna lead to some
weird admission from you, is it?

443
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,640
Look, all I'm saying is I'm
sure you've got a poison,

444
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:16,146
just like Bradley.

445
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,359
And that's probably
why he was up here.

446
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,966
Yeah, you're right, I do,

447
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,896
but I get my aggressions
out in my own way.

448
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,240
It doesn't end with me
crashing through the skylight.

449
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,070
Wasn't that Bradley's
drink of choice?

450
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:31,462
Yeah. Anything to stay awake.

451
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,242
Why would he care
about staying awake

452
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:36,166
if he was planning on
jumping to his own death?

453
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,185
He wouldn't.

454
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,877
Excuse me, ma'am.

455
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,186
I'm sorry, but your
appointment has been cancelled.

456
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:52,967
Uh, I've been waiting
for over half an hour,

457
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:54,296
and my appointment was
scheduled on Tuesday.

458
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,870
Denise is a former
colleague of mine.

459
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,300
- She would have
called in advance.
- Something came up.

460
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,673
So sorry she forgot to call.

461
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:01,053
The way that our
calendar system works,

462
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:03,143
- it's really hard...
- Denise.

463
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:04,212
Hey, Denise.

464
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:09,183
Ma'am? Ma'am!

465
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:11,163
Unfortunately, we
are booked for the day,

466
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,032
But if you'd like to make
another appointment,

467
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:14,688
you can call and reschedule.

468
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:16,518
You do realize I'm not
just here to hang out

469
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,303
and catch up with
old friends, right?

470
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,938
I'm actually here
at the medical board

471
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:22,813
to report someone who's
putting patients in danger.

472
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,225
You know, the patients? The
ones we're supposed to help?

473
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,418
Do you care at
all about anything?

474
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,298
You know, don't
answer that. I'll be back.

475
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,974
You suck.

476
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:38,061
Wow. Oh, this is my lucky day.

477
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,180
Wait, is, uh, is that
good news for me?

478
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:42,216
No. It's a penile fracture.

479
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:43,328
That baby's broken.

480
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:45,285
Ow!

481
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:47,232
But it-it doesn't
even have a bone.

482
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:50,157
It's a membrane called
the tunica albuguinea.

483
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,693
Look, Doc, this is my thingy
we're talking about here.

484
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:54,273
Oh, we're not talking
about it anymore.

485
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:55,095
I'm booking an OR.

486
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:56,964
Wait, surgery? Whoa.

487
00:21:57,032 --> 00:21:58,298
Look, it's a little crooked.

488
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,312
I can-I can live with that.

489
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:02,069
"A little."

490
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:04,254
Steve, tell me how you did this.

491
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,459
- I-I just... not...
- Use your words, Steve.

492
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,295
Well, I had to, uh...

493
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,747
I had a wild night
with a-with a lady.

494
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:15,516
I mean, uh... a girl.

495
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,379
- But she... It was a woman.
- Steve,

496
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,281
do you really want
to lie to the people

497
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,222
who are going to have sharp
knives next to your thingy?

498
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,169
I thought she was doing
the surgery. Who<i> is</i> this guy?

499
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:26,776
Hey! Are you gonna
help us help you or not?

500
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,328
I have a tee time.

501
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,064
Okay, that's a lie.

502
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,084
I have a date
with a single malt.

503
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:34,752
Now, Steve.

504
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,714
Are you going to tell
me what happened,

505
00:22:36,738 --> 00:22:39,073
so we can save the only partner

506
00:22:39,142 --> 00:22:40,536
who seems to want
to have sex with you?

507
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,159
It wasn't from coitus
with a human person.

508
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,279
I'll stay for this.

509
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:47,548
You did this
yourself, didn't you?

510
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,217
How?

511
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,269
An elliptical machine.

512
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:53,921
Uh, he asked how.

513
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:56,156
That is how.

514
00:22:56,242 --> 00:23:00,911
I was working out, and I
was watching pornography.

515
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,946
You did this in public?

516
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,032
No, it was at home.

517
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,968
I mean, I also own a-a
used Pilates reformer

518
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:09,303
and gravity boots.

519
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,288
Uh, gravity boots?

520
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,606
Yeah, those are new.

521
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:14,795
What do you have
to live for, Steve?

522
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,344
What makes you rise
and shine in the morning?

523
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,146
What fills your lungs with air?

524
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,631
My... my cats?

525
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,117
I have seven.

526
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:25,586
I like kitties.

527
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,154
I've always been a cat man.

528
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,357
Dogs like everybody.

529
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,059
But cats are more discerning.

530
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:33,327
Exactly.

531
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,630
I wanted to know
how you did this

532
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:38,282
so I could scare you

533
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,129
into never doing
something this stupid again,

534
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:41,501
because the next time,

535
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,171
you could snap your
neck and not your thingy.

536
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,373
And you will die.

537
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:48,658
And then, three days later,

538
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,695
guess who's gonna starve and
die right next to your corpse?

539
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,515
My kitties. They...

540
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,334
They're all I have.

541
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:58,714
That's right.

542
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:00,671
There's only the eight of you.

543
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,191
Now, we are going
to fix your thingy,

544
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:07,394
and then we're gonna find
you another, safer fetish.

545
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:09,229
Yeah.

546
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:11,297
- Thanks, Doc.
- Don't touch me.

547
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,757
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins?

548
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,036
Is he in pain?

549
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,226
Uh, he's deeply sedated.

550
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,389
He doesn't feel anything.

551
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:25,745
Uh, how did this even happen?

552
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:27,793
Our son would never
try to kill himself.

553
00:24:27,817 --> 00:24:29,399
I don't believe he did.

554
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,795
We're still working on
answering a lot of questions.

555
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:33,236
But Bradley was a deeply
dedicated member...

556
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,716
You don't need to sugarcoat it.

557
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,556
We know he was struggling.

558
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,436
Bradley was always one of
those kids who had to work

559
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,409
twice as hard as everyone else.

560
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,438
But he would never

561
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:43,308
- I mean...
- Don't take this the wrong way.

562
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:44,581
We love our son.

563
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,950
We wanted him to be happy,

564
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,297
but he put a lot of
pressure on himself.

565
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,253
Wanted to be
like his big sister.

566
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,789
She's at the Cleveland clinic.

567
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,423
A natural-born doctor.

568
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,359
Maybe if we told Bradley

569
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,162
how proud we are of
him, no matter what.

570
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,300
He's a good person.

571
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,936
He's got a good heart, you know?

572
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,723
Trust me, we all know that.

573
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:12,142
If Bradley ends up being okay,

574
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,510
what happens to him?

575
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,646
Is his career over?

576
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,299
I don't know.

577
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:21,385
Well, if it is,
he'll be just fine.

578
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,037
We'll... help him
get through it.

579
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,390
D-Dr. Okafor?

580
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:42,840
Promise us that
he's gonna be okay.

581
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,409
Surgeons don't make promises.

582
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,983
But I'll make an exception.

593
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,589
The impalement injured
the left pulmonary vein near

594
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,853
- the bronchus.
- Okay. Let's get him on cardiac bypass.

595
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:53,517
Whoa. Bypass?

596
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,530
I guess that's the way
a trauma surgeon thinks.

597
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,594
But, you know, you wouldn't
need a bypass if you knew

598
00:26:58,618 --> 00:27:00,367
how to do heart surgery like me.

599
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,569
What'd you just say to me?

600
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:04,766
- I said kill your resident.
- So you think it's better

601
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,435
to get in there, dig
around without being able

602
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,585
- to see what's going on?
- What do I know?

603
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:10,426
I'm only a
cardiothoracic surgeon.

604
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,107
Mina, do you have
an opinion on this?

605
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,442
Oh, whoa, whoa, you're asking

606
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,098
your resident for confirmation?

607
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,284
Dawg, you are the attending.

608
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:19,513
Theoretically, if you
move fast enough,

609
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,522
you don't need bypass.

610
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,784
Ah.

611
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,025
See? Princess Nokia gets it.

612
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:26,655
Let me show you.

613
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,444
Nurse, headlight.

614
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:31,181
I said I need a headlight.

615
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,083
I'm sorry,

616
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,630
is English not
your first language?

617
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,388
Or maybe I need to speak slowly.

618
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,616
- I said...
- This is my team.

619
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,025
You will not talk
to them like this.

620
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,079
Fine.

621
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,547
Give him his headlamp.

622
00:27:47,616 --> 00:27:50,401
My apologies to the group.

623
00:27:50,453 --> 00:27:53,654
I don't know what came over me.

624
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:57,791
No... I really, really shouldn't
have raised my voice.

625
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:00,527
Thank you.

626
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,296
But it's not like
this is a matter

627
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:06,316
of life and death!

628
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,352
After you, Doctor.

629
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:15,359
By all means.

630
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:19,596
This is only because
you're cardiothoracic.

631
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,315
Yeah, whatever you
have to tell yourself, pal.

632
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:25,569
Yo, why don't you load up a, uh,

633
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,605
5-0 Prolene on a BV-1 needle?

634
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:30,674
- Today, Dr. Okafor.
- Listen,

635
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,304
I've treated people
wounded in civil wars

636
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:33,660
and children dying of AIDS.

637
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:35,295
None of that scared me.

638
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:38,515
So you definitely
don't scare me.

639
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,667
Now, speak to me with respect,

640
00:28:40,735 --> 00:28:43,520
dawg.

641
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,825
Fine. Suture.

642
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,728
Now, do you think you
can yank the impalement out

643
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,780
so we can get to work?

644
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:58,438
He's hemorrhaging.

645
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:01,388
Retract medially. Suction.

646
00:29:02,358 --> 00:29:03,673
Come on, keep up.

647
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,387
- Keep up!
- He's losing blood.

648
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:06,771
Pressure's dropping.
Two units, wide open.

649
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:08,507
Another suture. Now.

650
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,396
Increase my suction.

651
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,701
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, keep up.

652
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,315
Will you look at that?

653
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:31,329
Bleeding's stopped.

654
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,797
- Vessel's repaired.
- Oh.

655
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:34,704
Piece of cake.

656
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,372
Wow.

657
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,723
That bleeding was
nothing but a distraction.

658
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:41,261
Now we can look
for other injuries.

659
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:46,366
Left ventricle
severely thickened.

660
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,062
He has heart disease.

661
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,536
In his 30s?

662
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:53,690
Not that we knew of.

663
00:29:53,742 --> 00:29:55,152
The medical board doesn't
make scheduling errors.

664
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:57,310
And Denise just blew me off.

665
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,746
It was weird. And I think
someone's following me.

666
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:01,259
- Wait, what?
- There was this car

667
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,733
waiting for me outside
the board, to box me in.

668
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,947
- It freaked me out.
- Okay, I'm done with this whole

669
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,383
"I'll handle Chastain, you
handle the investigation" thing.

670
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,618
Please, don't do anything
else until my shift ends,

671
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,592
and we'll come up
with a game plan.

672
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,088
Rumors travel fast around here.

673
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,778
Nic Nevin?

674
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,347
On the grounds of Chastain.

675
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,614
Ballsy.

676
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,478
She heard about Bradley
and wanted to visit him.

677
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:21,946
No need to explain to me.

678
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,732
It's not like I'm
gonna call security.

679
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:25,372
Someone else might, but not me.

680
00:30:25,441 --> 00:30:27,641
So let them.

681
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,613
Have a nice day.

682
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:38,663
Ventricular hypertrophy?

683
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:39,936
From what?

684
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,604
Don't know yet.

685
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,652
Combination of cigarettes
and obesity, mixed with

686
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:46,076
a heavy dose of stress,
would be my educated guess.

687
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,610
Obesity?

688
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,613
I noticed stretch marks
around his gut during surgery.

689
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,883
Telltale signs of a man
who's had gastric bypass.

690
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:55,284
Um, I'm sorry, I don't
believe we've met.

691
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,453
- Mina, is this...?
- Dr. Austin.

692
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,839
And he is?

693
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:01,174
Dr. Devon Pravesh.

694
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:05,178
Top intern at Chastain,
and it's not even close.

695
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,814
Stop smiling.

696
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,183
And don't wink.

697
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,637
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

698
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,772
I've heard some things.

699
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:17,824
But it's cool.

700
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,627
I'm sure you've heard
some things about me, too.

701
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,346
I'm Dr. AJ Austin in the flesh.

702
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:25,866
I assisted in Bradley's surgery.

703
00:31:25,934 --> 00:31:27,167
The plan was to observe,

704
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:28,913
but I ended up
working with Dr. Okafor,

705
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:31,104
because the cretin masquerading

706
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:33,773
as a trauma surgeon really
ought to bury his scalpel,

707
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:37,727
along with his career,
in an unmarked grave.

708
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:47,420
Can I borrow you
two for a second?

709
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,704
<i>Toxicology on Bradley's back.</i>

710
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:54,694
Amphetamines in his system.

711
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:57,497
And security found
methylphenidate in his locker.

712
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,316
- Uppers.
- Stimulants were his crutch to work in overdrive.

713
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,425
- And it's what damaged his heart.
- Yeah,

714
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:04,516
but there's no proof that
his heart caused the fall.

715
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,780
Which means Bell will
still sell this as a suicide.

716
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:10,777
Unless a little controlled
chaos helps us figure out

717
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,730
what actually happened
to Bradley on that roof.

718
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,131
Mm. You're smiling?

719
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,167
Keep me out of it.

720
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,819
You in?

721
00:32:19,888 --> 00:32:21,488
Do I have a choice?

722
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:22,889
No.

723
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,264
Wait, his rhythm is normal.

724
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,833
Why am I getting
ready to cardiovert him?

725
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:35,284
I'm pushing isoproterenol

726
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,215
to mimic the cardiac
effects of caffeine.

727
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:39,873
Wait a second, are you trying
to induce an abnormal rhythm?

728
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:41,519
- Because that would be...
- Yes.

729
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,543
I am.

730
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,762
I think that energy
drink in Bradley's system

731
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,809
triggered something in
his already damaged heart

732
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,111
and caused him to faint and
crash through that skylight.

733
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,934
And this little experiment

734
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,371
is gonna prove
if I'm right or not.

735
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,893
He's in V tach.
He's gonna crash.

736
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:01,961
- I'm paging Code Blue.
- Relax.

737
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,864
There's our answer.
Okay? Paddles.

738
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,984
Yeah.

739
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,724
Charge. Clear.

740
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:20,564
Back in sinus. See?

741
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:22,782
Controlled chaos
to test our theory.

742
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:24,901
Exciting, right? Everybody wins.

743
00:33:24,953 --> 00:33:26,993
Except Bell. Proves
that he didn't jump.

744
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:29,284
Wean him off the vent and
page me when he's awake.

745
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:33,154
The guy is a gross liability.

746
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,544
He does not belong at Chastain.

747
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:35,824
Dr. Nolan is just filling me in

748
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:38,008
- on what happened in the OR.
- You were there.

749
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,400
You saw the way that that
animal treated everybody.

750
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:42,669
Mostly you, but yes.

751
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:45,238
Dr. Okafor, you spent the
whole shift with Dr. Austin.

752
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:46,890
What are your observations?

753
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,326
His bedside
manner is a disaster.

754
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,395
Think about who's saying that.

755
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,113
Sorry.

756
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:57,434
But in the OR, his
hands, his instincts...

757
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:59,383
Unlike anything
I've seen before.

758
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:03,140
And, ultimately, he
saved Bradley's life

759
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,008
without even having to expose
him to the risks of bypass.

760
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,910
He's cardiothoracic, all right?

761
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,874
I put my ego aside
for the patient.

762
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:12,143
Other surgeons might not
be able to handle Dr. Austin

763
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,310
with that type of modesty.

764
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:15,014
- Am I done here?
- No.

765
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,286
In your opinion,

766
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:18,688
would Dr. Austin be
a valuable addition

767
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,017
- to Chastain's surgical staff?
- Absolutely not.

768
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,391
Albert.

769
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,143
Mina.

770
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:27,864
Even a raptor serves a purpose,

771
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,853
as long as you
know it's a raptor.

772
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,686
Keep Austin away
from conscious patients.

773
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,723
Unconscious ones will love
him because he'll save their lives.

774
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:40,993
- Raptor.
- We're done.

775
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,886
Hey. Dr. Austin.

776
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:55,058
- So, how's my, uh...
- Your penis is as good as new.

777
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,194
Oh, thank God.

778
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,531
That's amazing.

779
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,299
Give me your password.

780
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:04,968
What?

781
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,770
Hey, how'd you get my ph... Why?

782
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:15,044
6-9-6-9.

783
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,987
There's my kitties.

784
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:27,007
Take care of your babies, okay?

785
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:30,543
And I want you
to see this face...

786
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:33,079
This face right here...

787
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:35,465
Before you think about
doing something stupid

788
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:38,051
on a treadmill again.

789
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:41,421
Do you hear me, Steve?

790
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,056
Yes, sir.

791
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,495
Good.

792
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,957
Can I help you?

793
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,927
Oh. Howdy there.

794
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,306
Um, sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

795
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,975
I'm just delivering
your groceries.

796
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,109
Uh, well, I didn't
order any groceries.

797
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,732
You must have the wrong house.

798
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,467
Oh, golly. Really? I'm sorry.

799
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,253
I... No, it...

800
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:17,040
No, it says this exact
address right here.

801
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,976
Don't want to go wasting
free groceries, now, do we?

802
00:36:26,668 --> 00:36:28,134
Well, now, say thank you.

803
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,470
Excuse me?

804
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:32,566
Oh, this is the part
where one nice person

805
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,173
says to another nice person,

806
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:36,326
"Hey, thanks for
the free groceries."

807
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:37,989
If you don't get off my property
I'm gonna call the police.

808
00:36:38,013 --> 00:36:39,512
Hey, hey, now.

809
00:36:39,581 --> 00:36:41,191
Ain't no need to go turning
something perfectly pleasant

810
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:42,498
into something else.

811
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,545
How about we just
move on with our lives

812
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,013
and stop looking
to cause trouble?

813
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,637
That way we can both sleep tight

814
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,691
and nobody gets hurt.

815
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,914
You have a good
night, Nicolette Nevin.

816
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,004
I am so sorry, you guys.

817
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:23,172
I was just trying
to push through.

818
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,086
You know? Just act
like everything was okay.

819
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,287
That's kind of
what we do, right?

820
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:30,213
We don't put patients in danger.

821
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,632
Or doctors.

822
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:35,134
Or ourselves.

823
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:36,986
Okay.

824
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:42,224
So, is that it then?

825
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,109
Am I done?

826
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,895
Bradley, what do you want?

827
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,646
Everyone in this room
would answer that question

828
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,631
in a split second and
say, "I want to be a doctor."

829
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:55,033
- But why didn't you?
- No, I do.

830
00:37:55,057 --> 00:37:57,023
I-I do want to be a doctor.

831
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:58,286
Don't tell me what you
think the right answer is.

832
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,276
Tell me what you want.

833
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:03,730
I don't know, man.

834
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:13,206
Look, I...

835
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:21,214
I never thought that I
would admit this to anyone.

836
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:26,953
But I thought
about it all the time.

837
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:29,255
Not falling through the skylight

838
00:38:29,323 --> 00:38:32,107
on Bell's conference
table, per se,

839
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,743
but...

840
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,981
I thought about
stepping off that rooftop.

841
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,221
I just...

842
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,308
wanted to escape the pressure...

843
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:52,278
anxiety...

844
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:55,281
the exhaustion...

845
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,750
the fear of...

846
00:38:57,819 --> 00:39:01,321
fear of failing again...

847
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:05,157
of being a failure.

848
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,231
Even just the thought...

849
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,601
of walking away from medicine...

850
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,074
brings this overwhelming
sense of relief.

851
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:26,613
It's like a weight
lifted off my shoulders.

852
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,385
Is that weird or what?

853
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:37,423
- To me it is.
- Incomprehensible.

854
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:38,970
But for you, it's
not weird at all,

855
00:39:38,994 --> 00:39:40,304
because you don't
love being a doctor,

856
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:42,661
so go.

857
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,314
Get out of this place

858
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,983
and find what you do love.

859
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,307
Yeah, and...

860
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,277
Well...

861
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:01,681
I am not going
to miss this place.

862
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,686
But I am definitely...

863
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:09,923
definitely...

864
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,558
gonna miss you guys.

865
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:17,363
We're gonna miss you, too, man.

866
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:19,415
You know where to find us.

867
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:22,368
Yeah, you guys seriously
never leave this place.

868
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,821
Hey, thumbs up, man.

869
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,333
- Dude, yeah.
- Good, good.

870
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,190
I think this is...

871
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,812
Not one for good-byes?

872
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,014
Love them, actually.

873
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,016
Good-bye.

874
00:40:37,085 --> 00:40:38,462
I'm willing to offer
you a full-time position.

875
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:40,319
Yeah, what's the number?

876
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:43,222
Well, more than anyone else
will pay, less than you'll demand.

877
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:45,541
I'll pass.

878
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:47,643
Dr. Austin, I know
a great surgeon

879
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:51,231
when I see one, but...

880
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,249
I also know a desperate man.

881
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:56,319
You've been a locum
tenens for the last 36 months,

882
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,420
hopping from
hospital to hospital,

883
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,656
searching for something,

884
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,407
maybe running from something.

885
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:03,242
I only run when being chased.

886
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:06,795
Okay.

887
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:11,367
Well, your reputation
outside the OR is catching up.

888
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:16,239
You know, great hospitals
have a profound aversion to risk,

889
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,857
but I'm willing
to bet two things:

890
00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:21,277
one, on you,

891
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:24,413
and two, that
your list of suitors

892
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,449
is neither long nor impressive.

893
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:30,269
You'll have an offer
from me in the morning.

894
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,222
It's a best and final.

895
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,779
Dr. Okafor frightens me

896
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:43,933
in wonderful ways.

897
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,303
I want her to be my right hand.

898
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:50,873
My thoughts exactly.

899
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,068
- Hey.
- Did he come back again?

900
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,136
No. Not yet.

901
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,122
How about his license plate?

902
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:24,468
It was dark. I couldn't see it.

903
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:25,986
I just ran in the house
and locked the door.

904
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,527
Did you call the police?

905
00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:29,823
And say what? That some
creepy guy gave me groceries?

906
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,180
No, no, no, no, that's okay.

907
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,560
I just, I know what
you're gonna say,

908
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:33,777
that you're fine and
you don't need my help.

909
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,302
No, I am not fine and
I do need your help.

910
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,671
I'm just starting to realize

911
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:41,173
how far Lane's willing to go.

912
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,626
Grab your things. You're
staying at my place.

913
00:42:43,678 --> 00:42:46,612
- Just until we figure this out.
- Yeah.

914
00:42:50,018 --> 00:42:51,595
I mean, she
already got me fired.

915
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:53,870
I thought she was
just trying to ruin<i> me.</i>

916
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,639
But it's not that simple.
Think about it, Conrad.

917
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:59,709
This isn't just
about Lily or me.

918
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:01,760
It's bigger than that.

919
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,789
Lane has got
something else to hide.

920
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:06,232
And we're gonna find
out what it is together.
