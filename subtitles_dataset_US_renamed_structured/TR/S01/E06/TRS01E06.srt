I'm a ballet dancer...
I'm used to intense pain.

177
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:56,101
- That's no way to live, man.
- I've made my peace.

178
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:58,436
Only thing that matters
now is my career.

179
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,771
So can I just get some
steroids for my ankle,

180
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,957
- so I can get back to my show?
- Look...

181
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,342
I get it.

182
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,478
I get how important your
career is to you, okay?

183
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,764
If you leave, you'll be right
back with another injury.

184
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,334
Maybe a day, a
week, or even a month,

185
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:15,303
but it will happen.

186
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,799
Your twisted ankle's
just the beginning.

187
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,784
You're malnourished,
and your body can't handle

188
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,786
the stress of being a
professional dancer anymore.

189
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,310
- So I should just give up?
- Give me 24 hours, and let me

190
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:25,357
see if I can figure out
what's wrong with you.

191
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,465
It's worth it if I can
save your career.

192
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,267
Right?

193
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,295
You found me.

194
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:41,841
- Wasn't lookin' for you.
- Ouch.

195
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:43,743
Didn't you get the
cheese and grits?

196
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:46,167
They say the way to a woman's
heart is through her stomach.

197
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:48,397
Actually, I think that's the way
to a man's heart, but thanks,

198
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,539
- Irving loved them.
- You gave away my gift?

199
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,268
Mm, "gift" is a strong
word. This is more like

200
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,605
you passed a bush, saw a flower
sticking out, plucked it for me,

201
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,390
and then said, "Hey,
look... I bought you flowers."

202
00:09:57,414 --> 00:10:01,215
- Wow. Tough crowd. Okay.
- Have you seen Mina?

203
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:03,496
I heard she took on a
gang of muggers last night.

204
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,248
It's all anyone's
talking about upstairs.

205
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,406
- I - need some
help in here! Now!

206
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:12,193
- Damn it, Atiba, calm down!
- Easy, buddy, easy!

207
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,456
He's going through withdrawal.

208
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,395
He tried to take
a chunk out of me!

209
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:15,584
Give me two of lorazepam.

210
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:17,599
Code Gray! Bed three!

211
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,547
Okay.

212
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,571
Okay.

213
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:33,064
How's Atiba?

214
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,632
Calmer. Drowsy. Restrained.

215
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,485
- You need to call his parents.
- Me? Why me?

216
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,422
Because someone needs to tell
them to come pick up their son.

217
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,507
I don't do people.

218
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,277
I thought you were
still on vacation.

219
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,213
My sister-in-law's in town.

220
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,882
Not a fan?

221
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,984
- Want to grab a coffee?
- Sure.

222
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,953
- Be happy you don't have in-laws anymore.
- Oh, I am.

223
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,422
By the way, that
golf buddy of mine,

224
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,126
- the one with the tremor...
- Right. How's he doing?

225
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,939
Well, he's had to
lay off the benzos.

226
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,691
The side effects were
too aggressive for him.

227
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:08,616
And now he's all wound up
about the tremor returning, and...

228
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:11,635
Well, he's right
to be concerned.

229
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,149
If the tremor is
really interfering

230
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,389
with his quality of life,

231
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,468
your friend may ultimately

232
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:16,424
have to consider brain surgery.

233
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:17,759
And we both know

234
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:18,837
when the air hits your brain...

235
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:20,495
You're never the same.

236
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,433
<i>No, this is...</i>

237
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,468
this is a hospital, Mr. Jackson,

238
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,554
not a hotel. No.

239
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,672
No, we don't have
courtesy shuttles.

240
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:35,076
Well, you'll just have
to come get Atiba.

241
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,627
Hello?

242
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,630
Hello?

243
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,915
Are you kidding me?

244
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,366
You okay?

245
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,315
Nothing a little caffeine

246
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,503
- can't fix.
- Oh.

247
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,941
Mmm. It's been a long shift

248
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,925
that is thankfully almost over.

249
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:53,127
Well, maybe this

250
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,712
will help your mood, too.

251
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,275
Oh, my God. I
didn't even realize

252
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,311
- it had fallen off.
- Lara found it on the floor

253
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,500
of the nurses' lounge.

254
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,303
I'm simply doing the
honor of returning it.

255
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,590
There you go.

256
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,157
I see you wear it all the time.

257
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,687
Figured it's one
of your favorites.

258
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,694
Well, thank you. I owe you one.

259
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,112
Really?

260
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:13,182
Get over yourself.

261
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,617
I'll see you later.

262
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:16,967
Hey, Conrad!

263
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,153
Whatever it is, figure it out.

264
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,071
No can do.

265
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,639
I need reinforcements.

266
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,511
The priority is to get to
the source of your pain,

267
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:33,429
be it psychological,
neurological...

268
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,736
- This is not in my head.
- This is a GI problem.

269
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,216
We'll need to do
a battery of tests,

270
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,218
starting with a colonoscopy
and upper endoscopy...

271
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:41,387
That's fine, but after I get
nerve condition studies.

272
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:43,744
- This is neuropathic.
- Has anyone ruled out<i> H. pylori?</i>

273
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:45,775
- This is a GI problem.
- This is neuropathic.

274
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,410
- It's psychological.
- Nerve conditions.

275
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,434
- Battery of tests.
- After I get nerve conditions.

276
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,537
What's going on? I didn't ask

277
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,816
for any consults
on this patient.

278
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,623
Our attending did.

279
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,436
We can't rule out
biliary dyskinesia, either,

280
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,627
until we do a CCK-HIDA scan.

281
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,774
- Gen surg isn't even here.
- Look who finally showed up.

282
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:03,459
Nigel, I'm sorry.
Give me one second.

283
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,816
Can I talk to you, Dr. Wilmot?

284
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,641
You're not usually on
the floor post rounds.

285
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,221
I don't have to account
for my whereabouts.

286
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:16,755
I'm your attending.
You report to me,

287
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,379
not the other way around.

288
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,443
- You requested consults on my patient.
- Yeah.

289
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,901
- Why?
- Yeah, I think the question is why didn't you?

290
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,020
He's already had every test
you're coming up with in there.

291
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:28,656
Not at Chastain.
We run our own tests.

292
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,558
Nigel is sick of doctors.

293
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:32,622
He's been poked
and prodded for years.

294
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:33,911
I'm just giving him a breather

295
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,725
while all his medical records
are sent from New York.

296
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,827
And meanwhile, he sits
around in constant pain?

297
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,918
Pain that can be exacerbated
by unnecessary procedures.

298
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,620
Oh, see, this has always
been your problem, Hawkins.

299
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,618
You think your
way is the only way.

300
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:48,376
Look, I... I just want to go
over his previous test results

301
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:50,306
before subjecting
him to new ones.

302
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,740
Yeah, well, look, it's
not your call anymore

303
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:52,596
because he's no
longer your patient.

304
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,764
He's mine now.

305
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,649
Thank you.

306
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,576
How you feeling?

307
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:07,812
I'm just gonna check
your pupils, okay?

308
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,798
Doc, are these
restraints necessary?

309
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,649
I'm cool now. For real.

310
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,830
I'm actually a nurse
practitioner, not a doctor.

311
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,421
And yes, they are. They're
for your own protection.

312
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:20,140
So, I guess the cops
are coming, huh?

313
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,987
Well, looks like
it's your lucky day.

314
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:24,712
Dr. Okafor decided
not to press charges.

315
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,865
I haven't exactly had

316
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,835
a lot of lucky days lately.

317
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,753
I called your parents.

318
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:33,987
Why?

319
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:35,668
They don't want
nothing to do with me.

320
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,036
Because someone has
to come and get you.

321
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,554
If y'all for real not
calling the cops,

322
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,888
- then just release me.
- On your own?

323
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,490
So you can go back
out onto the street

324
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,675
and score again?
I don't think so.

325
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:44,009
Plus, you have
lorazepam in your system.

326
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,217
- You could OD.
- No. Seriously...

327
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,786
after everything
that happened today,

328
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:49,770
I'm done with that mess.

329
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,555
I'm-a get clean.

330
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,657
I've heard that before.

331
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,076
Why you care so much
about me anyway?

332
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,647
Is there anyone else who
can come pick you up?

333
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:00,982
Nah.

334
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,850
I got no one.

335
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,739
So what happens to me now?

336
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,219
What are you doing?

337
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:23,888
Taking Atiba home.

338
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,306
I asked you to call his parents,

339
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,874
not turn into his personal taxi.

340
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:28,387
Well, his parents
aren't coming to get him,

341
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:29,972
so I'm going to
take him to them.

342
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,646
Have you lost your mind?

343
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:33,959
Y'all know I'm standing
right here, right?

344
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:35,682
Be quiet. You tried to mug me.

345
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,896
You don't get to say anything.

346
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,735
I'm sorry. This-this morning

347
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:39,865
I wasn't thinking st...

348
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:41,355
I'm-a stop talking now.

349
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,618
- Mm-hmm.
- Look, my shift is over.

350
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,508
I'm giving him a ride.

351
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,616
It's not a big deal.

352
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,545
Damn<i> oyibo</i> savior complex.

353
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:52,166
Someone has to protect
you from yourself...

354
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:53,467
and him.

355
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,902
Plus, he's my patient.

356
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,933
So, you're stuck
with both of us now.

357
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,923
That's fine by me.

358
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,841
Get your ass

359
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,926
in the back seat.

360
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,073
It's quite a view, isn't it?

361
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,943
Never fails to
impress. You rang?

362
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,913
Yeah, about an hour ago.

363
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,514
I was in surgery.

364
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,700
Ah, Mr. Levine's
parathyroidectomy. How was that?

365
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,447
A success. I
think you'll find him

366
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:30,071
very indebted to Chastain.

367
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,723
I had the scheduling
nurse clear your afternoon.

368
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,093
I ran into Dr. Edmund
Carver from St. Grace

369
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,178
last night at the opera.

370
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,714
He's in town briefly,

371
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:41,326
and I invited him
here for coffee today.

372
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,786
And you'd like me
to attend that coffee.

373
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,331
Every reputable
hospital in the country

374
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:47,955
is trying to recruit Carver

375
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:50,290
after his surgery on the
former attorney general.

376
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,960
I want Carver at Chastain.

377
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,795
I hear he's overrated.

378
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:56,014
Maybe.

379
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,932
But with your guidance,

380
00:16:58,001 --> 00:17:01,735
he would be an incredible
asset to your team.

381
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:03,104
You just talk to him.

382
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:05,939
Show him around,
give him the full Bell.

383
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:07,891
Close that deal for me.

384
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,595
Consider it closed.

385
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:13,864
Thank you.

386
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:24,553
So, who are we mad at today?

387
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:25,617
Other than that pen.

388
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,977
How much time do you have?

389
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,580
Anything I can help with?

390
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,965
I convinced a patient
with unknown chronic pain

391
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,012
to stay and let me try
and help him, but then...

392
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:35,865
Word gets out, and
the vultures descend.

393
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,200
Yep. I'll give you two guesses.
Who was the leader of the pack?

394
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,958
Sampson in Neuro. He
can never resist a call

395
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,611
for a mystery diagnosis.
Allows him to bill

396
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,780
- a ton for testing.
- Oh, he was there.

397
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:47,492
But today's prize
goes to Wilmot.

398
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:48,949
Took over the case.

399
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,963
Wants to ensure if we
figure out the diagnosis,

400
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,987
he gets the win.

401
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:55,723
You sure it's just Wilmot
that's bothering you?

402
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,875
Hey. You're a hard man to find.

403
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,828
- Well, you found me.
- Wilmot asked me to consult

404
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:03,314
on a possible lap
chole for Nigel Meahan.

405
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,000
You and Wilmot want
to unnecessarily remove

406
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:07,746
a man's gallbladder
without even knowing

407
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,014
if that's the
source of his pain?

408
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:10,888
Well, for the record,

409
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,457
I told him it was premature
to consider surgery.

410
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,898
So, has he been biting
everyone's head off today,

411
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,316
- or just mine?
- Depends.

412
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:25,653
What'd you do?

413
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:28,021
<i>You know, you really didn't</i>

414
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,152
have to escort me to my
conditioning personally.

415
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,060
Well, don't tell me
you're sick of me already.

416
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,763
You know, once my
immune system is stripped,

417
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:39,717
just how isolated am
I gonna have to be?

418
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,319
Are we talking no contact? Or...

419
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,955
- It's for your safety, Lily.
- No, I know.

420
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:48,509
That's stupid, right?

421
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:51,512
You'd think I'd be used
to being alone by now.

422
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,754
I thought we were
headed to conditioning.

423
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:01,822
We have time.

424
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:06,110
Talk to me, Lily.

425
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,962
What's really going on?

426
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,584
Well, this is the right
thing for me, right?

427
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,970
The bone marrow transplant?

428
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,873
I've been doing some reading,

429
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:20,892
and once we start,

430
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:23,210
there's no turning back.

431
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:28,082
You're scared. I get it.

432
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:30,251
But that's-that's
totally normal.

433
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,102
I know.

434
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:35,839
I have a 62% survival
rate in my first year.

435
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,411
That's a 38% chance of dying.

436
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,396
But no doctor has ever
just come out and said that.

437
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,265
Besides, there's...

438
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:47,374
there's other
complications. I mean...

439
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,937
it could damage
my organs. Infertility.

440
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:53,140
I want to have
kids one day, and...

441
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,526
God.

442
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,795
Listen to me.

443
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,681
Self-pity is so attractive.

444
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,302
You know what? Ignore me.

445
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,921
Bone marrow
transplants save lives.

446
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:10,324
I need a transplant, so
I'm going to get a transplant.

447
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:12,827
End of story.

448
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,735
I understand, but...

449
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,355
I don't care what my
husband told y'all on the phone.

450
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,807
Atiba is not welcome
back in our lives.

451
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,904
It's not safe for him to
be out on the streets.

452
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,127
He could OD at any time.

453
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,074
Monique, if he's
trying to get clean...

454
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:32,980
Do I look like a fool?

455
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:35,466
I'm done helping him.

456
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:36,984
That is not the boy I raised.

457
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,987
I know how difficult it is

458
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,283
to watch someone you
love suffer through a disease

459
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,835
- like this...
- Really, missy?

460
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:44,791
Do you have kids?

461
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:46,922
Do you know what
it's like to come to work

462
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,979
and find your store robbed

463
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:50,809
and then realize
that your boy did it

464
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,015
for drug money?

465
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,184
Or to come home and find

466
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,098
your baby alone
in a soiled diaper,

467
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,821
crying for hours

468
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,935
because his brother's
passed out in the bathroom?

469
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,937
You're trying to protect
what's left of your family.

470
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,594
I do understand that.

471
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,524
But I also know you
still love your son.

472
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:07,681
What if he really is

473
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,783
willing to get help?

474
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,018
He can beat this.

475
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:14,838
Monique.

476
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:16,390
Come on. Just hear him out.

477
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,225
Come on.

478
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:22,012
I'm for real this time, Mom.

479
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,116
Please.

480
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,037
I'll go in a program.

481
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,172
I swear.

482
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:35,091
I'll do whatever you say.

483
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:41,165
Ma!

484
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,939
That boy won't be
able to stay clean.

485
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,390
He hasn't hit rock bottom yet.

486
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,154
Yeah, well, you
can't give up hope,

487
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,655
'cause while you're
waiting for rock bottom,

488
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,279
you could end up dead.

489
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,913
So, who is it?

490
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,883
The way you're talking
only comes from experience.

491
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,552
So who is it?

492
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,687
My sister.

493
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,045
Hey. I need a full
panel on Lily Kendall.

494
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:14,064
Her most recent
labs are in her file.

495
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:17,451
Thank you, but I'd still like
to have a full panel done.

496
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,281
You've worked here long
enough that I shouldn't have

497
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,571
to explain this to you.

498
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:22,923
Dr. Hunter handles all
of her patient labs through

499
00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:25,136
her clinic, and they've
already done a full panel on Lily.

500
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,328
Isabel,<i> you've</i> worked
here long enough to know

501
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:28,963
that I am the doctor,

502
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,764
you are the nurse.

503
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,083
So you can run a
new damn panel on Lily

504
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,302
or I can take it up
with your supervisor.

505
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:37,788
Green and purple
top coming up...

506
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,339
Doctor.

507
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,164
He's seizing.

508
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,211
What's the first thing
you do, Pravesh?

509
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:51,101
Let's get some access.

510
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:52,453
All right. Lorazepam.

511
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:55,088
Four milligrams.
Go. Soon as possible,

512
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:57,218
- get him on the monitor.
- What happened here? -Last I saw him,

513
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,370
he was drinking his
colonoscopy prep solution.

514
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:01,261
Where's Dr. Wilmot?

515
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,410
Let me guess, you
paged him... No response.

516
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,928
Dr. Carver.

517
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Dr. Bell.

518
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:21,281
It is an honor.

519
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,684
Randy, please. The
pleasure's all mine.

520
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:25,335
Welcome to my hospital.

521
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,548
This is one hell of a hospital.

522
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,167
Well, you haven't
seen anything yet.

523
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:29,918
How 'bout a personal
tour before coffee?

524
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,536
Does that tour include a
sneak peak at the Titian?

525
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,671
'Cause I am dying to get
my hands on one of them.

526
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:36,175
Well, as long as you promise
to share how you were able to do

527
00:23:36,232 --> 00:23:38,849
a Kasai procedure
in under four hours.

528
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,951
Dr. Carver. Wow, such an honor.

529
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,065
- If I may, one question...
- Now-now is not the time.

530
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,699
No, no. It's okay. What's
your question, son?

531
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,684
Uh, your retrospective
study on risk factors for...

532
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,059
How do you keep your
retransplantation rate

533
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,762
- under 20%? -It's actually been 22%...
- This is not the time

534
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,609
or place for any
kind of confrontation.

535
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,410
I need to talk to
Dr. Wilmot. Whether or not

536
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,378
there's a confrontation
or not is up to him.

537
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,835
Just... let me handle it.

538
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,737
Dr. Wilmot.

539
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,407
I don't know what kind of drama
you got going on with Conrad,

540
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:07,177
but get it the hell away from
Carver and me right now.

541
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:09,045
Yes, sir.

542
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,626
That's the first thing,
and the most important.

543
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,649
Keep that in mind.

544
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,970
Hey.

545
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,483
I don't appreciate
you embarrassing me

546
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:20,073
in front of Dr. Bell.

547
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:22,425
You took anatomy class
in med school, right?

548
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,078
Vestigial organs...

549
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,142
- What are you rambling about?
- You know, like the appendix.

550
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,477
The one in 20 people who have
it removed don't even miss it.

551
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:33,053
Serves absolutely no purpose
in the human body anymore.

552
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,372
Like certain doctors
here at Chastain.

553
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,708
You really think you're
untouchable, don't you?

554
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,693
What I think is you gave an
already malnourished patient

555
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:44,247
a prep solution that exacerbated
his existing hyponatremia.

556
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,134
And when he started seizing,
you were nowhere to be found.

557
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:48,297
He's stable now, isn't he?

558
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,252
Thanks to my intern.

559
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,038
Good. Get an NG tube in there.

560
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:52,484
We should be able to
get the solution straight

561
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:54,691
into the digestive
system that way.

562
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,410
You want to put Nigel through

563
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:58,307
a nasogastric tube
insertion just for a test?

564
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,742
If it means getting to the root
of his pain sooner than later,

565
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,232
then, yes, I do.

566
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,119
Look, I'm trying
to help the patient.

567
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,444
Then why don't you try
actually listening to him?

568
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:20,467
You did a good thing
getting Atiba to his family.

569
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,473
At least he's
safe for one night.

570
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,320
I'm sorry I judged you.

571
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,122
I didn't realize you judged me.

572
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,702
It was all in my
inner monologue.

573
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,660
Good to know.

574
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,162
I would've wanted someone
to do the same for my sister.

575
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,665
There were many nights
she didn't make it home.

576
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,601
But she's been
sober for a year now.

577
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,304
So, you're sleeping
with Jude now?

578
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,740
What? Why would you say that?

579
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:46,109
I'm really good at
reading body language.

580
00:25:46,162 --> 00:25:48,522
I mean, look, the guy's
attractive and he's nice...

581
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:50,130
And safe,

582
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,482
compared to
someone else we know.

583
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,485
Look, Jude and I are just
becoming better friends.

584
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,189
All right. So I guess that means
I can become "better friends"

585
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,791
with Conrad now, right?

586
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,431
I was joking.

587
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,450
I-I'm sorry. I'm
still running late.

588
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:13,203
What? Where are
you? I'll be there

589
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,571
in less than ten minutes.

590
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,558
I need you to drop me
at my place, right away.

591
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:19,359
Yeah, sure.

592
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,500
What are you doing?

593
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:30,220
Wilmot ordered me to
put an NG tube in Nigel.

594
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,905
What a surprise.

595
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:35,725
He could have us both
cut from the program.

596
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,605
Oh, man up. Where's
all that bravado

597
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,929
you had on independence day?

598
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:40,608
What happened to
"When someone's wrong,

599
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,552
I'll be the first
one to tell 'em"?

600
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:45,785
Well...

601
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,405
I'm not so sure Wilmot's wrong.

602
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,294
Get out of my way.

603
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,330
Let me have it. I deserve it.

604
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,210
When you asked for
24 hours, I didn't realize

605
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:01,535
it would put me closer to
planning my own funeral.

606
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,298
You said you could help
me. Now I'm worse off

607
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,655
than when I came in.

608
00:27:08,811 --> 00:27:11,144
What are you doing?

609
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,524
You're right. I should
have done a better job

610
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,448
protecting you.

611
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,440
Do you trust me?

612
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:25,926
Yes.

613
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:27,594
God knows why.

614
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,112
Put your clothes on.

615
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,301
Do I want to know
what you're doing?

616
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,504
Wilmot can't test a
patient he can't find.

617
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,076
Mina, what's going on?

618
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,202
Thanks for the ride.

619
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,833
I'm so sorry. We tried
to wait for you at home.

620
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,714
No, it's my fault.
I was delayed.

621
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:55,605
She won't stop throwing
up. It's never been this bad.

622
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,653
These episodes can
recur multiple times a year.

623
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,994
- Any abdominal pain?
- Yes. A lot.

624
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,432
Here you go. Here you go, baby.

625
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:08,502
- Tell me the pain, one to ten.
- Ten.

626
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,574
You followed me?

627
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:16,721
That call sounded urgent.
I thought I could help.

628
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:17,822
Mina, what is going on in here?

629
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:18,779
Do you have any
pain in your head?

630
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,147
Just my stomach.

631
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,509
Mm. I need one
tablet of ondansetron.

632
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,782
Bottom drawer to the right.

633
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:25,435
And one liter bag of IV
fluid from my backpack.

634
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,700
Are you just going to stand
there or are you going to help?

635
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,513
Mina, are these from Chastain?

636
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:49,642
Okay, so this is one
test I haven't had.

637
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:52,946
But, seriously, what
are we doing here?

638
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:54,481
I'm hiding you where no doctor

639
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,616
will voluntarily
show their face.

640
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:58,768
A hospital waiting room?

641
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,271
That is brilliant.

642
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,457
And a damn sad
commentary on my profession.

643
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:06,221
So, what's the
plan beyond hiding?

644
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,411
I'm gonna listen.

645
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,330
I've reviewed all your
old medical records.

646
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,650
Now I want your patient
history directly from you.

647
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,970
Doesn't matter how small
the detail... bore me with it.

648
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,468
You went to all this trouble
and all we're gonna do is talk?

649
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,608
Patient's words over tests.

650
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:25,495
90% of the time, they give
you the answers you need.

651
00:29:25,548 --> 00:29:27,547
Hmm.

652
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:30,366
Maybe.

653
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,569
I have to say, you're
not what I expected.

654
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,070
Yeah? What'd you expect?

655
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,073
Frankly, less warmth, more ego.

656
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,708
Well...

657
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,755
Your surgeons are
lucky to have you as chief.

658
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,124
- I hope they appreciate you.
- Well, y-you're very kind.

659
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,715
But I can tell you what they
do appreciate is the autonomy

660
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,317
and the extensive OR time.

661
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,320
And, you know, for
the best of the best,

662
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,933
just a membership
to the Blackburn Club.

663
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,590
Wow.

664
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,437
A lot of benefits to
working here at Chastain.

665
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,038
- It's a great place to be.
- Well...

666
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,513
I'm curious. Uh...

667
00:29:59,582 --> 00:30:03,266
how are your surgical
error and complication rates?

668
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,767
Excuse me?

669
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:07,270
Well, I'm leaving St. Grace
for a bunch of reasons,

670
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,806
and, to be honest,
accountability's a big one.

671
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,936
They refused to even
consider my recommendations

672
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,728
for tracking surgical error
rates, among other things.

673
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:17,764
Well, so-so what
you're looking for

674
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:19,610
is a place that's
willing to embrace that.

675
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:21,846
Transparency and accountability
force us to weed out the bad

676
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,387
and grow the good.

677
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,774
This one doctor at St.
Grace had patients die

678
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:30,343
from complications every
time he did a bypass.

679
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,296
No one even noticed.

680
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,732
Except me. I noticed.

681
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,785
That's incredible.

682
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,137
I'm telling you, it's
like they say, you know,

683
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,523
the truth never
gets out of the OR.

684
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:03,860
Well, you are just
full of surprises.

685
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,628
How's Shalisha?

686
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,713
Cyclical vomiting syndrome.

687
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,250
She'll be fine once she
finishes her IV treatment.

688
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,384
Mina...

689
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,252
Save me the lecture.

690
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:13,653
I can't.

691
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,199
You're treating
patients from your home.

692
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:17,001
You're taking
supplies from Chastain.

693
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:18,669
Those drugs are all
free samples from reps.

694
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:21,778
Free samples given to Chastain.
Regardless, you could lose

695
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,764
your medical license for
treating people in your home.

696
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,528
Hell, Mina, you
could lose your visa.

697
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,784
I'm not a fool. I know that.

698
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,731
But am I supposed
to look the other way

699
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:32,150
while people in my community
are dying from treatable illnesses?

700
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:33,973
So send them to a clinic.

701
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,992
What clinic?

702
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,461
All the big hospitals are
closing their local clinics

703
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,547
left and right for
profit reasons.

704
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:42,260
And it's not fair. But if
you lose your license,

705
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:45,351
you're not gonna
help anybody. Ever.

706
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,845
My uncle, Onoche,

707
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,847
he was a brilliant man.

708
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,899
Like a second father to me.

709
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:03,503
He was a surgeon
here in the U.S., and...

710
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,266
when he'd visit
Nigeria on holiday,

711
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,024
he'd bring my cousins
clothes and candy.

712
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:12,913
For me, he'd bring
medical books and gadgets.

713
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:15,882
On his last visit home,
he had a heart attack.

714
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:18,552
A heart attack he
would have survived

715
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,788
if he had access to
proper health care

716
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,157
and not been in a
hospital in Arondizuogu

717
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:27,760
without a working defibrillator.

718
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,967
I think that's the most
words you've said, ever,

719
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:36,619
in the past three
years I've known you.

720
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,949
Don't get used to it.

721
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,874
<i>I don't know how I
was still standing.</i>

722
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:01,544
It hurt, but I still
finished the show.

723
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:04,114
My rendition of Albrecht's
Act II variation was

724
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:05,782
"just perfection."

725
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:07,834
At least, according
to The<i> Times.</i>

726
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,285
I would've paid to see that.

727
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:15,741
Colleague issues?

728
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,710
Father issues.

729
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:20,913
You're talking to a male
dancer about daddy issues?

730
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:23,433
Bet my old man was way worse.

731
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,767
Oh, you think so, huh?

732
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,981
My dad couldn't wrap his head

733
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,816
around me wanting
to dance ballet.

734
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,624
So he forced me to go
out for football instead.

735
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,459
He'd train me by making
me run stadium stairs

736
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,445
carrying buckets of sand.

737
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,947
My legs would burn,

738
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,950
my lungs exploding.

739
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,020
I was, like, 15
years old at the time,

740
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,305
and I thought I
was going to die.

741
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:48,308
Never thought just inhaling air

742
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:50,944
could be so excruciating.

743
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:52,795
But my father didn't care.

744
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,165
He just kept pushing.

745
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,234
My dad was so
bad, I went to fight

746
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,619
in Afghanistan for
peace and quiet.

747
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,826
You said you were 15
when this happened?

748
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:09,178
Yeah.

749
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,698
Funny thing is, my dad
still thinks I'm a wuss.

750
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,184
Joke's on him. He doesn't
get how much strength

751
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,052
it takes to do ballet.

752
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,732
Was that the first time
you felt pain like that?

753
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,822
Sure, yeah.

754
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,158
But it would always go
away after the workout.

755
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,926
Huh.

756
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,890
Was your initial pain
centered in your diaphragm,

757
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:27,794
right about where
your ribs meet?

758
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:31,868
How'd you know?

759
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,832
I think I know what's
wrong with you.

760
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,605
Don't mess with me, Doc.

761
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,822
Has anyone ever mentioned

762
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:40,677
median arcuate ligament
syndrome to you?

763
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,631
Hey. Have Lily's
labs come back yet?

764
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,133
She's about to
start conditioning.

765
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:51,671
Wait. This can't be right.

766
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,351
Isabel, am I reading
this correctly?

767
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:56,275
Lily's in acute renal failure?

768
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,094
I thought you were the doctor.

769
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,032
Oh, my God. How
did we miss that?

770
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,044
If we proceed with the
transplant, she'll die.

771
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,068
Call downstairs right
now and make sure

772
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,036
that they don't start
her conditioning.

773
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,605
And page Dr. Hunter.

774
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,677
<i>Lily, you're gonna be okay.</i>

775
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,433
How did her initial
labs not show

776
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:22,001
that her kidneys were failing?

777
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,715
Yeah, I'm asking myself
the same question.

778
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:24,904
Somebody clearly messed up.

779
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:26,450
Well, I'm gonna get
down to the bottom of it

780
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,052
as soon as I get
back to my clinic.

781
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:29,554
Whoever made this
mistake will be fired.

782
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:31,310
I can promise you that.

783
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,062
Dr. Hunter.

784
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,176
If we would have
proceeded with this treatment,

785
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,899
Lily would have likely died.

786
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:41,120
Yes. You saved Lily's
life today, Dr. Pravesh.

787
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:43,940
Excellent work. It's good to
know I was right about you.

788
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,893
You're gonna make an
exceptional oncologist.

789
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,996
Thank you. That means a lot.

790
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,142
Okay.

791
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,909
If Dr. Hawkins is right,

792
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,913
and this is MALS,

793
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:10,700
the minute this numbing
agent hits that celiac ganglion,

794
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,252
you're gonna
feel instant relief.

795
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:46,119
How you feeling?

796
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:48,387
Pain-free.

797
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,991
The first time in over a decade.

798
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:15,865
Hey.

799
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,134
Where the hell have you been?

800
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:19,819
Patient's fine, by the
way. Thanks for asking.

801
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,482
Turns out he has MALS.
Surgery's scheduled

802
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,167
for next week
after his final show.

803
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,191
Hey.

804
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:26,993
You think you're so damn smart.

805
00:37:27,062 --> 00:37:30,029
You know, one of these
days your need to play God

806
00:37:30,098 --> 00:37:32,899
with the rules is gonna
cost a patient their life.

807
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,568
And when that happens,
there'll be a long line of us ready

808
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:38,254
to make sure your medical
career goes up in flames.

809
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:41,006
Mmm. One man against an army.
Now you're talking my language.

810
00:37:41,075 --> 00:37:42,492
That gets me excited.

811
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:45,195
You know what
else gets me excited?

812
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,074
Knowing that if your
hand is still on my arm

813
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,109
in three seconds, you'll
be waking up in the ER

814
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,734
with no memory of
how you got there.

815
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:03,229
<i>Carver is</i>

816
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:05,065
even more impressive in person.

817
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,877
Oh. That's exactly
what I want to hear.

818
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:08,329
He'll be a great addition
to the surgical team.

819
00:38:08,353 --> 00:38:10,273
And I think his
plans for tracking

820
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,603
and publicizing all error
rates are really admirable.

821
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,852
Wait. Publicizing outside
the walls of the hospital?

822
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,654
Yeah, but I think once we
get through those lawsuits

823
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:19,044
that that transparency
causes, we'll be...

824
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:21,046
- Lawsuits?
- Yeah, lawsuits.

825
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:23,327
But Chastain can weather
those, and maybe, you know,

826
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:26,218
- even get ahead of the bad publicity.
- Right, of course.

827
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:28,265
You know, we can spin it into
something we can make use of.

828
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,434
You know, here's the thing,
Dr. Carver's very expensive.

829
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,236
And I think I'm gonna
have to take a look

830
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,072
at the budget. I'm
not sure that Chastain

831
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:37,063
can afford to make a
competitive offer at this time.

832
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:38,965
That's a pity.

833
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:41,851
Marshall. I didn't
expect to see you here.

834
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,270
I had some unfinished
business with Dr. Hunter.

835
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,105
Well, good news, I hope.

836
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,857
Actually, I won't be investing

837
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,792
in Chastain after all.

838
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:51,305
It's just not the
right fit for me.

839
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,445
Well, that's a shame,

840
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:55,342
that you couldn't have
come to that conclusion

841
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,283
before wasting everybody's time.

842
00:38:57,352 --> 00:39:01,654
I appreciate your time
and hospitality, Claire.

843
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:05,074
You wouldn't by chance
know where Dr. Hawkins is?

844
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:08,260
Conrad Hawkins?

845
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:10,124
I'm sure he's
on the fifth floor.

846
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,392
I can have one of
the nurses page him.

847
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,244
I wasn't aware you
were acquainted.

848
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,935
He's my son. Excuse me.

849
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,140
Did you know?

850
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:24,593
No idea.

851
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,993
Eh, regardless,
makes no difference.

852
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,650
Of course it does.

853
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,787
A no now could very well

854
00:39:33,855 --> 00:39:35,888
be a yes later.

855
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,308
- You haven't seen me work my magic.
- Yeah, dream on.

856
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,608
Hey. I rushed back as
soon as I got your message.

857
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,532
What's going on?

858
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,153
You were right.

859
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:53,956
I ju-I just... I-I
can't believe this.

860
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:57,326
It's crazy.

861
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:01,513
That transplant... with
Lily's comorbidities.

862
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:03,360
All right, Devon. I need
you to keep your voice down.

863
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:05,296
Just tell me exactly
what happened.

864
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,222
Okay, I reran a full blood
panel on Lily without telling Lane.

865
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,359
And the lab showed that
her kidneys are failing.

866
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:15,327
Which means she's not eligible

867
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:17,225
for a bone marrow
transplant right now.

868
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,032
Lane just played it off
like somebody at her clinic

869
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:22,038
made a mistake,
but I don't know...

870
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,321
She had to have known, right?

871
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:27,806
Why would Lane proceed
with the transplant?

872
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:31,361
Money. Bone marrow
transplants are the Super Bowl

873
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,964
of cancer treatments
when it comes to billing.

874
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,183
Lily would have died.

875
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:40,636
You were right.

876
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:44,373
We have to do
something about Lane.

877
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,960

Let's just try to stay
out of each other's way

881
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,431
while you're doing whatever
business with the hospital.

882
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,789
I'm not investing
in the hospital.

883
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,991
Truth is, I never was.

884
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,594
I was just doing
some recon, that's all.

885
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:06,696
Recon for what?

886
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:09,415
I'm opening a small
private hospital.

887
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:12,317
What I hope will
be the first of many.

888
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,854
And I don't just want
you to work there.

889
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:17,056
I want you to run it...

890
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,613
after you finish this final
year of residency, of course.

891
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,865
- What?
- Just hear me out.

892
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:28,451
You can do what you love to do.

893
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,604
Interact with the patients while
training your doctors your way,

894
00:41:31,673 --> 00:41:34,874
without all of this bureaucratic
mess over your head.

895
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,973
You trying to buy your
way back into my life again?

896
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:42,097
Maybe I am. The point is,

897
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,077
this is something
that's important to you,

898
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,369
and it's important to
me to help you get it.

899
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,707
Conrad, I am trying.

900
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:54,294
I-I don't need an
answer right now.

901
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:56,362
Just think about it.

902
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,551
