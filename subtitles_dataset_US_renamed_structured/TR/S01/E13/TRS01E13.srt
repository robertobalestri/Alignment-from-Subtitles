00:00:02,203 --> 00:00:05,086
I'm Dr. AJ Austin in the flesh.

3
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:06,983
<i>One of the most gifted
cardiothoracic surgeons</i>

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,223

5
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:09,591
I still plan to cut.

6
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,276
Why bother?

7
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,039
Keep Austin away
from conscious patients.

8
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:14,708
York, what did you shove
up your rectum this time?

9
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:16,159
<i>It was the first time that...</i>

10
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,800
That you had extracted

11
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,352
an object from the
colon of an adult male?

12
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,034
- Yes.
<i>- I like working for Hunter.</i>

13
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:26,641
She likes everyone who
works for her to be discreet.

14
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,372
Sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

15
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,073
<i>I'm just delivering
your groceries.</i>

16
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,097
<i>I think someone's following me.</i>

17
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,549
I'm just starting to realize
how far Lane's willing to go.

18
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,982
Hey!

00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,152

Claudia!

Claudia, wait!
Somebody, he... Get her!

25
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,322
Seriously? Are you...

26
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,074
Really? Thanks.

27
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:26,178
- And then he said...
- "No,

28
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:27,536
Bob's actually your uncle."

29
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
See, that's funny
because it's...

30
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,526
Never mind.

31
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,713
"Incoming"?

32
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,664
Whoa!

00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:41,083
Oh!

Claudia?

- Get back! Get back!
- Hey! Hey!

36
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:46,766
- Stop. Claudia.
- Claudia.

37
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:50,253
- Get back! Get back.
- Claudia, let us help you.

38
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,210
- Hey.
- You're hallucinating.

39
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,966
No! Please!

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,213
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,283
Just come with us.

00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:05,886
Claudia!

00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:20,317
- Incoming.
- Okay, let's go to Trauma One.

Major trauma, page Surgery.

46
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:29,626
It's your sis. Do you
want me to pick up?

47
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,200
I can't do Jessie before coffee.

48
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:34,136
Well...

49
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,504
I got his license plate.

50
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,706
And you were gonna
keep that to yourself?

51
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,295
- What?
- And do what?

52
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,643
Track him down, catch up
to him this time, kick his ass?

53
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,301
Oh, well, maybe you can track
him down and slash his tires,

54
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,553
throw a trash can
through his window.

55
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:52,999
Whatever.

56
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:54,456
How about I call the cops?

57
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,319
They can finally nail
this creepy son of a bitch.

58
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,377
Yeah, that sounds
like a good plan.

59
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:01,630
Think this is when
you go help someone

60
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:04,282
in that big, shiny hospital.

61
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,051
I'm fine.

62
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,879
She was hit by an ambulance?

63
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,297
Yeah, she was admitted

64
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:26,332
with a severe headache,
high temperature,

65
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:28,468
nausea, somnolence, and
she started hallucinating

66
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,625
- and she charged out.
- Yeah. Hip fracture

67
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,844
from impact with
the ambulance, and...

68
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,280
looks like loops of
bowel in her chest?

69
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,659
The impact ruptured
her diaphragm.

70
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,350
I'll prep for surgery.

71
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,162
Yeah, I'd like to pull
in Dr. Austin for this,

72
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,753
if you could check his schedule?

73
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,933
He treated you like a
child at Bradley's surgery.

74
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,157
He's the best thoracic
surgeon I've ever seen.

75
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,360
He'll probably save her life.

76
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:54,332
Dr. Nolan,

77
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,666
I called you a cretin

78
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,414
after our last
surgical experience.

79
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,638
Is there anything
you'd like to say to me?

80
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,689
Yes, there is.

81
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,443
Let's have a good surgery.

82
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,246
I love that.

83
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,982
Yes, let's do that.

84
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,734
Dr. Okafor, proceed with
the time out, s'il vous plaît.

85
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:15,615
Claudia Clare Webb.

86
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,505
Yes, correct.

87
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,125
A pair of ruptured
diaphragms, status: post-MVA,

88
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,234
versus pedestrian...

89
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,595
Well, this is a special treat.

90
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,408
Just here to observe.

91
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,216
Dr. Bell said,
"I will still cut."

92
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:32,120
I said, "Why bother?"

93
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,388
Dr. Bell said,

94
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:36,508
"Love, passion, discipline."

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,428
A rare opportunity
for the both of us.

96
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,379
- And after that,
we can take you to see her...
- Damn it, lady!

97
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:47,352
You keep giving
me the runaround.

98
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,431
I need you to tell me...

99
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,005
Sir, you need to calm down.

100
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:51,317
I need you to tell me
where I can find Claudia.

101
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,559
- Now. My...
- Hey. Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

102
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,556
- Claudia's my patient. What's your name?
- Felix.

103
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,391
- Are you taking me to see her?
- Soon.

104
00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:59,609
Trust me, she's in good hands.

105
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,732
I trust nobody.

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,300
Nobody.

107
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,813
Now, somebody, tell me
where I can see Claudia,

108
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,387
or get out of my face now.

109
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:07,666
I'll take you to see her as soon

110
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,569
- as she's in recovery.
- I don't believe you.

111
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:11,488
I got to make sure
that Claudia's getting

112
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,273
the best treatment.
People like you

113
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,497
lie to people like
me all the time.

114
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,499
I need to see Claudia now!

115
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,869
Are you done? Are you
ready to listen to the person

116
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:23,038
who's trying to save her life?

117
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:24,940
Hmm?

118
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,598
So, Claudia's your mom?

119
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,385
She's more of a mother
to me than anyone else.

120
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:40,255
She gave me a job
when no one else would.

121
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:43,191
We have to run some tests
when she's out of surgery

122
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,437
and figure out what's going on.

123
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:46,761
Yeah, I know, I know, but...

124
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,340
She spreads herself
thin, you know?

125
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:51,883
She's got a lot
of mouths to feed.

126
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,717
Looks like a traumatic
splenic laceration

127
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:00,242
from the accident.

128
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,504
Do you need a
trauma surgeon or...?

129
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,845
No. Lap. Suction.

130
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:06,526
Hmm.

131
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,800
"Not seeing things
can be a blessing."

132
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,652
Someone famous said that.

133
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,348
August Strindberg.

134
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,507
Ah, look at the
big brain on Albert.

135
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,643
But that quote doesn't
really apply in surgery.

136
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,512
Seeing is saving.

137
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,847
Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Bell?

138
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,107
Dr. Bell?

139
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,041
Well, I've never met a
bleeder I couldn't catch.

140
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,328
All right, Captain,
I think it's my turn.

141
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,575
Stay where you are, keep
your quotes to yourself.

142
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,331
2-0 silk.

143
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,565
Imagine you can
handle it from here.

144
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,560
Nice.

145
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,563
Yes, Officer, the guy
has been following me,

146
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,632
he confronted me at my house.

147
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,568
I just... I don't feel safe.

148
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:21,306
Okay. You'll look into it when?

149
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,841
Thanks.

150
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,843
For nothing.

151
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,766
- Allie, listen.
- What are you doing here?

152
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,535
Look, I'm worried Lane's
gonna hurt someone else.

153
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:37,038
I just need Lily's
original blood work.

154
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:38,584
- I know you're scared...
- Uh, yes.

155
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:39,841
I'm scared.

156
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,876
I have a child, bills.

157
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:43,577
If I lose this job...

158
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:45,547
I can't lose this job.

159
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,199
Stay away from me.

160
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,449
All right, the
surgery went well.

161
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,151
- Toxicology results?
- Negative.

162
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:57,153
- No drugs, no alcohol.
- Well, we still have
to figure out

163
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,587
what's causing
her erratic behavior.

164
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,656
Sounds like
bacterial meningitis.

165
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,912
She needs a spinal tap.

166
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,042
Start her on empiric
antibiotics after that.

167
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,582
Ah, Pravesh.

168
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,552
Your favorite frequent
flyer just arrived.

169
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:08,887
Go.

170
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,905
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

171
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:14,542
Don't tell me he put another
condiment in his colon!

172
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,114
It's nice to see
you again, York.

173
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,384
- And this must be...
- My beloved mother, Yvonne.

174
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:25,070
Yorkie has told me so
much about Chastain.

175
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:27,021
Thank you for your care of him.

176
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,601
Don't mention it.

177
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,360
I have the same
problem, you know.

178
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,629
A day without asthma
is a day I long for.

179
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,614
Well,

180
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,494
we are so glad
that we could help.

181
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,068
With his asthma.

182
00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:41,636
And Conrad is where?

183
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:43,704
Urgent case.

184
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,973
So, Ms. Evans, what
brings you in today?

185
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,525
Well, I took a tumble.

186
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,778
Yorkie and I were out for a
walk on the BeltLine, and...

187
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,296
Can we stop for a second?

188
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,710
Do you have any
heart-related issues?

189
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:57,101
Mm, no, not that I know of.

190
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:58,548
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Yeah.

191
00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,883
- Okay.
- It hurts, yeah.

192
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:02,018
I'm gonna order an
echocardiogram and expedite

193
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,474
an X-ray on your foot, okay?

194
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,464
- Fine by me.
- All right.

195
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,495
Wait.

196
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,732
- Wait, where you going?
- Just one sec.

197
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,819
My mother is my entire
life. Do you understand?

198
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,405
She seems like a
very sweet lady, York.

199
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,491
She is a bulldog.

200
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,342
My dad left us.

201
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,361
Did she wallow in self-pity? No.

202
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,663
She grabbed life by the balls.

203
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,332
Kung fu grip,

204
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,678
- started squeezing...
- Okay.

205
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,652
Just try not to worry, York.

206
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,305
I assure you, she is going
to get the very best care.

207
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,874
She better.

I have Narcan.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never
want to do this to you again.

I don't care. I don't care
about that, Jess, okay?

227
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:10,651
- Let's just get you better.
- Trauma Bay Two.

228
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,654
- What's going on?
- My sister. She OD'd on oxy.

229
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:15,768
- I gave her two doses of Narcan.
- You had it around?

230
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:17,803
After the last time, I had to.
Just keep an eye on her, okay?

231
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:19,477
You know I will.

232
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,858
Vitals, full blood work, EKG.
Let's have Narcan standing by.

233
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,993
I want updates every five
minutes. Keep this one quiet.

234
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,333
Of course.

235
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:28,786
I told her to call
me before she...

236
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,917
I didn't pick up earlier. I
should have answered.

237
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,474
She's here now. She's safe.

238
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,310
- She could have died.
- Do not do this to yourself.

239
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,630
I should've picked
up the phone. I...

240
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,515
Any word on
Claudia's blood test?

241
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,216
Elevated white count,
otherwise normal.

242
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,218
We'll need more tests to
figure out what's going on.

243
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,308
My head's killing me!

244
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,762
- My head is killing me!
- Look at me. Deep breaths.

245
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,059
Deep breaths, Claudia. Claudia.

246
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,810
Tell me what's wrong
with me, please.

247
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:00,934
- Stay focused. Shh...
- What's going on? What do we got?

248
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:04,439
Her head CT was normal, but with
these symptoms, I think we need a repeat.

249
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:06,040
Claudia.

250
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:08,204
We're gonna get you
something for the pain.

251
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,962
Claudia's visitor,
Felix, in a gang.

252
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,875
Last time one of their
members showed up,

253
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,500
a rival tried to take him
out, this place was chaos.

254
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,967
She's also uninsured,

255
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:21,071
so we have to diagnose and
treat Claudia before Bell turfs her.

256
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,390
Huh.

257
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,925
Excuse me, Doctor. I'm
looking for Claudia Webb.

258
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,279
- She's in recovery right
now and can't be seen. Yo!

259
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,441
Felix.

260
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,366
Go back to the waiting area.

261
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,268
- Hell no. He's cool.
- Wait, who's cool?

262
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,971
This cat right here.

263
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,325
- Thanks for coming.
- How are you?

264
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:42,710
Man, I'm freaking out,
man. I still haven't seen her.

265
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,279
Do Claudia proud,
keep it together.

266
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,881
For her, okay?

267
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,400
I used to arrest this
guy every six months

268
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,802
until Claudia took him in.

269
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,654
Felix is one of many ex-cons

270
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:55,334
she's hired at her
catering company.

271
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,992
Claudia's an important
part of the Atlanta PD family.

272
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,862
- Take special care of her.
- Don't worry.

273
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,231
I got your word on that, homie?

274
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,749
Yeah, you got my word.

275
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,589
Appreciate it.

276
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,408
Come on.

277
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,928
Thank you for coming.

278
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,117
You have a fifth metatarsal
fracture in your foot.

279
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,587
But the good news
is it's-it's nonsurgical.

280
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:27,355
Oh!

281
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:29,857
Yeah, but that
echocardiogram is not so good.

282
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,692
Let's keep this train moving.

283
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:34,428
Ms. Evans, your aortic valve

284
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,014
has calcified and thickened,

285
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,383
resulting in critical
aortic stenosis.

286
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,584
It's in urgent need
of replacement.

287
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,086
How urgent?

288
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,666
D-Does it require
general anesthesia?

289
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,122
It does.

290
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,969
A close friend of
mine went under

291
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,927
and when he woke,
he was a different man.

292
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,563
He couldn't even
recognize his own family.

293
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,164
Yeah, she's right.

294
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,784
General anesthesia can trigger
dementia in the<i> Cocoon</i> crowd.

295
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:01,573
Now, there is another option.

296
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,357
It's, uh, nonsurgical.

297
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,826
- You interested?
- Yes.
- Yes.

298
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,948
Don't have the surgery and die.

299
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:14,051
Hey. You... watch it, buddy.

300
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,572
Dr. Austin is just being
honest, but I would rather die

301
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,141
than go through life being
demented and confused.

302
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:23,261
- Mom!
- I still got to go
to my belly dancing classes.

303
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:25,124
I like this lady. Pravesh.

304
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:28,298
- Hallway, sidebar, now.
- York.

305
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,401
Emergency, sorry, bye.

306
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,106
It's Claudia.

307
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:37,608
She started seizing and
her sats are dropping.

308
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,060
Let's get her to the ICU.

309
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,327
Push two of lorazepam

310
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,948
and prep a gram of
phenytoin on standby.

311
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,216
Okay, ready?

312
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,734
Let's go. One...

313
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,136
two... three.

314
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:04,352
- Not now.
- Easy. I come in peace.

315
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,382
I-I heard about
your sister. I'm sorry.

316
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,956
- I trust she's doing better?
- Yeah.

317
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:11,792
I have a troubled loved
one in my family as well.

318
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:13,589
Believe me, I understand
what you're going through.

319
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,045
He's doing great now.

320
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,260
He was part of the
program over at Crossroads.

321
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,918
Hasn't had a relapse
since. Four years clean.

322
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,253
If you'd like,

323
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,922
I can help get Jessie into
the program free of charge.

324
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,640
Are you crazy?

325
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,010
You are the last person I
want help from right now.

326
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:31,198
Why don't you let me
take care of my family.

327
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,868
Hmm.

328
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,473
What's wrong with me?

329
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,436
The seizures have
been continuing

330
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,038
and we're trying
to figure out why.

331
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:49,463
I have so many people,
they're like family to me.

332
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:54,134
- They depend on me.
- I know. I've met some of them.

333
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,937
I don't know what
happens to everyone

334
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,956
if I'm not okay, you know?

335
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,910
Look who it is.

336
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,680
You look great.

337
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:11,402
You're gonna be okay.

338
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,421
I know.

339
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,607
Whatever happens...

340
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,609
look how far you've come.

341
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,846
I am so proud of you.

342
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,116
Don't talk like that.

343
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,450
Everything's gonna be fine.

344
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,453
I love you. We all love you.

345
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,904
I know you do.

346
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,433
Dr. Austin, where are you going?

347
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,319
To see a movie.<i> I Feel Pretty.</i>

348
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:48,739
Centers on an ordinary woman
who struggles with feelings

349
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,859
of inadequacy and
insecurity on a daily basis.

350
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:55,113
Amy Schumer. She makes me laugh.

351
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,447
What do you want?

352
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,277
I wasn't comfortable
mentioning this earlier,

353
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,935
but I can do a transcatheter
aortic valve replacement.

354
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:02,865
So Yvonne can have
moderate sedation.

355
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:07,141
- I need an attending.
- I'm not really a fan
of awake surgeries.

356
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,793
A risk we have to
take. You in or out?

357
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,979
Great.

358
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,498
I already bought my damn ticket!

359
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,700
Are those Claudia's CSF results?

360
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,136
Negative for
bacterial meningitis.

361
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,050
So we're still nowhere
closer to figuring out

362
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,473
- what's wrong with her.
- We're looking for a zebra.

363
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,343
- But we've run every test.
- Yeah, now you know the drill.

364
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,594
You talk.

365
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:30,698
- To whom?
- Felix, Mambo, and Raq.

366
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:34,502
Figure out everything
about Claudia.

367
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,904
Habits, hobbies, favorite food.

368
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,892
Hope we get closer
to a diagnosis.

369
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,664
Awake? What do you mean awake?

370
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,482
Awake, meaning not sleep...

371
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,117
Don't you do that.

372
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:52,453
It just... scares me.

373
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:54,738
- When I had surgery...
- Surgery?

374
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,490
For what, Yorkie?

375
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,877
Mom, it wasn't a big deal.

376
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:03,130
- Is it safe?
- Yes. And just regional anesthesia.

377
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,132
- I'm in.
- Mama.

378
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:07,485
I'm in.

379
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:09,417
But you listen to
me, mister man.

380
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:12,139
I'm sure you are
God's gift to medicine,

381
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,936
but you mind your
Ps and Qs in the OR.

382
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,804
If I hear anything
to the contrary,

383
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,730
I will wield my pen like a
mighty sword. Ask Pravesh.

384
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,734
I was thinking about something
else when you were talking.

385
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,670
But don't bother repeating
it. I really don't care.

386
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:29,890
I am going to save
your mother's life.

387
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,225
You're welcome.

388
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,122
So you've got the valve issue,

389
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,579
asthma, varicose veins,

390
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,214
a recent cataract surgery.

391
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,228
Any other medical history
we should know about?

392
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,101
- Nope, that is everything.
- Uh...

393
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,236
Yorkie, honey, give us a minute.

394
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,266
- But we don't have secrets,
Mother.
- No, no, honey.

395
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,306
I... Just one moment, sweetie.

396
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,075
Okay?

397
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,595
Close the door.

398
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,365
I have, um...

399
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:57,235
the little "C."

400
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,571
The little "C"?
You mean big "C."

401
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,374
- Cancer.
- No. Chlamydia.

402
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:06,560
We call it the little "C" in
my retirement community.

403
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,406
Yeah, you do.

404
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,448
She likes European movies.

405
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,379
- At least I can tell you
that much.
- European movies...

406
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,197
Mambo, not European movies,
she hates European movies.

407
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,532
- She loves the outdoors.
- She does.

408
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,467
- She does like the outdoors.
- She loves music.

409
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,373
It doesn't matter
what kind of music.

410
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,725
As long as she can groove to it,

411
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:22,054
- she digs it.
- Loves food.

412
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,677
Oh, she loves to cook...

413
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,341
- The Hot Pocket things, the...
- The little Hot Pocket things.

414
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,859
- She cooks a good meatloaf.
- She likes hiking, biking.

415
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:28,009
She's at the water
park, she's always in...

416
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,478
she was in the
water the whole day...

417
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,780
- Yeah.
- It was nice. I mean, we do it every year.

418
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:32,820
Wait.

419
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:34,905
Wait, back up. What
did you just say?

420
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,635
Uh, we did an event
for the Boys & Girls Club.

421
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,270
- I know, but, uh...
- We-we always do
an event for them.

422
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:39,927
Wh-Where was it, again?

423
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,023
- It was, uh, Running Rapids.
- Running Rapids.

424
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,441
- Yeah, yeah, Running Rapids.
- Right?

425
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:45,210
- Yeah.
- Yo, why are you asking
all these questions?

426
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:46,450
Did Claudia get in the water?

427
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,762
- Yeah, man, lazy river.
- Obviously.

428
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,688
- Slides.
- You know what,
uh, I'll be right back.

429
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:54,792
Hey! Yo! I got it!

430
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,760
Conrad, I got it.

431
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:58,979
Get this.

432
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:02,116
Claudia was at Running Rapids.

433
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:05,152
- Warm, stagnant water.
- So what are we thinking?

434
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,637
<i>Naegleria fowleri.</i>

435
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,233
98% fatal. I don't
like those odds.

436
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:10,807
Yeah, but the signs
and the symptoms,

437
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,143
they-they-they all line up.

438
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,429
The CSF didn't show an amoeba.

439
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:18,265
Because it was Gram
stained. I took a seminar

440
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,351
on brain-eating
amoebas in med school.

441
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,364
If they don't use
the Wright-Giemsa,

442
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,699
it's almost
impossible to detect it.

443
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,190
Tell the lab to rerun
the held sample

444
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,508
with the Wright-Giemsa. Now.

445
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:36,350
You need anything?

446
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,353
Yes, go to work. I know
you got a million things to do.

447
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,588
We're good.

448
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,876
Nice to see you two
are happening again.

449
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,511
Nothing's happening again.

450
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,713
Well, it should be.

451
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,233
- Nice to have you back, Jess.
- Conrad.

452
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,685
When's the last time
you had a simple carb?

453
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:57,738
It's been a minute.

454
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:07,480
Eight months clean.

455
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:10,350
Happiest I've been in forever.

456
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:12,379
Just like that, I
threw it all away.

457
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,541
Saddest part is, I
can't even tell you why.

458
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,476
It happened. It's done.

459
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,826
Now I just need to get you
into a treatment program.

460
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,364
Too expensive.

461
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:25,410
I'll do outpatient again.
I'll go to meetings.

462
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:28,552
No, Jess, we got to get
you better for good this time.

463
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,271
Whatever it takes.

464
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:33,273
I'm such a liability.

465
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:37,944
Thank you. Let me talk to her.

466
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,698
You've saved me
so many times, Nicky.

467
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:44,084
I can't keep doing this.

468
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:46,587
- You don't deserve this.
- I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:50,607
And don't you dare call
yourself a liability again.

470
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,609
We all have our demons.

471
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,881
You never judged me for mine.

472
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:58,832
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

473
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:03,437
I really do think you might need
to make Conrad some pasta.

474
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:05,539
He won't eat it.

475
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:07,425
<i>Dr. Okafor.</i>

476
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,638
- What are you doing here?
- Well, one of your patients

477
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,412
made it into my space, so
now I'm coming into yours.

478
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,199
- York.
- He's very insistent.

479
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,884
He also writes medical reviews

480
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:19,920
on every major
website known to man.

481
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:22,923
An awake surgery on his
mother with the Raptor?

482
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,642
Whose grand idea was that?

483
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,461
Well, now you'll have to
control his uncontrollable mouth.

484
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,279
Isn't that your expertise?

485
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,147
It's way below my pay grade.

486
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,360
You put this plan into motion.

487
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,967
This surgery falls on your head.

488
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,422
I'm sorry. I don't get it.
What are we doing here?

489
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:42,759
I'm the patient, wide
awake on the table.

490
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,806
I'm trying to prevent
you from giving Yvonne

491
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,131
a heart attack during
surgery. This isn't about me.

492
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,544
Well, this certainly
isn't about me.

493
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,345
Is that what you thought
was-was happening here?

494
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,669
You were gonna train me?

495
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,104
You're gonna groom
me, huh? Come on, girl.

496
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:55,734
I don't want this
old lady to die

497
00:22:55,758 --> 00:22:57,824
because you can't
keep your mouth shut.

498
00:22:57,893 --> 00:23:00,427
Maybe this will help you
understand me better.

499
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:02,595
My daddy looks like Chow Yun-Fat

500
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:05,116
and my mother is the
spitting image of Mary J. Blige.

501
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:06,612
Now, you're probably
thinking at least one of them

502
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,647
served in the armed
forces, right? Wrong.

503
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:10,337
They met at Vassar.

504
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:13,274
A decade later they
adopted my left-for-dead ass.

505
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:15,476
They were fantastic parents.

506
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:18,312
My childhood was
amazing, but guess what.

507
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:21,015
That didn't matter 'cause
I was still mad as hell

508
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,995
because the people
who actually made me

509
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:25,052
tossed me away like trash.

510
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:26,953
That's all I ever thought about.

511
00:23:27,023 --> 00:23:30,808
Why are you telling me this?

512
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,660
Because I was just
like you, princess.

513
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:37,630
Closed off, tied and,
and twisted all up inside,

514
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:41,152
until I learned to use
that emotion as fuel.

515
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:45,539
See, you think my
behavior is a weakness. No.

516
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,825
It's my superpower.

517
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,994
I walk into the OR with nothing

518
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:52,908
but a clear mind
and steady hands.

519
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,100
The only thing that stands
between life and death in an OR

520
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,218
are these, and the very thing

521
00:23:58,287 --> 00:23:59,915
that you were trying
to breed out of me

522
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,539
is why mine are better
than anyone else's.

523
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,558
Now...

524
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:09,212
you tell me something
real and make me believe it.

525
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,848
I...

526
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:15,852
do not need your superpower.

527
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:19,072
Then you will make
a great surgeon.

528
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:22,976
But you will never
be the best surgeon.

529
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,946
That's too damn bad.

530
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,042
Whoa. There it was.

531
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:41,378
<i>Naegleria fowleri</i> confirmed.

532
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,996
Brain-eating amoeba.

533
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,615
So we administer miltefosine.

534
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,016
Spoken like a true rookie.

535
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,629
It's the only
chance for a patient

536
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,487
with primary amebic
meningoencephalitis to survive.

537
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,916
It's also incredibly expensive
with a short shelf life.

538
00:24:52,942 --> 00:24:55,254
So I'll give you one guess
who doesn't stock this drug.

539
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:56,694
Chastain.

540
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:59,262
And Claudia doesn't have the
money for a drug we don't have.

541
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:00,631
Okay, so we fix this.

542
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,094
I mean, there's got to be
something that we could...

543
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:03,550
Yeah. Yeah, there is.

544
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,119
We need the Glacial Sun.

545
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,938
That's for inducing hypothermia

546
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,606
in cardiac arrest patients.

547
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,203
If we can lower her
body temperature

548
00:25:11,227 --> 00:25:13,071
to below what the
amoeba can survive

549
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,961
and administer the miltefosine,

550
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,580
we might have a shot.

551
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:17,826
We also might
freeze her to death.

552
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,100
It's possible. Call the CDC,

553
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,419
and then call whoever
the CDC tells you to call

554
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:25,038
and do not stop until you
get a dose of miltefosine.

555
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,773
What do we do about the money?

556
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,492
We do whatever it
takes. And keep this quiet.

557
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:33,313
We don't want this
popping up on Bell's radar.

558
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:35,498
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, uh,</i>

559
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:38,602
I've been thinking
about what you said.

560
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:41,171
Nic, if it's true,

561
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,190
I couldn't live with myself.

562
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,370
<i>Can you meet me at
the clinic at 4:00 a.m.,</i>

563
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:46,626
<i>before the staff arrives?</i>

564
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:48,195
Of course.

565
00:25:48,264 --> 00:25:49,507
And listen, Allie, I
know this is hard,

566
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:50,964
but it's the right thing to do.

567
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,477
You don't deserve
to go down with her.

568
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:53,645
<i>I will get you Lily's files.</i>

569
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:55,769
<i>Okay, see you then. Thank you.</i>

570
00:25:55,838 --> 00:25:57,821
<i>Gotta go, bye.</i>

571
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:12,619

care for some music?

572
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:15,556
Yes. How nice. Tom Jones?

573

574
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:21,561

00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,563

- Correct.

- Date of birth.

580

April 4, 1942.

581
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,363
My boyfriend thinks
I was born in '47.

582

00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:56,013
but your colleagues

699
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,915
need to lay eyes on
someone who gets it,

700
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:02,202
someone who listens, who
learns and who understands...

701
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,065
What it's like to let your
emotions get the best of you?

702
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,556
Just shut your mouth.

703
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,859
This is unfortunate.

704
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,728
I believe it was Nietzsche

705
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,525
who said that many
are stubborn in...

706
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:15,698
You've served your
purpose. Now get out.

- She's better.
- Huh.

720
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,066
Uh, what exactly
is going on here?

721
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,600
Fund-raiser.

722
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,703
Reformed criminals
doing a legal drug deal

723
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,283
with more cash
than I've ever seen.

724
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,607
While my sister is
detoxing from legal drugs

725
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,609
bought illegally.

726
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:00,710
Hey, you.

727
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:02,429
Uh, look, Mambo, this...

728
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,930
Ooh... Uh, yep.

729
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,083
- Nurse Nevin, right?
- Yeah.

730
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,996
Yeah, you took care of my
Uncle Deebo a few years back.

731
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,553
Deebo. Oh, I love him.

732
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,462
- He's a big teddy bear.
- Yeah.

733
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,772
He always would brag about
how good you were to him.

734
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,905
I think he had a little
crush, to tell you the truth.

735
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,095
Oh, how's he doing?

736
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,512
He's dead as hell.

737
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,248
Well, diabetes
finally took him out.

738
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:26,102
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

739
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,581
But, anyway, I
never got a chance

740
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:28,805
to say thank you in person.

741
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:31,524
- Hey, just doing my job.
- Yeah?

742
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,760
Well, you ever need
me to return the favor,

743
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,412
you just holler.

744
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:39,182
Hey, Mambo.

745
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:42,802
Actually, there...

746
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:46,539
there is a situation I
could use a little help with.

747
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,909
You are quickly becoming a
lost cause to me, Dr. Okafor.

748
00:33:49,978 --> 00:33:53,480
Your behavior in the OR...
In general... is unacceptable.

749
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,032
Well, I inspire and
transform those around me

750
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:57,434
in order to breed the best.

751
00:33:57,486 --> 00:33:58,885
I do not compromise.

752
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,987
- You're delusional.
- Yeah?

753
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:03,322
Well, when you win a
three-peat JAMA publication

754
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,692
and an ASA Medallion in
the same year, then, maybe,

755
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,126
I'll consider your diagnosis.

756
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:09,115
But until then, if
you're in my OR,

757
00:34:09,164 --> 00:34:12,332
you either exit or evolve.

758
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:14,233
That's funny.

759
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,786
I didn't peg you for a doctor
who cared about accolades.

760
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:18,238
Well, I do.

761
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,106
I am who I am.

762
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:23,409
That will never change.

763
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:50,604
What's up, man?

764
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,522
Can I help you with something?

765
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,559
Yeah. My little sister Nic

766
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:59,496
wanted me to return the favor.

767
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,680
Thanks for coming
all this way, Kevin.

768
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,004
Ah, it wasn't so bad.

769
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:09,701
I once drove to Kentucky
to deliver a dose.

770
00:35:09,725 --> 00:35:12,008
Did that patient make it?

771
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,160
Ah, afraid not.

772
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:15,349
Never would have imagined

773
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:18,064
a pharma CEO to
hand-deliver medication.

774
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,682
Yeah.

775
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:23,019
Well, I worked in Big
Pharma for 20 years.

776
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:24,537
Couldn't take it anymore.

777
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,190
Believe it or not, I put
people before profit.

778
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,842
Wait, so you only
supply miltefosine?

779
00:35:29,912 --> 00:35:31,344
Big Pharma refuses.

780
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:35,064
Not enough people
contract<i> Naegleria.</i>

781
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,515
No patients, no money.

782
00:35:36,585 --> 00:35:37,767
How do you profit?

783
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,935
I don't. 48 grand a pop's

784
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,722
what I need to keep the
lights on and the drug stocked.

785
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,952
Speaking of which, my daughter
is getting married tomorrow.

786
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,010
I should probably
get back on the road.

787
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,262
Uh, who should I, uh... invoice?

788
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:51,080
Yeah, uh...

789
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,550
Hey, pay that man his...

790
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:57,237
- Uh...
- So you're the guy?

791
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,423
Drove all the way from Florida
to deliver Claudia's medicine?

792
00:36:01,944 --> 00:36:03,976
It's all there.

793
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,149
For your records.

794
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:12,619
- No records.
- No records.

795
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:16,773
Thank you, Kevin.

796
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,452
I really hope this trip
was worth it for you.

797
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,321
It certainly will be
if Claudia survives.

798
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,594
Let me know, okay?

799
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,314
Will do.

800
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:30,803
<i>You've reached Allie.
Please leave a message.</i>

801
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:34,023
<i>Hi, Allie, it's Nic.
I'm pulling up now.</i>

802
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:12,378
Allie?

803
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:26,175
Allie?

804
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:45,156
- Tell me about this man
that you're very close to.
- No.

805
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,880
- You met him.
- Oh, there he is.

806
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,398
Bring it in for the real thing.

807
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:51,028
Oh.

808
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,338
- All right, big guy.
- Thank you.

809
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,790
- You're all right by me.
- Thank you, York.

810
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,254
Now, let's get you
guys home, yeah?

811
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,127
- Yeah.
- All right.

812
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,460
- Just get my flowers,
don't forget.
- Yeah.

813
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:08,585
It's clear you've chosen the
right profession, young man.

814
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:09,852
Thank you.

815
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:20,363
Yorkie, why is there a
syrup bottle up your butt?

816
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:21,875
You pulled up

817
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,434
the wrong "Y. Evans."

818
00:38:26,922 --> 00:38:28,722
I'm so sorry.

819
00:38:31,593 --> 00:38:33,693
It's okay.

820
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:35,361
I have chlamydia.

821
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:41,384
Those... look...

822
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:43,836
good.

823
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,538
How we feeling?

824
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:48,975
Can you tell us your name?

825
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,956
Yo, Felix.

826
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:04,991
Hey, what's up?

827
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,326
What?

828
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:08,978
Oh, what's up?

829
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,246
She okay?

830
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,266
She's awake?

831
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,752
This one's all you.

832
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,272
Yeah.

833
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,740
She's awake.

834
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:22,408
And she's okay.

835
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:23,955
In fact, she's doing great.

836
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:26,696
And she can't wait
to see all you guys.

837
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:30,332
Hey, man.

838
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:31,834
You did good, man.

839
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,836
You did real good.

840
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,269
Oh!

841
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,143
I love you, D.

842
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,399
Oh, God.

843
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,520
Man, not again.

844
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,042
You know, only four
people in the U.S. have

845
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,494
ever survived<i> Naegleria fowleri.</i>

846
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,262
You just saved the fifth.

847
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,659
It would not have been
great if you'd frozen Claudia

848
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:04,133
to death, but you didn't.

849
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:05,651
No, today you gambled

850
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,337
on unorthodox
medicine and you won.

851
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:10,874
Had you not won...

852
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,587
you'd be walking
out of this hospital

853
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,143
for the last time,

854
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:15,373
to join the ranks
of the unemployed

855
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:16,477
along with Nurse Nevin.

856
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,082
This is my hospital.

857
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:22,652
It's not your casino.

858
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:24,504
Enjoy your drinks.

859
00:40:24,573 --> 00:40:27,390
Ah.

860
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,291
Wait, wait.

861
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,494
What just... what just happened?

862
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:32,762
He said you're amazing.

863
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,100
And he can fire you
whenever he wants.

864
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,736
Hello.

865
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,416
<i>They set me up.</i>

866
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,538
Who set you up?

867
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,424
Where are you?

868
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:46,893
Atlanta Detention Center.

869
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:49,195
I'm on my way.

870
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,581
No, Conrad, listen to me.

871
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,026
There's nothing you
can do for me right now.

872
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,635
There's something
else I need help with.

873
00:40:56,904 --> 00:40:58,504
There you are.

874
00:40:58,573 --> 00:40:59,584
I was just about to call you.

875
00:40:59,608 --> 00:41:00,884
I tried Nic, like,
a hundred times.

876
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:01,974
She's not answering.

877
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,776
Where you going, Jessie?

878
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:05,556
Inman Park. Gonna
meet up with some friends,

879
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,446
just clear my head.

880
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:09,515
It'll be good for me.

881
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,650
Thanks for everything yesterday.

882
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,886
Sit down, Jessie.

883
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:16,355
Yeah, I'm good.

884
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:18,991
Did Nic send you?

885
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,788
Is that why she's not
answering my calls?

886
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,913
You know, I don't
need this right now.

887
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,910
And I've been discharged.
Dr. Whatever said I could go.

888
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:28,600
Uh, Nic got you a
place at Crossroads;

889
00:41:28,669 --> 00:41:30,085
it's a three-week program.

890
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,532
- Crossroads.
- Mm-hmm.

891
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,422
Nice.

892
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:35,791
See, this is what happens.

893
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,943
People make
decisions about my life,

894
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,429
- and that's not okay.
- We'll do this together.

895
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:41,542
Yeah, I said I'll do
the outpatient stuff,

896
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:42,698
I'll go to meetings...

897
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,595
You tried it last time,
and it didn't work.

898
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:46,586
I'm leaving.

899
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:48,304
Move, Conrad.

900
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:49,973
You almost died last night.

901
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,103
Would you have come
to my funeral if I did?

902
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:54,594
You care now?

903
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:56,913
We're family?

904
00:41:56,965 --> 00:41:58,464
Please.

905
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,700
You're still just
passing through.

906
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:05,121
Well, I'm here right now, and
I'm not leaving without you.

907
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,707
Where the hell is my sister?

908
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:12,290
Your sister's going through
a hard time right now...

909
00:42:12,314 --> 00:42:14,074
- Is she okay?
- She will be.

910
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,534
Your sister loves you very much.

911
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,520
She loves more than anything.

912
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:24,240
If you don't want to do
it for you, do it for her.

913
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,421
I wasn't always the
one screwing up.

914
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,783
Oh.

915
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:36,920
I guess you don't know Nic
as well as you think you do.

916
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:41,974
I'll be waiting outside.

917
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:43,493
We'll leave when you're ready.
