1
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:14,880
Bell, yank that sucker,
so we can get out of here.

2
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,908
Oh, the appendix hasn't burst.

3
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,683
That's good news.

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,937
Slippery little fellow.

5
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:25,140
Did you guys know this is
my first surgery with Dr. Bell?

6
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,603
No kidding.

7
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,293
We have to get a photo.

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,522
- Make it quick.
- Get in, Chu.

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,992
That is totally inappropriate.

10
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,046
- Go back to your stations.
- Oh, we're just having fun.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,602
He's out cold, he'll never know.

12
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,882
Wait, I'm gonna
take a quick selfie.

13
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,471
Get closer together.

14
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,708
I wish we could do
one without the mask.

15
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,995
Quit clowning, Chu.

16
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,742
Just one more.
I think we got it.

17
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,309
I'm going to send
this to my mother.

18
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:54,064
You'll get us all fired.
Cameras aren't allowed

19
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,949
in the OR.- -

20
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,333
He's waking up.

21
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,857
I need to up the sevo.

22
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,855
Oh, my God. Did
you hit an artery?

23
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,662
- On an appendectomy?
- You're losing blood fast.

24
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,877
I'm hanging two liters of
normal saline wide open,

25
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,829
Call for four units of
blood and 2 FFP stat.

26
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:10,053
I'm giving him Trendelenburg.

27
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:13,435
Packing, suction.

28
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,475
You have to clamp something.

29
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:17,721
He's lost at least
two liters already.

30
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,494
Come on, come on.

31
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,674
We just lost the
pulse. P.E.A. arrest.

32
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:22,618
All right, pressure, Cheryl.

33
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,316
I'm starting compressions.

34
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,601
CPR isn't gonna put
all that blood back

35
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,874
into his body.

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,640
Don't die on me.

37
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,997
It's no use.

38
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:52,327
He is so dead.

39
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:55,030
Time of death: 12:03.

40
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,652
Dr. Bell.

41
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,660
Oh...

42
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,772
Well, I think we can all agree
it was the misdosed sevo...

43
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,004
that led to this
unfortunate situation.

44
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,144
What? You're kidding, right?

45
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:45,007
The patient woke up,
his arm hit my hand.

46
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,643
You left the blade in the
field. You nicked the artery.

47
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,427
- You all saw it.
- Well, you never should've okayed

48
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:50,180
him for surgery in the first
place. His INR was abnormal.

49
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,131
The upper range of normal.
That's never gonna fly.

50
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:53,972
You know, I'm-I'm flashing back

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,307
to the time when
you tore through

52
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:58,455
that old woman's oropharynx
on a routine intubation.

53
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,989
Did that fly? I covered for you.

54
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,246
Not this time.

55
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,389
I'm chief of surgery, and he's
at the end of a 30-hour shift.

56
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,792
What did you see?

57
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:23,501
Well, w-we're all on
the same team here,

58
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,171
right?

59
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:36,131
Maybe he had a heart attack.

60
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:48,159
Yes. There's some family
history of heart disease.

61
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,445
Uh, yes.

62
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,447
His left main clogged.

63
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:54,999
Sudden cardiac event.

64
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,818
We tried CPR.

65
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,653
He was unresponsive.

66
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,689
Yeah, that works.

67
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:10,098
Well, that's right.

68
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,400
That's exactly right.

69
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,972
There was no
way to prevent this.

70
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,129
Who are you calling?

71
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,148
I'm erasing the photos,

72
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:28,233

That's him.

124

Dr. Randolph Bell.

125
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:10,845
Chief of surgery. He's a legend.

126
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:12,380
Thank you very much for coming.

127
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,182
I really appreciate
you taking the time.

128
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:16,635
And, Dr. Shore, thank you...

129
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,221
Excuse me, Dr. Bell?

130
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:21,622
I just wanted to say
that I really admire you.

131
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,643
And you're the reason
why I chose this residency.

132
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,255
Well, you made
the right decision.

133
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,429
Good luck to you.

134
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:29,163
Thank you.

135
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:32,967
Okay. So that's pretty much it?

136
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,636
Did you see that?

137
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,732
I feel like I just got
blessed by the Pope.

138
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,407
Oh, my supervising
resident just texted me.

139
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:42,244
Oh! A winky and a smiley face.

140
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,072
- That's got to be good, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

141
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,396
Um, hey, man.

142
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:05,099
Know where I can find
Dr. Conrad Hawkins?

143
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:06,401
Namaste.

144
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,103
You found him.

145
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,428
Take off that tie. You're
not at Harvard anymore.

146
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,459
What are you into? White, black?

147
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,278
Brown?

148
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,398
Men?

149
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,683
- I-I don't understand what you...
- Oh...

150
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,286
"I don't understand."

151
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:27,121
Were you affirmative
action at Harvard?

152
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,141
I read your file, bro.

153
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,276
Yale, then Harvard.

154
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,128
Let's go.

155
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,482
19 first authors.
Step 1 score: 267.

156
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,051
- I got 280 by the way.
- Dr. C.

157
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,098
Top of your class,
followed all the rules,

158
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,639
and you think that puts you
at an advantage. It doesn't.

159
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,419
It just means you
have more to unlearn

160
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,221
than the guys who
weren't paying attention.

161
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:49,706
Over easy, no cheese,

162
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,341
- no mayo, breakfast sandwich.
- Good man.

163
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,064
Second year.

164
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,298
I broke him.

165
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,417
Now he's a doctor.

166
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:58,197
You're not.

167
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,531
You got your little
white coat, though.

168
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:02,123
Your stethoscope, your penlight.

169
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,408
You're all ready to
play doctor, right?

170
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,471
No, no, no, no.
It's not like that.

171
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:06,978
We're not laughing together.

172
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,947
Everything you thought you
knew about medicine is wrong.

173
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,350
All the rules you
followed, we'll break.

174
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,469
I have only one rule.
Covers everything.

175
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,856
I'm never wrong.

176
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,324
You do whatever
the hell I tell you.

177
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,877
No questions asked.

178
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:24,696
Do you want me to speak now?

179
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,298
That's a question.

180
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,452
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no. Don't do that.

181
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,303
Don't do that. Eyes on me.

182
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,549
My last resident
had an attitude, too,

183
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,006
and you know where he is now?

184
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,553
He's teaching
eighth grade biology.

185
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,692
I cut him. Do you
know what that means?

186
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,661
It means I can end your career.

187
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,364
Just like that.

188
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:44,710
Remove you from this residency
at any time, for any reason.

189
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:47,068
And if I do that, no other
residency will take you.

190
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:49,721
All you'll have left

191
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,634
from that fancy Harvard
medical school degree

192
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,125
is a mountain of debt.

193
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,344
Now, let's meet
your first patient.

194
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,329
This is Dobroslav.

195
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,565
He's Croatian,
speaks no English.

196
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:01,860
He has severe cauda
equina syndrome.

197
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:02,816
What are we worried about?

198
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:04,630
- Early paralysis.
- Hey, man.

199
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,366
What's the first
sign of paralysis?

200
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,573
- Anal tone.
- Stick your finger up his ass.

201
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,361
Normal procedure
is to get an MRI.

202
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:17,198
Thank you so much for telling
me about normal procedure.

203
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,217
An MRI would take
hours and delay

204
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,603
steroid treatment and surgery,

205
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:25,456
both of which might
save Dobroslav.

206
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,244
A loose rectum means
his legs may give out soon.

207
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,807
Tight means
there's no paralysis.

208
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:34,265
So we need to know
exactly how tight it is up there.

209
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,403
Good afternoon, we need
to explore your rectum.

210
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,853
How tight would you say it is?

211
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,622
Compared to your prom date.

212
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,860
Stay like that until you
can answer the question.

213
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,307
Excuse me, nurse? Devon.

214
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,460
Nic.

215
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,627
I need a new resident.

216
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:22,446
- Mine's impossible.
- You got Conrad.

217
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,066
Yes, I did, and I need
someone else, like, now.

218
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:28,336
Let's say your car has a rattle.

219
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:29,970
So you take it to a mechanic

220
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,824
and this guy's kind,
polite, eager to help.

221
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,326
For two days, he runs
every test in the book.

222
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,694
And then he calls you and says

223
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,373
it's gonna set you
back a thousand bucks.

224
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,464
So you max out your credit card

225
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,395
and on your drive
home, guess what.

226
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:43,617
What?

227
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,353
You hear the same rattle.

228
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,533
Or you could take the
same car with the same rattle

229
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,324
to another mechanic.

230
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:53,111
And this guy is rude,
uh, dismissive, arrogant,

231
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,347
but he tightens a
bolt, fixes the rattle,

232
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,449
charges you five
bucks. Problem solved.

233
00:11:58,502 --> 00:12:00,634
This is nothing like that.

234
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:03,021
No, because your
car can't end up dead.

235
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,523
Watch and learn.

236
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,459
Conrad's the guy
who tightens the bolt.

237
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:19,821
Four heart failure disasters.

238
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,539
Two went straight to the unit.

239
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,648
One is dry and cold.

240
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,042
Now a new admission shows up

241
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,654
with a bewildering
array of symptoms.

242
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:26,511
You'd probably diagnose her

243
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,197
by the type of dirt on her shoe.

244
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,649
Could you possibly
do a quick consult?

245
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,051
I'm slammed.

246
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,402
Ah.

247
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,770
I took that photo.

248
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,943
Mrs. Robinson, we're going
to get you back to your room.

249
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,322
Right.

250
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,997
"No gamers, no
slackers, no doctors."

251
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,565
That's pretty clear.

252
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,533
What did you do this time?

253
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,553
Tell me about the new admission.

254
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,774
Alopecia, discoid rash,
rising urea nitrogen...

255
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,459
Lupus.

256
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:03,314
Lupus.

257
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,400
HR to Dr. Shaw.

258
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,421

Nic.

282
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,863
Not funny.

283
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:29,650
Nic.

284
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,103
Acute leukemic on chemo.

285
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,716
Fiancé called because she
was shaking uncontrollably.

286
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,718
Uh, she spiked a fever
this morning, 100.8.

287
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,074
Also, there was some vomiting.

288
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,610
There's no blood in it.

289
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:39,772
Last chemo was a week ago.

290
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,062
Hey.

291
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,598
You're here.

292
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:44,815
I was scared.

293
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,484
Ah, you're running a fever.

294
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,169
It's just another infection.

295
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,232
Chemo is still crushing
your immune system.

296
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,224
We'll get you started on broad-
spectrum antibiotics again.

297
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,826
Acetaminophen to
get your fever down.

298
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,855
Get cultures from
both arms. Urine.

299
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,979
She'll need a head CT.

300
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:02,199
- Okay.
- Don't worry.

301
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,834
We'll get this under control.

302
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,419
Get you both back home soon.

303
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,521
You're in good hands.

304
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,590
Guess where he
went to medical school.

305
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,778
I think he went to
Harvard Medical School.

306
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,715
Was it Harvard Medical School?

307
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:21,802
I'm pretty sure it was
Harvard Medical School.

308
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:23,303
Lily means a lot to all of us.

309
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:24,950
She's been in and
out of the ER so often,

310
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:28,325
we're all invested, but her
diagnosis is a tough one.

311
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,827
I'm giving you a gift.

312
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,929
From now on, she's your patient.

313
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,582
But if you screw this
one up, I will wreck you.

314
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:36,767
- I got it.
- Hey, Conrad.

315
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,590
What's wrong?

316
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:44,537
Your appendectomy patient
who had surgery last night...

317
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:45,726
What about him?

318
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:48,812
Conrad, he's dead.

319
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,715
What the hell happened?

320
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,800
HODAD happened.

321
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,599
What was it this time, Bell?

322
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:09,934
Pulmonary embolism?

323
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,852
Undisclosed heart condition.

324
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:15,256
Tragic situation, and
naturally I covered for you.

325
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:16,740
You need to consider a change

326
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,220
before you kill
any more patients.

327
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,910
How dare you?

328
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,357
Go be one of those
celebrity TV doctors.

329
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,880
You look the part.

330
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,972
Make a lot of money,
wear nice clothes.

331
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,884
You'd be great at it.

332
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,586
You watch yourself, Conrad.

333
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,222
You know, I'm remembering
a pretty, young resident

334
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,909
that reported a fatal chemo
overdose a couple years back.

335
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:38,278
That good deed...
that led to a lawsuit

336
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:39,914
that cost the hospital millions.

337
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,099
You tell me, Conrad,
where is she today?

338
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,813
With cutting-edge research.

339
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,697
At this moment, our
patients are involved

340
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:47,121
in over 100...

341
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,256

00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:36,937
He broke my toe!

357
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,138
His toe fell off.

358
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,235
Chad, buddy, we are
amputating the whole foot.

359
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,960
You knew this was coming. Devon.

360
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:45,052
What do you think
they got for dessert?

361
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,615
You can't keep me here!

362
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:49,862
- You need to settle down.
- Calm down.

363
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:51,618
- Get me out!
- Calm down.

364
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:52,820
New admission.

365
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:55,690
21-year-old girl,
history of IV drug use.

366
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,491
Likely endo.

367
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,021
She was trying
to steal Dilaudid.

368
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,277
Now she wants to leave AMA.

369
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,790
She's been spiking
fever, vomiting.

370
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,175
- She's using again.
- Hey, hey.

371
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,777
She took all my money
and spent it on oxy.

372
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,011
Oy, listen to me.

373
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:08,301
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Please, stop.

374
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,021
Hey, hey, hey. See these?

375
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,984
See these? These
are Osler's nodes

376
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,986
caused by bacteria
swarming in your blood

377
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,104
and moving throughout your body.

378
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,061
Classic for endocarditis,

379
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,340
an infection of the heart valve.

380
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,681
Happens to drug
users all the time.

381
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,928
If you walk out of here
without any antibiotics,

382
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:24,752
this will kill you.

383
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:28,955
If you give us a chance,
we can save your life.

384
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,894
I'll stay if you give me
three milligrams of Dilaudid.

385
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:36,063
Two.

386
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:39,984
If you calm down and you
get back in bed right now.

387
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:52,012
Chloe, baby!

388
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:55,015
- Get a crash cart.
- Chloe, baby!

389
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:56,946
- I'm not getting a pulse.
- Code Blue in ED alpha!

390
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,280
- Get them out of here.
- No, no!

391
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,587
- Baby, no! No!
- You need to give them space.

392
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,735
Start compressions.
You're running the code.

393
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:03,924
I've never run a code.

394
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,738
- Do you want an amp of bicarb?
- He's in charge.

395
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:08,095
Page Anesthesia.

396
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,284
What is the first question
you ask in a code?

397
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,253
Rhythm.

398
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,738
What's her rhythm?

399
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,956
P.E.A.

400
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,721
- Should we shock?
- No, we can't. Her rhythm's not shockable.

401
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,825
Get me one of epi.
Make those compressions

402
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:25,962
harder and faster.

403
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,072
Prepare to intubate.

404
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,025
It's been 24 minutes.

405
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,094
- It's time to call the code.
- No!

406
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:42,613
This is my code. You
gave me this code.

407
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,150
She's 21 years old.

408
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,852
Harder, man. You need
to feel the ribs crack.

409
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,291
That's enough.

410
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,376
No. Move.

411
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,979
I'm not giving up.

412
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,116
I said that's enough.

413
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:19,200
We got a pulse.

414
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,470
You saved her life.

415
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:35,799
Her end tidal CO2 was less
than 15 for the entire code.

416
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:38,152
- That doesn't necessarily mean that...
- Yes.

417
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,987
Yes, it does.

418
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:42,001
She's been without oxygen
to her brain for 26 minutes.

419
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:44,625
Congratulations, you got
her heart beating again,

420
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:45,959
but she's brain-dead.

421
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:06,063
You came in here all
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,

422
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,443
ready to save lives, but
today you didn't save a life.

423
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,019
You saved a brain stem
because you didn't listen to me.

424
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:14,654
Now the repercussions
on Chloe's family

425
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:18,075
will be catastrophic.

426
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,144
There's no way
they'll accept this.

427
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,324
Chloe looks alive. They'll
think she can wake up.

428
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:26,183
So they will hover over
her, tend to her for days,

429
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:28,475
weeks, maybe years,
waiting for a miracle to happen

430
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,955
that's utterly impossible.

431
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,075
What was rule one, Devon?

432
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,062
Do whatever you tell me to do.

433
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,597
No questions asked.

434
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,165
All we want to do
is help our patients,

435
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,112
but what they don't
teach us in medical school

436
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,136
is there are so many
ways to do harm.

437
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:12,062
As you can see, the
Titian is an amazing piece

438
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:13,514
of medical technology.

439
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,084
We've nicknamed
it the "Hand of God"

440
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,088
because it does what no
human hands could accomplish.

441
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:23,891
Even yours?

442
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,325
Yeah, even mine.

443
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:30,230
The finest surgeon in the world

444
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,532
would benefit from the Titian.

445
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,934
It's capable

446
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,070
of movements that are incredibly

447
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,573
steady and precise,

448
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:42,475
virtually eliminating
human error.

449
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:45,162
Chastain Park Memorial

450
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,265
is the first hospital
in the country

451
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:50,701
to have this miraculous machine,

452
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,136
thanks to Dr. Bell,
who spearheaded

453
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,555
this fund-raising campaign,

454
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,358
and, of course, to you,
our very generous donors.

455
00:22:57,443 --> 00:23:00,060
Thank you.

456
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,582
"Serious complications
may occur,

457
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:09,486
"up to and including death.

458
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,506
Individual surgical
results may vary."

459
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:13,718
I've trained for
months to do this.

460
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:15,375
Results will not vary.

461
00:23:15,444 --> 00:23:18,278
Until Bell gets his hands on it.

462
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:19,630
Over my dead body.

463
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,376
I'm sure HODAD
could manage that.

464
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,166
I heard a nurse call him HODAD.

465
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,835
What does it stand for?

466
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,838
Hands of Death and Destruction.

467
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,141
You're kidding. Does
that mean everyone knows

468
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,410
about his complication rate?

469
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:35,379
All the nurses,
some of the doctors.

470
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,014
The ones who pay attention.

471
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,401
Poetry.

472
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,171
But none of the
patients. They're clueless.

473
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:48,325
You've got the best
hands in the business,

474
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,355
but he's still the most
requested surgeon

475
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:52,229
in the hospital.

476
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:54,026
Have you seen
his reviews online?

477
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,567
He has got five stars.

478
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:01,672
Top patient review:
"McDreamy is real."

479
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,324
- You want to hear yours?
- Don't care.

480
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:06,377
You got one star.

481
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,062
"Steer clear of Dr. Okafor.

482
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,397
She told me my uterus sucked."

483
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:13,317
It did suck.

484
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:18,338
I just had hernia
surgery with Dr. Bell.

485
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:20,307
The man has magic hands.

486
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:26,124
Dr. Flores, dial 182...

487
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:27,276
Hey.

488
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,117
Randolph, I'm so
glad you're here.

489
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,787
Where else would I be?

490
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,467
You better finish up
those smoked oysters.

491
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:36,990
There's no food after midnight.

492
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,403
All right. They're
absolutely delicious.

493
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:41,444
This whole VIP
floor is spectacular.

494
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:44,764
It's nothing more than
you deserve, my friend.

495
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,528
If it hadn't been for
your generous donation,

496
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:49,420
there would be no
new cancer wing.

497
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,272
- Well...
- So...

498
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,668
I hear you're gonna
be the first patient

499
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,025
to benefit from the Titian.

500
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,476
Yeah, it's quite the honor.

501
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:58,795
I hear the damn thing
practically operates itself.

502
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,632
Have you met your
surgeon yet, Dr. Okafor?

503
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,400
Nope, not yet.

504
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,301
She's Nigerian.

505
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,304
Mm-hmm.

506
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,839
Yeah, here on a visa.

507
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,807
Very promising young resident.

508
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,522
What do you mean,
"young resident"?

509
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:16,079
Well, second year, I believe.

510
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:19,099
Randolph, I spoke
directly to the CEO...

511
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:21,468
I mentioned you...
But she told me

512
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:23,103
that Dr. Okafor was the best

513
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:25,723
possible person to remove
my prostate with the Titian.

514
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,952
She'll be fine,
I'm fairly certain.

515
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:28,442
I want you.

516
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:29,843
You're the chief of surgery.

517
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,522
Don't you think I
deserve the best?

518
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:33,847
Yes.

519
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:36,499
And I'll make sure you get it.

520
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,501
Thank you.

521
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,665
You have a visitor
in the main lobby.

522
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:42,773
Lisa brought this
back to you, baby,

523
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,191
your honey bunny.

524
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:47,461
I'm so happy
you're with us again.

525
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:49,512
I'll be right back, my darling.

526
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:50,781
Dr. Pravesh,

527
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,399
I never thanked you

528
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,336
for saving my daughter's life.

529
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:57,854
Thank you.

530
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,290
You're wonderful.

531
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,626
I'll be in the cafeteria
if she wakes up.

532
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:17,490
You okay?

533
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,860
Nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.

534
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:22,223
They'll do an
investigation, right?

535
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,546
Are you kidding me?

536
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,526
The hospital will
probably give you a medal.

537
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,518
Every day Chloe's in the ICU,

538
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:29,987
they bill thousands of dollars.

539
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:32,522
It's a huge payday for them.

540
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:36,226
Medicine isn't practiced
by saints, Devon.

541
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,328
It's a business.

542
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:41,481
Yeah, but this, all this,
just isn't what I imagined.

543
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,984
Then you're lucky.

544
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,540
When I was 13, my mom
went in for her routine physical.

545
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,543
They did some tests, and they...

546
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,929
they found something
small on her lung.

547
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:58,382
So they cracked her chest,

548
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,751
and her lung collapsed.

549
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,052
She got pneumonia,
and five days later,

550
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,355
she was dead.

551
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,807
She was 38 years old.

552
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:10,594
I'm so sorry.

553
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,014
This happens all
the time, Devon.

554
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:16,633
Medical error is the third-
leading cause of death

555
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:20,286
in the United States after
cancer and heart disease.

556
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,452
They don't want us
talking about that.

557
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:27,394
But you still show
up here every day.

558
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,413
'Cause it's personal to me.

559
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,403
And there are
still plenty of good

560
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:37,437
doctors and nurses
trying to do the right thing.

561
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:41,274
I'm just trying
to be one of 'em.

562
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,463
Lily.

563
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,266
You look like
you're feeling better.

564
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:53,437
Yeah, yeah. Conrad's
a miracle worker.

565
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,505
Well, good. Let's
get you back in bed.

566
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,940
You need to stay warm.

567
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:02,062
Where's your fiancé?

568
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,665
Oh, he... he left
a few hours ago.

569
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:06,116
I was still in the ER.

570
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,601
I bet he's just exhausted.

571
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:11,638
- He'll be back tomorrow, I'm sure.
- No, he won't.

572
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,643
I got diagnosed a month
after I got engaged.

573
00:28:16,712 --> 00:28:19,480
It's not his fault. He
didn't sign up for cancer.

574
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:25,152
I mean, maybe if I
just let him go sooner...

575
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,038
I was selfish.

576
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,789
Didn't want to die alone.

577
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,196
Do you have to go right away?

578
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,500
No.

579
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,469
No. We can talk.

580
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,825
Come on, man.

581
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:12,132
Status?

582
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:14,079
We pushed adenosine
six milligrams, then 12.

583
00:29:14,103 --> 00:29:15,713
She's still tach'ing
away at 180.

584
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:17,265
- Try verapamil.
- That won't work,

585
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,000
Dr. Bell, she's gonna
have a heart attack.

586
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,731
I think her heart's had
enough AV blockade.

587
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:47,300
Oh.

588
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,834
Normal rhythm.

589
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,458
- Her heartbeat is back.
- Ice water stimulus.

590
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,678
Prompts vagal tone,
restores normal rhythm in SVT.

591
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:00,975
Called the Diver's Reflex.
That was my next step.

592
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,034
Two in one day would
have been a bit excessive.

593
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,556
Tightening the bolt.

594
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,775
You saved my life, Dr. Bell.

595
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,744
Thank you so much.

596
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,879
Nothing to it.

597
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,734
I don't have time to give
updates on how the surgeries

598
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:23,447
went one by one. Are
the families all assembled?

599
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:25,783
Dr. Okafor, you have to
talk to them each individually.

600
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:27,847
- There are rules about this.
- I get it.

601
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,807
Luis is doing fine.
He's in recovery.

602
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,464
- Oh.
- Oh.

603
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,700
Raj is in the ICU.
It's touch and go.

604
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,063
- Oh.
- Oh.

605
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,454
Prescott's dead.

606
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,491
What? Huh?

607
00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:50,763
Dr. Okafor! A word.

608
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:53,032
Sorry, I'm on my
way out. I need to rest

609
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,679
for the first robot
prostatectomy tomorrow morning.

610
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:56,281
Well, that's actually
why I'm here.

611
00:30:56,305 --> 00:30:57,770
The patient has requested

612
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,233
a last-minute
change in the lineup.

613
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,706
The lineup?

614
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,092
Lyle's always been my patient.

615
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,611
He's asked me to step in.

616
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,646
Does he have a death wish?

617
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:10,416
I hear you're applying
for an O-1 visa.

618
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:12,196
You'll need a letter
of recommendation

619
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,770
from your supervisor.

620
00:31:13,822 --> 00:31:15,855
- I believe that'd be me.
- Dr. Bell,

621
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:18,491
you have never
touched the Titian.

622
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,760
It takes many hours of
practice to be proficient.

623
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,796
You cannot do that surgery.

624
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,814
As in, it's literally
impossible.

625
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,300
You have no idea what's possible

626
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:30,170
for a surgeon with my
experience and expertise.

627
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,933
The surgery is first
thing tomorrow morning.

628
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,524
There isn't enough time
to bring you up to speed.

629
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:37,527
I have to draw a line
here. This can't happen.

630
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,846
It's too risky for you
and for the patient.

631
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,243
Oh, then, I'm afraid you'll
be heading back to Abuja.

632
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,833
And as you know,

633
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,914
immigration to the States
has become quite difficult.

634
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:47,687
We're shutting our doors.

635
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,874
Given the political
unrest and the quality

636
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,704
of health care
available in Nigeria,

637
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:55,028
you might want to reconsider.

638
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:57,847
If I help you,
you'll get your visa.

639
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,183
If I don't, you won't.

640
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,922
Your call.

641
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:10,543
Start with a simple maneuver.

642
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:14,113
Four-millimeter incision
on the ventral surface.

643
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:26,176
Slow and steady.

644
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,577
I've got it.

645
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,534
What the hell's wrong
with the machine?

646
00:32:36,438 --> 00:32:37,904
It would be better,

647
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:41,724
for everyone, if I do this.

648
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,559
No. The patient asked for me.

649
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,548
I'm always there
for my patients.

650
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,100
Just put that plum
back on the table,

651
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,601
and let's get on with it.

652
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,805
Round 11.

653
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:03,913
Oh, for crying out loud!

654
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,547
This is a new low even for you.

655
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:58,885
Is your pride really worth
more than the life of a patient?

656
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,053
Get out.

657
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:03,790
I can't stop this train wreck,

658
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:05,286
so I just wanted
to let you know,

659
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,828
I've arranged for a
very wide audience.

660
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,479
What are you talking about?

661
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,782
The hospital's gonna
stream the robotic surgery live.

662
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:15,035
Not just to the donors
who are watching here,

663
00:34:15,103 --> 00:34:17,637
but to thousands
of viewers online.

664
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,990
Unless, of course,
you want to step aside.

665
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:24,344
Idiot.

666
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:26,980
I'll do no such thing.

667
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:29,599
The more witnesses the better.

668
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:33,520
This is going to be a
flawless presentation.

669
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:53,873
Do you think you can sleep?

670
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:57,194
Uh, yeah, I think so.

671
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,328
Hey, can I ask you something?

672
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,030
Of course.

673
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,900
What are my odds?

674
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:07,871
I mean, is there a
chance I can survive this?

675
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,092
I looked at your chart, and
you're on an intense protocol.

676
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,544
The next few
months will be rough,

677
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,080
but you can beat this.

678
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:22,668
How are you feeling, Lily?

679
00:35:22,738 --> 00:35:24,838
A bit weak all of a sudden.

680
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:26,066
Your blood pressure is low.

681
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,658
80/40. It was
120/90 a minute ago.

682
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,310
Lily. Lily!

683
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,111
Lily.

684
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,180
Lily!

685
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,233
Where's Conrad?

686
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,480
He's in the ER.
Why? What's wrong?

687
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,470
Lily's BP is 70/38 and dropping.

688
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:43,339
Can we please get
rapid response now?

689
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,558
Get a CBC, CMP, LFTs, lactate.

690
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:47,359
Is the IV wide open?

691
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:49,040
Systolic's fluctuating,
but it's not good.

692
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,909
We're three liters in
already. It's sepsis.

693
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:52,276
You want to give
norepi peripherally?

694
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,000
No. Get a central line.

695
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,335
No. You've never done
one. We wait for Conrad.

696
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,039
We can't. She'll die.

697
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:00,835
Prepare the iodine swabs.

698
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:03,170
We need norepi and vaso on
the table. Get pharm here now.

699
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,278
I want 12 leads
on her at all times.

700
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:07,964
Call for an
ultrasound as backup.

701
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:13,119
Scalpel.

702
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:15,957
Scalpel.

703
00:36:19,962 --> 00:36:23,029
Have respiratory
on page, please.

704
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,118
Oh, good. Her
pressure's crashing.

705
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,421
- We need a central line now.
- I can see that.

706
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,973
Go on.

707
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:35,825
Do it.

708
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,454
- Conrad, seriously...
- You heard me.

709
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:38,840
She's right. You
should do it, not me.

710
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:39,996
Then why are you here?

711
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:42,498
Premed, med school, MCATs.

712
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,934
Was that just for fun?

713
00:36:44,987 --> 00:36:48,605
Come on. Be a doctor,
or go be something else.

714
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,387
Her stats are slipping.

715
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:55,478
Pressure's 70/38
and dropping fast.

716
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,351
Okay.

717
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,004
Keep going.

718
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:22,639
So far, you haven't killed her.

719
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:27,643
Start at five micrograms.

720
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,379
Titrate up as needed.

721
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,663
Don't look at him.

722
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:32,148
I'm right, and you know it.

723
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,567
What next?

724
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:36,368
When her pressure levels out,

725
00:37:36,437 --> 00:37:40,472
wean her off the norepi
and then drown her in fluids.

726
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:44,777
Congratulations. We
just busted your cherry.

727
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:00,297
We are moments away

728
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:02,306
from the maiden
voyage of our new Titian.

729
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,697
And after having spent
considerable time working

730
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:06,565
with it, I can definitively say

731
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:10,687
this is a miraculous machine.

732
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:12,333
And we expect it to
be particularly useful

733
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:13,622
for radical prostatectomies,

734
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,674
which is what we're doing today.

735
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,962
Tell me this isn't happening.

736
00:38:36,031 --> 00:38:37,111
Oh, this is happening.

737
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:39,198
The man is insane.

738
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:41,917
Only upside is this
should be a career-ender.

739
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:46,639
I can't watch.

740
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:47,941
I can't look away.

741
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,526
The prostate has to
be carefully peeled

742
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,529
off the bladder.

743
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:55,097
The risk of rupture
and bleeding is high

744
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,933
in unskilled hands.

745
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,022
How is this possible?

746
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,263
As you can see, the robotic

747
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,683
instruments are smaller
than your fingernails.

748
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:15,668
But that blade

749
00:39:15,737 --> 00:39:19,105
is sharper than a #11.

750
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,107
This represents

751
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:26,162
the union of human ingenuity
and cutting-edge technology.

752
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,882
Man and machine are melded,

753
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,952
working as one.

754
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:59,728
Where's Chloe's family?

755
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,298
They just left
for the first time.

756
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:07,202
The mom was sleeping in
there in case she woke up.

757
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:16,195
You're done.

758
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:19,031
You can go home.

759
00:40:29,211 --> 00:40:31,160
Hey!

760
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,281
I want to show you something.

761
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,755
Annabeth. Five. She had cancer.

762
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:45,324
I was a first
year, just like you.

763
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:48,410
I gave her too much potassium.

764
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,313
She died.

765
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,382
From me, not the cancer.

766
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,737
If it were easy, everyone
would be a doctor,

767
00:40:57,805 --> 00:40:59,783
because this is the
best job in the world.

768
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:02,742
Despite everything.

769
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,444
Because of everything.

770
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,436
