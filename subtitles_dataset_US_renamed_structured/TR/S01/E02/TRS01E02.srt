3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:06,566

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,251
<i>It just means you have
more to unlearn than the guys</i>

5
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:11,226
<i>- who weren't paying attention.</i>
- I need a new resident.

6
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:14,312
- Mine's impossible.
- You got Conrad.

7
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:16,648
- Watch and learn.
- Start compressions.

8
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:20,535
I will do whatever it
takes to get you back.

00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,152

10
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:26,869
Lily means a lot to all of us.

11
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,173
From now on, she's your patient.

12
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,261
What are my odds?

13
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,674
The next few
months will be rough.

14
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:31,997
But you can beat this.

15
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,793
All we want to do
is help our patients,

16
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:36,234
but what they don't
teach us in medical school

17
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,714
<i>is there are so many
ways to do harm.</i>

18
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,988
You got the best
hands in the business.

19
00:00:40,056 --> 00:00:42,034
<i>But he's still the most
requested surgeon.</i>

20
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:43,492
Did you hit an artery?

21
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,005
On an appendectomy?

22
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:46,611
Maybe he had a heart attack.

23
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,174
- That's exactly right.
- You need to consider a change

24
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:51,649
- before you kill any more patients.
- How dare you.

25
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,696
<i>Is your pride really worth
more than the life of a patient?</i>

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,880
You watch yourself, Conrad.

27
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:00,992
Career day. Exciting, right?

28
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,906
Time for you guys to
think about your future.

29
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,073
And I want you to aim high.

30
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,992
For example, you
could be a doctor like...

31
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:08,300
Dr. Hawkins here,

32
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,913
who diagnosed my
heart condition early.

33
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,970
And, God willing, he's gonna be

34
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:13,099
the man that
saved my life. So...

35
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,773
let's give him a warm welcome.

36
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,004
Okay, one more
time or we're gonna

37
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:20,178
do a pop quiz on
the periodic table.

38
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:23,949
All right. You guys
are wound up now.

39
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,034
They're all yours. Good luck.

40
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:27,502
Wow.

41
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,954
When I was about your age,

42
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,371
I was driving with my dad.

43
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,657
Guy on a moped
swerved in front of us,

44
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,253
right into the path
of an oncoming car.

45
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,044
Wham. The impact

46
00:01:36,113 --> 00:01:37,924
threw this guy's body
onto the pavement.

47
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:39,831
He must have slid 50 feet.

48
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:42,017
And my dad, he just sat there,

49
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:44,052
pissed at being held up.

50
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,322
But a woman in the car
behind us jumped out,

51
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:51,059
and she worked on that kid
until the ambulance came.

52
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:53,088
This incredible
woman had the ability

53
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:54,907
to save a life
right in front of me,

54
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,331
and I knew, in that moment,

55
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,966
that I wanted to be a person

56
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,752
who could jump out of
the car to help people.

57
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:04,756
So that's what I do.

58
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,025
So, has anyone thought
about becoming a doctor?

59
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,140
I've thought about
becoming a millionaire.

60
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,364
That's not a career path.

61
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:16,919
So, do you cut people
open and take them apart?

62
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:18,148
That's...

63
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,821
a surgeon, Treena.

64
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,779
I'm an internist.

65
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,248

figure out what's wrong.

- Yeah...

72

fast. I got to slow it

into your heart.

00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:19,616
Peterson's gonna
run a bedside echo,

180
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,838
and we'll know more soon.

181
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,423
Mitch's wounds are superficial.

182
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:23,775
Hey, how you doing? Dr. Hawkins.

183
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,288
- Hi, Doctor.
- Nice to meet you. Brody, how we feeling?

184
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,411
I'm just gonna lift up

185
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,707
your shirt here,
check things out.

186
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:29,213
This is a PR disaster.

187
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,732
We take a congressman
and our lobbyist out hunting,

188
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,368
and they both end up in our ER.

189
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:35,347
Well, we can still
change the narrative

190
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,405
if we can save 'em.

191
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:44,245
Did you hear what happened?

192
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,641
Yeah. Remind me not
to go hunting with you.

193
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,433
Dr. Hunter, so
pleased to meet you.

194
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,434
I'm Dr. Devon Pravesh,

195
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,086
and I just read your paper

196
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,233
on aggressive treatment
of stage IV bladder cancer.

197
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:55,468
- Are you done sucking up yet?
- Nope. A five-year survival

198
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:57,876
was higher with
platinum-based therapy.

199
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,427
It's incredible.

200
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:00,907
Oh, man. My new intern.

201
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:02,708
- He's a real gunner.
- Cancer is fascinating to me.

202
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,810
And you are the top
oncologist in Georgia,

203
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,812
so... maybe if you have
some time someday...

204
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,386
Absolutely. I'd love to help.

205
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,255
Sucking up works for me.

206
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,291
I think Dr. Feldman could
use some help in Trauma Two.

207
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,295
It was good to meet you.

208
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,897
Roughly 200 bird shot

209
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,477
evenly distributed
across the buttocks.

210
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,781
He's sedated and prepped for you

211
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,915
to start removing the
pellets, Dr. Okafor.

212
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,369
These are superficial wounds.

213
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,358
You don't need a surgeon.
Any fool could do this.

214
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,931
Got to go.

215
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,466
The OR just paged me.

216
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,172
Dr. Pravesh.

217
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,085
Just the man.
Divide and conquer.

218
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,325
You take the right
cheek, I'll take the left.

219
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,872
<i>Conrad.</i>

220
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,541
Micah's heart's arriving
earlier than expected.

221
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,375
- The medevac's five minutes out.
- Don't leave.

222
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,184
I need you.

223
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:57,329
Sorry. Got a situation here.

224
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:59,386
Devon, come with me.

225
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,205
Seriously? Seriously?

226
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,353
I've got a case that's
gonna take my full attention.

227
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,844
I know you'll be crushed
to hear you're on your own.

228
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,495
It's Independence Day.

229
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:08,963
What's Independence Day?

230
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:11,950
Your first day as a
doctor without my help.

231
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,301
Start by handling sign out.

232
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,580
Doctors at the
end of their shifts

233
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:16,349
must debrief you
on all their patients.

234
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:17,883
You write down every
single word since you know

235
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,569
absolutely nothing
about these cases.

236
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,470
You'll be covering
20 patients solo.

237
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,205
- No backup.
- Poor bastard.

238
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,546
What do you mean, "no backup"?

239
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:25,846
You'll have Nic. Page me

240
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,544
if there's a serious
problem, but remember,

241
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,201
that's a sign of weakness.
Don't let him kill anyone.

242
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,220
I'll do my best.

243
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:36,991
How many surgical
residents did you beat out

244
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,805
to scrub in on a
heart transplant?

245
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,528
All of them.

246
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:42,346
You excited?

247
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,332
Don't I look it?

248
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,000
No.

249
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:48,203
I am excited. For Micah.

250
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,920
I want him fixed.

251
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,207
Me too.

252
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,531
Oh, my God.

253
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,400
Um... uh, my name
is Dr. Devon Pravesh,

254
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,335
and I'm handling sign out today.

255
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,499
- -Dr. Pravesh.
- I've never done this before,

256
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,456
so please, uh, speak slowly,

257
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,124
uh, one at a time,

258
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,792
and-and be-be patient.

259
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,039
First patient is Leona
Bates, 62-year-old female,

260
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:15,858
status is post
appendectomy in 1991.

261
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,410
- This is her EKG from admission.
- All right.

262
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,545
- Slow down, slow down.
- And then from ten minutes later,

263
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:21,430
- and then from an hour after that.
- Okay, okay.

264
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,404
Uh...

265
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,057
- All right, go ahead.
- 39-year-old male with a history

266
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,470
of diabetes
mellitus, pancreatitis

267
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,138
due to increased
triglycerides presented

268
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,107
with abnormal LFTs and a
heterogeneous liver mass.

269
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,412
Lucinda Cooley's blood
glucose level is in the 50s.

270
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,677
She was getting
way too much insulin

271
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,312
because the nurse was telling me

272
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,664
- that she'd been hypoglycemic...
- Due to acute illness.

273
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,450
Which super pisses me
off. That's Nurse Raymond.

274
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,594
Watch out for him,
okay? He's a total dick.

275
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:43,774
All right.

276
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,455
Olivia Coffin,
76-year-old female.

277
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,479
She's a mess.

278
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,341
- Also a whiner.
- And a talker.

279
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:49,876
On the pain-in-the-ass scale,

280
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,260
- she's ten. -Probably about a ten.
- Super complicated...

281
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,654
Micah Stevens' heart, Doc.

282
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:13,454
Hey.

283
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,440
Mitch.

284
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,674
I-Is Mitch all right?

285
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,893
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

286
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:20,939
We have the results of
the cardiac catheterization.

287
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,280
There's good news and bad news.

288
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,727
You had a very
serious heart attack,

289
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,829
and the only reason
you're still with us at all

290
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,920
is because you
were with these two.

291
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,688
What's the good news?

292
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,106
That<i> is</i> the good news.

293
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,775
The bad news is, your
heart was badly damaged.

294
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:37,478
The ejection fraction
is severely reduced.

295
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,941
What that means, Trip,

296
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,699
is... you're gonna
need a transplant.

297
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,133
Oh, good Lord.

298
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,936
We'll contact UNOS immediately.

299
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,604
You'll be status 1A.

300
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,006
So that'll put you at the
top of the organ donor list.

301
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,521
- You'll be top priority for a new heart.
- Well, how long is it

302
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,489
- gonna take to find one?
- Well, unfortunately,

303
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,725
finding the right match can
take weeks, sometimes months.

304
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:59,700
Well, maybe.

305
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:02,152
We do have a new heart
at Chastain. It just flew in.

306
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,749
- That organ is already allocated.
- Well, let's

307
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:05,506
just wait, see if it's a match.

308
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,059
And if it is, we
will un-allocate it.

309
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,003
Right?

310
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,510
Ready?

311
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,495
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

312
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:29,730
Gonna get you
back to your class.

313
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,867
- Got to teach those students, right? They need you.
- Yeah.

314
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:35,419
Yeah? Okay.

315
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,782
- Let's do this.
- Sorry, Micah. I need Dr. Hawkins

316
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,566
- for just a moment.
- Okay.

317
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,476
Is everything all right?

318
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,884
- Micah's surgery was canceled.
- Why?

319
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:53,537
His heart was reallocated
to Congressman Dunlap.

320
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,673
They can't do that.

321
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,559
Yes, they can. The hospital
went through proper channels.

322
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:00,806
- They got the okay from UNOS.
- You mean they pulled strings.

323
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,759
Look, I'm pissed, too, but
they didn't break any rules.

324
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,699
Dunlap has higher priority
than Micah because he's sicker.

325
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:07,218
There's nothing you can do.

326
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,737
Says who?

327
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,029
I called Dunlap's wife.
Turns out they're separated.

328
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,799
The daughter's coming.
Flying in from California.

329
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,768
Divorce blowback. You
get sick, you're all alone.

330
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,670
Yeah, could happen to us, too.

331
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,698
How many exes have
we got between us?

332
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,107
Four, last time I counted.

333
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,486
Unless, of course,
you've been busy.

334
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,143
No. No.

335
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,856
But I still haven't
given up hope.

336
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,114
Me, I'm off the romance
track permanently.

337
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,761
From here on in, I'm
married to my work.

338
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,419
Never say never.

339
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,037
There's Conrad.

340
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:45,101
He's the resident in
charge of Micah's care.

341
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,574
Don't I know it.

342
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,326
Go easy on him.

343
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,780
Dr. Hawkins, I know
you're upset. I would be, too.

344
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,826
This is against all
protocol, and you know it.

345
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,728
Micah's waited two
years for a heart.

346
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,830
You can't just cut in line
for a VIP who hasn't waited

347
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:00,650
- two minutes.
- Well, they-they both need a heart.

348
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,685
There was only one.
It was a tough decision.

349
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,887
My patient is 28, with his
whole life ahead of him.

350
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,755
That heart could give
him 50 more years.

351
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,979
Trip Dunlap is 63 and a smoker.

352
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,649
His body's far more
likely to reject the heart.

353
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,085
And even if the transplant
takes, what does it buy him,

354
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,282
- ten more years?
- Look, Dunlap is critical. I mean,

355
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:18,956
he could die tonight. And
Micah, he's waited this long.

356
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,609
- He can safely wait a bit longer.
- His quality of life

357
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:24,528
is zero. He was an athlete.
He's a science teacher.

358
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,658
Loved by his students.
I know him. We all do,

359
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:28,761
because he's been in
and out of here so often.

360
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,479
Three times we
thought we had a heart.

361
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,970
Three times he was sent home.

362
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,998
Zero complaining
or self-pity, ever.

363
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:35,623
This guy, he's golden.

364
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:36,835
You want to tell
Dunlap's daughter

365
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:38,442
her father is less deserving?

366
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:40,640
Why? Because he's a VIP
who can help out Chastain.

367
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:43,798
You really speak your mind.
It's just, it's a juvenile habit.

368
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:46,601
The decision was made
for medical reasons alone.

369
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:49,470
- I think we both know that's not the truth.
- I'm gonna

370
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,567
cut you some slack
because you're upset.

371
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,023
Chief of surgery,

372
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,843
resident.

373
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:57,728
Try to remember that.

374
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,545
All good news, Mr. Ramirez.
Your EKG looks normal,

375
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,704
- and you should be out of here tomorrow.
- Thank you.

376
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:10,140
You forgot to listen
to his heart, Doctor.

377
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,944
I don't need to listen to his
heart. I looked at his EKG.

378
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,563
Why didn't the murmur
show up on his EKG?

379
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,932
Occasionally, you can
get a normal reading

380
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,900
in patients with
significant heart disease.

381
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,068
Always use your stethoscope.

382
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,737
If you don't, Conrad
will ream you.

383
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,228
- Do you have to tell him?
- No, because I know you're never

384
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,713
gonna skip listening to
a patient's heart again.

385
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:35,265
Devon, I want you to call
the OPO every 15 minutes.

386
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,979
- We need to find another heart.
- Can you get

387
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,964
a physician's assistant to
do it? I'm handling 20 patients.

388
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,266
Most people take a few
hours to fail Independence Day.

389
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,657
You just broke the record.
What has it been, 40 minutes?

390
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,060
- I smell carbs!
- Chad, you have surgery

391
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:47,773
scheduled today to remove
that foot. You can't eat.

392
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:50,364
No pizza. Take it back.

393
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,950
How 'bout chocolate pudding?

394
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,085
Four or five cups
should slay the beast.

395
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,932
You can aspirate
food under anesthesia

396
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,939
and die. Even chocolate pudding.

397
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,784
- I told him that.
- Well, I didn't believe him.

398
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:02,610
Is he a real doctor?

399
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:07,197
Tachycardia 5918.

400
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,733
Doobie's heart rate's spiking.

401
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,903
I want you to call the OPO every
15 minutes. And don't page me

402
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,966
about a patient unless it's
an emergency. It's a sign

403
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,625
- of weakness.
- It's a sign of weakness.

404
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,657
What's going on, Doobie?

405
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,781
Nothing.

406
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,735
His heart rate's falling.

407
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:28,936
Are you all right?

408
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,870
<i>Are you ready
for your injection?</i>

409
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,194
<i>I don't care if you are.</i>

410
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,595
<i>You're getting it.</i>

411
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,714
"Naughty Nurses"? Really?

412
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:41,883
When in Rome?

413
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:45,085
You are recovering
from major heart surgery.

414
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:46,737
Get the mittens.

415
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,923
Mittens?

416
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,943
<i>Do you like it?
Do you like that?</i>

417
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,930
<i>- Do you like it? Yeah! Yeah!</i>
- Oh...

418
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,184
Where have you been?
I paged you three times.

419
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,409
I'm already on your cheek.

420
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:11,895
- Nic is really good.
- You just noticed?

421
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:12,975
Why didn't she
want to be a doctor?

422
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,915
Because she's smart.

423
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:17,224
Nurses get to spend time
with patients. We don't.

424
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:21,088
They have a strong union,
earn overtime, make good money.

425
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:22,968
For all of residency, if you
figure the hours we're working,

426
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:24,970
interns and residents
make minimum wage.

427
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:28,929
Well, I still think she'd
make a good doctor.

428
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:31,632
She's working on her
doctorate. Doctor of Nursing.

429
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,653
How long has he been coughing?

430
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:38,973
A while. His heart rate's

431
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,459
- over 100.
- O2 saturation 93.

432
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,863
He's been immobile
for several hours.

433
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,583
I'm hearing some
abnormal breath sounds.

434
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,787
- Pleuritis?
- I think it's a possible pulmonary embolism.

435
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:57,040

That we're sending him
home for a fourth time? Not yet.

442
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,101
Do I have to?

443
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,755
Yeah.

444
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,050

If you mean
Dr. Pravesh, quite well.

447
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:47,007
- Don't change the subject.
- I want to change the subject.

448
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:49,126
Let's talk about anything else.

449
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,921
- It's not your fault.
- It feels like it is.

450
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,341
I come up against
Bell... He's like a wall.

451
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,045
I look for a work-around, a side
door, a window... there's none.

452
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,214
You'll find one.

453
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:13,734
You always do.

454
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,790
God, I love it when
you believe in me.

455
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,160
I never stopped
believing in you.

456
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,985
This the lobbyist who got shot?

457
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:56,910
Yes.

458
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,163
Filling defect in the
right pulmonary artery,

459
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,642
- suggesting...
- Massive lung clot.

460
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,116
Nice catch.

461
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:04,918
Particularly
impressive for an intern.

462
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:06,998
His pressure just dropped.

463
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:09,806
Let's get him out
of there. Mitch?

464
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,242
Hey, Mitch.

465
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,199
Mitch? He's unconscious.

466
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,996
He needs thrombolysis.

467
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:18,181
Activate the
interventional team.

468
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,118
No. His pressure's
70/30. Page surgery.

469
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,215
Why? I can do the thrombolysis
with a local catheter right now.

470
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:25,701
It won't work with this patient.
We have to crack his chest open,

471
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,670
remove the clot, and save
whatever lung can be saved.

472
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,371
That's extreme and way
too big a call for you to make

473
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,094
without backup. Page Conrad.

474
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:35,016
- I'll page him.
- No. I know exactly what to do.

475
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:37,246
We've got IV access.
Let's give him a stat IV direct

476
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,215
thrombin inhibitor. Tell
the OR we're coming.

477
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,056
On my call. One, two, three.
- Two.

478
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:46,271
What's happening?

479
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:48,256
You've got a blood clot
in an artery in your lung.

480
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,209
We're taking you to
emergency surgery.

481
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:52,216
Am I going to die?

482
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,651
No. You're gonna be fine, Mitch.

483
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,300

made the right call.

I did.

490

And they have a heart
that's a match for Micah.

491
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,917
That's great news.

492

Why do you look like

It's Chloe.

00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:49,090
My first medical error.

495
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:51,892
You told me to stop
CPR, and I didn't do it.

496

Rule one: do what
I tell you to do,

497
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,075
- no questions asked.
- Conrad, ease up.

498
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:59,316
She's brain-dead.
Neuro confirmed.

499
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,318
They did a full workup.

500
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:04,304
That's no longer a human
being... That's an organ farm.

501
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:07,123
- What's the problem here?
- Her mom called the OPO about

502
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:10,377
- donating her organs, and then she backed off.
- Why?

503
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:13,314
She can't accept the diagnosis.

504
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:16,334
Is there any chance that
something good can come of this?

505
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,052
Yes, so many people could
receive her other organs, too.

506
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:21,305
If the family can be
made to face the truth.

507
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,324
Want me to speak to them?

508
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:24,324
-No. -No. -No.

509
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:26,304
- Then you speak to them.
- I can't.

510
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:29,129
Not anymore. No
doctor whose patient

511
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,160
could benefit from an organ
donation can make the case

512
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,477
to a family to
withdraw life support.

513
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,735
It's a hard and fast
rule, and a good one.

514
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:37,220
The hospital, on the
other hand, could step in.

515
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:43,310
Ugh.

516
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,130
Before you say anything,
I'm not here to argue.

517
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,165
I have a solution.

518
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,966
You have one minute. Go.

519
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,687
There's a brain-dead patient
in the ICU. Chloe Gellar.

520
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:55,300
Her heart could
save Micah's life,

521
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:57,335
and you are the only
person I can think of

522
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,094
who can convince the
mother to withdraw life support.

523
00:23:00,162 --> 00:23:03,463
So... so your solution
is to have me walk in

524
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,366
and ask a grieving
mother to unplug her child?

525
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:07,801
Her child is gone.

526
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,514
- The answer's no.
- No one is better

527
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:11,138
at communicating than you.

528
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,668
Thanks for the
compliment, but no.

529
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,775
Chloe's organs would
save so many lives.

530
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:17,177
You know, humanitarian
considerations aside,

531
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:19,129
to force a mother's hand

532
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,198
- would risk a lawsuit.
- So Chloe stays

533
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,011
on life support in
our ICU indefinitely?

534
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:26,303
If her family can
handle it financially, yes.

535
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,216
In other words, it's all
about the bottom line.

536
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,157
You would gladly step in

537
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:31,686
if Chastain weren't
making 100 grand a week

538
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,438
on Chloe's
gold-plated insurance.

539
00:23:33,462 --> 00:23:36,113
The whole world is
about the bottom line.

540
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,938
Your white blood cell
count is improving, Lily,

541
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,652
but still a bit lower
than we'd like to see.

542
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,553
I think you need to
stay here a little longer.

543
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:52,145
No, please, Dr. Pravesh.
I just want to go home.

544
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:54,181
Dr. Hunter already
said that I could.

545
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,278
I'm not sure she's seen
your most recent numbers.

546

Your immune system is
still badly compromised, Lily.

547
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,115
You could easily get
another infection and

548
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,251
- end up back in the ER again.
- And that's a huge risk

549
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,408
with leukemia and what
brought you to the ER

550
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,254
- in the first place.
- How we doing in here?

551
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,646
Dr. Hunter, hi!

552
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,431
How you feeling, darling?

553
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,549
Better. Really, so much better.

554
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,018
Well, no fever.

555
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,481
- She did have one this morning.
- Exactly.

556
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:18,350
That's why I'm trying
to get her out of here.

557
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,034
Lily's more likely to
get another infection

558
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,859
here than she would be at home.

559
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:25,546
One in seven patients end up
with a hospital-based infection.

560
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:28,515
People on chemo are most at
risk for everything from the flu

561
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:32,268
- to MRSA.
- That's why I get my chemo at Dr. Hunter's clinic.

562
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,355
Makes sense.

563

care of my patient.

567

- Of course.
- Wow. That's high praise.

568

She doesn't trust
anyone but Conrad.

- That's concerning.
- And it appears when he fell,

he fractured a rib,
lacerated his spleen.

693

- And you

694

medicine again.

695

Bell's still the most

He gets the most
interesting cases,

711
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,258
and he trusts you to
operate beside him.

712

Win-win situation.

Congressman Dunlap,

714
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,896

00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,031
You could
potentially save a life.

00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:25,281
- Exactly.
- Oh, come on.

868
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,267
You know I'm right.

869
00:41:29,437 --> 00:41:32,388
- Uh, incoming.
- In the ER,

870
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:35,274
I caught Mitch's PE,
which Irving missed,

871
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,321
and then I handed off 30
patients to the next shift

872
00:41:37,345 --> 00:41:39,385
with no issues, and
I did the whole thing

873
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,675
without asking you one question.

874
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,032
Mm. Okay, well, are you
looking for an attaboy?

875
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,366
'Cause you won't get one.

876
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:47,119
You should have asked a question

877
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:49,489
before you sent Mitch for
an unnecessary thoracotomy.

878
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:51,435
Did you even see a
thoracotomy in med school?

879
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:53,688
It's when they cut someone
open in the middle of their chest

880
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,189
laterally all the
way to their back,

881
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:56,912
and then they peel back the skin

882
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,476
and literally crack
open their ribs

883
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,932
to get to the pleural cavity.

884
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,029
And poor Mitch could have
had a noninvasive femoral cath

885
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,303
and been home in a few days,

886
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:05,333
but now he's gonna be in
the hospital for at least a week

887
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:08,457
- enduring a hellishly painful recovery.
- Wrong.

888
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,609
You didn't check
Mitch's records. I did.

889
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:13,007
And it turns out he has a
hereditary platelet dysfunction,

890
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,580
which means a femoral cath

891
00:42:14,649 --> 00:42:16,193
would have caused
him massive bleeding,

892
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:17,667
and he would have died.

893
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:19,385
So I made a fast call,

894
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,304
and it was the right call,

895
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,389
that may have saved his life.

896
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,136
- And you know how I know that?
- Hmm?

897
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,687
He's doing great in
recovery right now.

898
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,356
Look at this guy. He
forgot rule number one.

899
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,479
I didn't forget it.

900
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:31,549
I broke it.

901
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,433
And I will again.

902
00:42:34,502 --> 00:42:36,735
Because you are
not always right.

903
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,304
No one is.

904
00:42:38,373 --> 00:42:40,223
That's why this job

905
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:42,091
is so difficult.

906
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,644
And when you're wrong, I
will be the first one to tell you.

907
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:48,147
And if you don't like that...

908
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:50,115
cut me.

909
00:42:50,184 --> 00:42:52,318
Right now, right here.

910
00:42:52,386 --> 00:42:56,338
I don't care. End my career.

911
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:59,775
Because I am not your slave,
your shadow, or your echo.

912
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:04,046
Devon!

913
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:14,374
Congratulations, you just
passed Independence Day.

914
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,832
