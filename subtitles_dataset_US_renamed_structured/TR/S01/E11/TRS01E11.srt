00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,325
- it was the misdosed sevo.
- That's never gonna fly.

00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:11,989

Wow.

21
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,114
Hey.

22
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,299
Mina told me to find you.

23
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,785
Dr. Bell just started the
lipoma excision on your patient.

24
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:56,054
- Turner was scheduled for that.
- Yeah.

25
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,283
He's out sick. Stomach flu.

26
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,640
Wait, that's TJ's surgery.

27
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,287
Doesn't he have
a latex sensitivity?

28
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,322
You're right. I need to
check on him, and Bell.

29
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:05,047
Hey.

30
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:06,209
Go easy on your ankle today.

00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,799

the new hospital promo?

38
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:22,030

00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,330
Just have to close up.

45
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,420
Some bleeding posteriorly.

46
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,905
Yeah, I got it.

Shut off the oxygen.
Look, I got to keep sterile

52
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,054
so I can close the
patient. Get the O2 off!

53
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,660
- Get that O2 mask off.
- Rip the drapes down.

54
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,262
More oxygen might
be hiding beneath them.

55

Lily's family is suing the
hospital for wrongful death.

And you're named in the suit.

- No.

72
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,513
However, risk management
has to do their investigation,

73
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,671
and until its over, we have to
ask you to stop seeing patients.

74
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,058
Has Lily's autopsy come back?

75
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,794

Ms. Thorpe.

77
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:36,593
There's been an
emergency in the OR.

78
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,200
A patient caught fire.

79
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,171
You've done enough
damage, I've got it from here.

80
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,251
I'm his surgeon, you're an
internist. What are you even

81
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:46,736
- doing on the OR floor?
- He had a latex allergy.

82
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,371
I was double-checking
nothing was missed.

83
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,762
- The proper precautions were taken.
- What happened?

84
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,858
Your chief of surgery
just set a patient on fire.

85
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:54,377
Look, I've just had
it. I've had it with you!

86
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,046
- Challenging me at every corner.
- Not now. Dr. Hawkins,

87
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,950
go to the ICU; Dr. Bell, a word.

88
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,506
What the hell happened in there?

89
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,708
Well, it's unclear,
but it wasn't my fault.

90
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:07,429
Oh, just like Mr. Zhou's post-op
bleeding wasn't your fault?

91
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,564
I don't know what
you think you know.

92
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,678
You know what I know? Is
that I have recording devices

93
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:13,546
in every OR, so I'm
gonna find out exactly

94
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,653
what caused that fire.

95
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,498
Are you okay?

96
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,983
Yeah, the surgery
went perfectly.

97
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:31,553
I... the resection was done.

98
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:35,790
And I-I was, I was
closing, and then...

99
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,792
You're not to blame.

100
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,362
I mean, doctors are only as
good as our support staff...

101
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,231
I use a cautery
in every surgery.

102
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:46,234
This has never happened before.

103
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:48,098
Don't worry, the
truth will come out.

104
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,605
The truth... it's relative.
It-it looks like my fault.

105
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:53,208
Worst case, the hospital
settles with the patient.

106
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,345
That's a... like,
another lawsuit.

107
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:58,414
Randolph.

108
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:01,849
The board reveres you.

109
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,220
You will survive this.

110
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:08,056
We will survive this.

111
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:11,309
Together.

112
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,445
I'm on your side.

113
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,347
Never forget that.

114
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,894
And finally, all charting
must be done immediately

115
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,096
after you see the patient.

116
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,677
I've worked in the
ER before, Irving.

117
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,568
This is your intern
year rotation in the ER.

118
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,815
Today, you're one of us.
Let's start with something

119
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,850
closer to home for an internist.
A nice mystery diagnosis,

120
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,741
Sherlock.

121
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,580
Hi, Olivia Tan?

122
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:50,265
I'm Dr. Devon Pravesh.

123
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:51,666
What brings you in today?

124
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:53,679
I was gargling with
mouthwash this morning,

125
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,514
and I accidentally
swallowed some.

126
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,255
So I called poison control,

127
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:59,119
and they told me it was
nothing to worry about,

128
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:02,277
but I think they were just
trying to get me off the phone.

129
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,678
I gargle a lot.

130
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:05,814
It helps with my
bowel movements.

131
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,267
Got to be conjunctivitis.

132
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,418
Or shingles.

133
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:11,786
Melanoma?

134
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,038
I think it's a staph infection.

135
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,657
It's a mosquito bite.

136
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,944
And then, my face blew up
like I had a peanut allergy.

137
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,346
Frickin' avocados, man.

138
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,849
That is how my aunt died...

139
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,951
of leprosy.

140
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:28,669
Right.

141
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:31,222
You're perfectly healthy.

142
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,796
What's your diagnosis, Harvard?

143
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,981
She's a total nutjob.

144
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,499
I'm discharging her.

145
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,201
Without a thorough workup?

146
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,954
I was as thorough
as humanly possible.

147
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:48,740
And I've given her a
definitive diagnosis.

148
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,236
- She's a cyberchondriac.
- Hmm.

149
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,960
She surfs WebMD for symptoms,

150
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:54,362
and she convinces herself
that she has them all.

151
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,597
Not bad, Harvard, not bad.

152
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,199
Now pick one of her complaints

153
00:06:58,268 --> 00:06:59,846
and write her some sort
of placebo prescription

154
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,268
before you discharge her.

155
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,705
Why would I do that?
She's perfectly healthy.

156
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,034
To make sure she
walks out of here

157
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,352
feeling better than
when she walked in.

158
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:08,438
And more important, that
she doesn't come back

159
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,394
to the ER tomorrow.

160
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,218
Lily's family's filing a suit.

161
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:18,837
What family?

162
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,566
I never saw them once
the entire time she was here.

163
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,601
Me neither, but risk
management's launching

164
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,487
an investigation, so
they're definitely suing.

165
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,561
I was her internist.

166
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,046
Why haven't I heard about it?

167
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,181
Probably because
they're focusing on me.

168
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,610
This is what they do, find a
lower-level hospital worker

169
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,252
to pin everything on.

170
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,705
Hey.

171
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,529
As soon as the autopsy
results come back,

172
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,899
they'll see that a chemo
overdose caused Lily's death,

173
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,928
and you had nothing
to do with that.

174
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:53,455
Come here, come here, come here.

175
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,039
Is this a formal investigation?

176
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:13,185
I'm trying to get to the
truth of what happened

177
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:15,376
with the fire in Dr. Bell's OR.

178
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:18,563
This is the surveillance
footage from the security camera.

179
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,598
That scalpel there,
it has a spark.

180
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,716
That's a big deal.

181
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,151
It's a cautery tool.

182
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:24,502
They all spark.

183
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,021
Yes, but the spark
hit the surgical drape.

184
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,200
He should have
been more careful.

185
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,407
No, it's not that simple.

186
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,093
He's holding the tool
that caused the fire.

187
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:34,728
Do you see the pure oxygen
pooling from the patient's neck?

188
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,098
No, of course not.
Oxygen is invisible.

189
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,816
Exactly. Neither did Bell.

190
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,253
It's seeping out from
under the patient's mask.

191
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:44,472
And since pure oxygen
is heavier than air,

192
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,503
it falls to the table and
collects like kindling

193
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,209
waiting to ignite.

194
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:52,997
The spark hits it
and bam... Fire.

195
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:56,451
It was an accident.

196
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,515
It sounds like you're
covering up for him.

197
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,483
I'm telling you
what caused the fire.

198
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,140
And it wasn't Dr. Bell.

199
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,459
<i>A surgical fire?</i>

200
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,111
I'm calling in a favor

201
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,992
with the best plastic
surgeon I know, Dr. Rand.

202
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,798
We'll go over our options.

203
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,100
I think I'm cursed.

204
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,002
You aren't cursed.

205
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:17,838
Fires in the OR are
rare, but they do happen.

206
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:22,460
In high school, they
called me "Tumor Boy"

207
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:26,698
because of this huge
mass coming off of my neck.

208
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,751
But surgery was so expensive,
my family couldn't afford it.

209
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:34,288
So when I was old enough,
I went to work coding,

210
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:36,524
like a rat in a cubicle.

211
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:40,228
I saved every penny.

212
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,175
And all I wanted to
do was to look normal.

213
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,498
And-and I wake up...

214
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,568
looking like Freddy Krueger.

215
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:50,054
We'll do everything
possible to make this better.

216
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,189
I promise.

217
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,853
<i>When Lily came to the hospital</i>

218
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:55,954
after her final chemo
dose, she was so sick.

219
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:58,896
Nauseous, vomiting, dehydrated.

220
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,450
And she was scared.

221
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,684
Scared?

222
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:05,487
Why was she scared?

223
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:08,373
Earlier that morning, she'd
undergone a massive chemo blast.

224
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,543
It was causing her body
to fail, and she knew it.

225
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,729
Dr. Hunter has her
own powerful protocols

226
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:16,843
which have had remarkable
success fighting cancer.

227
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,466
And take a toll on patients
in every possible way.

228
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,669
Lily was depressed,

229
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:25,740
and weak, and that was before
Dr. Hunter bombarded her system.

230
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:28,026
She wasn't strong
enough for such high doses.

231
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,678
Are you suggesting that
Dr. Hunter was to blame

232
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:32,680
for Lily's death?

233
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,019
I wish Dr. Hunter hadn't
given her that last treatment.

234
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:40,621
Lily wanted to stop.

235
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,790
She told me herself.

236
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:48,162
Dr. Hunter convinced
her to go through with it,

237
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,564
and Lily paid
the ultimate price.

238
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,966
Nurse Nevin,

239
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:55,937
Lily Kendall didn't die
from a chemo blast.

240
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,175
The autopsy results
are back. They identify

241
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,512
Lily's cause of death as
a potassium overdose.

242
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:09,450
That's not possible.

243
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,097
The bag of potassium
that you hung for Lily

244
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:14,155
the night she
died... killed her.

245
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:23,981
After Dr. Rand has
worked his magic,

246
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,667
the scarring will be minimal.

247
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,974
- Yeah.
- No more Freddy Kreuger for you.

248
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,410
It's amazing what a great
plastic surgeon can do.

249
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,413
How long until I
look almost normal?

250
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:40,927
Several months to
be ready for surgery

251
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,166
and then heal afterwards.

252
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,635
- Man.
- Oh, come on.

253
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,688
I've already waited so long
to be camera ready, dude.

254
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:50,141
Camera ready?

255
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,761
I didn't want to do the
surgery just to look better.

256
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,407
I was gonna quit coding. I
was gonna do my own thing.

257
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:56,831
A NetTube channel.

258
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,166
"ChioffiCoffee with
TJ and Rascal."

259
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:03,121
Rascal is... my dog.

260
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:07,107
Yeah, he's a badass.

261
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,010
Oh, dude, he's a total badass.

262
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,345
We'll do a bunch of cool
stuff together, you know?

263
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:12,863
Like, shred a skateboard.

264
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:15,833
- I've been training him to box.
- But why wait?

265
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,053
Vlog the whole process of
plastic surgery and recovery.

266
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,689
Just be yourself.

267
00:12:21,758 --> 00:12:24,008
People love you.
You're funny as hell.

268
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,294
Would you subscribe to that?

269
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:29,364
Are you kidding me? Absolutely.

270
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,482
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

271
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:33,334
Uh, you have a second?

272
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,753
A potassium overdose?

273
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,700
Lane told me to set the
drip to the slowest setting,

274
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,156
infusing her over eight hours.

275
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,020
Somehow, she got the
entire dose in 30 minutes.

276
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:44,345
Was there something
wrong with the bag?

277
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:47,698
What I do know is that
when I set the flow rate,

278
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,195
I checked it and I rechecked it.

279
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:52,537
You know how thorough I
am. I didn't make a mistake.

280
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,783
And now Lily's family is suing,

281
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,535
so they need a
scapegoat, and I'm it.

282
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,492
- I'll fix this.
- No, stop.

283
00:12:58,562 --> 00:12:59,772
I don't need you
doing anything crazy.

284
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:01,124
It's only gonna
make things worse.

285
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,748
What do you want me to do?

286
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:08,602
Help me find proof.

287
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,974
Where do we start?

288
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,777
Okay, there are seven of
Lane's patients here at Chastain.

289
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:18,178
Run a full blood panel on each.

290
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:20,359
Okay, seven patients?
What are we looking for?

291
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,317
Anything that shows a pattern
of Lane making mistakes.

292
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,370
Kidney function,
potassium levels.

293
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:26,704
Okay, but there's a problem.

294
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:27,956
When the test results come in

295
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,036
on Lane's patients,
they go directly to her.

296
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,659
He's right.

297
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,397
But since I am
in the ER today...

298
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:42,020
I could run the blood work here
like they're for our John Does.

299
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:44,772
That works. You're catching on.

300
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:48,425
One thing. We can't drag
another nurse into this.

301
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,805
They could get
into serious trouble,

302
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,724
so perform the
blood draws yourself.

303
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,065
Okay, okay. Refresh my
memory as to how to draw blood

304
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:55,800
and we're good to go.

305
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,814
Don't look at me. I haven't
drawn blood since med school.

306
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,571
Doctors.

307
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:07,495
Dr. Kays. I'm reviewing every
surgeon's complication rate.

308
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:10,448
Well, my stats are
no cause for concern.

309
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,027
Agreed, but the
same cannot be said

310
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,468
of your surgical
resident, Dr. Okafor.

311
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,304
She's seen more
than her fair share.

312
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,757
Not in my OR.

313
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,259
Ladies.

314
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:25,129
What brings you to our
floor again today, Claire?

315
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,082
Well, she's worried about
Dr. Okafor's complication rate.

316
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,952
Those concerns were previously
brought to the surgical board

317
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,453
and put to rest.

318
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,422
I'm just interested in
Dr. Kays's assessment.

319
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:36,669
Uh, well, initially,
I had doubts,

320
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:38,459
because Mina is arrogant.

321
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,929
Turns out she has a right
to be, because she's brilliant

322
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:44,398
and careful and fearless,

323
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,600
and I wish I had
ten more like her.

324
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:48,135
What're your thoughts?

325
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,671
No, I agree. As I've said
before, I think she's a talent.

326
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,858
High praise, all around.

327
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:02,750
Yeah, that's-that's the
worst the pain's ever been.

328
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,852
It's got to be
another obstruction.

329
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,337
No air-fluid levels,

330
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,573
no dilated loops of
bowel. X-ray's normal.

331
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:09,857
Then why does it hurt so bad?

332
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,921
- Well, it can be either two things...
- Dr. Feldman.

333
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:15,146
Multi-casualty MVC just
arrived and bed eight needs you.

334
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:17,681
I'll give you one shot
of Dilaudid for the pain.

335
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,812
Nurse Hundley will walk you
through dietary recommendations

336
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,036
- and we'll send you on your way.
- Up to surgery.

337
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,738
For a perforated intestine.

338
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,893
Sir, this is free air
under your diaphragm.

339
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,528
Surgery? It's serious?

340
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,598
Dr. Feldman, am I,
am I gonna be okay?

341
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,866
We caught this early.
We'll start antibiotics

342
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,245
and you'll have it
fixed this afternoon

343
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,630
and be recovered
in no time. Hey.

344
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:41,038
Hang in there.

345
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,540
Good catch.

346
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,343
Call a gen surg consult
then jump into the trauma.

347
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,479
Good looking out.

348
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,867
Lesson two, no matter what
other emergency pops up...

349
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:54,018
Don't let you kill
the patient. Got it.

350
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,303
You do catch on quick.

351
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:03,210
May I join you?

352
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,184
So, Claire has been...

353
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:12,053
asking about your error rates.

354
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:13,854
And, of course, I had your back.

355
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:17,291
Oh, like when you blamed me

356
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,104
for the complication
that happened

357
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:20,728
during your multiple surgeries?

358
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,114
Just tell me what you want.

359
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,086
Well, I wouldn't be surprised
if Claire or someone from HR

360
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,921
reaches out to
you about the fire.

361
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,775
She already found me.

362
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,527
And what'd you tell her?

363
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,846
The truth.

364
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:49,256
Yes, Nurse Nevin was in
charge of Lily's care that night,

365
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:53,294
but I can't fathom how a
respected nurse practitioner

366
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,946
could make such
a careless error.

367
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,415
What error, exactly?

368
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:01,602
Well, obviously, when
the bag was hung,

369
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:03,937
the wrong flow rate was set.

370
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:07,425
You're saying that Nurse Nevin
set the flow rate incorrectly?

371
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,871
Well...

372
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,828
it is possible.

373
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,012
But I'm also...

374
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:15,683
W-Wait. What other
explanation is there?

375
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:19,853
At the moment, there isn't one.

376
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,259
What happened?

377
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:30,264
He was fine. His
O2 levels went down.

378
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,094
- He started suffocating.
- Help me.

379
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:33,118
Help.

380
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,282
Here we go. I can
barely bag him.

381
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:39,673
The swelling from the burns
is compressing his trachea.

382
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,287
All right, his sats
are down to 78%.

383
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,406
- He's bradying down.
- Start prepping the neck.

384
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,328
Gonna need to do an escharotomy.

385
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,113
He's gonna code, doctor.

386
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:48,515
Hang on, TJ. Hang on.

387
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,251
We need anesthetic?

388
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,632
Burned flesh has no
sensation. He won't feel anything.

389
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,616
We do need to
worry about infection.

390
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,177
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

391
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:08,268
Come on, come on, come on...

392
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,509
His sats are going up.

393
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,366
Slow, deep breaths.

394
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,035
Deep breaths, TJ.

395
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,767
Do you really think they're
gonna blame Lily's death on you?

396
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:42,036
Not without a fight.

397
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,215
Let's get this over with.

398
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:45,839
All right.

399
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,542
Needle bevel up, 30 degrees.

400
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,877
Ready?

401
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,446
Yep.

402
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:55,216
- Ow.
- Sorry.

403
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,586
Okay, um, you're
angling it a little too high.

404
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,354
Try again. Down a little bit.

405
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:01,672
Lower. Yeah.

406
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,907
Start.

407
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,892
- No.
- Sorry.

408
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,706
Pull the skin
down taut like this.

409
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,615
One more time.

410
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,462
Wow, okay. Um...

411
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,620
I will be drawing the blood.

412
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,890
You're not supposed
to go near the patients.

413
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:21,108
I am done coloring
inside the lines

414
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:22,743
in a system rigged against me.

415
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,335
Come on.

416
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,269
Are you kidding me?

417
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,399
I already gave
blood this morning.

418
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,989
It's frozen, Mr. Guzman.

419
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:39,426
Damn it.

420
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:42,129
It's not fair. You
know my weakness.

421
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:46,266
I'd let you have a gallon of
my blood for one of these.

422
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:47,696
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

423
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:06,186
Next victim.

424
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,156
Ah, I got to take this.

425
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:11,203
Wait for me so I can
stand guard with you.

426
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:12,960
- I got it.
- Nic.

427
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,878
I'm good.

428
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,398
You paged?

429
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,784
Where you been?

430
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,936
Conrad needed
help with something.

431
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:25,406
Oh, yeah. No, you don't get
to run off during your ER shift

432
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:26,841
to help Conrad.

433
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,459
We're not busy right now.

434
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,610
Don't jinx us. Here.

435
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,015
Nothing I've tried has
worked and I hate snot.

436
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,549
Luca, bed one.

437
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:38,185
Let's see what you come up with.

438
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:41,884
Hi, Luca.

439
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,818
- -Oh, hey.
- What's happening?

440
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,177
Uh, she shoved her father's blue
collectable marble up her nose,

441
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,546
like way up her nose.

442
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,815
We're gonna get it out, okay?

443
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:52,766
It's okay.

444
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,602
Shh. It's okay.

445
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,862
You're supposed
to be on desk duty.

446
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:20,928
I know.

447
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,902
Hold on.

448
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,056
Mr. Smith in 5087.

449
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,508
I can't find his vein.

450
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:36,176
Can you stick him for me?

451
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,247
Sure, no problem.

452
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:45,086
You'll be great.

453
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:46,287
Thanks, Doc.

454
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,622
I used a cardiac catheter

455
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,891
to pull the marble
out of her sinus cavity.

456
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,043
Worked like a dream.

457
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,312
You're good, Dr. Pravesh.

458
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,459
Did Conrad tell you to
use the catheter like that?

459
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,532
No, I did it on my own.

460
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:02,470
Not bad for a Harvard grad. Huh?

461
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,931
Hey, Ashley.
When's my interview?

462
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,617
Your interview's been
cancelled, Dr. Hawkins.

463
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,302
Why?

464
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:21,271
I just keep the schedule.

465
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,683
Dr. Hawkins.

466
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,153
What's going on, Alexis?

467
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,462
Why was my interview cancelled?

468
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,789
Lily was my patient,

469
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,241
and I was the last
person to see her alive.

470
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,277
Why won't they let me testify?

471
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:44,795
Dr. Hunter.

472
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,975
She convinced them
that you can't be objective

473
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,927
because you're in a
romantic relationship with Nic.

474
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,335
Conrad, Lane totally
threw her under the bus.

475
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,304
And they believed her.

476
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,640
Now, everyone's afraid
if they stand up for Nic,

477
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,175
they'll get fired.

478
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,111
All right.

479
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,478
Thank you, Alexis.

480
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,631
I promise I didn't
hear this from you.

481
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,484
- Dr. Hawkins, what are you doing here?
- Your best nurse

482
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,353
is getting screwed over.
That's not a risk management

483
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:16,297
investigation,
it's a witch hunt.

484
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:18,023
- Okay, Conrad. That's enough.
- Do you know why Lane

485
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:20,447
barred Nic from treating
Lily those last few weeks?

486
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:22,378
'Cause Nurse Nevin was
making some mistakes.

487
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,034
No, she doesn't make mistakes.

488
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,969
She catches them.

489
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:28,384
That's why she was the first one
to see what Lane has been doing.

490
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,258
What do you think
Lane has been doing?

491
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,261
Overdosing patients with chemo,
discharging patients too soon,

492
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,640
- hiding patients' records...
- Okay, this is ridiculous.

493
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,209
You want me to
believe this about one

494
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,500
of our most respected
doctors at Chastain?

495
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:43,520
Yes. That's exactly what
I'm asking you to believe.

496
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,507
And I can't stop thinking if I
would've listened to Nic sooner,

497
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:48,425
maybe Lily would still be alive.

498
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:51,211
Lane's protocols
did not kill Lily.

499
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,763
A potassium overdose did.

500
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,983
And Lane is trying to
pin that overdose on Nic.

501
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:59,553
Dr. Hunter put Nic back on
Lily's case the day Lily died.

502
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:03,823
Come on. Clearly, something
is going on here, Ms. Thorpe.

503
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:06,071
Lane is up to something,
and if we don't do anything...

504
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:09,329
Okay, Lane is devastated
about Lily's death.

505
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:10,808
And I am not sure
what you're insinuating,

506
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:12,428
but she was nowhere
near Chastain

507
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,418
the night that Lily died.

508
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,770
Lane was out to
dinner with Dr. Bell.

509
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:19,406
Perfect. The Hands of Death
and Destruction is her alibi?

510
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:22,693
Keep your absurd
allegations to yourself.

511
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:25,412
If you don't open your eyes
to the truth, hold on tight,

512
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:26,592
because this entire hospital

513
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:29,466
will come crashing
down on all of us.

514
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:37,024
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to ChioffiCoffee.

515
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:38,970
Have you ever felt like
you might be cursed?

516
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:41,595
Well, wait till you see my day.

No, it's already gone

Okay, so what do you recommend?

550
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:47,505
We need to give them
something else, something good.

551
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:48,928
A human interest story,

552
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:53,350
maybe a kid from
a... war-torn country.

553
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:55,602
Build him a face, or hands,

554
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:57,482
- a limb. Something.
- All right.

555
00:25:57,506 --> 00:25:59,939

Yeah?

561
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,217
You're a star.

562
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:11,568
And you are a genius.

563
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,531
No, I had nothing to
do with you hacking

564
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,656
into the surgical
learning database.

565
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:16,856
The hell you didn't.

566
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:19,109
Chastain could use
a security update.

567
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,694
And I could help you with that,

568
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,497
but I'm... I'm gonna be too busy

569
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,899
finally living my dream.

570
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:28,369
Thanks, man. You
changed my life.

571
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:30,870
No more coding in
a cubicle for this guy.

572
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,225
Can't wait to watch
your NetTube channel.

573
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,266
Hey. I...

574
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,069
I thought Dr. Kays was
doing this hernia repair.

575
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,605
She is, I'm just...

576
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:52,142
I'm just here to see how you're
holding up after this morning.

577
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,161
Claire's making the rounds.

578
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:56,480
I haven't talked to anyone.

579
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,576
I mean, OR fires are caused
by the anesthesia team.

580
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,979
And I think, before an inaccurate
narrative takes a hold, well,

581
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:03,570
we got to figure out
what the hell happened.

582
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,939
What do you need from me?

583
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:11,189
Hey.

584
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,880
Got all the blood work back.

585
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,565
Anything unusual?

586
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,585
All of Lane's patients are as
healthy as can be expected.

587
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,954
Damn it.

588
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:23,001
Well, at least the
patients are safe.

589
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:24,808
For now.

590
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:34,318
I'm being called back
in for more questions.

591
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:35,580
You want me to come with you?

592
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:36,936
After your sit-down with Claire,

593
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:39,406
- you should probably hang back.
- Nic.

594
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,925
Are you sorry I did it?

595
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:45,178
No.

596
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:53,286
So we have no record
of the rate at which

597
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,805
Lily received the potassium,

598
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:58,541
or if you did in
fact, as you claim,

599
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,195
set the flow machine
at the prescribed rate.

600
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,914
If I made an error, I
would admit it, but I didn't.

601
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:05,911
Then how do you account for
the lethal levels of potassium

602
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,218
in Lily's system?

603
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,438
Someone must have changed
the flow rate after I set it.

604
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,157
So your defense is, is that
some mysterious person came

605
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:18,011
into Lily's room after you left,
and accelerated the flow rate,

606
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,246
administering a lethal
dose of potassium?

607
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:23,350
Why would someone do that?

608
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,821
To kill Lily.

609
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,008
Um...

610
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:34,278
Who would kill a patient
who, by all accounts,

611
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,329
is beloved by the entire staff?

612
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:42,835
I could guess, but I
don't have any proof,

613
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:44,171
so I'm not going to do that.

614
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:46,507
Well, if you have
something to tell us,

615
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,752
it would be in your
best interest to do it now.

616
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:54,247
My best interest?

617
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:58,852
None of this is in my
best interest, or Lily's.

618
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:00,870
We want to know the truth.

619
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,623
- The family wants to know the truth.
- No, you don't.

620
00:29:03,692 --> 00:29:07,494
And Lily's family wasn't
here taking care of her.

621
00:29:07,563 --> 00:29:11,298
Not once over the two
years that she was in and out.

622
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:14,334
I comforted her.

623
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:16,336
Talked to her about death.

624
00:29:16,405 --> 00:29:18,305
Bathed her, fed her.

625
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:20,958
I cared for her.

626
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,677
Not because I liked her,

627
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,696
which I did,

628
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:30,400
and not because she was
one of my favorite patients,

629
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:33,586
which she was.

630
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:38,358
I cared for Lily the same way
I care for all of my patients.

631
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:40,894
'Cause that is what nurses do.

632
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,180
Now, doctors order
tests, they prescribe meds,

633
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,416
and they go home, but nurses...

634
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,232
You know, doctors think
the patients are theirs,

635
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,388
but they're not.

636
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:57,578
They're ours.

637
00:29:57,646 --> 00:29:59,997
The nurses'.

638
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:03,800
Lily Kendall was my patient,

639
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:07,653
and I did not harm her.

640
00:30:09,758 --> 00:30:11,524
But someone else did.

641
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:19,266
I think we're done here.

642
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,189
Yeah.

643
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:33,425
Ha-ha, Roman. Glad
you're feeling better, man.

644
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:34,593
Okay.

645
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:37,751
You're on a roll.

646
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,920
But this next one's tricky.

647
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:41,622
Try Mr. Langdon out for size.

648
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,756
Bay two.

649
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:43,924
On his first day?

650
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:45,108
That's not fair.

651
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,377
Oh, whatever it is, I got it.

652
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,813
- Double or nothing?
- You're on.

653
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,982
Hello, Mr. Langdon.

654
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,617
What seems to be the problem?

655
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,252
Snakes.

656
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,638
I got snakes in my throat.

657
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,535
They're crawling,
like, all down here.

658
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,003
I can feel it moving,
like, right now.

659
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,288
Well, let's take a look at them.

660
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:05,295
W-Will it hurt?

661
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,864
Not a bit.

662
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,067
Okay, Mr. Langdon.

663
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,752
Open wide and say "ah."

664
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:14,804
Ah...

665
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,280
Nurse Hundley.

666
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,832
Let's get ready for the...

667
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,450
the...

668
00:31:27,503 --> 00:31:29,186
the snake extraction.

669
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:31,321
- Okay.
- All right?

670
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,706
Magill forceps.

671
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,176
- Y-You almost got it?
- Shh...

672
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,123
- We don't want to scare her.
- Uh-huh.

673
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:42,199
Almost... there.

674
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,650
Oh, yeah.

675
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,002
Here we go.

676
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,456
One female, beige snake.

677
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:51,958
- Uh, hard to believe that was in my throat, huh?
- It is.

678
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:53,776
Specimen jar!

679
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,669
How you doing, Mr. Langdon?

680
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:04,120
So much better.

681
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:06,323
Oh.

682
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,441
Thank you, Doctor.

683
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:12,930
Oh, you are very welcome.

684
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,885
Okay.

685
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:23,222
While I was giving my
testimony, I suddenly realized...

686
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,709
Lane did this intentionally.

687
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:28,678
She overdosed
Lily intentionally?

688
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:29,958
- Did you say that to them?
- No.

689
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:33,516
But I know it's true.
Who else had the motive?

690
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:35,647
I mean, think about it.
Dr. Osder probably called her

691
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,821
that afternoon for Lily's files.

692
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,451
There must be
something in Lily's files

693
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:41,118
that Lane didn't
want anyone to see,

694
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:42,721
so she made sure that
Osder couldn't get it.

695
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:44,940
Didn't she tell you she
was leaving for the night?

696
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:47,097
She made a point of telling me

697
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,447
that she was leaving when
she ordered the potassium.

698
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:53,252
I think she pretended to leave

699
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:55,481
and then doubled back
to adjust the flow rate.

700
00:32:56,992 --> 00:32:58,903
Then it's completely
untraceable,

701
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:01,327
and it looks like you set it
wrong from the beginning.

702
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:06,183
But you believe me, right?

703
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:09,435
Of course I believe you.

704
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,266
Dr. Okafor, have you ever heard

705
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,552
Dr. Hawkins call Dr. Bell

706
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:29,322
the "Hands of Death and
Destruction," or HODAD?

707
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,808
Yes. I have.

708
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,127
Why? I need to know.

709
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,123
You are asking me
to be a whistle-blower.

710
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:39,082
I need someone to
tell me what's going on.

711
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:41,668
Whistle-blowers get
fired. Not just at Chastain.

712
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:43,014
At the best hospitals
in the country,

713
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:44,421
it happens again and again.

714
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:47,307
I love surgery
more than anything.

715
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:50,243
I have given up everything
to be here in America,

716
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:53,412
practicing, and I want to stay.

717
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:55,816
I will do everything
I can to protect you.

718
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,968
If you go after Bell,
you are at risk as well.

719
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,838
He'll stop at nothing
to destroy you.

720
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,357
I am the CEO.

721
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:07,143
His future is in my hands,
not the other way around.

722
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,663
And this is not only about Bell.

723
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:14,050
It's about saving
patients' lives.

724
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,370
You are a great doctor.

725
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:21,190
And if great doctors
don't speak up...

726
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,660
nothing changes.

727
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:35,388
I'll tell you the truth, but
only within these walls.

728
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:37,301
If you reference
this conversation,

729
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,541
I'll deny it ever happened.

730
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,343
Understood.

731
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,862
You have my word.

732
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,816
Let's start at the beginning,

733
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:48,935
when he killed a patient
during an appendectomy.

734
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,244
- Well done.
- Hey, next video, you got to be in it.

735
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,059
- How's he doing?
- He's doing great, actually.

736
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,194
NetTube just offered
him a partnership.

737
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,663
Looks like his curse is broken.

738
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,816
The board called an emergency
meeting to discuss Bell.

739
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:07,220
That fire he didn't even
start might end his career.

740
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:08,654
Isn't there a word for that?

741
00:35:08,723 --> 00:35:11,191
Irony?

742
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,177
I was going for justice,
but yours works, too.

743
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:17,514
The fire today is only
the last in a string of errors

744
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:19,198
caused by Dr. Bell.

745
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:21,427
Most of which have been
so cleverly covered up,

746
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:24,503
I have no evidence to present.

747
00:35:24,573 --> 00:35:27,073
You're making very
serious accusations.

748
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,342
And they're all hearsay?

749
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:31,773
The staff that have come
forward wish to remain anonymous

750
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,096
for fear of reprisal.

751
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:35,347
Disgruntled staff?
That's your evidence.

752
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,495
Autopsies are rarely
performed these days,

753
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:39,831
so there is nothing to prevent
surgeons from disguising errors

754
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:42,339
by listing "complications"
as the cause of death.

755
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,924
The truth remains in the OR,

756
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:48,144
unless somebody insists
on transparency, and I do.

757
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,046
Which is why I installed

758
00:35:50,098 --> 00:35:52,131
recording devices
in all the ORs.

759
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:56,119
And this is what we see.

760
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,137
<i>Get that O2 mask off.</i>

761
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,093
<i>Rip the drapes down.</i>

762
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:07,163
<i>More oxygen might
be hiding beneath them.</i>

763
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,740
This video is damning, Randolph.

764
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:19,959
Well, it's not, when
you understand

765
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:21,108
what you're looking at.

766
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,251
See this machine right here?

767
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:33,306
Sitting beside it
is Dr. Paul Chu,

768
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:35,336
chief anesthesiologist
here at Chastain.

769
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,543
Dr. Chu?

770
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,032
Dr. Chu, can you explain
the cause of this fire?

771
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,969
Every year in the U.S.,

772
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,922
there are around 600 OR fires,

773
00:36:49,992 --> 00:36:51,219
just like the one
we had here today.

774
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:53,426
They are preventable

775
00:36:53,495 --> 00:36:55,306
if you replace
antiquated machines

776
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,130
like the ones we have with...

777
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,466
With the newer air-oxygen
blending machines

778
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,687
that allow a skilled
anesthesiologist like Dr. Chu

779
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:06,473
to limit the flow
of pure oxygen.

780
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,125
A request I made to Claire

781
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,744
right after she began
here at Chastain.

782
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:15,164
His proposal was
cost-prohibitive.

783
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,166
So you chose saving money

784
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,652
over patient safety.

785
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:24,307
So this was made...

786
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,175
with Claire's OR camera.

So, in her zeal
for transparency,

797
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:50,166
she ignored my warnings
about the damage

798
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,353
this kind of footage can
do in the wrong hands.

799
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,538
What we're witnessing

800
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,608
is when hospital
leadership has an MBA

801
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,678
and doesn't understand medicine.

802
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,231
Our CEO needs to be a doctor.

803
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,407
Claire wanted to see me?

804
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:18,277
Uh, the board meeting's
running late, have a seat outside.

805
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,333
Hello?

806
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:38,414
Hey, you have a minute?

807
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,733
Oh, you know better than that.

808
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,170
- You have to hustle back to the clinic?
- Yeah.

809
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,550
I should've listened to my
father, gone into dentistry.

810
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,224
In at 8:00, home by 5:00.

811
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:50,471
Yeah, nothing against
dentists, but you're saving lives.

812
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,928
Well, I'm not alone in
the fight, but thank you.

813
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,231
Really? 'Cause I can't
find another oncologist

814
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,345
who carpet-bombs patients
with chemo in secret,

815
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,369
unsupervised cancer clinics.

816
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,575
Only one patient,
she got scared,

817
00:39:05,627 --> 00:39:07,371
thought she was
gonna die in treatment,

818
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:08,990
looked for a second
opinion, and...

819
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:12,898
well, you couldn't have that.

820
00:39:12,968 --> 00:39:16,902
Wow. That nurse, Nic.

821
00:39:16,972 --> 00:39:19,472
Clearly, you two
are sleeping together.

822
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,924
Oh, well, you couldn't have
me testifying on her behalf.

823
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,577
If the committee believed
me, you'd lose your scapegoat.

824
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:27,280
She must be amazing,
for you to take me on.

825
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:30,833
The doctor who turned
a PTSD army medic

826
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:33,319
into a competent diagnostician.

827
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:36,305
I graduated med school at 22.

828
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,985
I was a fellow at
Sloan Kettering

829
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,720
when you were still
cutting into frogs.

830
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:43,178
I was an attending physician at
Johns Hopkins by the age of 30.

831
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,515
I have three clinics
with my name on them.

832
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,651
And just recently, Emerson
asked me to head oncology,

833
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,470
which I politely declined,
because I'm kind of busy.

834
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:53,472
Has this been
more than a minute?

835
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,241
I believe it has.

836
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,911
You come at me like
that again, Dr. Hawkins,

837
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,848
and I'll have you selling
orthotics out of your car.

838
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,885
I will end you
without hesitation.

839
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,983
Didn't Dr. Pravesh discharge you

840
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,002
with a prescription
for omeprazole?

841
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:24,915
- It's an over-the-counter antacid.
- Mm-hmm.

842
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:27,957
Look, Dr. Feldman,
we've ruled out pleurisy,

843
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,608
IBS, melanoma, shingles

844
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,477
and leprosy, but we still...

845
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:34,347
we still haven't gotten to the
bottom of my general malaise.

846
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,499
Hypochondria with
a side of depression.

847
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:37,950
Cancer, okay?

848
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,836
Specifically, lymphoma.

849
00:40:39,888 --> 00:40:42,488
Look, Olivia, there's
absolutely no reason

850
00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:44,057
for you to believe that...

851
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,542
No, I-I don't want to be
the girl that has cancer

852
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,756
that the doctors don't
diagnose until she's stage IV.

853
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,363
I'm not leaving until
I see an oncologist.

854
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,651
Fine. Maybe if one of the
most respected oncologists

855
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,553
this side of the Mississippi
tells you you're cancer-free,

856
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:58,855
you'll believe her.

857
00:41:01,576 --> 00:41:04,861
Here's a referral
to Dr. Lane Hunter.

858
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:12,317
Thank you.

859
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,211
