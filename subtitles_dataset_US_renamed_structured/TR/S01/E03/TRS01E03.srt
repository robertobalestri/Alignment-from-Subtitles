about medicine is wrong. All
the rules you followed, we'll break.

00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,769
You don't have the
right to play God, Conrad.

I'll talk you through it.

Lily means a lot to all of us.

She's been in and out of the
ER so often we're all invested.

12
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,336
- Where's Lily Kendall?
- She went home.

13
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,285

Right fibula. Compound fracture.

46
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:26,144
We need a splint.

47
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,913
- Oh, it hurts. It hurts so bad.
- Deep breaths, buddy,

48
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,443
we don't want you going
into shock. What's your name?

- We'll just wrap him up.
- Like old times...

51
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,816
- medic and surgeon?
- He's about to tell us how much he misses

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,085
the good ol' days when we
were in Afghanistan together.

53
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:41,627

hey. All right, listen,

54

this is gonna sting. Might
want to bite down on that.

00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,258
- But I do miss it sometimes. Don't you?
- I don't miss

00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:47,827
being shot at. No
sane person would.

Oh, hey, Nic.

68
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,059
You left Chastain so abruptly
the other day. I was worried.

69
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,705
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

70
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:34,796
Just grabbing a prescription.

71
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:36,865
You feeling okay?

72
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,834
You want to come upstairs?
I can take your temperature,

73
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:41,481
- make sure you don't have a fever.
- No, no, I'm-I'm good.

Yeah, I'll stop by Dr. Hunter's

Thanks.

78
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:55,967
Come on, Mr. Rosenthal.

79
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,281
I got to take you for some
fresh air, and then to PT.

80
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,671
No, thanks.

81
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,040
What I need is a
drink and smoke.

82
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,959
Good morning, Mr. Rosenthal.

83
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:06,988
Lucky you... A free
ride with Louisa,

84
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,091
our most popular transpo worker.

85
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,864
Ah, just a quick spin.

86
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,034
Don't want a spin
around nothing.

87
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:13,913
- You need sunshine.
- Vitamin D,

88
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:15,303
helps you absorb calcium.

89
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:16,705
Which promotes bone density.

90
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,184
You don't want to break
your hip again, do you?

91
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,109
You know, you should really
listen to Louisa. You know why?

92
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:21,993
No, why?

93
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,444
She's studying to be a doctor.

94
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,924
Med school, huh?

95
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:26,264
You got a ways to go.

96
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,649
How old are you, 12?

97
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:29,234
Ah, close. 22.

98
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,736
And she volunteered at
Chastain all through high school.

99
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,116
- Hmm.
- Hi, Louisa.

100
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,317
- Hey.
- Nic, seriously,

101
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,985
what is this mandatory
meeting about?

102
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,375
I have 30 patients to see.

103
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,938
- Billing.
- Billing?

104
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:41,262
Whoa, sign me up.
Love me some billing.

105
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,732
Enough already.

106
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,737
You okay?

107
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:48,687
Yeah. Diagnosed myself
with a muscle pull this morning.

108
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,088
Some kind of softball injury.

109
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,691
Might have to, uh,
skip out early today.

110
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,027
Plus, I have to cram.
Midterms next week.

111
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,345
Bio and calc.

112
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:58,724
Well, if you need
any help at all,

113
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:01,066
I got a 132 on the bio
section of my MCATs.

114
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,312
Kid brags a lot, doesn't he?

115
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,546
Thanks, Dr. Pravesh.

116
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,671
I might take you
up on that offer.

117
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,753
Compound fracture
of the right fibula.

118
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,322
Now, we reset it in the field,
but he might need surgery.

119
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,901
All right. I'll be right there.

120
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,765
- We'll see you inside.
- Okay.

121
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,728
- Thanks, Doc.
- Let's go.

122
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,946
You did great, Hank.

123
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,331
Yeah, except for the crying.

124
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,560
And screaming for a doctor.

125
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:36,578
And breaking all
those beer bottles.

126
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,120
The truth? That
was like old times.

127
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,167
Well, you miss it so much,
why don't you go back?

128
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:42,685
Yeah, I've been
meaning to tell you.

129
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,127
Jude, I was joking.

130
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,228
Thinking about re-enlisting.

131
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:49,981
- Back into the Marines?
- Yeah.

132
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,133
Do boys ever grow up?

133
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:53,179
- Yes. -No.
- Mandatory meeting, we're late.

134
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:55,114
I thought you were
gonna get us out of this?

135
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:56,983
Yeah, well, I told her we
had seven open cases...

136
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:58,967
All residents, all
nurses. Let's go.

137
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:02,777
You smell like a barn.

138
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:04,779
- I like barns.
- Never been in one.

139
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,247
What? I grew up in Queens.

140
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:08,149
I've smelled worse, trust me.

141
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:09,150
Excuse me.

142
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,630
Morning, everyone.

143
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:13,588
We're here today to talk
about reimbursement.

144
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,635
No one's favorite
part of the day, right?

145
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:17,325
Okay, put that away, sweetie.

146
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,611
Now, to simplify, doctors
and nurses at Chastain

147
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,407
need to charge
more per procedure.

148
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:24,282
For example: ear infection.

149
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:27,035
Typically billed to insurance
as service code one

150
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,320
at about... yeah?

151
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:33,008
$200.

152
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:34,187
But what if that ear infection

153
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:35,376
took a trip to the brain?

154
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:38,830
That's now a code four. Serious.

155
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,048
Costly.

156
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,016
We can bill in the thousands.

157
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:45,069
Illness is unpredictable,
so billing must be proactive.

158
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:49,274
Right? It's called upcoding.

159
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,810
Think... CUTE.

160
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,063
Code. Up. To. Excellence.

161
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,849
Enjoy. I'm out.

162
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,513
Third year. First year.

163
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:04,806

healthcare 101.

164
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:08,009
Okay, what are we
all concerned about?

165
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,524
How much did you
have to drink today?

166
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:13,081
Not really sure.

167
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:14,860
You were at the
race all morning?

168
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:17,385
Which Conrad and
I won, by the way.

169
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,504
I had a beer before the race.

170
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,906
Jaundiced skin, scleral icterus.

171
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,203
I'm sending him for a liver
panel and an ultrasound.

172
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,510
How's our number one fan?

173
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,106
You see this?

174
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,292
This is a stateside doctor,

182
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,368
Ooh.

183
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,947
You get out on the
boat this weekend?

184
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,938
Yeah, the fish
weren't biting. You?

185
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,757
Well, a little golf.

186
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,939
You know, actually, I
had a question for you.

187
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:02,881
Old guy I was playing with
has developed a bit of a tremor.

188
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,093
And it's giving him the yips.

189
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,528
And I prescribed the
standard... Beta blockers...

190
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,485
But it hasn't helped.

191
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,731
You know, I know
there's surgery,

192
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,088
but it seems a little drastic.

193
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,334
Well, cracking open his
head for a missed putt

194
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,390
is a bit much, huh?

195
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,270
Yeah, what about
benzodiazepines?

196
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,338
Last resort, he can try 'em.

197
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,855
But the side effects
are gonna be...

198
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,999
- Aggression and cognitive impairment.
- Yeah.

199
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,327
I guess it just depends how
desperate the guy is, though.

200
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:23,618
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

201
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,914
Rosenthal in 5931...
Catheter out and discharge.

202
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,515
Anderson 5942...

203
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,418
Monitor her rhythm. Where
were you and Dr. Silva deployed?

204
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,386
Afghanistan.

205
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,833
If she spikes a
fever, you add...

206
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,289
IV piperacillin.

207
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,759
My brother was in the
army, two tours in Iraq.

208
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,928
He came back a
very different guy.

209
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,597
Did you see any action?

210
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,199
I was a corpsman in the Marines.

211
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,361
Jude was a base surgeon.

212
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:58,297
We tried to save
lives, not take them.

213
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,216
But mostly, we had
each other's back.

214
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,808
Now let's move on to medicine.
We have a busy day ahead of us.

215
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,055
Let me know if there's anything
in the marketing department...

216
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,106
Look busy.

217
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,173
The upcoding system.

218
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:09,957
Don't forget testing.

219
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,694
A well-insured patient
should be tested

220
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,958
for all possible outcomes,
no matter how unlikely.

221
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,540
Dr. Hawkins, have
you met Barb Olsen?

222
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,158
She's our billing consultant.

223
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,221
Here for two weeks to help
Chastain become more efficient.

224
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:24,039
Of course. The bike shorts.

225
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,831
Yeah, I already saw you at
my presentation... well, briefly.

226
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,982
I got paged.

227
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,251
Didn't I get paged?

228
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,487
I didn't hear anything.

229
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,374
Well, nice meeting you.

230
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,576
Barb, there's, um...

231
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,980
Payback. For making
me sit in that presentation.

232
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,848
What's your problem?

233
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,117
A strong kid like you...
Can't you go any faster?

234
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,385
I got a life to lead.

235
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,821
Hey, Louisa, how's my
man Rosenthal treating you?

236
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,389
Like the daughter he never had.

237
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,473
A nightmare.

238
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,619
The Chastain softball team

239
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,393
crushed Emory yesterday.

240
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,495
Yeah, we did.

241
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,597
Is your back still
bothering you?

242
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,582
Uh, yeah, it's no big deal.

243
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:04,402
Now I'm thinking it's a
pinched nerve, lumbar spine.

244
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,222
Pain that, uh, radiates
along the affected nerve.

245
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,368
That's impressive, but
you're not quite a doctor yet.

246
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:10,920
- Let me have a look.
- Uh, maybe later.

247
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,461
I told Joey in Ped Onc I'd
take him to the play area.

248
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,581
Man, that munchkin is cute.

249
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,629
Check back in
with her in an hour.

250
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,333
I just want to examine
her and make sure...

251
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,890
Hey! We need some help in here!

252
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,030
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

253
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,310
It's okay, stay still.

254
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,634
We got you.

255
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:39,220
I'm too young for kidney stones.

256
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:40,416
I'm thinking it's
just a gas bubble.

257
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,873
It's really no big deal.

258
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,753
How long have you
been short of breath?

259
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,075
Just a few days.

260
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:47,262
I was thinking it
was from the pain.

261
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,281
Your lungs sound congested.

262
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,433
We need a full workup.

263
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,718
This could be serious.

264
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,653
No, I'm okay. I swear.

265
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,289
I can't be sick, they'll
send me back home.

266
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,273
And I need every dime
to make ends meet.

267
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:01,643
And a CT scan as well.

268
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,506
MRI's probably
the better option.

269
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,424
Actually, maybe we should
check her insurance first.

270
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:06,992
- Uh, can this wait?
- No.

271
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,594
Can I a moment with
the patient, please?

272
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:11,068
We're conducting an exam here.

273
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,571
Dr. Hawkins, the administration
has given me license

274
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,273
to inspect all
hospital finances.

275
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,486
You're a subcontractor
to the hospital, right?

276
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:20,339
Yes. Is this really necessary?

277
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,175
I'm feeling better. I
just want to go home.

278
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,465
Rest up.

279
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,333
She wants to go home. Great.

280
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,668
She can't. She needs an MRI.

281
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,321
Do you know if your
company will cover an MRI?

282
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,557
Does anyone know that stuff?

283
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,108
Then if it doesn't, an X-ray

284
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:37,311
- is more than sufficient.
- Actually, it isn't.

285
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,741
Louisa is part of
the Chastain family.

286
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,526
- She deserves our best care.
- Well, I can see

287
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,128
that she's a wonderful
young woman...

288
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,462
I can't do this.

289
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,566
I'm sorry, thank
you, but I'll just leave.

290
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,775
It would be wise
for you to let her go.

291
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,566
Wow. Really?

292
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,520
Louisa...

293
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,159
Easy. Easy.

294
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,326
There you go.

295
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,712
Pulse is weak.

296
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:14,599
Distant heart sounds,
distended jugular veins.

297
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:15,717
Cardiac tamponade.

298
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:17,185
Too unstable to move.

299
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:19,336
I need 18-gauge spinal needle

300
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,638
with a 20cc syringe.

301
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:21,784
I'll prep the ultrasound
in exam room four.

302
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,407
Good. Go.

303
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,569
Louisa, you have
fluid around your heart.

304
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:25,838
We're going to
relieve the pressure.

305
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,395
You cut, I draw.

306
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,427
Quickly, we're losing her.

307
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,411
Ready.

308
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:47,793
Now, Louisa, you're
gonna feel pressure

309
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:48,833
and then stinging.

310
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,930
You're okay, Louisa.

311
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:15,577
DEVON: Another loud noise

312
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:17,262
and we're almost done.

313
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,258
Don't worry, just a
few more minutes.

314
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:24,068
Get her out of that machine.

315
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,915
- We're almost finished.
- She's not insured.

316
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,456
She can't pay for her treatment,
that's why she ran away.

317
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:29,618
Or maybe she didn't
want to burden the hospital.

318
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,903
Well, it's a little
late for that,

319
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:31,859
'cause Chastain is gonna have

320
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:33,244
to eat the cost of that MRI.

321
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:34,940
- That's $10,000.
- $10,000 is what

322
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,525
they charge the
insurance company.

323
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,660
It doesn't cost the
hospital anything like that.

324
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,528
Are you offering to pay?

325
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,903
Here, for your intake files.

326
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,856
I will call her employer,
see what I can negotiate.

327
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:51,262
God, I hate that woman.

328
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,781
You and I will run
point on Louisa's care.

329
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,067
We need to get as
much done as we can

330
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,302
before the administration
pulls the plug.

331
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,286
We can't let them kick her out.

332
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:00,555
Well, don't panic yet.

333
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:02,468
Worst case, we guide
her to another hospital.

334
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:05,609
Where she never even
makes it past ER triage.

335
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,645
Trust me.

336
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:13,301
LFT panel.

337
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,705
Hank, you have acute hepatitis.

338
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,507
Is that bad?

339
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,643
It means that you've
consumed so much alcohol

340
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:24,206
that your liver's
temporarily paralyzed.

341
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,374
It's quite a feat, actually.

342
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,759
Exactly how many
beers did you have?

343
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,917
- Two...
- Two beers?

344
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,489
Two dozen.

345
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,059
If you don't cut back, your
liver's gonna stop functioning.

346
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,543
Your stomach will swell,

347
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,390
you're gonna become
confused, then sleepy,

348
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,514
you slip into a
coma, then you die.

349
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,822
I'm not trying to scare
you, it's just the truth.

350
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,152
You're drinking
yourself to death.

351
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,741
I know.

352
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,510
Help me?

353
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,539
I can get you into
a rehab facility.

354
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,197
I can't do rehab.

355
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,166
I'd lose my job.

356
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,635
But the rest of it, yeah.

357
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,554
I'm ready to quit.

358
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,718
I am. I've struggled with
alcohol my whole life.

359
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,774
Look, the moment
I walk out of there,

360
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,354
I swear, I will go
straight to a meeting.

361
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,997
I'll get a sponsor, I'll stay
in AA the rest of my life.

362
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:20,601
That's easy to say,
pal. It's hard to do.

363
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:28,676
Atwood, Henry, two of
Lorazepam for withdrawal.

364
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:30,161
Thank you, Doctor.

365
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,408
You can do whatever you
want, it's not gonna help.

366
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,649
His problem is self-inflicted.

367
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,818
Hell, 90% of the
patients that come in here

368
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,380
have done stupid
stuff to themselves.

369
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,982
Remind me how you got
that scar on your thumb.

370
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,717
Wasn't it field-dressing
a possum?

371
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:42,840
I was nine years old.

372
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,620
And I treated the injury myself.

373
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:45,743
Of course you did.

374
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,639
It still doesn't explain
why you eat possum.

375
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:49,408
Yeah, we all didn't have moms

376
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:50,842
who would shop and cook for us.

377
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,251
Or dads who were sober
enough to drive us to the ER.

378
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,997
Exactly, and that's
why I'm here...

379
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,215
To help whoever
walks in that door

380
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,805
who can't help themselves.

381
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,651
It doesn't matter whether
they eat lobster or road kill.

382
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:01,175
I take care of them.

383
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:03,378
All right.

384
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:07,014
Let me ask you this.

385
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,750
What is the most fun you
have had in the last week?

386
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:12,236
My guess?

387
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,221
You and me fixing up Hank

388
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,001
in the back of
that pickup truck.

389
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,758
Seat-of-our-pants medicine.

390
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:19,493
Nobody telling us what to do

391
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,045
or making us fill out forms.

392
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,196
Then what happens?

393
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:25,632
We come back to work,

394
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:27,735
and a patient is
trying to run away

395
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:29,737
because she doesn't
have insurance.

396
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:32,000
We can't even treat someone
who's worked at Chastain

397
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,158
for the past two years.

398
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,978
How many wounded
Marines did you ever ask

399
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:39,464
for proof of insurance?

400
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,982
Well...

401
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,251
I guess I got my work cut
out for me, then, don't I?

402
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,280
You keep tilting
at windmills, huh?

403
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,741
- Currently on any medications?
- No, but I'm...

404
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,010
Have you eaten anything
in the last eight hours?

405
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,595
I'm not having surgery today.

406
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:59,667
It says here, "Reynolds,
hernia surgery, 2:15."

407
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,235
I'll be assisting.

408
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:02,620
I'm having some more tests.

409
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,805
- Excuse me?
- A very nice lady came in

410
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:07,674
and talked my doctor into
ordering some more blood work.

411
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:10,010
Another CT scan and an MRI.

412
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,496
You don't need an MRI,
you need hernia surgery.

413
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,543
She said I needed it
to be on the safe side.

414
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,350
She was very convincing.

415
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,087
Why is my hernia
patient having more tests?

416
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,166
He doesn't need more tests.

417
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,690
Another Barb victim.

418
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:25,910
Profit before patients...
The new healthcare mantra.

419
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,495
Barb is like a migraine.
You can feel it coming,

420
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:30,114
but you can't stop it.

421
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,877
Then it gets worse and
worse, and you throw up.

422
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:34,635
What do you guys think
of the name "Say Ah"

423
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:37,638
for a resident-nurse
a cappella group?

424
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:39,790
"Say Ah"?

425
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,793
Yeah, you know, to
serenade patients.

426
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,998
No one wants you
to sing them a song.

427
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,416
The meaner she is to me,
the more I'm in awe of her.

428
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,539
Yeah, that's kind
of how it works.

429
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,609
Wow.

430
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:04,949
You got Louisa's results?

431
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,687
This is a T2 hyperintense,

432
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,667
enhancing mass,
encasing the spleen, kidney,

433
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,991
and vertebral bodies.
Most consistent with...

434
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,187
A retroperitoneal sarcoma.

435
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,678
Which would explain
the fluid in her heart.

436
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:20,098
She lied to us. And
to her employer.

437
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,194
She didn't run away because
she doesn't have insurance,

438
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:25,452
she ran away because she's
an undocumented immigrant.

439
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,910
She has a highly
aggressive tumor.

440
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,779
If she doesn't get surgery
right away, she dies.

441
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:40,083
No more tests,

442
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,186
no more treatment on our dime.

443
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:44,138
This hospital isn't a charity.

444
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,203
I felt this was important enough
to bring to the CEO's office

445
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:00,799
right away. Ms.
Rodriguez is an uninsured,

446
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:01,922
undocumented immigrant.

447
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,558
She has no family
in this country.

448
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,927
She was brought here
from El Salvador as a child.

449
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:10,013
No one can take her once
she leaves the hospital.

450
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,348
State rules are clear on this.

451
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:15,686
Ms. Rodriguez cannot be
released into her own care.

452
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,999
That means Chastain
would be stuck with her

453
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,556
for a long time.

454
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,459
She'd be living
here at our expense.

455
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,810
She would be a Perma Patient.

456
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:25,423
Not every CEO knows that term.

457
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:27,292
Claire is not your average CEO.

458
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,267
Dr. Bell, what's her prognosis?

459
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,447
Well, the five-to ten-year
survival rate is excellent

460
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,805
if we operate right away, but...

461
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,318
the longer we wait,
the worse her odds.

462
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,976
And if her surgery is
successful, what's the rehab?

463
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:42,395
Six months to a year.

464
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:45,832
Okay, best-case scenario,

465
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:48,135
what is Louisa's
care gonna cost us?

466
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:50,955
Chastain does the
surgery, it goes well, post-op,

467
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,135
she can walk with a physical
therapist down the hall...

468
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,992
Half a million dollars.

469
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,161
And worst case?

470
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,997
Post-op, Ms. Rodriguez
can't even get out of the bed...

471
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,515
Two million dollars.

472
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:16,096
Hang in there, your count is
moving in the right direction.

473
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:17,497
Lane.

474
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:20,650
Hey, Conrad. How are you?

475
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,187
I'd like to call you in
for an oncology consult.

476
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,489
Okay. Who's the patient?

477
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,859
Louisa Rodriquez, transport
worker here at Chastain.

478
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,172
Good person. She's uninsured

479
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,863
and an undocumented immigrant.

480
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,632
Um, a full course of
radiation and chemotherapy

481
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:36,901
is, uh, very expensive.

482
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,014
I understand, but don't
you have a foundation

483
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,918
- for cases like this?
- Yes, I do,

484
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,108
but it's not for the
undocumented.

485
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,009
Look, I'll make some inquiries,

486
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,843
but I can't make any promises.

487
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,913
- That'd be fantastic.
- Conrad.

488
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,148
Administration just
put Louisa's surgery

489
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:54,651
- on indefinite hold.
- Lane...

490
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:57,521
- Louisa's all alone.
- I'll see what I can do.

491
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,821
I forgot to tell you
I saw Lily earlier.

492
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,011
She didn't look good.

493
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,212
Nic, she has cancer.

494
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,714
I know we've been through this,

495
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:09,316
and I'm sure Lane had
every reason to discharge Lily,

496
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:13,220
- but my instincts are...
- Lane will take care of her.

497
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:16,340
Lily's in good hands.

498
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,757
Okay, well, I'll be
going... Oh, excuse me.

499
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,347
Oh, Nurse Nevin.

500
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,793
If I could just have a moment?

501
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,428
I'm actually really
busy right now.

502
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,631
Okay, but I don't think the
nurses are getting the hang

503
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,806
of the upcoding system
and the multiple-test vectors.

504
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,302
Our nurses are
laser-focused on patient care.

505
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:35,087
That is their primary
responsibility.

You're a little flat.

517
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:09,727
Next!

518
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,730
Claire, this is Jim Phillips,
CEO of Atlanta General,

519
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,376
and Stuart Green
from our Lady of Mercy.

520
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
The three of us go way back.

521
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,013
Ms. Thorpe took over
as CEO of Chastain,

522
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,204
- what, six months ago?
- Yes.

523
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,622
They're all yours.

524
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:23,974
Gentlemen, it's lovely
to meet you both,

525
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:26,054
and thank you for coming
in on such short notice.

526
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,527
I'll get right to the point.

527
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,631
We have a patient,
uninsured, undocumented,

528
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:32,999
with a retroperitoneal sarcoma.

529
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:35,085
Possible six months
to a year rehab.

530
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,321
Given our fixed costs per bed,

531
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,224
this patient represents a
considerable burden on Chastain.

532
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:42,054
As they would for
Atlanta General.

533
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:44,489
Yes, but Atlanta General and
Our Lady of Mercy's fixed costs

534
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:45,946
are much lower than ours.

535
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:48,999
What are you
suggesting, Ms. Thorpe?

536
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,263
If either one of you will take
this patient off our hands,

537
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,619
pre-surgery,

538
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:56,390
we'll pay a fee,
one-time, of $250,000.

539
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,995
If you can funnel us
five Medicare patients

540
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:03,764
and up the fee to
$300,000, we'll consider it.

541
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,567
What if I offered you

542
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,771
five Medicaid
patients and $250,000?

543
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,720
Medicaid
reimbursements are junk.

544
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:15,175
Ten Medicaid and 300 grand.

545
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,980
I'm offering seven
Medicaid and 275.

546
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:21,883
Too low.

547
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:24,050
We're out.

548
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:28,488
Stuart, Our Lady of
Mercy has a charity fund.

549
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:31,158
What if we did the surgery
and you did the rehab?

550
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,843
We could give your fund
$100,000 that you could use

551
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:35,029
at your discretion.

552
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,674
We just built a
new cardiac wing.

553
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:38,798
Which is a-a beautiful wing.

554
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:40,517
Cost us $40 million.

555
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,186
And I am sure that you will
make that back in fees in no time.

556
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,423
My board would kill me if we
took another Perma Patient.

557
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,809
I'm gonna to have to pass.

558
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:50,293
I'm sorry.

559
00:23:57,552 --> 00:24:00,420
Who can we call, Louisa?

560
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:03,724
You must have family here.

561
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:06,227
My parents brought me here
when I was three years old.

562
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:09,029
My mom died two years ago,

563
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:12,199
and my dad moved
back to El Salvador.

564
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:14,401
I'm alone.

565
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:18,088
And you support yourself?

566
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,691
Yeah.

567
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:24,411
I guess I was crazy to think
I'd make it to med school

568
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,212
without being found out.

569
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:27,909
If Immigration gets
their hands on me,

570
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,233
they'll send me back,
no questions asked.

571
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,937
But this is the only
country I've ever known.

572
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:37,340
And to be a doctor...

573
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,376
that's my dream.

574
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:43,130
I'm so sorry to cause all
this trouble, Dr. Pravesh.

575
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:46,951
Everyone at Chastain has
been nothing but good to me.

576
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,146
Louisa, we're going to help you,

577
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,771
and you deserve
better than this.

578
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,923
I looked up the
surgery on my phone.

579
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,711
Cancer wrapped
around a lot of organs.

580
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,298
Pretty dangerous stuff, huh?

581
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,599
Yes.

582
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,367
It is.

583
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,738
But we both know it is
the only road to a cure.

584
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,875
Do you know how some people
say they're not afraid of dying?

585
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,127
That's crazy, right?

586
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:18,382
It scares the hell out of me.

587
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,935
Louisa, you're going
to be a doctor someday.

588
00:25:22,004 --> 00:25:24,371
Helping you get there...

589
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,224
that's our dream.

590
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,752
Hey.

591
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:41,154
I, uh, checked
with my foundation,

592
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:43,389
and got a fast, hard no.

593
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,192
Our donors expect their gifts

594
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,128
to pay for the treatment
of U.S. citizens.

595
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:50,392
There are plenty of
deserving Americans out there

596
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,615
waiting for a chance.

597
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,635
Ugh.

598
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,321
I hate to disappoint you,
Conrad, that's the hardest part.

599
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,624
Thanks for trying.

600
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:06,030
You know, we do the best we can,

601
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,216
as often as we can.

602
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,736
But we can't save everyone.

603
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:25,565
You're all post-surgery,
and you all want to go home.

604
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:27,412
So today, we're
going to have a race.

605
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,414
Whoever gets to the end of
the hallway first gets discharged.

606
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:31,454
No more poking,
needles, BP checks.

607
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,902
You can cook your own meals,
take a warm shower. Sound good?

608
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,243
If you can't walk to
the end of the hallway,

609
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:37,594
you're here for another week.

610
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,263
One, two, three. Go.

611
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,312
Too slow, Mrs.
Pill. You're done.

612
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:48,288
Mr. Farragut, the same.

613
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,894
No time to treat a heart attack,

614
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,763
Mr. Smith, off you go.

615
00:26:59,301 --> 00:27:00,501
Discharge the winners.

616
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:02,464
The losers can go
back to their rooms.

617
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,532
Take it easy, all right?
You're gonna be fine.

618
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,650
- Culling the herd?
- Yep.

619
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:06,735
Administration won't allow

620
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,553
- Louisa's surgery.
- Unfortunate.

621
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:10,071
But I heard she is undocumented.

622
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,495
Rules are rules.

623
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:13,475
Am I crazy, but aren't
you and me supposed to be

624
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,250
in the trenches together
on situations like this?

625
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:18,330
Please, tell me this is
not actually how you feel.

626
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:19,686
What I feel doesn't matter.

627
00:27:19,755 --> 00:27:21,171
What I feel doesn't help.

628
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,606
I deal in facts.

629
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,274
Okay. Fine.

630
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:27,644
Because the hospital is trying
to save money, Louisa might die.

631
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:28,713
Fact.

632
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:30,158
She might die from surgery, too.

633
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,247
Fact.

634
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,283
Love the optimism.

635
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:35,118
How dangerous is it, Mina?

636
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,638
Very intricate, very demanding.

637
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:39,873
Seven, eight hours.

638
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:41,608
But glorious.

639
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:43,793
Sounds like it's
right up your alley.

640
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:14,341
Conrad, we all feel
terrible for Louisa.

641
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:17,311
She's an enormous liability.

642
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:19,078
As much as two million dollars

643
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,915
over the course
of her treatment.

644
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:25,084
Look, I get that it's
a bottom-line world.

645
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:26,904
You made that clear.

646
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,750
But I want you to think
back for a moment,

647
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,502
to when you were in med school.

648
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:33,927
It wasn't all about
making money.

649
00:28:33,996 --> 00:28:35,929
That was a long time ago.

650
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:37,509
Healthcare has
changed since then.

651
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:39,493
We need to deal
with the new reality.

652
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:42,452
I think we can both agree

653
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,955
that every doctor has
that singular moment

654
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,834
when they decide they're
going into medicine.

655
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,126
For you, to be a surgeon.

656
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,539
And even if it was decades
ago, I'd bet everything I got

657
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,407
you remember it
like it was yesterday.

658
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,482
And I don't buy for one second

659
00:28:55,551 --> 00:29:01,021
that it had anything
to do with money.

660
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:02,639
It didn't.

661
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,741
I fell in love with cutting.

662
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:08,478
I fell in love with the OR.

663
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,397
I love it.

664
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:13,534
Still.

665
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,520
But the money has to
come from somewhere.

666
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,390
If we treat Louisa, our
other patients will suffer.

667
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,192
Services will be cut.

668
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:24,544
Hours, staff.

669
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:26,458
You know, I don't like the
idea of putting a price tag

670
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:28,031
on a life any more than you do.

671
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,368
But the system
doesn't run on air.

672
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,537
No matter how
much we love Louisa,

673
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,188
her price tag

674
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:38,608
is not two million dollars.

675
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,682
Don't say anything.

676
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,751
Nothing.

677
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:56,737
Catch you at a bad time?

678
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,239
I'd like to shove
CUTE right up her...

679
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,343
Throw it in the trash.

680
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,597
You'll feel better.

681
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:05,102
Look at that.

682
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,703
Stress management.

683
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,772
I'm guessing you
didn't come up here

684
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:10,774
to talk to me about upcoding.

685
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,242
No.

686
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,471
It's about your boy, Conrad.

687
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:15,612
Look, he's taking things hard.

688
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,058
If he doesn't start
to choose his battles,

689
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,148
he's gonna burn out.

690
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,218
Yeah, well, I can't
control Conrad.

691
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,420
Never could.

692
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,622
And he's not my boy.

693
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,724
Not anymore.

694
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:30,761
Sorry to hear that.

695
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:36,900
Alabama Shakes is playing
Terminal West next week.

696
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:39,235
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

697
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,704
I got an extra ticket.

698
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,500
I remember you saying
you liked their music.

699
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:43,974
I do.

700
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:47,627
It's not a date.

701
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:49,524
Just a concert.

702
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:50,631
Have a little fun.

703
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:55,501
Rapid response, 5922. Let's go.

704
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,321
She's crashing.

705
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,550
- Blood pressure?
- 70/40.

706
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:00,857
- Cycling right now.
- Her IV blew in the MRI.

707
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,320
We haven't been able
to get another line since.

708
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:03,438
She's bleeding internally.

709
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,144
Now it's 60/30.

710
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:08,515
She's a hard stick.

711
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:11,651
Her vessels are clamped
down, she's too volume-depleted.

712
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,669
Emergency IO.

713
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,367
Yeah, I've never
done that before.

714
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:16,391
Get the kit.

715
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,657
You're doing it now.

716
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:24,864
Push the needle in.

717
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,267
Once you hit the bone, drill.

718
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,724
Keep it steady.

719
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:45,519
Drill.

720
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:47,187
Okay, release.

721
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,393
Flush.

722
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:03,948
Running in fluids.

723
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:06,172
We're in the clear.

724
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:07,602
- For now.
- She'll keep bleeding

725
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,776
until we get her to surgery.

726
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,389
There are four oncology
surgeons on call.

727
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:14,113
Why can't we ask one of
them to do the operation?

728
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,760
Good idea. Let's practice that.

729
00:32:15,784 --> 00:32:16,784
I'll be Dr. Hillis.

730
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,062
Go ahead, pitch me the surgery.

731
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:21,405
Hi, Dr. Hillis, I need
a surgical oncologist

732
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,590
to operate on a
patient right away.

733
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:24,753
Okay, sure, who's the patient?

734
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:25,777
Louisa Rodriguez.

735
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,661
Actually, I forgot.

736
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:29,829
I'm booked solid today.

737
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:31,248
Ask Dr. Miller.

738
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,227
Dr. Miller, I need an
oncology surgeon...

739
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,246
Would love to, but I'm
headed to Aruba today

740
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,469
with my fiancée.

741
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,821
Dr. Singh says the failure rate

742
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,450
for this surgery
is through the roof.

743
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:40,618
Dr. Weiss heard
the administration

744
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:41,824
is dead set against it...

745
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,787
- The administration is wrong.
- Maybe they are,

746
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:46,207
but Dr. Weiss makes 400K a
year, really wants to keep his job.

747
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:48,915
Okay.

748
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:52,219
They're gonna wiggle their
way out of it any way they can.

749
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:54,921
But we know someone
dying to do the operation.

750
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,742
But it's not in your specialty.

751
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:02,745
So? I'm arrogant enough
to believe I can do it.

752
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:04,047
And I'm your only option.

753
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,035
Just get an
attending to sign off.

754
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:09,603
I need you to sign
off on a surgery.

755
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,833
It's not in your specialty.
You'll just be supervising.

756
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:13,440
Yeah, and what's the catch?

757
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:14,975
No catch.

758
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:18,745
Look, I know you, pal.

759
00:33:18,814 --> 00:33:20,380
What rules am I gonna break?

760
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,465
Not breaking. Bending.

761
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:23,750
Bending, okay.

762
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:26,703
- Who's the patient?
- Louisa Rodriguez.

763
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,292
Oh, I'm in.

764
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:38,015
Surgery's a go. Mina's on deck.

765
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,361
Conrad, someone
called Immigration.

766
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:40,545
They're coming for Louisa.

767
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,447
How can I help you, gentlemen?

768
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:55,926
- Sir, you need to move aside.
- I will,

769
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,317
if you tell me what's going on.

770
00:33:57,386 --> 00:33:59,047
Hospitals are sensitive areas,

771
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:00,297
along with schools and churches.

772
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,454
And sensitive areas

773
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:03,468
cannot be accessed
by immigration officials

774
00:34:03,492 --> 00:34:05,942
without arrest warrants
or under investigation

775
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,822

national security threat.

00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:12,726
You're interfering

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,000
of authorized federal agents.

779
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:16,080
- You're gonna regret this.
- I doubt that.

780
00:34:16,104 --> 00:34:17,715
Well then, you better
drag us both out of here.

781
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,272
Conrad.

782
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:20,768
Stop.

783
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,342
Step aside or you
will both be fired.

784
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,964

Wait. Give that back to me.

- Pull him out.

- Did you push his doctor to order this test?
- I did.

807
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,675
Without checking
the patient history?

808
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:06,780
Open the microphone.

809
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:09,766
Mr. Reynolds, do you
know how an MRI works?

810
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,835
It has incredibly
powerful magnets.

811
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,403
Magnets that will rip anything
metal out of your body.

812
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,422
Anything at all.

813
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:19,592
Do you have anything metal
in your body, Mr. Reynolds?

814
00:36:19,661 --> 00:36:22,228
Mr. Reynolds has
a penile implant,

815
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:24,831
a metal-based penile implant.

816
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,433
How much is your penis
worth to you, Mr. Reynolds?

817
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:28,784
Say, in a lawsuit?

818
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:29,948
A million dollars?
Five million dollars?

819
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:31,972
Stop the machine!

820
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,491
You are not a doctor
and you are not a nurse.

821
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,059
Not every test is safe.

822
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,454
Not every procedure
should be billed

823
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:38,978
for ten times what it's worth.

824
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:40,625
You're gonna end up
getting someone killed.

825
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:42,760
- Now wait just a second...
- I'll be filing an incident report

826
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,328
with the Comptroller's
office and the CEO.

827
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:47,537
Good luck getting
hired at Chastain again.

828
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,209
Louisa.

829
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:00,884
Do you have any nausea?

830
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:01,968
No.

831
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,403
I feel okay.

832
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,023
You've been so
kind to me, all of you.

833
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,070
I'll never be able
to repay you for this.

834
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:13,647
But I'll still need some
help on my bio midterm.

835
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:14,830
Anytime.

836
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,374
So...

837
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,180
the operation came
off without a hitch.

838
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:22,105
You had a spectacular surgeon.

839
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:23,206
Cake.

840
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:25,775
What are her rehab markers?

841
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,878
Well, if she can walk to
the door, we're in the clear.

842
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,930
If not...

843
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,567
Hey. Well, you look good.

844
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:39,472
You know, it's really important

845
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,552
that we get you up
on your feet right away.

846
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:44,127
So... how about
you get out of bed

847
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,973
and show us how you
can walk to the door?

848
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,064
Okay.

849
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:50,049
Let's really concentrate.

850
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,920
Here we go.

851
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,939
I'm so sorry.

852
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:18,344
Two million.

853
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,498
It's okay.

854
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,367
You'll be fine.

855
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:39,733
Louisa,

856
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:42,852
rehab is gonna be
a long, hard road,

857
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,105
but we all know
how tough you are.

858
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:46,617
You'll get through this.

859
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:48,018
With some time and care,

860
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:50,221
you'll be right back where
you were in a year or so.

861
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,278
We've got your
back the whole way.

862
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:09,628
Hey, Art.

863
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:11,463
Randolph.

864
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:19,438
Hey, uh, how's your
golfing buddy doing?

865
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:22,374
The one with the tremor?
He sink any more putts?

866
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:26,212
Oh, uh...

867
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,925
He just started
taking the medication.

868
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,149
- Probably too soon to tell.
- Okay.

869
00:39:30,218 --> 00:39:31,601
Well, keep me updated.

870
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,168
Yeah. Yeah. Will do.

871
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,099
Jude and I are
gonna go grab a beer.

872
00:40:08,123 --> 00:40:10,089
You want to join?

873
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,495
She's a lot cuter than
either of you guys.

874
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:17,246
True enough.

875
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,004
Enjoying your
victory, Dr. Hawkins?

876
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:29,329
Did you call Immigration?

877
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:34,646
You had your billing
consultant do it for you.

878
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:35,831
Barb Olsen's contract

879
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,377
with this hospital
has been suspended.

880
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:41,053
But I have to pull two
million dollars out of thin air.

881
00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:42,700
- I understand...
- No.

882
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:45,024
You will understand full
well when I take that money

883
00:40:45,092 --> 00:40:47,292
out of the Internal
Medicine and ER budgets.

884
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,029
Be prepared to be
woefully understaffed

885
00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:51,797
for the next 12 months.

886
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,536
By the way, thank you for today.

887
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,032
Yeah.

888
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,256
Thorpe could've had
you canned on the spot.

889
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:19,658
Well, I get fired, it makes
the decision for me, right?

890
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:22,879
I show up tomorrow at
Fort Benning, 6:00 a.m.

891
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:26,582
Hell, you could
be there with me.

892
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:28,918
Hmm?

893
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,380
All right, so you're
starting to come around.

894
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,889
What are you so
damn happy about?

895
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,618
Because I know exactly where
I'm supposed to be tomorrow,

896
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:36,508
and it's at Chastain.

897
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,612
Yeah.

898
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,367
Valor, honor...

899
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,353
Victory.

900
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,023
Mm.

901
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:54,160
I got these.

902
00:41:57,665 --> 00:42:00,266
So, you know, I've been
meaning to ask, you and Nic...

903
00:42:00,335 --> 00:42:02,151
That still a thing?

904
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,453
She doesn't think so, but...

905
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:07,852
I think she's worth
fighting for. Don't you?

906
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:11,310
Oh, hell yeah. Game on.

Short of breath and
