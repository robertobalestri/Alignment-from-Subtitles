00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:02,789
<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color="#ffff00">"The Resident"...</font>

2
00:00:02,874 --> 00:00:04,421
I set up marriages
between

3
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:06,071
Indian Americans in Atlanta.

4
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:08,321
No ring,
a faint look of desperation.

5
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:09,758
You're available.

6
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,485
Patients need to be honest
with themselves

7
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,844
about their prognosis.

8
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,843
<i>Based on what I saw
this morning,</i>

9
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:16,805
you will never likely
operate again,

10
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,704
but you're honest
with yourself about that, right?

11
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,759
- Just give me another chance.
- I'm willing to watch

12
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:23,071
and see how you do,

13
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,750
but I see no place for you
at Chastain.

14
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:28,460
Visa expires next week.

15
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,709
If I go to Nigeria
on my own accord,

16
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:35,039
I could apply to return
in the future.

17
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:36,843
I'm going back to Nigeria.

18
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:38,773
I'm coming with you.

19
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:53,078
Good morning.

20
00:00:53,163 --> 00:00:53,844
Hey.

21
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,602
Are we feeling nostalgic yet?

22
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:58,891
Nostalgia requires a yearning
for what's already passed.

23
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:00,782
I'm looking forward
to what's to come.

24
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:03,722
Well, our Nigerian adventure
begins tonight.

25
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:05,122
11:00 flight.

26
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:07,290
Mm-hmm. And 12 and a half hours
in the air.

27
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,060
<i>Oh, thank God
for neck pillows.</i>

28
00:01:09,144 --> 00:01:10,218
Yeah, that would be me.

29
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:11,645
I'm your neck pillow.

30
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:14,073
Yeah.

31
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,741
Yes, you are.

32
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:17,467
I'll see you at Chastain.

33
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:21,859
One last shift
and our adventure awaits.

34
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:24,792
Man, AJ,

35
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,954
you sure got
a big collection of...

36
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,045
stuff.

37
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:29,789
Hey, Dad,

38
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:32,427
make sure you check in
on my vinyl collection

39
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:33,492
every once in a while.

40
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:35,253
They'll be
in the storage locker.

41
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:37,415
What do you want me to do,
talk to your records?

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,257
Make sure they're not lonely?

43
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:42,351
Hey, Ma,
you all right over there?

44
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:44,814
I'm fine.

45
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,248
Excuse me a moment.

46
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,536
You were so excited
for sleepaway camp.

47
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,521
It's all you talked about.

48
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:14,503
But then you-you spent
those two weeks

49
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:16,775
asking me to come back
and pick you up.

50
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:22,241
You wrote me every single day.

51
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:23,706
Yeah.

52
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,659
I was a mama's boy.

53
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,321
And I still am, you know.

54
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:33,711
I love her, Mom.

55
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:35,312
That doesn't mean
I don't love you.

56
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:38,306
You know I do.
More than anything.

57
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:40,477
But I'm going.

58
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,383
I really want to.

59
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:55,582
Weren't you here yesterday?

60
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:59,149
10,000 hours of practice is
a minimum for greatness.

61
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:00,584
Hmm.

62
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,938
I'm all in for greatness.

63
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,595
I'm Billie Sutton, by the way.

64
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,352
Fifth-year
neurosurgery resident.

65
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,429
I...
Let emotional irregularity

66
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,097
ruin your career.

67
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:13,235
I know who you are.

68
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:18,915
And you're
the legendary Barrett Cain.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,033
You could remove a meningioma
in under ten minutes

70
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,553
with no complications.

71
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:25,596
Or at least you could
before the accident.

72
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:28,359
Believe it or not, I'm a fan.

73
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:36,334
Damn it.

74
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,769
Good morning, Dr. Cain.

75
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:04,962
How's your hand today?

76
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:06,648
Did you complete
the vessel anastomosis?

77
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:09,180
Yes. Yes, I did.
And the hand...

78
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:11,750
is...

79
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:14,770
It's perfect.

80
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,242
You've successfully completed
all your prerequisites.

81
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:20,130
Should I put in a request

82
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:21,454
to get you back
on the surgical schedule?

83
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:24,281
Absolutely. I'm ready.

84
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,155

Episode Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"Into the Unknown"</font>
Aired on: <font color="#00ffff">April 20, 2021</font>

86
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:40,696
16-year-old female.
Lisa McBride.

87
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,716
Traumatic neck injury
following a diving accident.

88
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,783
GCS 15. Vitals stable.

89
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:46,412
Okay, let's get her
to Trauma Bay Nine.

90
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:47,500
Lifeguard nearly drowns.

91
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,361
Add that
to my emergency room bingo.

92
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:50,604
It's tradition for new employees

93
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:51,978
to jump off
the ten-meter diving board.

94
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:53,078
So you jumped?

95
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:54,868
Kind of.
I splat.

96
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:56,414
Okay, on three.

97
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:58,922
One, two, three.

98
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:00,814
I just got hired.

99
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,907
My boss is so mad.
I bet you she fires me.

100
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:05,487
Let's not worry about all that
until we make sure you're okay.

101
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,922
I just really need this job.

102
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:09,173
College applications
are expensive.

103
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,402
BP's dropping.

104
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:11,243
70/40.

105
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:12,657
- Spinal shock?
- Could be.

106
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:14,385
All right, bolus two liters
of normal saline.

107
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:16,307
- Get atropine on standby, please.
- What's going on?

108
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:17,814
- Am I dying?
- No.

109
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:19,690
Sometimes an injury like this
can cause problems

110
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:21,776
with your blood pressure and heart rate.
My legs and arms...

111
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,321
They're all tingly.

112
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:26,993
- Wiggle your toes.
- I...

113
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,742
Wiggle your toes.

114
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Squeeze my fingers.

115
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:33,033
You feel that?

116
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:34,478
A little.
I don't know.

117
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:35,721
Maybe not.
What does that mean?

118
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,897
Let's get you to CT
and find out.

119
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:39,874
Can someone please call my mom?

120
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,650
Okay, have them prep an OR,

121
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:43,345
then call her parents
and tell them

122
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,360
that their daughter
might need surgery.

123
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:50,468
I was surprised to see your name
back on my surgical board.

124
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:52,245
Your board?
My board.

125
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,375
My hospital.
My rules.

126
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,931
Which means you don't touch
a scalpel until I've cleared you.

127
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,526
So then clear me.

128
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:00,753
I've done everything.
Recovery. PT.

129
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,064
Sim lab practice.

130
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:03,931
If you want to return to the OR,

131
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:05,501
you will do so
under my supervision.

132
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:08,002
I will be standing with you
for your first surgery back.

133
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:09,587
I don't need a babysitter.

134
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:13,086
And I don't need a neurosurgeon
with authority issues.

135
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,750
I look forward to operating
with you, Dr. Voss.

136
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:23,681
Going to miss you,
Dr. Austin.

137
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:25,755
You know, we never got that
drink we talked about getting.

138
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,407
And we never played racquetball.

139
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:29,408
Maybe I'll visit you.
We'll play a match in Lagos.

140
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:31,258
Well, you're welcome anytime,
Chu.

141
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:32,167
Right angle.

142
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,022
I made you a going-away present.

143
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:35,014
Kristy.

144
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,283
It's an OR cap.

145
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:38,860
I made it myself.

146
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,836
These are the colors
from the Nigerian flag.

147
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:44,804
We've had some times together,
huh?

148
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:52,852
Indeed we have.

149
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:55,164
I'm gonna miss them.

150
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:58,794
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

151
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:07,302
Our leaping lifeguard
is headed to the OR

152
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:08,896
for spinal decompression.

153
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,323
Poor kid.

154
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:11,742
Has anyone seen Mina?

155
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:13,133
How's she holding up?

156
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:15,413
She may be Spock,

157
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:18,469
but I'm sure she's just
as devastated as we all are.

158
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:20,584
- Oh. Speak of the devil.
- Good.

159
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,156
You're all here.

160
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,860
I have a few borrowed items
to return.

161
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:30,126
A phone charger you forgot at my
Halloween party three years ago.

162
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:33,078
The blouse you gave me
barhopping downtown.

163
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:34,204
- Mm.
- Pre-COVID.

164
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,534
And your headphones. Don't
remember when I borrowed these.

165
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:38,469
You didn't borrow them.
You took them.

166
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,129
But it doesn't matter.
You keep 'em.

167
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:41,856
You know, I was thinking
about the time we first met.

168
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,165
Do you remember?
I was just finishing up

169
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:44,449
- with that...
- No, no, no, no. Don't do that.

170
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,550
I'm not dead.

171
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:46,959
People move away all the time.

172
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,120
It's not a Hallmark moment.

173
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:49,985
No need to get sentimental.

174
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:55,766
Well, at least we know
that Mina is still... Mina.

175
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,389
How am I gonna say goodbye
to her?

176
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:01,274
You'll find a way.

177
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:10,852
I need to see
my daughter Lisa.

178
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,052
Sh-She's a lifeguard.

179
00:08:12,137 --> 00:08:13,904
- Mrs. McBride?
- Yes.

180
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:15,907
Was your daughter
in a diving accident?

181
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:17,289
Yes, that's her.
Is she okay?

182
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:18,799
Lisa's being prepped
for surgery.

183
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:20,695
You can see her as soon
as she gets out of the OR.

184
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:22,220
I know how hard this is.

185
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:23,884
You would do anything
for your daughter.

186
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,831
Anything.
But right now

187
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:28,000
you have to let the surgeons
do their work.

188
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:29,789
She's in the best of hands.

189
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,649
Okay.

190
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:34,832
Just remember,
you're still in a probationary period.

191
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:37,079
Follow the rules
and mind your manners.

192
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:40,258
- Consider my manners 100% minded.
- Good.

193
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,840
One wrong move and this poor
girl will be a quadriplegic.

194
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:47,103
Which is why I'm here...

195
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:49,797
to make sure
that doesn't happen.

196
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:51,767
Dr. Cain is the lead surgeon?

197
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:53,536
Risen from the dead,
it would appear.

198
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,953
Is that a problem?

199
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,289
I'm not sure
how fond he is of me.

200
00:08:58,441 --> 00:08:59,691
But the new Billie
could learn from him,

201
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:02,043
so, no, no problem at all.

202
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:13,954
Dr. Cain,

203
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:16,065
shall we begin?

204
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,005
10 blade to me.

205
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:31,266
- Hey, Ma, how you feeling?
- Just a bit of a headache.

206
00:09:31,382 --> 00:09:33,408
She hit the corner
of the kitchen sink.

207
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:35,532
You've been drinking
too much coffee

208
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,650
and not enough water.
I think she's dehydrated.

209
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,231
Well, that would explain
the dizziness.

210
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:40,868
We'll give you
some IV fluids.

211
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:42,241
Did you lose
consciousness?

212
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:43,453
No.

213
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:44,538
It's just...

214
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:46,689
my friend Charlene,

215
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:49,126
she got dizzy,
didn't see a doctor and...

216
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:51,083
turns out
she was having a stroke.

217
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,678
Now she walks with a cane.

218
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,657
You're not having a stroke, Mom.

219
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,314
Normal BP and heart rate.

220
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,426
EKG doesn't show anything
of concern.

221
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,493
Um, exam was normal.

222
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:04,914
We're running her bloodwork now
and waiting on a head CT.

223
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,192
S-Scuse me while I confer
with Dr. Hawkins.

224
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:11,771
Well, thanks for checking up on her.
Oh, of course.

225
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:13,564
I was in surgery
when they called.

226
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,189
Whatever you need, man.
I'm here.

227
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:17,861
Listen, she can be
a bit of a hypochondriac.

228
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:20,376
All right?
She came from Maui convinced

229
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:21,790
that she had dengue fever.

230
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,441
It was allergies.

231
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:25,536
And it's only gotten worse
ever since I told her

232
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,786
I was going to Nigeria.

233
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:28,370
You know?

234
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:32,692
Maybe she's just having a hard
time processing her feelings.

235
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:34,777
To be honest, we all are.

236
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:37,165
I want to keep her in the ER
for a bit,

237
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,307
make sure she's feeling okay.

238
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:39,806
And, selfishly,
I just like talking to her.

239
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,549
She has some enlightening
stories about your childhood.

240
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,135
Hey. You keep those
to yourself.

241
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:49,508
We'll get you on that plane
with a clear conscience.

242
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:52,984
Appreciate it.

243
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:03,071
- What's up?
- Looks like I got

244
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:05,001
my first potential date
from my Indian matchmaker.

245
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:07,159
Ooh.
Anyone interesting?

246
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:10,428
Oh, my God.
Oh, wait. Give me that.

247
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:13,250
Dr. Pravesh?

248
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:16,056
Your sickle cell patient
Rose Williams's labs came back.

249
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,594
Everything looks fine.

250
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,727
Okay. Cool.
Doctor, thank you.

251
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:23,486
Is something wrong?

252
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:24,704
Dr. Devi, have you ever used

253
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,376
a match...?
Mr. Benson in room 5202

254
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:28,469
needs an EKG.
Can you handle that, please?

255
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:32,539
- Sure.
- Thank you.

256
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:38,026
You are not being
helpful.

257
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:50,819
Rose.

258
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,586
That was a cryptic message
telling me to come in.

259
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,657
Is something wrong?
Good news, actually.

260
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:57,713
Your counts are excellent,
and you could never tell

261
00:11:57,797 --> 00:11:59,797
that you had a devastating
sickle cell crisis last month.

262
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:02,306
Oh, that's a relief.

263
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,517
Honestly, I feel healthier
and happier

264
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:09,446
than I have felt
in a long time, but, um...

265
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,282
admitting that sends a wave
of dread over me

266
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,386
because I know it's temporary,
and I know

267
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:18,656
that I'll never escape that,
not for the rest of my life.

268
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:22,751
Here.

269
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:27,861
Well... what if I told you
that might not be true?

270
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,696
We've been through this.

271
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:33,275
Doctors always underestimate my pain,
but it is very, very real.

272
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,938
I know. I know.

273
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:37,211
But I've been doing
some research.

274
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:40,336
There have been some
developments in gene therapy.

275
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:44,605
Recent clinical trials
with good outcomes.

276
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:47,018
There might be a cure, Rose.

277
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,646
I've opened the soft tissue.

278
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,456
Cerebellar retractor.

279
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:00,523
Maybe less force.

280
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,063
You don't want
to make your closure harder.

281
00:13:03,172 --> 00:13:05,656
Thank you
for the advice, Dr. Voss.

282
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:07,165
Bovie?

283
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:21,853
Elevating
the paraspinal musculature

284
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:24,219
off of the periosteal plane.

285
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,390
Sweeping it to the side.

286
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:30,360
And... beautiful.

287
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,706
Dr. Voss?
You're needed in the ER.

288
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:37,759
And you're thinking,
I can waste the rest of my day

289
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:39,922
babysitting
a perfectly capable surgeon,

290
00:13:40,008 --> 00:13:42,399
or I should move on to
an operation where I'd actually

291
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:43,574
be useful.

292
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,031
I'm fine with either choice.

293
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,792
It's your hospital, your rules.

294
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,415
You seem to have made
a miraculous recovery, Dr. Cain.

295
00:13:51,883 --> 00:13:53,659
Well done.

296
00:13:53,977 --> 00:13:56,662
Dr. Sutton,
learn all you can from this man.

297
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,382
It's good to have you back,
Barrett.

298
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:11,578
How is your mother?

299
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:12,929
She's fine.

300
00:14:13,022 --> 00:14:15,516
She's likely somatizing
her anxiety.

301
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,339
Conrad's doing a workup.

302
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:20,556
All of this has
to be stressful for you.

303
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:22,211
Well, for everybody.

304
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:26,079
Turns out you and I are the
Beyoncé and Jay-Z of Chastain.

305
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:29,642
I will stand for nothing less.

306
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:31,321
You know, I never realized

307
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:33,407
how us leaving would have
such an impact.

308
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:36,547
Oh, yeah, the hugging,
kissing, crying.

309
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:38,961
Oh, it's nauseating.

310
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:44,710
Do you regret this?

311
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,063
What?

312
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:49,515
Moving to Nigeria with me?

313
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:55,054
Listen to me.

314
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:02,016
I regret nothing.

315
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:08,134
Okay, that's my mom.

316
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:11,821
Listen, we are good.

317
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:15,039
Okay.

318
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,454
Anything we need
to be worried about?

319
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:21,805
Based on the test results,

320
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,166
everything looks
completely normal.

321
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,267
You see?
Everything's gonna be fine.

322
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:27,539
I am so embarrassed.

323
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:30,250
Making such a fuss
about nothing.

324
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,196
It's better
to be safe than sorry.

325
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:35,427
No, it's more than that.

326
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:37,578
This is supposed
to be AJ's last day.

327
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:40,561
And here I came
and made it all about me.

328
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:43,718
People often don't realize

329
00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:46,170
how powerful
the mind-body connection is.

330
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:49,506
Sometimes, when your heart
breaks, your body does, too.

331
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,632
It's good you came in.
It's important to take care

332
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:53,522
of yourself,
even when things are hard.

333
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:57,093
Especially when things are hard.

334
00:15:57,563 --> 00:15:58,866
Thank you.

335
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:00,525
Hey. Everything okay?

336
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,592
Labs and CT are normal.

337
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:05,362
Just to be safe,
I'm gonna set up an appointment

338
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,234
with her primary care physician.
She'll go

339
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:08,461
- in the next couple days.
- Yes.

340
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:10,038
So she doesn't have
to be admitted?

341
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:12,217
There is no specific
medical reason to admit her.

342
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:15,186
Please, AJ,
I want to go home.

343
00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:19,052
You're sure, Mom?

344
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,246
I'm sure.

345
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,194
You have
to drill down the facet.

346
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,571
Her hyperflexion injury
caused the bones to shift.

347
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:30,955
We have to shave them down.

348
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:34,272
That's arterial blood.
Vertebral artery.

349
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:35,842
The bone was tamponading
the bleed.

350
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:38,483
Give me suction.
Turn it up. Now.

351
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:41,202
You'll have to remove bone to
expose and repair the artery.

352
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:44,163
I know that. Drill.

353
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,303
Dr. Cain?

354
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:55,476
I got it. Hold on.

355
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:58,295
Dr. Cain, I don't think you do.

356
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,046
Let me take over the surgery.
Give me a second.

357
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,491
If we wait,
you won't have to worry

358
00:17:01,576 --> 00:17:04,060
about her walking again.
She'll be brain dead.

359
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:07,368
Call Dr. Voss.
Wait!

360
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:10,436
Okay, take over.

361
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:13,585
Suction here.
Hold it stable.

362
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:16,030
Drilling above and below
to expose the artery.

363
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:19,759
Two arterial ligation clamps
to me now.

364
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:31,932
Hey, can you cover
for me in the ER?

365
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:34,154
For, like, an hour.
Yeah, no problem.

366
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:36,646
Does this have anything to do
with your date with Dr. Devi?

367
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,277
Mina told me.

368
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:40,651
Of course she did.

369
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:43,086
No. So I have a meeting.

370
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,653
Remember Rose,
our sickle cell patient?

371
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:47,176
Of course. She's been
through hell and back.

372
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,738
Well, I think I may have found
her a clinical trial

373
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,173
using gene therapy.

374
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:53,832
The founder of one of these
companies running the trial...

375
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,508
He's an old college buddy
of mine, and he wrote this paper

376
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:59,512
about how he's revolutionizing
sickle cell treatment,

377
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:01,655
potentially curing it.

378
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:03,925
Well, we both know
he'll be incentivized

379
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:05,199
to publish
only the good outcomes

380
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,261
and conveniently
leave out the bad.

381
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:08,753
Like most pharma companies.

382
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,170
Just keep an eye on that.

383
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:13,257
Look, you know I'm not going
to get Rose involved

384
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:15,886
in anything that I don't 100%
believe in. You know that.

385
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,637
Of course I do. I trust you.

386
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,123
I just don't trust
Big Pharma.

387
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:24,516
We both love Rose.

388
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,269
Just...
I want this to work out for her.

389
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:32,027
Yeah. Me, too.

390
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,736
See you.

391
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,120
Would you stop following me?

392
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:44,175
I work here, too.
Yes, on another floor.

393
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,050
Yet every time I turn around,
there you are.

394
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,167
Well, maybe I want
to spend every last second

395
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,510
that I can with you.

396
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:51,023
Okay, if you're expecting me

397
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:52,309
to have
some emotional breakdown...

398
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:55,473
Tears, wailing, and so on...
It's not gonna happen.

399
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:57,167
How about you just admit
that you love us

400
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:58,268
and you're gonna miss us?

401
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,605
I do love you,
and I will miss you.

402
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:00,963
You don't look like it.

403
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,365
What do you mean?

404
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,857
This is my
"I love you" face.

405
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:05,331
You're the worst.

406
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,246
Okay, fine. You know what?
Go back to Nigeria.

407
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:09,355
See if I care. But I will get
the goodbye I want.

408
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,034
You can count on it.

409
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,386
Phillip, dude,
you're still driving

410
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:20,964
that nasty beater from college,

411
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,097
and this is what
your lab looks like?

412
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:25,691
That car treats me well, man.

413
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:28,058
We had some good times

414
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,902
rolling around Harvard Square
in that car.

415
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:31,922
No comment.

416
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:34,517
Look, the way I see it,

417
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:36,930
you got to put your money into
something that can do some good.

418
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:39,664
And right now that's here.

419
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:42,030
I'm proud of you, man.

420
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,839
I always knew you'd be
a great hematologist, but...

421
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:48,048
What? You didn't think I would
cure sickle cell anemia?

422
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,224
Have you?

423
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,909
We've completed
our gene therapy protocol

424
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,418
in a total of five patients.

425
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:57,424
All are currently
leading normal lives.

426
00:19:57,543 --> 00:20:00,377
No more symptoms, no pain.
Did you get a chance

427
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:02,963
to look at my patient's
medical chart that I sent you?

428
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:05,683
Yes. Keep in mind it doesn't
normally happen this fast.

429
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,349
But we did just have
somebody drop out,

430
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:10,409
and, I mean,
Rose is a perfect candidate.

431
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:14,058
That said, I mean,
these are uncharted waters.

432
00:20:14,143 --> 00:20:16,302
There is a chance... slight...

433
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,434
That a patient could
come out worse.

434
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:20,126
They could die.

435
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,238
A lot of hospitals won't risk
hosting our trials.

436
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:25,387
But you think Chastain should?

437
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,827
Not think. Need.

438
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,746
I know it's a lot to ask.

439
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:32,878
But if I can convince your CEO
to become a site in this trial,

440
00:20:32,963 --> 00:20:34,146
we would be one step closer

441
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,823
to eradicating sickle cell
from Atlanta.

442
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:42,424
Look, I can probably get you
in the room,

443
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,661
but Kit Voss...
She's a different kind of CEO.

444
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,488
If she even suspects, Phillip,

445
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,004
that this is about money
or profit...

446
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:52,340
Just-just give me
a chance, okay?

447
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,914
I will nail it, and then
you and me, Pravesh,

448
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:58,202
we'll start changing the world.

449
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,659
Ah.

450
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,942
We've taken enough time
on your last day, AJ.

451
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:11,037
You don't have to do this.
Of course I don't have to, Ma.

452
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:13,614
I want to.
You know, today made me realize

453
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:15,290
that I've not spent enough
quality time

454
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,042
- with you and Dad before I left.
- Oh.

455
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:20,769
I just want to make sure you
get back, settled safely.

456
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:22,929
We won't complain
about more time now, will we?

457
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,173
I want to apologize
for all day, really.

458
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:30,894
Mom, you have nothing
to apologize for.

459
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:32,866
Yes, I do.

460
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,198
Ever since you told us
you were leaving, AJ,

461
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:37,417
all I've thought about
is myself.

462
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:39,304
About my own distress.

463
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:40,814
About how much I'll miss you.

464
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:43,472
But I should be happy for you,

465
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:45,545
about the adventures
you'll be having

466
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,456
with your darling Mina
at your side.

467
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:52,652
Can you forgive your mother
for her selfishness?

468
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,089
Of course, Ma.

469
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,105
You okay, babe?

470
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,565
Mm-mm.

471
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,344
Take a deep breath.

472
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:16,995
Mom, we need to get you
back to Chastain.

473
00:22:26,363 --> 00:22:28,530
You can say the words out loud.

474
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:33,206
My mother has a tumor
in her lung.

475
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:36,206
AJ, I'm-I'm so sorry.

476
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:39,533
How could I have
not seen this?

477
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:41,202
When she came into the ER,

478
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:44,546
the exams and bloodwork we did
would not have caught this,

479
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:46,435
but now we know.

480
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,134
So we take this
one step at a time

481
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:51,011
and we focus on the
circumstances in front of us.

482
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:53,871
I'll do the surgery myself.

483
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,558
You know that's not possible.
It's a conflict of interest.

484
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:02,144
We do the surgery and the biopsy
at the same time.

485
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:05,125
She'll need a segmentectomy
to remove the growth fully

486
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,198
and maybe a lobectomy.

487
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:09,144
She needs the best hands
we got, Hawkins.

488
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:11,253
So let me do it.

489
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,497
Thank you.

490
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:25,644
Now I have to go tell her.

491
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:37,479
I don't understand.

492
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,964
A tumor in my lung?

493
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:43,738
I've never smoked.

494
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,515
And it could be benign,

495
00:23:45,823 --> 00:23:49,103
just a harmless growth,
but we don't know.

496
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,543
And we can't diagnose it
from imaging alone,

497
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:53,511
so we need to do a biopsy
just to be sure.

498
00:23:53,706 --> 00:23:56,859
- You gonna do it now?
- Yeah, you know, the sooner, the better.

499
00:23:57,012 --> 00:23:59,947
Now, the good news is,
as far as we can tell,

500
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:01,531
we caught it early.

501
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:03,183
It looks localized.

502
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:05,111
AJ.

503
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:06,937
I need to know...

504
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:10,131
what are my chances?

505
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:14,730
Mom, biopsy first.

506
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,224
Mina will do it.
She is the absolute best.

507
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:20,124
So let's get our facts straight,

508
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:22,852
and then we'll talk
about possibilities.

509
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,266
It's going to be okay.

510
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:30,485
We are in this together.

511
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,736
Look, this is not
about the money.

512
00:24:39,888 --> 00:24:41,404
And I know
when somebody says that,

513
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:43,074
it is always about the money.

514
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:45,507
Then what is this about,
Mr. Bondman?

515
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:47,662
You're looking at me,
and you're thinking,

516
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:49,923
"What is this white guy
from Harvard doing,

517
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:53,098
trying to cure a predominantly
African American disease?"

518
00:24:53,183 --> 00:24:56,715
Well, I'll be honest with you,
it was a calculated decision.

519
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,965
The technology is here...
CRISPR, gene therapy.

520
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,668
There is a badly
underserved population.

521
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:05,036
And if Bio South can solve
this problem,

522
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,396
we would have the momentum
and the money to solve others.

523
00:25:07,481 --> 00:25:09,441
Bio South, Phillip Bondman

524
00:25:09,526 --> 00:25:12,068
would become synonymous
with curing people.

525
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:15,176
I appreciate the honesty.

526
00:25:15,777 --> 00:25:18,117
But does this give Rose
a fighting chance

527
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:21,559
- at battling her disease?
- Yes, it does.

528
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:22,937
And not just Rose.

529
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,782
We're a public hospital now,
so we're serving

530
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:26,801
large sickle cell populations

531
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:29,980
that can really benefit
from Phillip's work here.

532
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:39,331
I want a cure, of course.

533
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:43,217
And Rose deserves nothing less.

534
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:46,286
But getting into bed
with Big Pharma...

535
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:49,772
With all due respect,
Bio South is not Big Pharma.

536
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:51,799
We couldn't be further from it.

537
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,527
We are small, we're scrappy...

538
00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:56,813
...and we want to do good.

539
00:25:56,965 --> 00:25:58,147
<i>So, what did you say?</i>

540
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:59,567
That I'd consider it.

541
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:00,994
In a perfect world,
there wouldn't be

542
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,693
a financial incentive
to make better medicine.

543
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:04,222
Yeah, but that's not
the world we live in,

544
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:07,657
so what harm is there
in giving the guy a chance?

545
00:26:07,863 --> 00:26:09,918
The harm is, history is littered

546
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,662
with examples of
dubious advancements in science

547
00:26:12,814 --> 00:26:15,339
coming at the cost
of a vulnerable population.

548
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:18,019
The Tuskegee syphilis
experiment, Henrietta Lacks...

549
00:26:18,104 --> 00:26:19,621
Yeah, yeah, but in this case,

550
00:26:19,706 --> 00:26:21,550
the patients have
the most to gain.

551
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,881
You know, a-a...
a cure for an ancient disease...

552
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,649
How amazing would that be?

553
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:30,171
It could also be
an opportunity to show

554
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,773
that this is a new Chastain.

555
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:35,878
One that will go to the ends
of the earth for its patients.

556
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,221
It sounds to me like
you've already made your decision.

557
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:46,792
AJ, if something happens
to me, I...

558
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:48,790
Now, don't talk like that, Ma.

559
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,533
This is not
our last conversation.

560
00:26:50,627 --> 00:26:53,863
All right?
No one is dying here.

561
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:55,141
I know, AJ.

562
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:58,753
But I need you to hear
one thing.

563
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:02,011
Please, son,
whatever happens to me...

564
00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:05,381
I want you to go with Mina.

565
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:07,256
Be happy.

566
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:10,228
Live your life.
This is important.

567
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,983
You deserve joy.

568
00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:17,736
Thank you, Ma.

569
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,500
Hey, Leela?

570
00:27:57,838 --> 00:27:59,823
Hey.
Yes, Dr. Pravesh?

571
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:02,542
Um...

572
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,840
this is gonna sound weird,

573
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:08,762
but I am working with
a matchmaker, and on her site,

574
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:10,538
you-you...
Oh, God.

575
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:12,659
You saw my photo?

576
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,033
Yeah.

577
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:16,818
Is that what you were looking at
with Mina earlier?

578
00:28:16,902 --> 00:28:19,817
Oh, that's... that's embarrassing.

579
00:28:19,902 --> 00:28:22,934
Um, I never go on that thing.

580
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:25,113
My dad wants me
to have an arranged marriage,

581
00:28:25,198 --> 00:28:27,231
like my parents did,
so I just humor him,

582
00:28:27,316 --> 00:28:30,317
but any time that matchmaker
offers anybody up,

583
00:28:30,402 --> 00:28:31,800
I just say, "No way."

584
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:34,917
- Mm.
- I don't have time for it, and it's just... it's...

585
00:28:36,488 --> 00:28:38,285
Oh, wait. Are you...

586
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,460
- you looking to get... married?
- No, no.

587
00:28:41,643 --> 00:28:44,003
No, no.
Uh, same as you.

588
00:28:44,152 --> 00:28:46,271
My mom... she just keeps pushing
and pushing, you know.

589
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:48,117
- Indian parents, right?
- Yeah.

590
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,704
Yeah.

591
00:28:51,084 --> 00:28:52,918
Okay.
Okay.

592
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:54,606
Later, Dr. Pravesh.

593
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,751
- See you.
- Okay.

594
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:05,001
There's the mass.

595
00:29:05,153 --> 00:29:08,096
Let's biopsy. Forceps.

596
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:19,019
Oh, you've come a long way since
our first operation together.

597
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:21,636
Ah, seriously, you, too?

598
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:23,208
You know, I know
I was never your mentor...

599
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:24,629
More like your tormentor...

600
00:29:24,714 --> 00:29:27,481
So it's not my place
to be proud, but I am.

601
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:29,371
I'm gonna miss working with you.

602
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:32,745
Who else would have shown me
what not to do?

603
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,231
Let's get that to the lab.

604
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:39,011
See what we're dealing with.

605
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:42,948
Can you move your toes for me?

606
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,386
I can't thank you enough.

607
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:52,392
Well, you have Dr. Sutton
here to thank.

608
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:54,458
She's the one
who saved Lisa's life.

609
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:56,612
Just don't go falling off
any more diving boards.

610
00:29:56,697 --> 00:29:59,640
I can't
believe I was so stupid.

611
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,398
Ah, don't beat yourself up. We
all do stupid stuff at your age.

612
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,276
But the good news is,

613
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:08,994
they removed the bone fragments
that were compressing your spine.

614
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:11,652
With some time
and aggressive therapy,

615
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:14,070
you'll be good as new.

616
00:30:14,308 --> 00:30:16,149
That is wonderful news.

617
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:18,375
And your boss dropped this off.

618
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,024
It's the first paycheck?

619
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,008
First and last. Um, I got fired.

620
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:24,685
I'm sorry to hear that.

621
00:30:25,944 --> 00:30:28,843
I thought I knew what this
summer was going to look like.

622
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:31,624
Make some money, get a tan,

623
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,281
sneak in a couple
of night swims at closing.

624
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,945
Probably sounds silly.

625
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,391
Take it from me.

626
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:40,147
Even the best laid plans
fall apart.

627
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,109
Things change.

628
00:30:42,194 --> 00:30:43,524
You lose a job.

629
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:45,860
But the people that love you
stick by your side.

630
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,793
They do.

631
00:30:49,023 --> 00:30:51,452
And that's a beautiful thing.

632
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,234
I can't even believe it.

633
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,657
You'll start the
trial next week. It's fast.

634
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:01,317
Most people have to wait months,
but there's an opening.

635
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:04,162
Yeah, and it's gonna be
a long, hard road, and nothing

636
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:05,916
is guaranteed, Rose.
But I have a chance?

637
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,400
Oh, you have more
than just a chance.

638
00:31:07,484 --> 00:31:09,751
You have a damn good chance.

639
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:15,833
Barrett?

640
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,761
Go.

641
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:21,263
We'll be in touch.
Thank you so much.

642
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:25,851
You'll never guess
what just happened.

643
00:31:26,002 --> 00:31:29,521
I've been accepted into
a gene therapy clinical trial.

644
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,516
That could work.

645
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,177
Chances are slim, but...
that could work.

646
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,593
This is a big deal.

647
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:38,757
Aren't you happy for me?

648
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:41,209
Yes, of course
I'm happy for you, Rose.

649
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,280
I'm happy for you.

650
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:45,871
Wait.

651
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:47,944
I don't know
what's going on with you,

652
00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:50,184
but if there's a light
at the end of my tunnel,

653
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:52,102
there's a light at the end
of yours, too.

654
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:54,124
And what if there is no light?

655
00:31:54,352 --> 00:31:56,536
What if I just have
to face the facts?

656
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,522
Own up to the truth
that I'm not who I once was?

657
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:02,387
You're more than just a surgeon.

658
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,272
Am I?

659
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:08,952
Look, I'm gonna go to Waylon's

660
00:32:09,037 --> 00:32:12,048
and eat my weight
in pretzels and beer cheese.

661
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:13,807
There's a big world
outside of the OR.

662
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:17,293
If you want to see it,
that's where I'll be.

663
00:32:18,244 --> 00:32:19,929
I'd like that.

664
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:26,374
Pleural studding,

665
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,497
too small to have been detected
on imaging.

666
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:30,288
Well, whatever it is,
it's already spread.

667
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:33,272
It's much worse than we hoped.

668
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,421
It's adenocarcinoma.

669
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:41,835
I'm so sorry, Mina.

670
00:32:46,155 --> 00:32:48,640
Well, we can't cut
all of this out.

671
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:50,515
Um, let's close up.

672
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:53,483
No reason to put her through
the rest of this surgery.

673
00:33:21,077 --> 00:33:23,911
The biopsy confirmed it.

674
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:30,054
Your mother has
stage IV lung cancer.

675
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:33,638
If she's a candidate
for target therapy,

676
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:35,663
Carol will have years.

677
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,401
Many years.

678
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:47,093
You and I both know
the average life expectancy...

679
00:33:47,888 --> 00:33:50,047
is two years.

680
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:52,202
She's not average.

681
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:56,249
She's resilient, strong.

682
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:01,100
I know that
because she raised you.

683
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:07,022
If anyone could beat this,
it's Carol.

684
00:34:11,094 --> 00:34:14,663
Your mother needs you.

685
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:19,702
In Atlanta, by her side.

686
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:25,880
You cannot come to Nigeria
with me.

687
00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:34,614
I know.

688
00:34:34,988 --> 00:34:36,889
I wish things
didn't have to be this way.

689
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:39,176
I wish I didn't have
to leave Chastain.

690
00:34:42,716 --> 00:34:44,153
Leave you.

691
00:34:45,514 --> 00:34:47,197
I will do anything

692
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:49,465
to be with you through this.

693
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:56,301
Maybe one day
I could come back.

694
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:08,090
Yeah.

695
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:13,914
Maybe.

Mina Okafor's
infamous one-star Yelp review!

748
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,474
"Steer clear of Dr. Okafor.

749
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,567
She told me my uterus sucked."

750
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:10,320
It did suck.

751
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:13,675
Ah, we love you.

752

754
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,354
Speech!

755
00:38:27,398 --> 00:38:29,398
Okay.

756
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:32,499
I'm not gonna stand here and...

757
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:35,021
give some speech about
how much you all mean to me

758
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:36,479
and how much I'll miss you,

759
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,498
because that's not who I am.

760
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,601

762
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:46,416
You all know that.

763
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:53,866
You know exactly who I am,

764
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:57,804
and yet you still care about me.

765
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:00,723
