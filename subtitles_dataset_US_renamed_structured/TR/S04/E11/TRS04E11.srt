00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:03,430
My entire life,
I've wanted

3
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:04,977
to be a surgeon,
despite knowing

4
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:07,664
- I have one big obstacle to overcome.
- You're dyslexic.

5
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:10,602
Tina's baby will go
to a traditional family.

6
00:00:10,687 --> 00:00:11,418
I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,763
I don't know
what's going on with you,

8
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,243
but I'm gonna go to Waylon's.

9
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:15,758
Big world outside of the OR.

10
00:00:15,843 --> 00:00:17,586
If you want to see it,
that's where I'll be.

11
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:18,391
I'd like that.

12
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,821
Your mother has lung cancer.

13
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:22,282
You cannot come

didn't have to be this way.</i>

<i>I wish I didn't have

18
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:36,149

20
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:41,140
I think Fritz got a little wet,

21
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:44,915
but otherwise we are all okay.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,360
Good. Here.

23
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:47,918
Thank you.

24
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,790
Hi, buddy.

25
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:52,544
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, little wet? That's okay.

26
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:55,220
Look at you getting all wet.

27
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:59,299
Hey... how about you don't
go into work today?

28
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:01,134
Fritz needs you.

29
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,581
Well, the tornado's not supposed
to touch down

30
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,999
anywhere near us.

31
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:07,753
Anyway, we're just as safe
at Chastain as we are here.

32
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:09,540
Yeah, I was just thinking,

33
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:12,142
with all of your extra shifts,
it's been a while since

34
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:13,484
I've seen you stand still.

35
00:01:13,714 --> 00:01:16,649
Got to keep busy,
otherwise all I think about

36
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,035
are all of the ways in which
we could have kept Mina here.

37
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:23,056
We did everything we could.

38
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:26,462
Doesn't feel like it.

39
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:36,932
What's that?

40
00:01:37,017 --> 00:01:38,310
It's from Mina.

41
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:41,135
She told me to give it to you
if you started...

42
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,361
- Spinning out?
- No. Yeah.

43
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:44,949
Very funny.

44
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:48,212
"Dear Nic...

45
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,783
"Please stop doing that thing
you do when you feel guilty

46
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:54,510
"where you can't sit still.

47
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:55,626
Hmm.

48
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:58,610
"I know you need permission
to let things go, so here,

49
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,624
"unclench your fist,
let it go.

50
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:06,509
Last thing I want is to be an
anchor around your neck. Mina."

51
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,618
She knows you almost as well
as I do.

52
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:14,954
We better get going.

53
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,733

71
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:43,876
and is now just outside
metro Atlanta.

72
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,608
We're expecting a mass increase
of catastrophic injuries.

73
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:47,823
Pull out the disaster carts.

74
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:49,219
Prepare the portable monitors.

75
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:51,603
- Clear the hallways.
- Let's move, people!

76
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:53,405
We have incoming.

77
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,460
Hey, Piper, Wes,
let's take her to Bay Four.

78
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:58,882
Seven-year-old girl,
severe abdominal pain,

79
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,186
nausea, vomiting.

80
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,913
Slightly hypertensive. 400cc's
normal saline given en route.

81
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:05,432
We wouldn't have brought her in
because of the tornado,

82
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:07,367
but she collapsed;
We didn't know what to do.

83
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,789
Uh, Dr. Bell is our doctor.

84
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:10,604
- We left him a message.
- I can let him know you're here.

85
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:12,205
- Thank you.
- On my count.

86
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,715
One, two, three.

87
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,817
Hey, I'm Dr. Feldman.

88
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:19,319
I'm gonna listen to
your heart and lungs, okay?

89
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:23,240
- Hi. - Hey.
- Hey.

90
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:25,483
What's going on, Sammie?

91
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:27,029
<i>Ni hao,</i> Dr. Bell.

92
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:29,698
It's her stomach pain.
It's never been this bad.

93
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:31,858
And she's been having
constant nosebleeds

94
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:32,875
these past few days.

95
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:34,578
Is it the tumors?
Do you think they're getting worse?

96
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:36,030
Maybe, but we'll admit her

97
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:37,755
and look into why
this is happening.

98
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:41,042
Sammie has a history
of abdominal cancer.

99
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:43,186
The Ackermanns recently
adopted her from China.

100
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:45,475
So let's finish the exam
and I'll get a hold of Dr. Wong

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,758
for an urgent ENT consult.

102
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:55,381
Problems with parking?

103
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:58,474
So far so good.

104
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:01,463
Please have a seat, Dr. Cain.

105
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:07,512
Dr. Sutton is your
new resident.

106
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:09,872
No, she isn't.
I work alone.

107
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:12,756
It's my call.
You've had residents before.

108
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:14,599
Yes, and they almost
killed me on the table.

109
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:16,354
Now you want me
to mentor someone

110
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:18,764
who's gunning for my job.
No, thank you.

111
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:20,731
There's a lot I can learn
from you.

112
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:22,239
I'm not looking
to take your job.

113
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:24,114
Either you're lying
or you lack ambition.

114
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,561
Either way, pass.

115
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,654
I haven't had a good
run with attendings either.

116
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:29,428
They seem hellbent
on ending my career.

117
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:31,201
Is this you selling yourself?

118
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:33,936
This is me being truthful.
It's how I roll.

119
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:35,692
Make it work.

120
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:37,375
Both of you.

121
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:43,536
Oh, God.

122
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:45,985
It's a tornado.

123
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,013
It's coming right at us.

124
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:53,206
<i>Code Yellow.
Please seek immediate shelter.</i>

125
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,794
Sir, we need to go.

126
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,098
What's going on?

127
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,045
Leela, we have to go.
We're in the path of a tornado.

128
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,129
I know, I know.

129
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:00,639
I'm just trying
to get him to come down.

130
00:06:00,723 --> 00:06:02,457
Just gotta finish one thing.

131
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,743
Get down!

132
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:21,576
Everyone move quickly and
safely, everyone take cover!

133
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:23,527
Come on, come on, hurry!

134
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:25,709
Everyone take cover, take cover!

135
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:28,387
- Safely and quickly, please.
- Come on. Com e on.

136
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:33,001
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Are you sure everyone's okay?

137
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:34,413
- Here, take these.
- Here.

138
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:36,084
- Here we go.
- Take these.

139
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:37,435
- Get away from the glass.
- Get away from the glass!

140
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,161
- Come on, hurry!
- Check everyone's okay

141
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:40,271
- in that direction. Thank you.
- Get in the corner.

142
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,765
This way. Go this way.

143
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,607
Thank you.

144
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:49,148
Get away from the glass!

145
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:50,755
Get away from the glass!

146
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:55,760
Hey, hey, hey! Guys, hey!

147
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:58,354
- Got to get away from there.
- Get away from the glass!

148
00:06:58,448 --> 00:06:59,998
Get away from the glass!

All right.

164
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:14,109
We should take a look at those.

165

00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:33,227
How's the rest of the hospital?

174
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,571
Still assessing, but it seems
like most of the medicine

175
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,491
and surgery floors
were left unharmed.

176
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:40,148
Let's triage the red critical
patients to the PACU.

177
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,578
Yellows to the atrium,
greens to the cafeteria.

178
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:44,588
We're gonna need more hands.

179
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:50,278
Hey. You okay?

180
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:55,091
I think so. Are you?

181
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,980
Yeah. We got lucky.

182
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,794
Where's the guy that was
working on the lights?

183
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:02,895
He was right behind us.

184
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,239
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

185
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:16,144
- Headache...
- Okay.

186
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:19,371
- Can you tell me your name?
- Ted.

187
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:22,558
Okay, Ted, listen to me

188
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:25,473
and just take it easy, okay?

189
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:27,520
You have a metal rod
lodged in your skull,

190
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:29,481
so I need to gently
elevate your head.

191
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:30,686
We need to elevate his head.

192
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:32,862
Okay, right here. Here.

193
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,306
All right. Ready?

194
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,224
One, two...

195
00:09:36,638 --> 00:09:38,413
- Okay.
- There we go.

196
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:41,140
All right, Ted, look at me.
Good, good, good.

197
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:44,457
Deep breath.

198
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:46,569
Damn. He needs surgery.

199
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,733
We need to get him
out of here.

200
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:57,404
We're gonna get you out of here.

201
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,661
Damn it.

202
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:03,022
We're trapped.

203
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:05,352
No one even knows we're here.

204
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:10,764
Conrad, Nic.

205
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,290
The ambulance bay roof
collapsed.

206
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,809
I was out for a beat,
but Piper's hurt real bad.

207
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:22,021
Her leg is trapped under
the wall; I couldn't free her.

208
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:24,514
- Piper, I got help.
- This isn't good.

209
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:27,311
Hey, Wes, we need a tourniquet,
an IV kit and some fluids.

210
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:28,831
All right?

211
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,350
Weak radial pulse.

212
00:10:31,553 --> 00:10:34,700
- Anything else hurt?
- Just my leg.

213
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,444
She's going
into hemorrhagic shock.

214
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:39,108
She can't afford to lose
any more blood.

215
00:10:39,193 --> 00:10:42,928
- Tourniquet.
- You are gonna be fine.

216
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,265
Worst-case scenario,
you get some well-deserved

217
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,359
time off with pay.

218
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:49,491
Wes can find the upside
to anything.

219
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:51,639
It's nauseating.

220
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:54,398
I could use a little time
away from you, Pollyanna.

221
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:56,201
I mean, you guys
have been working together

222
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:57,844
for about a decade now.

223
00:11:03,418 --> 00:11:05,492
Tourniquet's on,
but it's not stopping the bleed.

224
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,243
We've done
everything we can out here.

225
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:09,086
We need to get her inside.

226
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:11,326
Wes, give me a hand?

227
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:15,092
Help me get this thing
off of her.

228
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,806
Damn it, the cell service
is still down.

229
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,947
He's having a seizure.

230
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:42,306
We need Cain or he's gonna die.

231
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,965
Ugh...

232
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:52,464
Damn it.

233
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,859
We should reduce the fracture.

234
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,064
That might buy us
some more time.

235
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,993
- Wes, you ready?
- You are now officially

236
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:05,577
the most needy patient
I've ever had.

237
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:09,533
Mm. Last thing
I wanted to do is die needy.

238
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:11,627
Not gonna happen, Pipe.

239
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:15,165
All right, you ready?

240
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:19,189
Okay. One,

241
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:22,101
two...

242
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:32,673
It's better,
but she's losing a lot of blood.

243
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,708
Guys, I-I don't feel so good.

244
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,366
We lost the pulse.

245
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:39,886
Grab the defibrillator.

246
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:41,298
Starting compressions.

247
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:43,756
We have to amputate
her leg before she bleeds out.

248
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:45,322
Wes, have someone page Dr. Voss.

249
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,218
We need her now.

250
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:50,665
Damage could've been much worse.

251
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,556
Guess only one side
of the hospital got hit.

252
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:53,923
Tell me about the patient.

253
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:57,903
I got a ridiculous consult
about a woman with sickle cell

254
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:01,673
who's here for myeloablative
chemo prior to gene therapy.

255
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:03,692
Rose Williams?

256
00:13:03,777 --> 00:13:05,052
Yeah. How do you know her?

257
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:07,626
- What happened?
- She fell and bonked her head.

258
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,259
I told them maybe don't call

259
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:11,371
unless there's an actual
neurosurgical problem, but...

260
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:13,946
No. We'll see her.

261
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:16,323
<i>Dr. Ward,
please come to admitting</i>

262
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:18,532
<i>for a new patient assessment.</i>

263
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,304
Rose.

264
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:26,501
This is Dr. Sutton, my resident.

265
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:27,642
Tell us what happened.

266
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:29,727
Oh, it's so stupid.

267
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:32,180
I fell in the bathroom
and hit my head.

268
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:33,889
I'm sure I'm fine.

269
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:35,548
Okay, well, we'll just see.

270
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:41,866
Full power's back on.

271
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:45,210
I see you started chemo.

272
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:47,312
Yeah. They're blasting my marrow

273
00:13:47,397 --> 00:13:49,400
and preparing me
for gene therapy.

274
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:51,275
I knew it'd be tough, but...

275
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:54,932
...this is really doing
a number on me.

276
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,173
Well, if anyone
can handle it, it's you.

277
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,871
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive.

278
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,890
Can you follow my finger?

279
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:06,672
I haven't seen you
since Waylon's.

280
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:12,056
Yeah, I'm sorry, I've just been,
been really busy.

281
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:14,249
Listen, given the effects
that the chemo

282
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:17,669
is having on your bone marrow,
I want to get you a head CT.

283
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:20,244
Dr. Sutton can finish the exam.

284
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,407
- Squeeze my fingers, please?
- Uh...

285
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:31,626
So, Sammie's nose just started
bleeding on its own?

286
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:33,540
Yeah, apparently,
it's been happening

287
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,173
- like this a lot lately.
- Okay, just...

288
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:39,158
All right, just let me know
if this hurts, okay?

289
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,853
Oh, I'm sorry, she might
not have understood you.

290
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:45,045
We've only had her six months,
and, uh, she hasn't really

291
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:47,494
picked up English
as quickly as we'd hoped.

292
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,212
It's a big adjustment.

293
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:07,165
Um, what happened
to her biological parents?

294
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,509
Uh, we-we didn't ask.

295
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,458
Well, they didn't tell us. We...

296
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:12,979
We were just so thrilled
there was a healthy little girl

297
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:15,001
waiting for us, and...

298
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:16,237
the first moment we met her,

299
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:18,223
- we fell in love with her.
- She passed out

300
00:15:18,307 --> 00:15:19,755
a couple of days
after we got her home.

301
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,837
We took her to the ER
and found out

302
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,853
she had tumors
everywhere in her body.

303
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:27,136
They told us to take
her home, make her comfortable

304
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,540
- for her last few months.
- That's when we found Dr. Bell,

305
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,244
and he said he could treat her.

306
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,189
Well, I-I said

307
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:37,276
I might be able to perform
a very risky surgery

308
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:38,768
that's only been done
a few times before.

309
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:41,429
There's, uh, t-there's a lot
we need to go over

310
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:42,754
- before we proceed.
- Yeah, uh,

311
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,254
this is more than just
an ordinary nosebleed.

312
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:47,496
- Yeah, I thought so.
- Sammie? - Oh, my God.

313
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,681
- Sammie, baby, are you okay?
- You okay?

314
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,733
It's a bit cramped.

315
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:00,301
I've amputated limbs

316
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:02,820
- under worse circumstances.
- All right.

317
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,681
Please, save her.

318
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:07,968
We're gonna do
everything we can.

319
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,783
Saline.

320
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:44,337
One, two, three.
Let's go. Yep, yep.

321
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:01,384
<i>Code Yellow. All visitors,</i>

322
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:02,996
<i>remain in the hospital.</i>

323
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:05,081
<i>Do not attempt to leave
the hospital.</i>

324
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:08,514
Dude, sorry about Mina.

325
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,168
Must be rough.

326
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:11,607
How you holding up?

327
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:14,151
On the bright side,
maybe we can go get

328
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:15,534
that drink we were talking
about getting, you know?

329
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,618
Do some sharing.

330
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:19,173
Go on about your business,
Nolan.

331
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,688
Yep... That thing? Okay.

332
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:26,888
Yeah, I feel you, man.
I have had it up to here

333
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:28,908
with the sad looks
from people

334
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:30,744
about losing the baby
we were gonna adopt.

335
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,151
I loathe pity.

336
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:33,799
- Yeah, me, too.
- Look, I'm thinking

337
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:35,298
you can both
use a distraction.

338
00:17:35,383 --> 00:17:38,867
This is imaging of my
seven-year-old patient Sammie.

339
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:41,963
Tumor in the pancreas
wrapped around the stomach,

340
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:44,633
liver, spleen,
large and small intestines.

341
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,726
This is inoperable.

342
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:48,247
It's an inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumor.

343
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,404
It's a death sentence.

344
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:52,892
Unless we can tag you in.

345
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:54,950
Are you talking
auto-transplantation?

346
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:57,406
Pioneered by
the legendary Dr. Kato

347
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:59,065
at Columbia Presbyterian.

348
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:02,115
You want to take out
all of her abdominal organs,

349
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:05,360
extract the tumors and then
put the organs back in her body?

350
00:18:05,454 --> 00:18:07,862
Yeah, this is
the highest-risk surgery

351
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,438
any of us will ever perform.

352
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:10,509
And I-I wanted to wait,

353
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:13,103
but the tumors have occluded

354
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:14,429
the spleno-mesenteric junction.

355
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:16,771
Her liver is failing,
clotting factors are low

356
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:18,496
and she's bleeding
uncontrollably.

357
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:20,401
That means she has
to have the surgery today.

358
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:22,153
We're the only chance she's got.

359
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:26,612
Well, say no more.
Let's go save a life.

360
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:37,332
She likes you.

361
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:40,361
She seems lovely.

362
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,624
You like her?

363
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:44,394
I'm only asking

364
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,893
because she couldn't
take her eyes off you,

365
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:48,136
and you couldn't bolt
out of there fast enough.

366
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:54,198
Geez. Patients fall
for their doctors all the time,

367
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:55,818
and vice versa.
What's the big deal?

368
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:58,913
First off, she's not
actually my patient.

369
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:02,008
Second, mind your own business.

370
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:04,078
When you tell someone
to mind their own business,

371
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:06,636
it just confirms what it is
you don't want them to think.

372
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:09,496
How I feel about Rose,
and how I choose

373
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,824
to interact with her
is not something

374
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:14,095
I need to explain to a resident.

375
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,807
Mind your business.

376
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:27,159
I don't see anything. You?

377
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:29,095
No bleeds.

378
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:31,004
We'll need to monitor her.

379
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,158
<i>Dr. Cain?</i>

380
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,496
Thank God. I'm with Dr. Devi
in the sim lab.

381
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:41,855
We're trapped with a patient who
has a penetrating head trauma.

382
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,706
He's status
post-grand mal seizure

383
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,534
and he's decompensating.

384
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,011
I just sent you a photo.

385
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:50,123
Okay, by the locations,

386
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,533
my money's on
an epidural hematoma

387
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:53,877
with middle meningeal
artery laceration.

388
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:56,026
You need to get him
to an OR immediately.

389
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,620
There's significant debris from
the tornado blocking the door.

390
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:00,768
<i>We won't be able to get out.</i>

391
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,401
From Kit. ER's overwhelmed.

392
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:04,893
I-I got to get down there.

393
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:07,659
I'll have a crew send someone
to free them, okay?

394
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:10,772
Dr. Devi, you are
a surgical intern.

395
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:12,362
I need you to start cutting now.

396
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:14,138
<i>- This can't wait.</i>
- Here in the sim lab?

397
00:20:14,223 --> 00:20:17,801
<i>Yes. Find any type of surgical
equipment that you can use.</i>

398
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:20,746
<i>What's the status
on the patient?</i>

399
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,331
He's unresponsive
to painful stimuli.

400
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,221
<i>What else have you got,
equipment-wise?</i>

401
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:32,816
Sutures and gloves.
Scalpels and surgical equipment

402
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:34,427
are in the cabinet
but we can't get to it.

403
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:36,402
Okay, listen to me,
you cannot do this

404
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,785
<i>- without the right tools.</i>
- We do have sheets

405
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,144
- and pillowcases.
<i>- Okay, great.</i>

406
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:40,700
Great, great.
Lay those around the patient.

407
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:42,276
<i>How about sterilization?</i>

408
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,972
- Hand sanitizer.
<i>- Okay.</i>

409
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:46,823
So here's the deal.
If you remove that rod,

410
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,293
he could die of exsanguination.

411
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:50,858
<i>If you don't,
he can die of herniation.</i>

412
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,801
I want to do whatever gives him
the best shot at survival.

413
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,022
Just tell us what to do,
Dr. Cain.

414
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:56,628
And speak fast
before we lose you.

415
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,862
Okay, remove that rod.
But then you'll need to remove

416
00:20:58,947 --> 00:21:00,948
a section of the skull around
the impalement.

417
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:03,233
<i>Do you have anything else
in that room that you can use?</i>

418
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:05,327
We have a toolbox.

419
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:09,781
Power drill.

420
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:13,556
Pliers.

421
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,167
X-Acto.

422
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:18,292
<i>Okay, that's not ideal,
but it's gonna have to work.</i>

423
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:20,129
<i>Once you take out that rod,</i>

424
00:21:20,223 --> 00:21:22,621
<i>you have to stop the bleeding
inside the cranial vault.</i>

425
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:24,651
Fingers crossed that
that artery's still intact.

426
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:25,987
Then you're gonna remove

427
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:27,738
<i>all of those bone fragments.</i>

428
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:29,148
<i>You have to be very...</i>

429
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:30,949
Dr. Cain.

430
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:34,307
Damn it. We lost him.

431
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:36,940
We're on our own.

432
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:52,338
Hi. Hey, uh, why don't you go

433
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:54,096
scrub and I'll catch up.

434
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:55,714
Okay.

435
00:22:18,683 --> 00:22:20,249
Hmm?

436
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:50,134
Okay.

437
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:52,279
It has to be you.

438
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:54,263
I haven't been in surgery
since med school.

439
00:22:56,302 --> 00:22:57,744
Hey, can you hear me?

440
00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:59,326
Whole wall's collapsed.

441
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,747
At least an hour, maybe more.

442
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:02,934
Oh, God.

443
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:07,420
Listen, I know you're scared,

444
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:08,961
but you have to do this now.

445
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:10,813
I'm not scared of anything.

446
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:13,571
But rushing me won't help.

447
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:15,579
Leela, what's happening?

448
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:16,841
Tell me what to do, come on.

449
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:19,349
My brain needs more time
to process one new thing

450
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:22,427
and this is... many.

451
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:24,877
Okay.

452
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:27,879
Visualize a quadrant
around the rod.

453
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:32,832
Imagine drilling a hole
in all four corners.

454
00:23:34,268 --> 00:23:36,981
And then we cut open the bone.

455
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:38,754
We get underneath it.

456
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,030
And...

457
00:23:40,115 --> 00:23:42,145
Extract the rod
and stop the bleeding.

458
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:07,022
Vascular clamping complete.

459
00:24:07,174 --> 00:24:09,325
Yeah, let's remove the organs.

460
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:17,889
I know as a surgeon,
we're supposed to play it cool.

461
00:24:17,974 --> 00:24:20,466
But this is insane.

462
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:22,740
Yeah, the clock is ticking.
Let's resect

463
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,715
the tumors on the back table,
then...

464
00:24:25,183 --> 00:24:27,627
get the organs
back inside her body.

465
00:24:27,712 --> 00:24:30,653
I'll begin
the portal vein reconstruction.

466
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:37,175
Dr. Austin, are you okay?

467
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:41,766
What about me suggests
that I'm not okay, Jessica?

468
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,258
Am I not elbow deep
in a child's abdominal cavity

469
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,368
doing the work of gods?

470
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:52,981
- Am I sad?
- Yes.

471
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,302
Do I feel as empty
as this poor child?

472
00:24:56,387 --> 00:24:57,614
Yes.

473
00:24:57,699 --> 00:25:00,294
Do I need people
constantly reminding me

474
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:03,177
that I've been mortally wounded
by the loss of love?

475
00:25:03,262 --> 00:25:05,145
No!

476
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:11,917
Uh...

477
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:14,708
my bad, Jessica.

478
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:16,697
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm fine.

479
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:18,448
Okay. Bovie?

480
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:20,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

481
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,121
Piper's blood pressure's
failing.

482
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:31,060
- I think I see the source.
- I'll keep transfusing,

483
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:32,709
but her body's starting
to shut down.

484
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:35,253
She can't afford
to lose any more blood.

485
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:37,801
There goes another one.

486
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:39,640
We didn't amputate Piper's leg

487
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:41,433
just to let her die
on the table.

488
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,265
She's going into V tach.

489
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:46,543
We need to speed this up.

490
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:54,192
Okay, let's get the bar
out of his head.

491
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:01,841
Steady hands.

492
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:04,754
You move it even one millimeter
in the wrong direction,

493
00:26:04,848 --> 00:26:06,332
it could be catastrophic.

494
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:08,427
Look, you got this.

495
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:10,903
I'll hold his head.

496
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:35,497
No major bleeding.

497
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:38,216
Okay, now we have to remove

498
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:40,450
the remaining bone fragments.

499
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:47,654
The tumors are resected.

500
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,100
Yeah, we're running out of time.

501
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:50,880
She needs these organs
re-implanted now.

502
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:53,747
The bad news is
the tumors eviscerated

503
00:26:53,832 --> 00:26:55,879
her pancreas,
spleen and stomach.

504
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,270
The good news is
we still have enough healthy

505
00:26:58,355 --> 00:26:59,947
liver and intestine.

506
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:01,786
You ready for re-implantation?

507
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:04,623
No. I just came across

508
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,626
a smattering of malignant growth

509
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:08,136
in her abdominal wall.

510
00:27:08,637 --> 00:27:10,731
They must've been
undetected on imaging.

511
00:27:10,847 --> 00:27:13,512
These are going to prevent us
from closing.

512
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:19,310
Okay, we are gonna have
to rebuild her

513
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:21,561
quickly from the inside out,
starting with

514
00:27:21,646 --> 00:27:23,941
the GI reconstruction, then
the abdominal reconstruction.

515
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:27,611
It's a good thing we have
a plastic surgeon in our midst.

516
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:31,188
Nice and slow.

517
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:35,059
Okay.

518
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:39,804
Let's do this.

519
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,598
All right, I think
that's the last fragment.

520
00:27:42,683 --> 00:27:44,395
I don't see any more.

521
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:50,465
Oh, it's the artery...
He's bleeding out.

522
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,641
Apply pressure.

523
00:27:51,726 --> 00:27:54,129
It's not working. We need
something to seal it off.

524
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,440
All right, I'll look.
Leela, keep applying pressure.

525
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,551
Okay.

526
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,145
The patient is
becoming unstable.

527
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,032
The instability is related
to a bleeding vessel.

528
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:10,021
We need to achieve homeostasis.

529
00:28:10,342 --> 00:28:13,598
We don't have clips or wax.

530
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:15,371
What else?

531
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:20,020
We need to burn it.

532
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,434
We don't have electrocautery.

533
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,246
Does he have a soldering iron?

534
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,864
It might work. Give it a shot.

535
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,809
You did it.

536
00:28:51,574 --> 00:28:54,242
Now let's hope
they get us out in time.

537
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,668
Time of death 17:41.

538
00:29:58,843 --> 00:30:00,309
Hey.

539
00:30:02,315 --> 00:30:04,129
We tried everything.

540
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:08,950
Amputation was her only chance,
but she lost too much blood.

541
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:13,371
She was one of us.

542
00:30:21,146 --> 00:30:22,731
We'll tell Wes.

543
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,903
I know how close
you and Piper were.

544
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,036
We're so sorry.

545
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:48,888
She saw the world as it is.

546
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,168
I saw...

547
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:53,340
like I wished it was.

548
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:57,442
We were two halves of a piece

549
00:30:57,527 --> 00:31:00,200
that were better
than either of us alone.

550
00:31:02,557 --> 00:31:05,246
You'll always carry
that part of her with you.

551
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,501
How am I gonna get back

552
00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:12,579
into the ambulance without her?

553
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:14,067
You will.

554
00:31:14,192 --> 00:31:16,832
When you're ready,
just one step at a time.

555
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:19,871
And she wouldn't want you
to stop helping people.

556
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,575
And the last thing
she would want is to be

557
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,802
an anchor around your neck.

558
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:30,416
Thank you for that.

559
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:33,828
Oh, man.

560
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:36,722
I have to pick up her dog.

561
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:38,924
I made her rescue him.

562
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:40,614
Dog's a total jerk.

563
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,917
And the only relationship
that she had

564
00:31:46,816 --> 00:31:48,664
besides me.

565
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,105
We'll see you soon, Wes.

566
00:32:03,347 --> 00:32:05,105
Hardest part of our job.

567
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:08,054
Never gets easier.

568
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,628
No one does it better than you.

569
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,191
Get him to the OR.

570
00:32:18,276 --> 00:32:19,867
Dr. Chan is waiting.

571
00:32:20,478 --> 00:32:22,761
He had a bleed,
and we almost lost him,

572
00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:25,901
but Dr. Devi cauterized it
with a soldering iron.

573
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:27,480
Well done.

574
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:29,489
I bet you didn't expect
to perform brain surgery

575
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,399
with power tools
when you woke up this morning.

576
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:32,918
Or any morning.

577
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:35,699
- Ever.
- Well, now you know what it feels like

578
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:37,163
to exceed your own expectations.

579
00:32:37,464 --> 00:32:39,839
I have always been confident
in my abilities.

580
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,237
It's always been other people
who have doubted me.

581
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:44,987
That being said, I'm happy
Dr. Pravesh was with me today.

582
00:32:45,072 --> 00:32:46,990
No, no. This is your moment.

583
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:48,902
Again, well done.

584
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:53,808
Let's go.

585
00:32:59,753 --> 00:33:01,700
These are worse than
you made them out to be.

586
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:03,245
Per usual.

587
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:05,245
Better me than you.

588
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,127
Look...

589
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:12,532
I know you want to work
right up until you go to labor

590
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,816
and I will support
whatever you decide.

591
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:18,362
But given everything
that we have been through...

592
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,100
I'm ready.

593
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:25,627
Home sounds really good
right about now.

594
00:33:27,431 --> 00:33:30,424
For me and for her.

595
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:32,766

Look, we knew this
was going to be hard,

607
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,168
but the recovery is going to be
more challenging

608
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:28,673
- than we anticipated.
- Yeah.

609
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:32,043
Sammie will require ongoing
care with constant follow-ups.

610
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:33,737
- For how long?
- Years.

611
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,598
The truth is, Sammie's
operations may not be over.

612
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,952
We will need to continually
monitor her organs.

613
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:42,779
And at some point, more
surgeries might be required.

614
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:46,541
Uh, w-we are so glad
she has a chance.

615
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:49,888
But I-I don't know how
we're gonna swing this.

616
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:52,224
Uh, the-the cost alone, uh...

617
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:54,254
What about her at-home care?

618
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:56,073
We will
provide you with resources

619
00:34:56,183 --> 00:34:57,801
to help with her dietary
requirements

620
00:34:57,886 --> 00:34:59,387
and her ongoing
physical therapy.

621
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:01,879
And she may need
to be home-schooled

622
00:35:01,964 --> 00:35:04,651
- for the next 12 months.
- I'll-I'll send up a social worker

623
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,486
that will speak to you
about all of it.

624
00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:08,361
No.

625
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,066
No, no social workers.

626
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:16,237
I'm really thankful for you
all saving her life,

627
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,032
- it's just that the truth is that...
- We have, uh,

628
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,167
two other kids at home.

629
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:26,758
We-we care about Sammie
and we want her to be okay.

630
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:29,800
But this is so overwhelming.

631
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:32,012
Look, our family
is falling apart.

632
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:36,975
I don't know if
we're the best people for her.

633
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,599
I don't understand.
She's your daughter.

634
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,706
There... are options
for situations like this.

635
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:53,099
We'll have to relinquish her.

636
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:56,120
Are you saying
you're gonna give her back?

637
00:35:56,205 --> 00:35:57,629
You're Sammie's parents.

638
00:35:57,714 --> 00:36:00,456
She has no other home
in this country.

639
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,391
She'll be better
with a family who's equipped

640
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:04,934
to do this sort of thing. Sorry.

641
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:07,698
Uh, Doctors,
why don't you get some air? I...

642
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,339
I can finish
with the Ackermanns.

643
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:19,863
Want to go grab a drink?

644
00:36:19,948 --> 00:36:22,425
Yeah. J... Uh,
just give me a minute?

645
00:37:00,315 --> 00:37:02,724
- Oh!
- Did it work?

646
00:37:02,816 --> 00:37:05,409
Okay, that's it. That's it.

647
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:06,857

- Yep.
- And was he appropriately impressed?

658
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,506
He was more excited
by the fact that there was

659
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:50,484
a single male,
Indian doctor trapped with me.

660
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:52,507

or lose my job, so a husband

small part of you

00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:50,628
Look, the truth is,
I do want your job.

699
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:51,928
Of course you do.

700
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:55,610
I wouldn't want
a resident who didn't.

701
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:57,790
We're cut from the same cloth.

702
00:39:59,402 --> 00:40:01,127
No hidden agendas.

703
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,792
- Can I ask you something personal?
- No.

704
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:13,446
You want to know if there's
something between Rose and me.

705
00:40:13,864 --> 00:40:15,271
The answer's no.

706
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:18,922
Like you said, she's not
your patient, she's Devon's.

707
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:21,008
Wouldn't be out of bounds.

708
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:23,774
She could die at any time.

709
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:29,141
She could. Anyone could.

710
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:31,735
You almost did.

711
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:41,869
About a year ago,
my college girlfriend

712
00:40:41,954 --> 00:40:43,741
shows up to Chastain.

713
00:40:44,657 --> 00:40:46,493
It's been decades.

714
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:49,243
Lots of wheels start turning.

715
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:51,199
Thinking about
what could have been.

716
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:53,167
What still could be.

717
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:57,407
Then she dies on my table.

718
00:40:58,732 --> 00:41:00,344
Damn.

719
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:03,258
I'm so sorry.

720
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:06,797
No one really knew
how it affected me, but...

721
00:41:10,727 --> 00:41:12,894
...I just don't think
I can go through that again.

722
00:41:14,964 --> 00:41:16,856
Okay, I get that.

723
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:23,521
But it's a dangerous
way to live, man.

724
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:26,891
Maybe you avoid
heartbreak, but...

725
00:41:27,376 --> 00:41:29,469
you end up where you are
right now,

726
00:41:29,926 --> 00:41:31,951
alone at the bar.

727
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:43,783
Just warming up.
There it is, all right.

728
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:44,959
Just warming up.

729
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:47,377
- Oh. Yeah, uh...
<i>- Oh, yeah. That's what you get.</i>

730
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:48,813
I'm-a say me,

731
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:51,711
- Jake and Leela.
Oh. - I got you.

732
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:53,216
That's not gonna be fair.

733
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,793
All right, I get it.

734
00:41:54,877 --> 00:41:58,722
The three of us are surgeons,
we are precise, competitive,

735
00:41:58,806 --> 00:42:01,728
finely-tuned,
highly-performing

736
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:03,375
- individuals.
- Yeah.

737
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:05,163
So I understand
the intimidation factor.

738
00:42:05,247 --> 00:42:07,407
You and Jake are so drunk
you can't even see the board.

739
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:10,279
Well, it appears to me
that Drs. Hawkins, Pravesh

740
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,801
and Sutton over there

741
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:14,636
may have a point.

742
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:19,107
However, I am too inebriated
to control my ego,

743
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:21,381
- so what do you say?
- I think we'll be fine.

744
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:22,481
Let's go.

745
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:24,232
Fine. Put your money
where your mouth is.

746
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:25,811
Yes. There we go.

747
00:42:25,896 --> 00:42:27,468
Now we're talking.
Now we're talking.

748
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:28,482
I'm just curious.

749
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:30,647
Why do you think we'll be fine?

750
00:42:30,732 --> 00:42:32,407
Trust me.

751
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,045
- Dollar a point?
- All right.

752
00:42:37,585 --> 00:42:39,003
We good with that?

753
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:40,973
- Bring it. - Yes, we're good with that.
- Yeah?
