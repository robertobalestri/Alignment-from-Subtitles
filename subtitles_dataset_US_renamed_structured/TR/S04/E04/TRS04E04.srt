1
00:00:00,905 --> 00:00:02,820
<i>- Previously, on</i> <font color="#ffff09">"The Resident"...</font>
- I saw Yorn.

2
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:04,680
Did he say why
he hasn't hired a CEO?

3
00:00:04,765 --> 00:00:06,119
- They're selling the hospital.
- Oh.

4
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:08,297
I need to show Yorn
that Chastain

5
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:10,703
is worth a hell of a lot more
than he thinks it is.

6
00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:12,562
My father, when he died,

7
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:14,585
I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

8
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,976
<i>What I would do for just
one more day with my dad.</i>

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,210
Sorry. Losing someone
is never easy.

10
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:22,040
I'll get someone
to cover for you.

11
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,382
No.

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,773
I'm okay.
I just need a minute.

13
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:30,179
It's official.

14
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:31,953
A baby?

15
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:37,524
What is this?

16
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,789
Uh, breakfast in bed.

17
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:43,367
- Where did you even get this?
- Ah...

18
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,719
Pancakes?

19
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:46,712
Your favorite.

20
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,630
- Blue wildflowers.
- Aw...

21
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:53,218
Nic's favorite berries. Ah!

22
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,007
Get in there,
get in there.

23
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:56,468
All right.
Mmm. Mmm.

24
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:59,250
Whose dad do we want
to call first, yours or mine?

25
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:02,000
I think we should wait
a little longer.

26
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:04,664
Well, sure,
there's no rush to tell anyone.

27
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,054
I mean, right?

28
00:01:10,922 --> 00:01:12,606
Your pregnancy
is already further along

29
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:13,843
than it was last time.

30
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:16,210
This time is gonna be different,
and it's...

31
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:17,968
it's gonna be okay.
You know that, right?

32
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:19,435
But we can't.

33
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,513
I had a miscarriage,
and it was awful.

34
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:27,954
And if it happens again,

35
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,568
I don't want
to have to tell everyone,

36
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:31,390
so I just...

37
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,803
just want to wait
a little longer, okay?

38
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:40,310
Of course.

39
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:42,576
Whatever you want.

40
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:45,592
Thank you.

41
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:52,732
I'm coming.

42
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,740
All right!

43
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:04,115
Did I park in someone's spot
or something?

44
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:07,778
Okay!

45
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:10,741
Mom. What are you...

46
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,283
- what are you doing here?
- Surprise.

47
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:14,615
I thought I'd
finally come visit my s...

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,560
What happened to you?

49
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,369
Oh, my God.
Were you in a car accident?

50
00:02:22,454 --> 00:02:24,539
I knew something was wrong.
I knew it.

51
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,753
A mother always knows.

52
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:28,256
Mom, I'm fine.

53
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:30,928
We had an ER patient
with psychosis,

54
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:35,076
and... someone should have
restrained him immediately,

55
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:38,272
but we missed it,
and then he was...

56
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:40,598
swinging at a nurse, and I...

57
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:42,013
uh, went in to help.

58
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:46,092
Yeah, in retrospect, I should
have just left it to the...

59
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:47,802
security.

60
00:02:48,842 --> 00:02:50,352
You are a hero.

61
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:52,779
My poor boy.

62
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:54,702
But where are your pajamas, huh?

63
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,070
And, uh...

64
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:57,779
what is that smell?

65
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:59,968
You know, just wait right here.
I just got to... I'll wash up.

66
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:01,343
Hey, don't worry.

67
00:03:01,435 --> 00:03:03,670
I-I'm going to take care
of everything.

68
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:23,685
The way you drive
like a hellion,

69
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,240
I was sure
you'd beat me here.

70
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:27,803
Normally, I would beat you here,
because you drive like a nun,

71
00:03:27,952 --> 00:03:30,842
but today... I stopped for this.

72
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,295
- Doughnuts.
- Mm.

73
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,404
Maple. I believe
they're your favorite.

74
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,834
And I believe you mentioned

75
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,388
a fondness
for breakfast burritos.

76
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,873
Oh, I do not hate

77
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,287
this part of being
in a relationship.

78
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,244
Oh, such high praise.

79
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:49,023
Tell me, what can I do to make
sure you stay this effusive?

80
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,170
There is one thing.

81
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:52,849
Uh, you can...

82
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,357
Marry me.

83
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:10,826

85
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:15,599
My 0-1 visa is expiring.

86
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:19,371
I knew it was coming,
so I applied way in advance.

87
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:21,435
Yesterday I found out
it was denied.

88
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,031
Mina, you should have
told me this yesterday.

89
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:26,014
I was gonna tell you
when I came over last night,

90
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,842
but you had made
such a nice dinner,

91
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:32,131
and I didn't want to ruin it,
so... I said nothing.

92
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:35,053
And then we got occupied
with other things.

93
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,412
I don't understand
why the government

94
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:39,592
would deny your renewal,

95
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:41,624
as many American lives
as you've saved.

96
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:45,295
Since February of 2020,
Nigerians are no longer able

97
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,263
to obtain... visas to immigrate
to the U.S. permanently.

98
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:50,764
If I want to stay,
I have to find a way

99
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:54,568
to renew my current visa
or marry an American citizen.

100
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,857
- You are terrible at this.
- I applied months in advance.

101
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:01,309
No, no, I mean this.

102
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:04,161
You know, Mina,
proposals usually come...

103
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:05,849
with a ring.

104
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:08,849
And a carefully crafted speech

105
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,568
About commitment and love,
full of compliments.

106
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:13,224
Flowers wouldn't hurt, either.

107
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:14,982
Okay, so will you do it?

108
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:17,718
You didn't even buy me
a nice dinner first.

109
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:19,240
I got you doughnuts.

110
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,857
True. And they're maple.

111
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,465
Hey. Come here.

112
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,394
Mm...

113
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:29,474
Breathe.

114
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:31,943
It's gonna be okay, Mina.

115
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:33,740
We can make this work.

116
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,384
All right?

117
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,763
Love.

118
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,545
Honor.

119
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,138
Obey.

120
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,230
Ooh, I love the way that sounds.

121
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:44,842
- Don't you?
- Okay, uh,

122
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,339
maybe we are rushing this.

123
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:48,310
Oh, no,
we're definitely rushing this.

124
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,170
What's that about?

125
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:58,381
Good morning.

126
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,592
Good question.

127
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:05,256
How's the other guy look?

128
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:06,724
Funny.

129
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:09,264
I couldn't sleep,
so I went out for a bike ride

130
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,215
in the middle of the night.

131
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:12,912
And it was pitch black,
and I was tired.

132
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:14,143
Yeah, I know.

133
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:16,107
- It was stupid.
- Mm.

134
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:18,310
I, uh, hit a curb
and I wiped out.

135
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:21,857
Oh, and then my mother showed up
this morning unannounced and,

136
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:23,553
uh, I lied to her about it,

137
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:24,889
because I didn't want her
to worry.

138
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:27,728
Anything else you want to know?

139
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:32,951
Well, your father
passed away, and...

140
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:34,777
It's been months.

141
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:36,449
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

142
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:38,801
You're grieving. You don't need
to put a timeline on it.

143
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:40,210
Getting through it takes
as long as it takes.

144
00:06:40,294 --> 00:06:42,294
- Let's just talk about how you're feeling.
- Okay.

145
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:44,291
I said fine.

146
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,546
You don't need to ask me again.

147
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:48,850
Excuse me? Excuse me?

148
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:50,088
Can we get some help?

149
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:51,554
Okay, what's going on?

150
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:53,835
My daughter Trinity needs
medical attention.

151
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,345
No, I don't.

152
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:57,038
What's happening, Trinity?

153
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:58,933
Show them.

154
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,725
It looks worse than it is.

155
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:06,063
My mom is making this
a big thing.

156
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:08,125
Your hand looks like
a sea monster.

157
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:10,296
It's a big thing.

158
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:12,765
Whatever.
I tripped on the stairs.

159
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,192
You, too?

160
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:16,554
Um, bike accident.

161
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:18,593
I don't need sedation.

162
00:07:18,678 --> 00:07:20,421
Just pop my fingers
back into place.

163
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,124
Trust me,
I have a high pain tolerance.

164
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,758
Look how well she tolerated
the existential pain

165
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:28,614
of being stuck at home
with her mom during lockdown.

166
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:31,422
I was supposed to speak
at my graduation.

167
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:33,149
Then I didn't go to college
in the fall

168
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:34,671
'cause it's all
distance learning.

169
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,507
Apologies for our family drama.
It's been a year.

170
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,492
Well, we're ready
to fix your fingers

171
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:40,977
if you really want to do it
that way.

172
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,835
- Positive?
- Yep.

173
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,228
Okay.

174
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:49,055
Trinity, look at your mom.

175
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,805
Let's remember the good parts
of lockdown.

176
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:57,108
The tap shoes.

177
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,890
The quail.- -

178
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:01,321
- Quail?
- We incubated eggs

179
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:02,812
and raised them
o adulthood.

180
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:05,149
- Kept the only girl.
- Sidney Vicious.

181
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,140
Ah, Sidney Vicious.
I love that name.

182
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:10,703
She's coming with me
when I get my own apartment,

183
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:12,917
which I'm supposed
to look at today.

184
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,292
Finally.

185
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,056
You're all done.

186
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:18,392
You should be good
to apartment hunt now.

187
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:20,825
Actually,
there's something else.

188
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,875
- This wasn't Trinity's first fall.
- Mom, stop.

189
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,032
- You said we didn't have to...
- She's been off lately.

190
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:27,702
Something
with her balance, maybe.

191
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:29,171
We can take a look at
that.

192
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:31,875
I said no.
I just want to go and get my...

193
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,336
If you want a cosigner
for that apartment,

194
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,577
you will stay in that bed
and let the doctors work.

195
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:38,015
It will be quick.

196
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,060
We'll get X-rays on your hand
just to be safe.

197
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:42,613
And then we'll be back
for a full physical.

198
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,564
I'll let imaging know.

199
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,456
<i>Procurement
coordinator to the ICU.</i>

200
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:53,849
Quail.

201
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:56,668
Maybe Nic and I need
to bring some variety

202
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,349
to our chicken coop, huh?

203
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:01,091
Well, it sounds like Trinity...

204
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,388
wants independence
more than any bird.

205
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,864
I hear the mother-daughter thing
can be tough sometimes.

206
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:08,772
Yeah, the mother-son thing is
no walk in the park, either.

207
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:10,992
My mom wants to know
where I keep the disinfectant,

208
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:13,218
the trash bags,
the<i> good</i> toilet paper.

209
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,354
This is the
last thing I need right now.

210
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,233
I don't know. Maybe
you can set some boundaries

211
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:19,732
with her or something?

212
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:24,857
I'm not really looking
for advice here.

213
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,147
I'm doing my job,
I'm not making any mistakes.

214
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:28,733
Anything beyond that
is not your business.

215
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:31,240
It's my business that my friend
is upset and grieving.

216
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,538
Can you stop trying
to doctor this?

217
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:36,451
Okay? I need a minute.
Can you handle the exam?

218
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:38,146
- Yeah.
- Okay.

219
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:46,076
So the good news is
that the PR coming in

220
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:47,878
from my show's segment
on the patient helped.

221
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,334
And Yorn thinks that Chastain
might still be valuable enough

222
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,115
to take selling the hospital
off the table.

223
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,560
The bad news is,

224
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:58,231
they're talking about filling
the empty CEO seat with me.

225
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,779
I thought you weren't keen
on the job anymore,

226
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:03,226
- you were focusing on surgery.
- Trust me, I don't want it.

227
00:10:03,474 --> 00:10:05,085
Even if I said yes,

228
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,061
Red Rock could
still dump Chastain

229
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,658
if we don't rebound
financially.

230
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,201
And we'd be under the thumb
of some other conglomerate.

231
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:12,328
And there are companies
out there

232
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,677
that are way worse
than Red Rock.

233
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,834
Well, here's something
to cheer you up.

234
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,952
There's a rather attractive
young woman over there

235
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,586
who can't take her eyes off you.

236
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,771
Do you know her?

237
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:27,373
No.

238
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,651
- No.
- Oh.

239
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,255
Here she comes.

240
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:33,349
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

241
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:34,968
but can I?

242
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:36,919
Interrupt, I mean?

243
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:38,752
I love your show.

244
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,724
- Ah.
- That segment on scurvy.

245
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,670
I-I don't have scurvy,
but you made me feel like I did.

246
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:46,178
Well, that's high praise.

247
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:48,012
That's...
that's very kind of you.

248
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:50,162
- What's your name?
- Fiona.

249
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:51,576
Well, it's lovely
to meet you, Fiona.

250
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,486
Thank-thank you
for watching the show.

251
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,208
You're... so nice.

252
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:58,303
Could I?

253
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:01,866
Yeah. Of course. Of course.

254
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:05,762
This is my lucky day.

255
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:07,551
- Thank you.
- You bet.

256
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:11,916
You are so happy right now.

257
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,559
No comments from you.

258
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,903
All right.

259
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:25,364
I've got some good news
for you, Trinity.

260
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,271
- Nothing's broken.
- Great.

261
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:28,561
I don't need any more tests?

262
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,880
Let's get out of here.

263
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:32,371
No. Get back in that bed.

264
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,333
Trinity?

265
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:37,973
Walk toward me.

266
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:44,064
Your steps are uneven.

267
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:47,215
Did you feel a little
off-balance when you fell?

268
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:49,582
I mean, I wasn't
totally awake yet.

269
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,109
I was tired.

270
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:53,442
I feel like I've been tired
the whole...

271
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:55,685
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

272
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,767
My heart's a little fluttery,
that's all.

273
00:11:58,852 --> 00:11:59,988
Heather.

274
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,817
Need to get her on the monitor.

275
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,754
Let's see what's going on.

276
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:09,153
I'm fine.

277
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:11,113
I'm f...

278
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:13,116
I knew it.
What's wrong with her?

279
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,699
Easy, easy, easy.

280
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,535
She just fainted.

281
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,512
What happened?

282
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:23,363
You just bought yourself some
more time in the hospital.

283
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,410
Got a call I have a visitor.

284
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:36,699
Hi again.

285
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:40,391
Um...

286
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:42,676
Fiona? Right?

287
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,520
I'm sorry to drop in
unannounced. I'll be quick.

288
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:48,808
I'm actually curious
about employment at Chastain.

289
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,936
Uh, well...

290
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,311
I admire the gusto.

291
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:53,980
Um, hiring is sort of...

292
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,108
- It's outside my purview.
- I know, it's just I'm...

293
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,483
I'm trying to switch paths,

294
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,186
so I'm looking
for something entry-level.

295
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,745
And after seeing
the way that you

296
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:03,581
talk about Chastain
on your show, and then...

297
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:05,784
when I met you in person,

298
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:08,586
I got all inspired.

299
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,713
It felt like fate.

300
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:15,818
Well, HR is on two, east wing.

301
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,165
And you can tell them
Dr. Bell sent you.

302
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,299
Thank you so much.

303
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:22,082
- You're amazing.
- Okay.

304
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,519
Yes!

305
00:13:33,903 --> 00:13:35,863
Hey. So...

306
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:38,918
I assume you've spoken to Mina.

307
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:40,986
I talk to Mina all the time.

308
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,454
So you know about the proposal?

309
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:45,768
No.

310
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,146
No, you-you did not
propose.

311
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:49,483
You've been dating
for, like, five seconds.

312
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:52,287
Why would you jump the gun like
that? - Mina Okafor proposed to me.

313
00:13:52,418 --> 00:13:55,332
Yeah, she needs a green card
so she doesn't get deported.

314
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:57,481
- What?
- Yeah.

315
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:02,731
How can I help?

316
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,176
Well...

317
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,113
You can help plan a wedding.

318
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,590
It has to happen quick,
so it can't be elaborate.

319
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,777
You know, small guest list,
tasteful, intimate.

320
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:14,388
Wait, so this is a real wedding?

321
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:16,427
Well, under normal
circumstances,

322
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:17,333
it'd be way too early.

323
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:18,958
- Way.
- But...

324
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:22,020
we will rise to the occasion.

325
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:25,536
And just figure out
if you want to be married

326
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:26,881
while being married.

327
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,334
Well, that's what
most people do anyway, right?

328
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:29,833
They're just not honest
about it.

329
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:31,129
All right. Oh.

330
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,269
Duty calls.

331
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:33,821
You are a doll.

332
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,464
Nic?

333
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:44,199
You okay?

334
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:46,246
Yeah.

335
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:47,739
Are you okay?

336
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:50,817
Yeah. Well, it turns out biking
at night is not a good idea,

337
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:52,622
which is why I was
looking for you.

338
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:54,419
Uh, I need a small favor.

339
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:55,945
- Okay.
- So, I can't sleep.

340
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,114
And I am exhausted.

341
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,599
So I was taking meds to help,
but my doctor's out of town,

342
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:02,326
so he can't refill the script.

343
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,620
- Mm-hmm?
- So I just need

344
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,152
something to sleep,
just enough for a couple days.

345
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,481
I mean, Devon, we're friends.

346
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:11,376
We don't have
a clinical relationship.

347
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:14,652
I know, but if-if I don't sleep,
I'm not gonna be able to focus.

348
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:17,092
And I'm not gonna ask Conrad,
'cause he's gonna worry

349
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:18,760
for nothing.
My next day off,

350
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:20,402
I'll go straight to the doctor.

351
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,002
- Are you on any other medication?
- No.

352
00:15:23,114 --> 00:15:24,712
And this is just to
get you over the hump?

353
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,527
Yes, this one time.

354
00:15:29,457 --> 00:15:31,480
All right, I'm sending this
to the pharmacy.

355
00:15:32,074 --> 00:15:34,669
Zolpidem, five milligrams.
I'm only giving you three pills.

356
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:36,002
If you need more,
you go to your doctor.

357
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:36,979
For sure.

358
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,145
Thank you.

359
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,904
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

360
00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:42,801
Yeah.

361
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:44,501
Good.

362
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:53,630
Trinity's arrhythmia broke
on its own.

363
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:54,996
Her heart is
structurally normal.

364
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,129
So why are these cardiac events
happening?

365
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,255
This is a 19-year-old female

366
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,583
with sporadic runs
of non-sustained V tach

367
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:05,989
that are symptomatic.

368
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:07,424
Echo is not impressive.

369
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,480
Interesting.

370
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,185
That is a wide-open box.

371
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,966
- Any other history?
- Her mother reports

372
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,684
difficulty with coordination.

373
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,013
Otherwise healthy.

374
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:17,270
All right, well,
keep her on telemetry.

375
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:19,657
And grab me another EKG
now that she's in sinus.

376
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:21,020
Will do.

377
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,591
Come in.

378
00:16:29,676 --> 00:16:31,463
Sorry again.

379
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:34,091
I left my résumé
with the lady in HR.

380
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,921
Is there something else?

381
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:38,723
I thought
you'd want to see it.

382
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,508
Okay.

383
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,730
Thank you.

384
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,567
This is not a résumé.

385
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,686
- Let's call it my headshot.
- Oh, no, no.

386
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,020
This is... No, no.

387
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,572
This is not your head.

388
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,067
And-and this,
this is not appropriate.

389
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:07,645
You know, I'm gonna ask you...

390
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,200
to leave.

391
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,321
- Don't pretend this isn't real.
- Just...

392
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,067
- stand back. Kit.
- I know you want me.

393
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:15,126
Kit. Dr. Voss. Could you
come in here for just...

394
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,409
- just a moment?
- Yes, Randolph.

395
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:19,450
I know you.

396
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:21,895
- You're the girl from this morning.
- Fiona.

397
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,599
She's acting psychotic.

398
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:25,261
And security's been notified.

399
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:26,777
You called security?

400
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,087
- Well...
- because

401
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:29,779
we are gonna get you some...

402
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:31,023
We're gonna get you some help.

403
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,942
Stop her! Stop her!

404
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,841
- Fiona. Fiona. Fiona.
- I need five of Haldol for IM.

405
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,052
Look at me. Look at me.
We're gonna get you some help.

406
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:43,841
We'll take a little trip
down to the ER.

407
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:45,256
I'll be there with you
the whole time.

408
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:50,152
There you go.

409
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,629
There you go, darling.

410
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:55,568
Just give it a minute.
You'll be okay.

411
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:02,004
Nice work.

412
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:11,886
Hey, Mom.

413
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:15,718
Can you pick up laundry
detergent on your way home?

414
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:18,102
- I had plenty.
<i>- Now you have none,</i>

415
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:19,391
<i>but you have clean clothes</i>

416
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:20,602
and linens.

417
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:21,929
<i>You didn't have to do that.</i>

418
00:18:23,257 --> 00:18:25,680
Your home is lonely.

419
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:27,485
You are lonely.

420
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,630
You need a partner.

421
00:18:28,714 --> 00:18:30,214
No. No, I don't.

422
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,026
No, don't-don't do that.

423
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,518
Check your phone.

424
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:35,071
Don't forget the detergent.

425
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:36,671
Love you.

426
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,782
Are you getting deported?

427
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,961
I will kill AJ Austin.

428
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:53,679
You can't marry a corpse, Mina.

429
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:55,773
Why didn't you tell me?

430
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:58,160
Uh, because saying it
makes it real.

431
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,663
Not saying it
doesn't change that.

432
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:03,477
I didn't want you to get upset.

433
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:05,450
All right?
It's not an ideal situation,

434
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:06,835
but AJ and I are handling it.

435
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:08,453
We'll do it quickly.

436
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:10,161
And I'll be safe
from deportation.

437
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:12,188
"Quickly"?
He wants a wedding.

438
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:13,917
This is real to him.

439
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,293
Of course it's real.

440
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:16,984
Sort of real.

441
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:18,765
It's also business.

442
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:24,176
A real marriage
and a business arrangement

443
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:25,273
are two separate things.

444
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:26,983
- I mean, it can't be both.
- Why not?

445
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:29,665
By definition, a marriage is
a business arrangement.

446
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,883
You are linking your finances,
your housing arrangement,

447
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:34,863
your professional
and biological plans

448
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:36,566
to someone else.
It makes sense.

449
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:38,711
It makes sense
if you're in love.

450
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:42,062
Are you in love with him?

451
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:48,376
Okay.

452
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,369
The reason I didn't want you
to get upset

453
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:55,299
is because I think
you also have a secret.

454
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:57,928
Yesterday, you took a power nap
in the nurses' lounge.

455
00:19:58,012 --> 00:19:59,303
You have developed
the superpower

456
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:01,530
to smell doughnuts a hall away.

457
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:03,174
Your hair is extra lustrous.

458
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:05,968
And some might say
you're glowing.

459
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:12,399
- Okay, it's early.
- Mm-hmm.

460
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:14,914
- I'm not ready to talk about it.
- Okay.

461
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,899
I will keep your secret.

462
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,229
Please keep mine.

463
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:19,562
For now.

464
00:20:20,326 --> 00:20:22,156
And congratulations.

465
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:31,317
Your girl here is
a missing person.

466
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:34,144
I called her house
and talked to her roommate.

467
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:37,796
Two days ago, she left for
groceries and never came home.

468
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:40,761
Pravesh said
her head CT came back normal.

469
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:42,430
No drugs in her system.

470
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,599
Did the roommate say anything
about a history

471
00:20:44,683 --> 00:20:46,268
- of mental illness?
- I asked.

472
00:20:46,352 --> 00:20:47,684
None that she knew of.

473
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:49,353
She's trying to get in touch
with her family

474
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:50,376
on the West Coast.

475
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:52,313
Then maybe this is
a new diagnosis.

476
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:54,442
- It might be her first psychotic break.
- Mm.

477
00:20:54,781 --> 00:20:56,735
She's in the right age range.

478
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:02,796
Can't treat her
till we find out what it is.

479
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:05,711
Well, Dr. Pravesh is on his way
to do a full exam.

480
00:21:05,796 --> 00:21:08,187
- I'll keep you posted.
- Okay. Thank you.

481
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,877
Lots of people faint.

482
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:16,469
True.
But you fainted

483
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:18,032
because your heart
was beating abnormally.

484
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:19,523
We need to find out why.

485
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:22,320
We ordered a few more lab tests,
okay, Trinity?

486
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,470
Mmm. Your coffee smells
like heaven.

487
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:26,539
- Is that hazelnut?
- Yeah.

488
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:28,476
- I'm gonna go get us some, Trin.
- That's weird.

489
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,023
I can't smell it.

490
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,539
What do you mean
you can't smell it?

491
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:35,766
What about this?

492
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:37,359
My perfume?

493
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:39,821
She can't have COVID, can she?

494
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:41,656
Let's all just take a breath.

495
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,423
Loss of smell can be a symptom
of multiple things.

496
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:45,009
- No, no, no, no.
- We were so careful.

497
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:46,827
We-we-we got
all our groceries delivered.

498
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:49,610
- We didn't see friends. We...
- It could be allergies or a cold.

499
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,719
Even when we joined a pod
and we tested positive,

500
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:53,835
we-we-we were lucky because
we didn't have any symptoms.

501
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,625
Okay. Good, good.

502
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,797
The danger's supposed
to be over.

503
00:21:57,882 --> 00:22:00,211
It's supposed to be... safe.

504
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:01,523
- Whoa.
- Mom.

505
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,242
- Whoa. Gotcha, gotcha.
- Mom!

506
00:22:06,623 --> 00:22:07,931
Mom...

507
00:22:08,124 --> 00:22:10,274
- are you okay?
- Your mom's stable.

508
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,804
They're just taking a look at
her heart with an ultrasound.

509
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:15,306
Akinesis
of the postero-basal wall.

510
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,126
Circumflex infarct.

511
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,592
That explains
the non-diagnostic EKG.

512
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:22,070
Is that bad?
It sounds bad.

513
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:23,947
Your mom collapsed
because she's

514
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:25,851
actually having
a heart attack right now.

515
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:28,086
Oh, my God.
How is that possible?

516
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:29,969
Her EKG shows evidence

517
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:31,614
of another heart attack
in the past.

518
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:34,578
Has your mom ever had chest pain
or shortness of breath before?

519
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:39,113
The protests.

520
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:40,993
When George Floyd was murdered.

521
00:22:41,078 --> 00:22:42,672
We made our signs
and we went out there.

522
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:45,187
It was supposed to be peaceful,
but it didn't matter.

523
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,389
They tear gassed us all.

524
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:50,176
That must've been awful.

525
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,001
I recovered pretty quickly,
but Mom said

526
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:56,564
she felt like an elephant
was sitting on her chest.

527
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,602
I wanted to take her
to the hospital,

528
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:01,068
but she was afraid we were
gonna catch COVID again.

529
00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:04,406
Back then, we didn't know
if that was possible.

530
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:06,490
She was afraid.

531
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:08,906
Okay, that could be it.

532
00:23:09,163 --> 00:23:10,657
Tear gas can cause stress

533
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:13,586
on the heart
and aggravate cardiac issues.

534
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:16,734
Your mom has
a good chance of recovery.

535
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:18,727
We need to get her
to a cath lab now.

536
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:20,938
We'll put a stent in to open up
the clogged arteries

537
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:22,289
- in her heart.
- Don't worry.

538
00:23:22,374 --> 00:23:24,175
It's a routine procedure, okay?

539
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,000
Mom?

540
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:28,578
I love you.

541
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:31,807
I love you, too, baby girl.

542
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:35,270
I'll be right back to cosign
for that apartment.

543
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:37,729
Okay.

544
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,721
Okay, you got to
get it closer to the vessel wall

545
00:23:55,806 --> 00:23:57,011
before you deploy.

546
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,799
I'm trying to rotate it,
but I can't get the stent

547
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:03,486
- into position.
- Well, see, it's a tight spot.

548
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:07,717
No blood flow.
She's in V tach!

549
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,461
Charge the defib to 200.

550
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,564
Any sign of trauma?

551
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,790
Not yet.

552
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:16,925
There's no bruising,
no breaks in the skin at all.

553
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,979
It looks like Fiona works
as a paralegal

554
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:20,150
while in law school.

555
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:22,027
No edema. No rashes.

556
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:25,737
She posts pictures of her food
and her feet in sandals.

557
00:24:25,822 --> 00:24:28,455
No clues there.

558
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:31,026
Uh, hold on.

559
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:33,486
There's bruising
on her lower flank.

560
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:35,050
Grey Turner's sign?

561
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:36,761
Wait, wait. Feel this.

562
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:38,312
You're right.

563
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:40,814
There's a mass.

564
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:44,500
Let's take a look.

565
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:48,104
It's right there.

566
00:24:48,189 --> 00:24:50,057
It's a tumor
right above her kidney.

567
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:52,073
Extending deep
towards her spine.

568
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,893
How long has she been walking
around with that in her?

569
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:57,260
If this is an adrenal tumor
secreting hormones,

570
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,510
it could be causing
her psychosis.

571
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:03,080
Certainly could explain her
interest in the famous Dr. Bell.

572
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:07,013
Zoom in.

573
00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:10,299
There... active extravasation.

574
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:11,754
She's got
a retroperitoneal bleed.

575
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:13,308
Could've happened when she
was fighting with security.

576
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:14,410
Well, if we don't
get it out soon,

577
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:15,635
she's just gonna bleed out.

578
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,995
I'll get an OR ready.

579
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:23,073
I gave the lab a heads-up

580
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:25,697
about putting a rush
on Trinity's bloodwork.

581
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:29,784
Nope. It's not my business.

582
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:31,878
- You do you.
- It's not a dating app.

583
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,136
It's my mom.

584
00:25:33,287 --> 00:25:36,306
It's the tenth eligible woman
she's sent me today.

585
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:38,434
You getting enough sleep?

586
00:25:39,431 --> 00:25:40,628
Oh, you're talking to Nic?

587
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:44,245
No, but... if she
noticed you look tired,

588
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,908
it's because you do.

589
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,644
Yeah, I'm tired.

590
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,613
But I'm handling it.

591
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:52,573
I get it. I've been there.

592
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:54,948
So much of what we fight against
is preventable.

593
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:56,234
It's like...

594
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,409
why am I drowning in debt

595
00:25:58,494 --> 00:26:00,081
for this?

596
00:26:01,252 --> 00:26:02,874
It's exhausting.

597
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:06,448
I don't know
how many different ways

598
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:07,910
- I can tell you that I'm fine.
- You don't have

599
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:09,785
to talk to me... I'll give you
a name, someone good.

600
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,994
But I'm not looking
to talk to anyone.

601
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:13,726
Drop it.

602
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:22,721
- Hi.
- How's my mom?

603
00:26:22,806 --> 00:26:24,080
Is she okay?

604
00:26:24,189 --> 00:26:26,045
Dr. Austin and Dr. Okafor

605
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:28,408
are still with her
in the cath lab.

606
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:32,025
While we're waiting,

607
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,689
we want to run
a couple other tests on you.

608
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,537
I bet your mom would feel better

609
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:38,283
if we had some answers
when she came out.

610
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:40,174
Put your hands up like this.

611
00:26:40,837 --> 00:26:42,312
Okay.

612
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:46,588
This is my fault, isn't it?

613
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:50,588
I pushed back about everything.

614
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:54,119
I argued with her all last year.

615
00:26:55,556 --> 00:26:57,198
I'm why she was so stressed.

616
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,792
No. No, you didn't do this.

617
00:26:58,877 --> 00:27:02,287
This past year was stressful
for everyone.

618
00:27:03,892 --> 00:27:05,083
You can't blame yourself

619
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,978
for circumstances
that are out of your control.

620
00:27:11,502 --> 00:27:13,565
That was a near miss
with that stent deployment.

621
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,417
Fine job back there.

622
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:17,542
We do make a good team.

623
00:27:17,627 --> 00:27:19,260
That we do.

624
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,806
I have bad news.

625
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,386
I spoke
to an immigration lawyer.

626
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:28,188
If we get married,
it could raise red flags.

627
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,024
Why?

628
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:31,859
We've known each other
for years.

629
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:34,128
It's easy to prove we have
a basis for a real marriage.

630
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:36,158
But this version of us is new.

631
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:39,470
We don't have photos or records
of vacations together.

632
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:41,650
The government
will ask "Why now?"

633
00:27:41,736 --> 00:27:43,043
They can ask
all the questions they want.

634
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,122
We got nothing to hide.

635
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:46,034
The lawyer said
the presumption will be

636
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:48,450
that our marriage
is not bona fide.

637
00:27:48,602 --> 00:27:51,206
If there is an investigation
and it goes badly,

638
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:54,214
I'll get deported and not
allowed back in the country.

639
00:27:54,892 --> 00:27:56,228
Not allowed back in the country?

640
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,926
You could face
felony charges for perjury.

641
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,587
Not if I don't perjure myself.

642
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:02,710
Mina, if we end up in court,
I will tell them the truth.

643
00:28:02,795 --> 00:28:04,461
The marriage is real.

644
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:10,148
Unless you're saying
you don't think it'll be real.

645
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:12,232
Okay, AJ,
you're not hearing me.

646
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:14,526
If we get married
right after my visa denial,

647
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:17,822
no matter what we say or do,
I can still get deported.

648
00:28:17,955 --> 00:28:20,282
It's putting us both at risk
and I refuse to do that.

649
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:25,245
- So you're saying the wedding is off.
- I am.

650
00:28:26,814 --> 00:28:29,064
We've got to deal
with this bigger problem first.

651
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,681
You can't marry or even date
someone who isn't here.

652
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:47,917
Ah.

653
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:50,979
Murgh makhani, Bharta,

654
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:54,026
Coconut barfi,
all of your favorites.

655
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,276
Mom, the hospital
has a cafeteria.

656
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,284
Well, now you don't
have to go there.

657
00:28:58,423 --> 00:29:00,752
Or come home to filth.

658
00:29:00,994 --> 00:29:02,885
Your room was
particularly a disaster.

659
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,986
- I discarded these things.
- Okay, stop.

660
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,666
Okay?

661
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:10,061
Did you like any of the pictures
that I sent you?

662
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,518
Hmm?

663
00:29:13,158 --> 00:29:15,380
Listen, I am not there
right now.

664
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:18,128
Dating is not exactly
on my radar, okay?

665
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:19,551
Let-Let's go.

666
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:21,549
I thought we could eat together.

667
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,268
God, you cannot
just show up at my job

668
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:27,072
and expect me to drop everything
and go eat barfi with you.

669
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:28,337
You need to listen.

670
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:30,854
I-I eat cafeteria food,
I have women over

671
00:29:30,939 --> 00:29:32,715
who might not be Indian,
and that is my choice.

672
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,931
I don't want any of this.
I don't need it.

673
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:39,572
You should have asked
before coming here.

674
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:44,011
We both miss your father.

675
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:47,720
I thought we could
help each other.

676
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:52,362
Well, you should have
called first.

677
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,939
My calls go
straight to voice mail.

678
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:59,643
And when you do answer,
it's always,

679
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:02,301
"I only have a minute,"
or "I have to get back."

680
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:07,463
I didn't ask if I could visit
because I knew you'd say no.

681
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:20,360
Two minutes in the microwave.

682
00:30:25,822 --> 00:30:30,861
Well, the famous Sidney Vicious
won't be lonely tonight.

683
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:32,722
We should be able
to get you out of here soon.

684
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:38,253
You have a rare genetic
disease called Refsum syndrome.

685
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,042
- Does my mom have it, too?
- No.

686
00:30:40,127 --> 00:30:42,745
She's a carrier of the mutation,
but to get the disease,

687
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,729
you have to have
two genetic defects.

688
00:30:44,814 --> 00:30:48,323
Basically, y-your body
isn't able to process

689
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:49,823
a certain type of fat.

690
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:52,863
Over time, that causes toxicity
to multiple organs.

691
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:54,365
That's why you were falling.

692
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:56,736
And it's why your heart
was giving you trouble.

693
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:58,853
Here's the good news:
It's totally manageable.

694
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,864
We caught it early,
which is fantastic.

695
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:04,209
And my buddy Dr. Pravesh and I,
we think changes

696
00:31:04,293 --> 00:31:06,089
in your diet are gonna
do the trick.

697
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:09,087
So we'll hook you up
with a nutritionist,

698
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:10,838
and we'll schedule
regular appointments

699
00:31:10,923 --> 00:31:12,756
to keep an eye on everything.

700
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:18,330
I acted like everything was fine
because I wanted it to be.

701
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:22,318
You wanted life to be normal.
We all do.

702
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,947
Yeah, but Mom knew something
was wrong with me.

703
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:29,692
Yeah, well,
sometimes our parents

704
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:31,736
see things that we don't see
in ourselves.

705
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:35,240
I stomped around like
the world was happening to me.

706
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:37,782
While she was the one who
actually had something wrong.

707
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:39,611
Eh, don't take that on.

708
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:42,187
You and your mom,
you got through the impossible.

709
00:31:42,286 --> 00:31:44,619
Cut yourself a break.
Celebrate it.

710
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:47,826
I've been so annoyed with my mom
this whole time,

711
00:31:47,911 --> 00:31:52,392
but now it's like...
I just want her to be okay.

712
00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:54,518
I need her.

713
00:31:54,602 --> 00:31:57,267
I'm pretty sure
she needs you, too.

714
00:32:00,566 --> 00:32:01,994
It's Nic.

715
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,385
Go.

716
00:32:11,744 --> 00:32:13,541
Oh, wow.

717
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:17,707
Doesn't matter how many times
I've seen one of these.

718
00:32:18,189 --> 00:32:20,150
It's different when it's ours.

719
00:32:20,948 --> 00:32:22,332
It's magical.

720
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:24,931
Oh, look. That's the heartbeat.

721
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:29,657
- Ah. Looks like a fighter.
- I agree.

722
00:32:29,768 --> 00:32:32,533
Growing just like it should be.
That is a perfect baby.

723
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:35,267
This is good.

724
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,874
I love you.

725
00:32:39,464 --> 00:32:41,191
I love you, too.

726
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:45,248
Want to know
what you're having?

727
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:48,072
Uh...

728
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:52,361
Mom?

729
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:55,510
Mom?

730
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,725
I'm right here, Mama.

731
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:01,833
Hi, baby.

732
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,311
The doctors fixed your heart.

733
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:08,369
We managed to place a stent
in your blocked artery.

734
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,580
You get to go home
in a couple of days.

735
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,948
Well, we didn't make it
to your apartment.

736
00:33:14,063 --> 00:33:15,147
It's okay.

737
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:16,724
I'm not moving out
anymore.

738
00:33:17,314 --> 00:33:18,935
I'm gonna stay home with you.

739
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:21,144
The hell you are.

740
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:26,267
You think I helped those wings
grow strong just to clip them?

741
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,150
You're ready to fly.

742
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:32,267
But what if you need me?

743
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,027
Then I'll call you.

744
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:38,821
Pickups to me.

745
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,642
These buggers are everywhere.

746
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,089
Well, we're
making good progress.

747
00:33:42,173 --> 00:33:44,775
Last time with one of these
tumors, it took hours to ligate

748
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,860
all vessels.

749
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:47,389
I think we're lucky she's young,

750
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,448
and we caught this
while it was still small.

751
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:51,191
Metz?

752
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:54,908
I see why you
don't want to be CEO.

753
00:33:55,385 --> 00:33:57,002
You're a wizard in the OR.

754
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,383
Still, Chastain needs you.

755
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:01,502
It's about quality of life, Kit.

756
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:03,143
That's why
you should do it.

757
00:34:04,486 --> 00:34:08,220
As CEO,
you can hire anyone you want.

758
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,602
Remind me, Randolph.

759
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:13,166
What are the
"Cs of medical cash flow"?

760
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,228
- I'm not doing that.
- I'll start.

761
00:34:15,414 --> 00:34:18,786
Chemo, cataracts, colonoscopies.
Come on, give me one.

762
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:19,784
Cancer.

763
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:21,932
Already covered when
I said "chemo." Try again.

764
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:23,458
Cosmetic surgery.

765
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:25,150
There you go.

766
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,431
You could gain financial ground
by hiring a rock star

767
00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:31,118
plastic surgeon.

768
00:34:31,424 --> 00:34:33,447
Like your stepson Jake.

769
00:34:34,556 --> 00:34:36,478
- Cauterize.
- I am.

770
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,846
Trust me, the kid doesn't want
to be anywhere near me,

771
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:40,604
much less work under me.

772
00:34:40,689 --> 00:34:44,556
Maybe you could sweeten the deal
if you took Yorn's offer.

773
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:53,861
Did I...
did I give you a picture?

774
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:57,096
Don't worry. It went straight
in the shredder.

775
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:59,242
Never mind. I don't want
to remember anything else.

776
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:00,636
No, it's not your fault.

777
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:02,645
You had a very rare type
of tumor

778
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:04,081
that secreted hormones,

779
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,550
and it caused your behavior
to change.

780
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:08,838
- What happens now?
- We have to wait

781
00:35:08,923 --> 00:35:11,676
for pathology results
to stage it appropriately,

782
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:13,698
but we have some
of the finest oncologists

783
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:15,667
here who will help
with the next steps.

784
00:35:15,752 --> 00:35:18,525
And we can already see
your mental status is improving.

785
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:20,379
Try not to be embarrassed.

786
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:22,017
If you hadn't followed
Dr. Bell here,

787
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:24,322
who knows when
you would've been diagnosed.

788
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,635
- Okay. But still, Dr. Bell.
- Mm.

789
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,345
You're like four decades
too old for me.

790
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:32,813
I don't think four is right.

791
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:34,990
You're like my grandpa.

792
00:35:36,764 --> 00:35:38,370
Or father.

793
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:39,868
It's fortunate we caught it

794
00:35:39,952 --> 00:35:43,488
when we did. Get some rest.

795
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:45,368
Let's go, Gramps.

796
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:49,494
Thanks.

797
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:54,338
Hey, Nic.

798
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,636
- Hey.
- Um...

799
00:35:58,001 --> 00:35:59,595
I'm giving these
back to you.

800
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:03,986
And, um, I shouldn't have
put you in that weird position.

801
00:36:04,172 --> 00:36:05,135
I'm sorry.

802
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,420
It did...
feel strange giving them to you.

803
00:36:09,713 --> 00:36:11,940
Um, but are you okay?

804
00:36:14,344 --> 00:36:15,714
Everyone keeps asking me that.

805
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,136
I guess I need
to figure it out.

806
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,111
Yeah, figuring it out
will help.

807
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,650
And you know I'm here
if you need anything, right?

808
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:25,408
Yeah.

809
00:36:26,455 --> 00:36:28,861
- Thanks again.
- Mm.

810
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,578
What's all that about?

811
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:35,354
Well, I was just
texting everybody.

812
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:37,701
Check your phone.

813
00:36:42,008 --> 00:36:43,425
<i>I was with Nic</i>

814
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,753
when she sent that text.
She didn't say why.

815
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:47,988
- Do you know why we're here?
- We'll find out soon enough.

816
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,846
I'm guessing a baby.
They just got married.

817
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,731
- It's got to be a baby.
- Shh. Don't jinx it.

818
00:36:53,983 --> 00:36:56,233
We wanted you
to be the first to know.

819
00:36:56,318 --> 00:36:59,110
- You're having a baby?
- Don't jinx it.

820
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:02,273
- - Guess it was obvious.
- Oh!

821
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:04,327
- Fantastic news.
- Yeah, I'll have that now.

822
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:05,954
Here you go. Here you go.

823
00:37:06,038 --> 00:37:08,331
- You want to do the honors?
- Thank you.

824
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:09,713
It's a girl.

825
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:13,882
You didn't waste any time there.

826
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:17,799
Yay! Congrats!

827
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,217
Cheers. Cheers.

828
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,712
All right.

Hey, Mom.

00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:48,892
I wanted to see for myself
that you are okay.

832

No.

Mom, I'm...
I'm sorry I lied to you.

835
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:03,927
I didn't get this
from an ER patient.

836
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:06,391
I told my friends at work that

837
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:09,486
I got in a bike accident,
and that was a lie, too.

838
00:38:11,843 --> 00:38:14,344
Last night, I went to a bar,

839
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,065
and there was this guy,
six foot five, huge arms,

840
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,713
minding his own business.

841
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:23,447
I just got in a fight with him.

842
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:25,110
Oh, Devon.

843
00:38:25,491 --> 00:38:27,799
Mom, that's not even
the first dumb thing I've done.

844
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:30,416
I just...

845
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:33,544
keep thinking about Dad,

846
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:35,252
you know, and...

847
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:38,494
what I could have done
different.

848
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,564
You know?

849
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:43,978
You cannot blame yourself.

850
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:48,080
If I...

851
00:38:48,985 --> 00:38:51,125
just moved him
to a different hospital,

852
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,625
or spoke
to his doctors more often...

853
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,539
If I had made him
stop driving that taxi.

854
00:38:58,354 --> 00:39:00,580
No, Mom.
That was his choice.

855
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,188
And then,
the system failed him.

856
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,117
And it failed us.

857
00:39:13,201 --> 00:39:15,156
Listen, that isn't your fault.

858
00:39:15,602 --> 00:39:17,227
Well, it's not yours, either.

859
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:22,758
No, his death was out
of our control.

860
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,695
Yeah.

861
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,633
We need each other.

862
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:29,930
Okay?

863
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,000
Please stay.

864
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,203
I will. I will.

865
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:42,882
Mm.

866
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:49,912
Someone has to help you eat

867
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:52,024
all of this food.

868
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:57,678
You could always make
a nice dinner

869
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,766
for one of the lovely women in
the pictures that I sent you.

870
00:40:00,977 --> 00:40:04,567
Oh, my... You don't quit.

871
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:09,648
AJ?

872
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:16,149
Well, if you came here
to wish me good luck,

873
00:40:16,234 --> 00:40:17,430
I'm offended.

874
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:21,289
I can do an inguinal
hernia repair in my sleep.

875
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:23,148
I'm not here
for luck.

876
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:25,555
I need to tell you something.

877
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:28,125
I'm listening.

878
00:40:29,758 --> 00:40:31,742
I don't often apologize,

879
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:33,914
because I rarely
make mistakes,

880
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:37,024
but today,
I made one.

881
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,759
I shouldn't have
proposed to you like that

882
00:40:40,844 --> 00:40:42,727
without doing
the proper research.

883
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,767
You had every right
to be upset.

884
00:40:47,563 --> 00:40:49,485
You were in a tough spot.

885
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,203
You still are.

886
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,531
I asked you the impossible and
you agreed without hesitation.

887
00:40:57,215 --> 00:40:58,617
I'm grateful for that.

888
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,047
Okay.

889
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:08,180
Nic asked me
if I'm in love with you.

890
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:12,235
I didn't know
what to say then, but...

891
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:14,422
now I do.

892
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:19,367
It's yes.

893
00:41:21,616 --> 00:41:25,084
I am...
in love with you.

894
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:40,146
So the end of today's
roller coaster ride is here.

895
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:43,506
And what a beautiful ending
it is.

896
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:45,549
Except, I may still
be deported.

897
00:41:45,634 --> 00:41:48,312
No. No, no,
that's not gonna happen.

898
00:41:48,515 --> 00:41:51,890
We are not gonna
let that happen, guaranteed.

899
00:41:55,335 --> 00:41:57,038
You know I love you, too,
right?

900
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:59,975
I suspected so.

901
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:06,749
What'd I tell you? Huh?
Magnificent lobby.

902
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:09,199
I think it would fall right
n line with what... - Jacob.

903
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:11,006
Your, uh, office

904
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:13,696
was my next stop
after I finished this tour.

905
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,057
Well, uh,

906
00:42:15,148 --> 00:42:16,817
pardon the interruption.
Do you mind if I just steal him

907
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,785
for just a moment?

908
00:42:23,037 --> 00:42:25,334
I've decided to accept
Red Rock's generous offer.

909
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:26,536
I'm confident, as CEO,

910
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,486
I can turn
our financial situation around.

911
00:42:28,622 --> 00:42:30,240
And I have
some initial thoughts about...

912
00:42:30,325 --> 00:42:31,957
Since last we spoke,
Red Rock has had

913
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:34,154
to make
some very difficult decisions.

914
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:37,841
So that CEO spot...
No longer open.

915
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:42,498
Who are you filling it with?

916
00:42:42,662 --> 00:42:45,146
No one. We sold Chastain.

917
00:42:46,668 --> 00:42:49,834
Well, um, I'll be happy to work
with the new conglomerate

918
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:50,991
- in any way...
- Look around. Look around.

919
00:42:51,075 --> 00:42:53,584
We are standing on
a prime piece of real estate.

920
00:42:53,669 --> 00:42:55,591
These buyers are developers.

921
00:42:56,483 --> 00:42:57,935
Yeah.

922
00:42:58,265 --> 00:43:01,021
They're turning Chastain
into luxury condos.

923
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,217
My apologies.

924
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:08,515
Why don't we walk over
to the elevators here.

925
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:11,592
I want you guys to get that
magnificent view from up top.
