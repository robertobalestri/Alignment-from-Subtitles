We wanted you

It's a girl.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,132
Red Rock has had to make
some very difficult decisions.

9
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:21,781
They're turning Chastain
into luxury condos.

10
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,178
Wow.

11
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:32,351
You keep coming
through for me, Dad.

12
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:34,285
One text and you hop on a plane.

13
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,602
Yeah. I would do anything
for you.

14
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:39,351
Well, there's good news
and bad news.

15
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:41,250
Bad news first.

16
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:43,650
Chastain's been sold.

17
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,171
The plan is to turn it
into condos.

18
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:49,554
Given that the hospital
loses millions,

19
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:52,750
I think Red Rock
made a smart decision.

20
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:55,468
With terrible
human consequences.

21
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:57,546
Atlanta needs Chastain.

22
00:00:57,843 --> 00:00:59,851
The other hospitals
can't possibly absorb

23
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,306
all of our patients.

24
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:04,443
And thousands of Chastain
employees will lose their jobs.

25
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:06,117
And two people I love.

26
00:01:06,202 --> 00:01:07,976
I can't stand by
and watch it happen.

27
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,976
Would you consider
putting together

28
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:16,789
a group of individuals
to buy back the hospital?

29
00:01:16,874 --> 00:01:18,584
You're the king of takeovers,

30
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:20,629
and if you're willing
to front some of the cash,

31
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:22,843
I can handle
the medical side of the pitch.

32

Conrad, my resources are

But the committee
took another look at your case.

108

And given your age
and your medical history,

109
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,460
they're worried that you're not
gonna survive the operation.

a transplant was my only option.

All right, so right there,

154
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,687
there's your
arteriovenous malformation.

155
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:37,315
It's in the left ventricle.

156
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,201
And you see how
completely enmeshed it is

157
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:40,191
in that heart wall?

158
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:41,819
If we cut that AVM out,

159
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:44,195
you won't have any heart left
to keep you alive.

160
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,956
I'll risk it.

161
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,366
It's not a risk, Mr. Schultz,

162
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,701
it's a certainty.

163
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:51,795
You would die in the OR.

164
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:53,715
Now, you can still have
a decent quality of life

165
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:56,760

00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:43,254
What does that do to us?

179
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,216
The band's breaking up already?

180
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,741
You could be there, too.

181
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:49,594
A lot of fantastic hospitals
in Boston.

182
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:52,098
Yeah, but you know I already
got accepted to Atlanta General.

183
00:08:52,182 --> 00:08:54,726
You know, plus,
I-I have family here.

184
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,487
A prestigious hospital like this
could get me my 01 visa.

185
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:00,323
It would solve all my problems.

186
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,825
You haven't committed yet.

187
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,951
Boston is a fantastic
medical town.

188
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,572
Come with me.

189
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:12,243
I-I can see us in a little house
on the Back Bay.

190
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:16,213
Snow falling down... ah,
a fireplace.

191
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,678
Sounds like heaven.

192
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,962
Uh... all right.

193
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:27,039
I'll check my contacts
and I'll see what's up.

194
00:09:27,142 --> 00:09:28,800
Okay? But hey.

195
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:32,022
Regardless, congratulations.

196
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,881
You know, I couldn't be
more proud of you.

197
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:37,234
Yeah.

198
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,864
Thank you.

199
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,386
Dr. Cain.

200
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,171
Barrett, Barrett, calm down.

201
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:07,431
Calm down.

202
00:10:07,582 --> 00:10:08,932
It's Dr. Voss. You're okay.

203
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,676
No, no, we can't take you
off the vent yet.

204
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,304
It's too early in your recovery.

205
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:15,346
No, stop.

206
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,941
Stop. It's... You can't
breathe on your own.

207
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:20,185
Sorry, Barrett,
but I have to sedate you.

208
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,904
It's for your own good.

209
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,793
Pack it up. We got to go.

210
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,837
One last sample just came in.

211
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:48,379
It's for Nic Nevin,
nurse on the fourth floor?

212
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,786
So everything turned out
great, yeah?

213
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:14,685
I mean, we're past
the first trimester,

214
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:16,918
so a little less scared,
getting excited.

215
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:19,077
I'm so happy for you.

216
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:22,540
And I am happy for you.
Mass General, Mina, wow.

217
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,749
Yeah, it's a pretty big deal.

218
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,377
I get to operate with
Marcella Crayton,

219
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:29,139
one of the best general surgeons
in the country.

220
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:30,640
Amazing.

221
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,675
What am I gonna do without you?

222
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,645
- Mm, I'll miss you, too.
- What about Austin?

223
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,722
Hopefully he'll find a spot
and come with me.

224
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:39,182
My head fricking hurts!

225
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,775
I need to see someone now!

226
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:41,943
I'm sorry, but
Chastain has stopped seeing

227
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:43,278
- any new patients.
- Useless!

228
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:45,103
- What are you even doing here?
- Sir,

229
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:46,856
a little respect, all right?
There's nothing she can do.

230
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,616
Well, then you do something.
All right? You're a doctor.

231
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,903
I need... I need fricking help.
Okay? I've been up for days.

232
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,611
Are you on any medication
right now?

233
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:57,074
Yes. Ativan. For-for months.
The doctors got me hooked.

234
00:11:57,158 --> 00:11:59,869
Okay? But I'm clean now.
All right? Two days.

235
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,508
- Okay, you're in withdrawal.
- Wait, what are you doing?

236
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:03,415
Are you calling the cops?

237
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,970
I'm not calling the cops,
I'm just calling for help.

238
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:06,603
- No, don't call the cops!
- Hey, hey, hey!

239
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,586
Sir, you need to calm down,
okay?

240
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,639

Mina, she needs access.

260

Nothing yet. Still
waiting on that crash cart.

265

that Nic's pregnant, so...

347
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:35,207
She...?

348
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,653
- Oh!
- God, I'm so, I'm so sorry.

349
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:40,231
I... I thought you knew.

350
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,654
I didn't know.

351
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,636
Take a breath.

352
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:52,729
How-How's the baby?

353
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:55,509
We don't know yet.

354
00:18:56,651 --> 00:19:00,077
My daughter...

355
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:03,554
and now my grandchild,
I could lose them both?

356
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:06,128
Don't go there.

357
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:11,021
There's a lot of heartbreak
in this hospital right now.

358
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,375
We have to stay strong
for our kids.

359
00:19:14,901 --> 00:19:17,068
Nothing else matters.

360
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:25,081
She made it.

361
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:31,498
The next 12 hours are going
to be crucial to her recovery.

362
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:35,861
I'll close.

363
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:39,298
It's Nic... it has to be perfect.

364
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:08,690
Just give it to me straight.

365
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:12,824
She lost a lot of blood

366
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:15,285
and was down for a long time.

367
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:17,588
We won't know
her neurological status

368
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:19,715
until we wake her up.

369
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,708
They're moving her to the ICU.

370
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:38,983
I'll order a stat set of labs as
soon as we get her to the ICU.

371
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:41,248
We need to courier
them to another hospital.

372
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:43,216
No one's left in the labs here.

373
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:45,543
We need to work on getting her
to Atlanta General.

374
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:48,890
We need to stabilize her
here first.

375
00:20:48,974 --> 00:20:50,362
Then we move her.

376
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:52,969
I'll call the transfer center,
see what's available.

I've got you. Okay.

394
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:25,902
Barrett, it won't work.
You can't breathe on your own.

395
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,939
You do this again,

396
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:30,282
we're gonna have
to strap you in.

397
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:56,692
Um...

398
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:59,588
So it doesn't look like Nic
is gonna wake up any time soon.

399
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:01,131
We don't know what's wrong.

400
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:02,856
Could be she suffered
a catastrophic

401
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:04,515
brain injury in the ER.

402
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:07,403
We don't know,
but it's not good.

403
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:10,280
We'll check on Henry.

404
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:14,839
I spoke to the transfer center.

405
00:23:14,924 --> 00:23:16,320
All the beds
in the city are taken.

406
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:17,662
Overflow from Chastain.

407
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,699
We can take
care of her here today,

408
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:23,960
but she needs specialists
we no longer have.

409
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:25,929
She needs
a functioning hospital.

410
00:23:26,014 --> 00:23:27,331
This puts it in perspective.

411
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:29,207
The loss of Chastain
was a body blow,

412
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:30,593
it's just nothing
compared to this.

413
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:32,053
Hey.

414
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:33,629
You want me to get
Conrad out of there

415
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,639
for ten minutes so you can do
a quick ultrasound

416
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:36,865
and check on the baby?

417
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,862
If something's wrong
with the baby,

418
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:39,521
I don't want Conrad to know.

419
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:42,145
I don't want to know, either.

420
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,690
That guy was mad and agitated.

421
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:49,653
And I tried to deescalate,

422
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,615
but I put my hands on him
and he attacked me.

423
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,383
Nic stepped in to help
and he turned on her.

424
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:58,235
She risked her life and the life
of her baby for my sake.

425
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,171
Mina, Mina, listen to me.

426
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,232
There is no way this
is your fault. You hear me?

427
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,376
I feel responsible.

428
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:12,417
I can't imagine
how hard this is for you.

429
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:16,587
But the surgery went as well
as could be expected.

430
00:24:16,682 --> 00:24:18,089
When will she wake up?

431
00:24:18,183 --> 00:24:20,551
When the sedation wears off.

432
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:22,560
Are you okay?

433
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,523
Yeah, I have to be.

434
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,191
For Nic.

435
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:43,873
We're losing our jobs,

436
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,210
we're losing our home.

437
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,963
But we can't lose each other.

438
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:56,945
U-Uh, Dr. Feldman, please,

439
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,297
- I want to see that one.
- Oh.

440
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:00,631
Uh, yeah, here you go, Henry.

441
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:03,186
But if we're going to reminisce
again, let's make it quick.

442
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,311
Pickup for hospice
is in about an hour.

443
00:25:07,482 --> 00:25:09,381
- Sunshine Sara.
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:25:09,484 --> 00:25:12,487
I picked her up at the Decatur
flea market for a song.

445
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:15,196
- She always brought me good luck.
- Ah.

446
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:17,574
How's Nic?

447
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,058
No change yet.

448
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,078
You guys aren't as far along
as I'd hoped.

449
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,666
We'd be all the way packed up
if a certain someone

450
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,583
didn't interrupt
with constant commentary.

451
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,670
Each figurine holds
a special memory for Henry

452
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:30,621
and he would like
to share them all with us.

453
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:33,815
Henry, Piedmont Park
is a nice place.

454
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,242
Lovely garden,
not far from here.

455
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:38,629
- Will you visit me?
- I will...

456
00:25:38,713 --> 00:25:40,321
come by as soon
as you're settled.

457
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:43,634
Dr. Feldman and Jessica
told me about Nic.

458
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:45,977
It's awful news.

459
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:49,974
This is a dark day indeed.

460
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:52,517
She's so lovely.

461
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:54,185
She dropped by
practically every day

462
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:57,363
for the six months I was here
to visit me.

463
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,321
Would you give Sunshine Sara
to Nic?

464
00:26:04,405 --> 00:26:06,449
Maybe she'll give her
good luck, too.

465
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:09,827
Or maybe you can give
Sunshine Sara to Nic yourself.

466
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:12,170
Thank you.

467
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:18,209
You know, your emergency
stapling skills

468
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:20,545
could use a little work.

469
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:22,713
You, on the
other hand, would make

470
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:24,048
a fine tailor.

471
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:25,634
Yeah, I guess
I missed my calling, eh?

472
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:29,145
No, you're doing exactly
what you were meant to do.

473
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,147
Hey.

474
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:33,901
I made up my mind.

475
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:35,893
I'll find work in Boston.

476
00:26:35,987 --> 00:26:37,654
Good.

477
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,783
'Cause I can't lose you.

478
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:43,243
Not when we can lose Nic.

479
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:46,579
♪

480
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:06,099
♪

481
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:19,028
Hasn't woken up yet.
We're worried.

482
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,846
She's been off sedation
long enough.

483
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:23,324
She should've woken up by now.

484
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:35,962
We all do.

485
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:59,728
She's gonna wake up
tomorrow, right?

486
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,195
We hope.

487
00:28:03,617 --> 00:28:05,158
Hey.

488
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,874
All day long we fix people.

489
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,627
I've never had to fix Nic.

490
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:18,546
Nic fixed me.

491
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,301
I don't know what's happening.

492
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:27,079
How can I not know this?

493
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:30,516
I know her better
than anyone and...

494
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,313
I just, I can barely think.
I'm just like...

495
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:40,443
Take a step back.

496
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:43,647
Right now,
you are not the husband,

497
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:45,366
you are a doctor.

498
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,951
Okay? We can figure this out.

499
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:50,946
I should've moved her
to Atlanta General

500
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,415
when we had the chance.

501
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,158
It wouldn't matter,
even if you wanted to.

502
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:55,959
There were no beds.

503
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:59,128
Listen, focus.
What are the differentials?

504
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,923
I've run them all.

505
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,949
Eliminated everything
in my head.

506
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:06,295
Well, here's what you taught me:

507
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:08,546
To find a cure,
you need the right diagnosis.

508
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:11,474
The key
to the right diagnosis is...?

509
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:16,020
T-The patient's history
and the physical exam.

510
00:29:17,816 --> 00:29:19,440
Right.

511
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,209
What are we doing, man?

512
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,706
What are we doing?

513
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,549
Wait.

514
00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:49,345
Come here. Watch this.

515
00:29:57,513 --> 00:30:00,356
Delayed deep tendon reflexes.

516
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:04,193
Did they check
her thyroid levels?

517
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:07,448
Gabbi ran a battery of tests,

518
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:09,607
but her thyroid never resulted.

519
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,527
Hey, Conrad, what's going on?

520
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:13,904
How can I help? What can I do?
I got to do something.

521
00:30:13,988 --> 00:30:16,073
- What can I do?

522
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:17,540
- You got this.
- Wait...

523
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,208
Let's go.

524
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,379
Hey.

525
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,881
Baby girl.

526
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,927
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

527
00:30:38,438 --> 00:30:40,638
All right, look-look for
anything with Nic's name on it.

528
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,523

her thyroid results.

No.

532
00:30:56,306 --> 00:30:57,498
Found it.
Lab tech must have left

533
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:59,415
before they finished
running them.

534
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,303
Look at Nic's TSH and T4.

535
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,265
- She's floridly hypothyroid.
- That can happen

536
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:06,665
during pregnancy. It's why she's
not clearing the anesthesia.

537
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:09,251
- We can treat that.
- We need to get her on

538
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:11,511
thyroid replacement
and steroids now.

539
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:19,740
How long until it takes effect?

540
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:23,286
Could be hours. Could be days.

541
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,579
Let's just hope it works.

542
00:31:38,085 --> 00:31:40,010
Henry's going to hospice.

543
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:41,753
He wanted to say goodbye.

544
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:46,683
I, um, I-I brought this
for Nic...

545
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,312
...to bring her luck.

546
00:31:49,396 --> 00:31:50,480
Would you give it to her?

547
00:31:50,564 --> 00:31:52,397
Sure thing.

548
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:57,854
Want to thank you all,
for everything.

549
00:31:57,938 --> 00:32:01,273
I don't know
what I'll do without you.

I-I thought that Nic and I were
the last patients at Chastain.

553
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,659
Uh, well, he'll be leaving soon.

554
00:32:20,744 --> 00:32:23,061
Do you think
that he'd like a figurine?

555
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:26,365
I-I've got an extra
Reckless Randy.

556
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,801
Yeah, I don't think
that's his jam.

557
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:31,469
Might cheer him up.

Yeah, sure.

Why not, right?

00:32:39,095 --> 00:32:40,571
Hmm.

562
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:46,577
Patient wanted
to leave you this.

Come on, bruh,
it's Reckless Randy.

564
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:54,490
Yeah.
Figured as much.

565
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,798
Henry Schultz.
70-year-old male.

566
00:33:06,882 --> 00:33:09,266
Inoperable AVM
on his left ventricle.

567
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:12,521
Delisted for a heart transplant.
Lovely man.

568

We all wanted to fix him,
but we can't.

569
00:33:15,482 --> 00:33:17,232

Hey, look at this.

This is Cain's idea about Henry.

574
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:56,306
Treat his AVM
like a brain tumor?

575
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,981
AJ, this means nothing.

576
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:00,917
You cut out a brain tumor
or you shrink it with radiation.

577
00:34:03,046 --> 00:34:04,470
But not a vascular tumor.

578
00:34:04,573 --> 00:34:06,024
Right, with those
you cut off the blood supply

579
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:08,066
and you shrink 'em
with surgical glue.

580
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:10,245
Th... That's radical.

581
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:11,863
- Yeah.
- But brilliant.

Cain may be down,
but he's definitely not out.

The patient could die on the
table. Will he accept that risk?

Yeah.
He's been begging for anything

that might give him
a fighting chance.

586
00:34:21,974 --> 00:34:24,467
The question is do we have an
interventional radiology suite

587
00:34:24,551 --> 00:34:26,044
that's still intact?

588
00:34:26,128 --> 00:34:27,511
On the second floor, yeah.

589
00:34:27,704 --> 00:34:30,257
I'll get Mina.
One last surgery

Rest.

596
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:47,975
It looks like
the supply to the AVM

597
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:49,905
is coming from
the obtuse marginal.

598
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:51,475
So you target the OM1.

599
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,608
But delicately, now.

600
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:56,026
If it's not positioned properly,
this glue can travel

See how it flows
and fills the vessel?

606
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,051
It's like lava from a volcano.

607
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:22,812

642
00:39:20,974 --> 00:39:22,859
since Randall is governor now

643
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,820
and she was a patient here.

644
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,664
Is there any chance the county
would take over the hospital?

645
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,704
Well, our budget
would be much tighter.

646
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,487
And you'd be legally obligated

647
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,416
to take on every new patient
that came through our doors.

648
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,262
We would be managed and funded

649
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,879
by the state.
Going public could be

650
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,572

Now, Red Rock Medical

657
00:39:58,087 --> 00:40:00,397
could sell the hospital
to the county

658
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,825
for a dollar, but then
you would have to assume

659
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:04,942
all of Chastain's debts.

660
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,870
But I've done some research,
and in Miami, they voted

661
00:40:08,063 --> 00:40:09,865
to institute
a half-penny sales tax

662
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,615
to fund their public hospital,

663
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,168

664
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:14,284
worked like gangbusters.

665
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:15,462
Who-who would run the hospital?

run the numbers,
do the research,

673
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,056
- I'll get back to...
- No, it's just, there isn't,

674
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:28,132
there isn't time.

675
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,758
You are one of the few leaders

676
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,468
who can act fast in a crisis,

677
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,895
and if you do this,

678
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:35,190
you'll be saving lives and...

679
00:40:35,274 --> 00:40:38,226
and-and making Atlanta
a leader in reform.

680
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,862
And, although I'm sure

681
00:40:39,946 --> 00:40:41,979
this isn't
your first consideration,

682
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,740
you would have
a crack platform to run on

683
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:48,411
in your
special election campaign.

684
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:53,323
Well, Mr. Schultz,
your AVM has gotten smaller.

685
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:56,670
Yeah, the glue is doing
exactly what it's supposed to.

686
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,254
No hospice for you.

687
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:00,341
We'll transfer you
to a skilled nursing facility

688
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,924
to recover, but then,

689
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,485
after that, you'll have
many years of life ahead of you.

690
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,004
What about the hospital?

691
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:08,423
No, we won't be here.

692
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,874
For Chastain,
there is no happy ending.

693
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,685
I think there is.

694
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,269
Marshall and Bell pulled it off.

695
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:15,189
They got the governor
to agree to make Chastain

696
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:17,898
a public hospital, and the staff
will return immediately.

697
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:21,351
This place could actually

698
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,020
be a model for health care.

699
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:26,407
Yes, the
doctors will be in charge.

700
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,286
Wow, I can't believe it.

701
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,748
It's amazing, right?
Conrad didn't give up,

702
00:41:32,832 --> 00:41:35,042
so neither did Bell or Marshall.

703
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,351
I'll see you guys.
Gonna make some calls.

704
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:41,924
We're going public.
Means we're still alive.

705
00:41:42,008 --> 00:41:44,459
And that also means you can't leave.

706
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,977
You know, you can't
change residencies

707
00:41:46,061 --> 00:41:47,504
unless the hospital
goes out of business.

708
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,598
Mass General's off the table.
So now I have just

709
00:41:49,682 --> 00:41:51,891
to call my lawyer about my visa.

710
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:55,938
Mina, listen to me.

711
00:41:56,022 --> 00:41:59,389
We are going to work this out.
Do you hear me?

712
00:41:59,525 --> 00:42:01,066
I promise.

713
00:42:03,002 --> 00:42:06,384
This has been
such a roller coaster.

714
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:08,604
Well, look,

715
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:11,042
it's a happy ending for Henry,

716
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:14,643
and Nic, Conrad
and baby Hawkins.

717
00:42:14,728 --> 00:42:16,783
Not so happy for Barrett Cain.

718
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:19,418
EMTs transferred him
this morning.
