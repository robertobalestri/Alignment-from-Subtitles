<font color="#ffff00">"The Resident"...</font>

2
00:00:02,364 --> 00:00:04,602
- Who's he?
- My former stepson Jake.

3
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:07,336
No, if you cared for me,
you would've stayed in touch.

4
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:08,844
<i>Chastain's been sold.</i>

5
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:10,813
The plan is to turn it
into condos.

6
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:12,131
Are you on any medication
right now?

7
00:00:12,216 --> 00:00:13,882
- Yes. Ativan.
- You're in withdrawal.

8
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:15,617
- No, don't call the cops!
- Hey, hey!

9
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:18,391
<i>- What happened?
- She was stabbed.</i>

10
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,734
Baby?

11
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:22,566
Looks like
your granddaughter's alive.

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,750
<i>We need to get Nic</i>

13
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:26,250
to a functioning hospital.

14
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:28,212
<i>Since Randall is governor now,</i>

15
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:31,001
is there any chance the county
would take over the hospital?

16
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:32,876
<i>They got the governor
to agree to make Chastain</i>

17
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:35,437
a public hospital and the staff
will return immediately.

18
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:51,352
Nic.

19
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:53,764
You're still at Chastain.

20
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:57,726
It's morning.
You're okay.

21
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:01,305
How's the baby?

22
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:06,312
Well, we heard the heartbeat,
remember?

23
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,056
Saw the ultrasound.

24
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,634
So she's safe.

25
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,153
No, we still haven't
ruled out any complications

26
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:14,859
that could've happened
from the attack.

27
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:17,500
You're right,
but it's been two weeks, so...

28
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:20,523
So far, so good.

29
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:24,047
Seems like our baby is strong,
like her mom.

30
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,945
Can't even make it through
the night without...

31
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,714
Nightmares.
I know.

32
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,430
They're getting worse.

33
00:01:34,747 --> 00:01:36,430
I dread going to sleep.

34
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:39,742
We could try
some different meds.

35
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:42,008
No, I want off
the sleep meds.

36
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:44,023
Okay, I get that.

37
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:52,896
Nic, I... also think you should
see a good therapist.

38
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,607
Sure. Fine.

39
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:58,156
But you know there's only
one person I want to see.

40
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,210
You know that.
You agreed to it.

41
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:02,242
Yeah, of course.

42
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,773
Whatever you need.

43
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,517
♪ <i>Yeah</i> ♪

44
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:19,773
♪ <i>My heart beats low</i>
<i>while the flames go higher</i> ♪

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,260

<i>and then the truth...</i> ♪

46
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,635
♪ <i>I'm gonna set my soul...</i> ♪

47
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,846
- Back up.
- You back up.

48
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:34,955
This is my parking spot.

49
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,956
I don't see a name.
There's no number.

50
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,608
We got here
at the same time.

51
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,035
You see,
it's reserved for doctors.

52
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:41,729
What are you,
a second-year resident?

53
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:42,871
Maybe third?

54
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,628
Internal medicine?
It's pretty obvious.

55
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:47,877
Particularly given
your bougie entitlement.

56
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:51,261
Okay, here's the deal:
If you don't back your car up,

57
00:02:51,346 --> 00:02:53,188
I'm gonna call security
and they're gonna tow it.

58
00:02:54,627 --> 00:02:56,134
Oh, don't you dare
key my car...

59
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:58,061
Want your special spot, Doctor?

60
00:02:58,146 --> 00:03:00,080
Go park mine
somewhere else.

61
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,466
Oh, and leave the keys
in Nic Nevin's room.

62
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:04,918
That's where I'll be.

63
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:11,850
- Pravesh. Good morning.
- Good morning.

64
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:13,902
Yo, some demented friend
of Nic's

65
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,994
actually expected me
to park her car.

66
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,354
Word? She tip you?

67
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,136
You know,
valets make bank on tips.

68
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:22,409
Your first day
at the new Chastain, huh?

69
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,838
Yeah. I mean, it doesn't
really look any different

70
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:25,425
as a public hospital, though.

71
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,885
Oh, believe me, brother,
it's different.

72
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:29,002
Brace yourself
for some growing pains.

73
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,050
An open door means
a lot more patients

74
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:34,322
and a lot less money
to care for them.

75
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,850
We turn no one away,

76
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:38,018
even though our resources
are stretched thin.

77
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,814
Yeah, I know it all
too well.

78
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,314
Happened to my father.

79
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:45,182
He died alone in
a public hospital, overlooked.

80
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,862
If it was private,
he might have lived.

81
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:50,346
Well, we gonna fight to make
sure that doesn't happen here,

82
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,947
- my man.
- Yeah.

83
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,858
Whoa. Dr. Feldman versus
a squeaky wheel.

84
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,569
My money's on Feldman
all day.

85
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:06,747
Thank you.
It's not just the wheel.

86
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:08,536
We'll be lucky
if we can get it to turn on.

87
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,466
Red Rock sold
most of our equipment.

88
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,536
Our EKG machines
are now ancient and we...

89
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:17,724
Oh, my God.

90
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:20,728
- You know her?
- Unfortunately, yes.

91
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:22,154
Although she looks
a lot different

92
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,755
than the last time
I saw her.

93
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:25,934
Less train wreck, more...

94
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,477
...wow.

95
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,992
- Train wreck. Really?
- Mm-hmm.

96
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:34,073
Didn't think
we'd ever see you here again.

97
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:35,882
Didn't think
I'd ever be here again.

98
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,268
I'm visiting Nic.

99
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:39,704
Oh, so you're the one
who got under Devon's skin.

100
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:41,872
Here you go.

101
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:44,093
Nic is in 521.

102
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:47,026
Your car is in
the impound lot on Peachtree.

103
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:55,596
- What's her deal?
- Billie Sutton.

104
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,797
Most promising neurosurgery
resident at Chastain.

105
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:03,128
Or was, until she wrecked one of
Conrad's patients and got fired.

106
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,274
- How'd she do that?
- Hubris, basically.

107
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,532
It was over three years ago.

108
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:08,312
Wow, that sounds bad.

109
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:09,680
- It was messy.
- Mm.

110
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:11,777
- All right.
- See you.

111
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,950
Ah. I fixed it.

112
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:21,820
We keep him on fluids.

113
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:23,507
He's stable, we should be...

114
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,131
Oh, my God.

115
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,484
- Here we go.
- Easy, Conrad.

116
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,799
People change.
Three years is a long time.

117
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:33,273
Not long enough.

118
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:37,704
Hawkins.

119
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:38,915
Sutton.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,343
I bet you're thrilled
to see me.

121
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:42,438
Mm, Nic wants you here,
so I want you here.

122
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:43,844
Then we won't have trouble.

123
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:45,781
Not from my end,
we won't.

124
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,226
Let's stick to the only thing
that matters.

125
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,140
How is Nic?

126
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,187
The attack nearly killed her
and the baby.

127
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:56,257
Physically, she's on the mend.

128
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,859
Mentally, each day's
a little worse.

129
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,930
She has PTSD,
keeps reliving what happened

130
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:03,515
and she's having
nightmares.

131
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:06,140
I sleep in her room.

132
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:08,578
She wakes up crying.

133
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,079
I'm so sorry it took me
this long to get here.

134
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:12,515
Where have you been?

135
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:15,890
You weren't at the wedding.
You never even called her.

136
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,079
- Nic was heartbroken.
- I'll explain what happened

137
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:19,013
when I see her.

138
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:20,797
You know, maybe for the moment,
we can put aside

139
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,719
all our triggers
and just be on the same side.

140
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,926
You and I will never be
on the same side.

141
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,057
I have worked the last
three years on my issues.

142
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:28,734
Your issues?

143
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,007
You wrecked
a young man's life.

144
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,961
It was my patient

145
00:06:36,046 --> 00:06:38,852
and you cut unsupervised.
You had no right.

146
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,488
So we're going there. Okay.

147
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:42,523
What I did was wrong.

148
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:45,219
But I believed I was acting
in the patient's best interest.

149
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,602
- You got me fired.
- No, I didn't,

150
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:48,876
and you were playing God.

151
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,649
A fifth-year resident does not
operate unsupervised, period.

152
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:52,289
Even you.

153
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:54,290
I made a judgment call.
It was bad judgement.

154
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,500
I broke the rules.
I was young and stupid.

155
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:58,992
No one breaks
more rules than you.

156
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,047
Yeah, I break the rules
when I have to,

157
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:02,352
when there's
no other alternative,

158
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:03,859
and only to save lives.

159
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,039
Annabeth Higgins.

160
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:10,282
The child
your incompetence killed.

161
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,731
Are you done?
Because I am.

162
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,968
We're all human.
We all make mistakes.

163
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:20,598
I have spent
the last three years

164
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:22,665
with Partners In Health
in Syria,

165
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,782
pulling bullets out of babies,
doing every kind

166
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,070
of emergency surgery
that exists.

167
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:28,532
Penance is my middle name.

168
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:30,555
Nic is vulnerable.
She can't handle any drama.

169
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,084
She won't get any
from me.

170
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,336
Fine.

171
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,120
Steer clear of me,
try and give Nic what she needs

172
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,687
and then leave,
as soon as possible.

173
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:49,755
Hello.

174
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:51,920
Billie.

175
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,130
Nevin.

176
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:55,740
You look amazing. Oh.

177
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:58,411
So good to see you.

178
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:00,982
Mm.
Let's see the ring.

179
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:04,802
Oh. Look at that rock.

180
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:06,482
He did good.

181
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:09,388
Mm. We missed you
at the wedding.

182
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:12,919
Long story.
I wanted to be there.

183
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:15,077
But I'm here now.

184
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,705
And I'll be staying
right by your side

185
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:18,341
as long as you need me.

186
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:19,780
I don't care how long it takes.

187
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:21,717
Days or weeks.

188
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,513
Honey, go.

189
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:27,955
Your patients need you.

190
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,717
Chastain needs help
with this transition.

191
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:30,936
Yeah, go.

192
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:32,312
I've got Nic.

193
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,298
Trust me.

194

Aired on: <font color="#00ffff">February 16, 2021</font>

196
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:54,479
Hey.

197
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,525
The board is interviewing
doctors today

198
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,855
for the new CEO position.

199
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,336
Yeah, they're talking
to everybody.

200
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:00,675
I declined.

201
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,940
Not everybody.
Not me.

202
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,120
You don't want
that thankless job, do you?

203
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:08,097
We are deep in the hole
but the situation is fixable.

204
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,675
I shouldn't be excluded
from providing solutions

205
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,210
simply because
I lack a penis.

206
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,127
- Wow, no women are being interviewed?
- Nope.

207
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:16,598
I wish Mina was here.

208
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,393
She'd have some choice words
and a few elbows to throw.

209
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:22,597
- Where is she?
- Meeting with immigration lawyers.

210
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:24,830
She has to find the best.
I can't lose her.

211
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,370
Neither can Chastain.

212
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:28,206
Dr. Lamas.
Where are you going?

213
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,831
L.A. I fly out tonight.

214
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,062
But you can't. We have

215
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:32,901
a bilateral hand transplant
this afternoon.

216
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:34,643
I get paid per procedure.

217
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:38,339
Can't work at a public hospital
on a fixed salary.

218
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:39,550
I'd make peanuts.

219
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:40,980
Come on, man.
It's not peanuts.

220
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:42,253
The salary is fair.

221
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:43,625
Is it north of two million?

222
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,425
Fine. Go.

223
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,369
But you have to do
Andy's surgery first.

224
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,872
We have donor hands
he's waited months to get.

225
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,236
Sorry, guys. Cedars-Sinai
is expecting me this week.

226
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:59,757
That's the fifth surgeon
we've lost.

227
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,161
There'll be more.

228
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:04,158
First things first.

229
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,987
Those donor hands will be
diverted to another child

230
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:08,565
if we don't find
a plastic surgeon

231
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,940
to replace Lamas
in the next few hours.

232
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,527
Do I look more important today?

233
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:17,322
- Should you?
- Yeah, the board needed a leader

234
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,233
for the ER transitional team
and you're looking at him.

235
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,625
Oh, good luck.
Have you seen the waiting room?

236
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,702
Yeah. We need to see
as many patients as we can

237
00:10:23,786 --> 00:10:25,871
as fast as we can.
15 minutes each.

238
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,294
- What if I need longer?
- Talk faster.

239
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:35,043
- I really have missed a lot.
- Yep, we have chickens.

240
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,813
The things we do for love.

241
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:40,293
What about you?
What's been going on?

242
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,317
I mean, you look better
than ever.

243
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:44,631
No, this is just armor.

244
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,520
You know,
given how things ended here,

245
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:49,364
- I had to put on my best face.
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,470
Have you gotten any residency?

247
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,787
No.

248
00:10:52,872 --> 00:10:54,580
I have no prospects yet.

249
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:57,012
Well, don't stop looking.

250
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:58,519
You can't waste all that talent.

251
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:00,020
Let's talk about you.

252
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:01,412
Looks like your physical

253
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:02,653
recovery is right on track.

254
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:03,770
But you're still in that bed.

255
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:05,067
Movement is medicine.

256
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:06,372
I've heard you say that
a million times.

257
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,919
Yeah, I just can't.

258
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:11,930
Okay, no pressure.

259
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,098
How long since you've left
this room?

260
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,114
I haven't.

261
00:11:17,992 --> 00:11:19,552
Let's get you some fresh air.

262
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,885
- Is it time to get my new hands?
- Soon, honey.

263
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:32,302
I'm here to introduce you
to your vascular surgeon,

264
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:33,865
- Dr. Austin.
- Hey.

265
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:35,349
Is he an all-star?

266
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:36,868
I promised Andy
I'd recruit

267
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:39,372
an all-star surgical team
for his hand transplant.

268
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,730
Ah, well, Andy, you are in luck.

269
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:43,732
I happen to be the all-star
of all-stars.

270
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,233
Like Freddie Freeman?

271
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:46,735
He's a four time all-star,
you know?

272
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:48,965
And a Golden Glove
first baseman, too, you know?

273
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,812
Just like me one day.

274
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:52,891
Mom already bought me
a baseball mitt.

275
00:11:52,976 --> 00:11:55,188
Ah, nothing like
the smell of a new glove.

276
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:57,116
And he hasn't stopped
smelling it.

277
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,581
Well, wait
till you can feel it, Andy.

278
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:01,225
I can't wait.

279
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,107
So when's my surgery?

280
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,921
Is there a problem?

281
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,308
We have a slight delay...
We lost our plastic surgeon.

282
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:11,912
But you finally
found him donor hands.

283
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:13,654
We can't lose them.

284
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:15,978
We'll find someone even better.

285
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,343
Uh-oh.

286
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:26,274
Is that...?

287
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:27,734
Dr. Aronson.

288
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:30,570
The new Chastain keeps
incompetent surgeons on staff?

289
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:32,256
We're shorthanded
in neurosurgery.

290
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,908
Top doctors don't like the fixed
salaries of public hospitals.

291
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:37,677
And so, yeah,
Dr. Aronson is filling in.

292
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:40,649
Oh, look
what the cat dragged in.

293
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:44,970
That was some
high-level restraint.

294
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:47,050
Self-help books, meditation,

295
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:49,424
a shrink, anger management,
hypnosis.

296
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,517
If you told me you had
a magic bean, I'd eat it.

297
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:53,277
That said, it's a journey,

298
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:54,751
and I'm nowhere near
the destination.

299
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,604
Billie, stop.

300
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,803
- Oh, God! I just felt the...
- Hey.

301
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:02,668
- Okay, talk to me.
- Oh, my God, I just had this pain.

302
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:05,339
- Where does it hurt?
- What are you doing? She's not supposed to be out of her room.

303
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:07,774
The baby. Something's wrong. I-I
just felt, I felt this pain...

304
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:09,794
Okay, okay, I'm sure
everything's fine, but let's get

305
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:11,445
that pain checked out and we'll

306
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,038
do another ultrasound
just to be okay.

307
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:14,335
Hang on.

308
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:30,221
- That's extra fluid.
- Yes.

309
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:31,750
See, I knew
something felt different.

310
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:33,132
The heart's beating.

311
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:34,835
The baby is alive and moving.

312
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,116
But there's extra fluid
around the heart.

313
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,482
That can have many causes.

314
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:41,240
Some of them benign.

315
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:44,437
Hey.

316
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,805
It's gonna be okay.

317
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,874
We just need
to find out what's going on.

318
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:54,468
Yeah.

319
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,085
I'm gonna go talk to
Nic's OB.

320
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,285
You up to speed?

321
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:01,870
Yes, uh, but before you go,

322
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:04,263
I have some ideas
about what's going on.

323
00:14:05,874 --> 00:14:07,070
Okay.

324
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:09,680
Um, time for some boundaries.

325
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,929
You're not her doctor.

326
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:13,624
And you don't work here anymore.

327
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:15,601
I want to help.

328
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,155
Good.

329
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:19,749
Go talk to Nic.

330
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:21,526
I'll handle the medicine.

331
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:24,184
Two heads are
better than one.

332
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:26,465
I'm gonna say this once.

333
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,582
Don't make
the same mistake again.

334
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:29,590
Just be Nic's friend.

335
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:31,566
And try and keep your ego
out of this.

336
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,251
Okay?

337
00:14:37,104 --> 00:14:38,597
Labs are pristine.

338
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:40,136
Vascular imaging looks good.

339
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:41,902
Our little guy is ready to go.

340
00:14:41,987 --> 00:14:43,411
We just need plastics.

341
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:44,691
I've called
around to every hospital

342
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:45,872
in driving distance.

343
00:14:45,956 --> 00:14:47,207
No one has the skill set

344
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:48,559
for a double hand replacement.

345
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:51,346
I mean, it's
the highest level of surgery.

346
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:53,559
I might have someone.

347
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:58,237
Dr. Jake Wong.

348
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:00,220
My former stepson.

349
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:02,430
I know Jake's in plastics,

350
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:04,542
but has he done
a bilateral transplant?

351
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,268
In Guatemala, four years ago.

352
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:07,730
Four years?

353
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:09,271
I'm sure best practices

354
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:10,897
has changed considerably
since then.

355
00:15:10,981 --> 00:15:12,893
Well, best practices may have
to give way

356
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,879
to best available
on short notice.

357
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:20,035
Your last exchange with him
did not go well.

358
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,432
Yeah, but this,
this isn't personal... it's work.

359
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:24,784
And it's a hell
of an interesting case.

360
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,613
I'm just, I'm-I'm betting
that Jake won't let

361
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:29,440
his resentment of me
stand in the way.

362
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:34,768
Then go, get him to commit.

363
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:37,651
We only have a few hours
before we lose the donor hands.

364
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:39,753
Okay.

365
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:47,886
We've all
left the stove on before.

366
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:49,519
It's the second time this week.

367
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:51,230
Third, but who's counting?

368
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:53,301
I could have burned
the house down.

369
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,293
Age, dear.
We're all in the same boat.

370
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:57,504
No. I'm dangerous.

371
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,129
Has Norman been
seen here before?

372
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:00,926
No. It was a different hospital.

373
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:03,737
But the doctor said
the diagnosis was clear.

374
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,081
Alzheimer's.

375
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:08,581
With this disease, it's the
caregiver that has it the worst.

376
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:10,932
I'm worried about her.

377
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,754
Why don't you just put me

378
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,048
away somewhere?
Don't go through this hell.

379
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:18,354
Hell would be
living without you.

380
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:22,925
- What's this?
- A fall.

381
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,253
Happens a lot. Usually at night.
He gets up in the dark.

382
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,690
Won't stay in bed.

383
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:29,150
Prostate issues.

384
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:30,987
I have to pee all the time.

385
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,109
I'd like to do
a comprehensive physical exam.

386
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:35,409
Balance issues can mean
other problems.

387
00:16:35,676 --> 00:16:38,120
And a lot of these conditions
mimic Alzheimer's.

388
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:46,019
All right, stay here,
you're not going anywhere.

389
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:47,940
I'll be right back, okay?

390
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,229
Look, I'm sorry I didn't come
to the wedding.

391
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,503
I missed having you there.

392
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:57,941
I knew it would be packed
with Chastain people.

393
00:16:58,026 --> 00:16:59,979
Just not the best crowd for me.

394
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:03,308
And given
my history with Conrad,

395
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:05,626
the fact that he basically
can't stand me...

396
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:09,159
...I didn't want to spoil
your perfect day.

397
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:11,573
But it was harder
than you might think.

398
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,700
And I wanted to see you
in your dress.

399
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:17,446
Watch the first dance.

400
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:22,011
I know that this is
your worst nightmare.

401
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,417
You don't want
to be the patient.

402
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,623
You want to take care
of patients.

403
00:17:26,854 --> 00:17:29,300
I mean, what kind of nurse am I
if I can't even save

404
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:30,675
my own baby, right?

405
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:37,214
What is it?

406
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,800
It's just I already
bought a crib.

407
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:46,378
I lose this baby, I...

408
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:49,564
...I can't help but think
that everything's

409
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:51,642
just gonna come crashing down.

410
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,268
No.

411
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:55,995
I'm here to catch you, Nic.

412
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:06,479
See the fluid in the abdomen
and around the heart?

413
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,884
Your baby has severe anemia.

414
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,580
How did we miss this?

415
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:12,025
We couldn't have known.

416
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,962
Nic's prenatal tests were
all normal.

417
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:16,470
But she must have an antibody
that's crossing the placenta

418
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:18,220
and attacking
the baby's red blood cells.

419
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:22,400
Where did it come from?
Where did it come from?

420
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,222
The blood transfusions.

421
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:27,392
She had so many
after the attack.

422
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,665
They must have triggered
the reaction.

423
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:31,920
Conrad, you know
what we have to do next.

424
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:33,330
Another transfusion.

425
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:36,658
Yes. The baby needs an
intrauterine blood transfusion.

426
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,214
Without it,

427
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:39,915
she won't survive.

428
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:41,795
If we do this,

429
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,611
there's a high chance
of miscarriage.

430
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,376
That can't happen.

431
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:50,470
I'm not sure
Nic could take that.

432
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:54,814
No, I'm not sure
I could take that.

433
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:02,337
This is Dr. Wong.

434
00:19:02,422 --> 00:19:03,853
<i>Hey, Jake. It's Randolph.</i>

435
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:05,626
I need your help
as a doctor.

436
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,806
<i>You want a little freshening u?
Neck lift?</i>

437
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,144
<i>Rhinoplasty?
'Cause I don't do that.</i>

438
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:12,900
I do reconstructive,
medically necessary.

439
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,509
There's a boy who needs

440
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:16,798
a bilateral
hand transplant today.

441
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:19,431
<i>And Chastain just lost our best
plastic surgeon. </i>

442
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:22,267
He's the only one in Atlanta who's done
a hand transplant before.

443
00:19:22,514 --> 00:19:24,767
Except... except for you.

444
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:27,619
<i>Without you, the kid is gonna
lose his place in line.</i>

445
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:30,047
And he may wait years
for another set of hands.

446
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:33,040
I'm on my way. I'll text you
when I'm out front.

447
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:47,540
Gentlemen,

448
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:50,312
Governor Randall,
sorry to interrupt

449
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,830
your CEO interviews, but

450
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:54,447
there's a time-sensitive issue.
We have a boy

451
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,176
awaiting a hand transplant
and I need emergency privileges

452
00:19:57,261 --> 00:20:00,180
- for an outside surgeon.
- Surely there's someone already here...

453
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,666
The only doctor qualified
for this rare surgery

454
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,715
quit because we've gone public.

455
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:07,580
Look, Chastain can't take a risk

456
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,315
on an unknown surgeon
for a rare, high-risk surgery.

457
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,642
Well, I can promise
we will fail if we don't try.

458
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:16,142
Don't we have a mandate
to make

459
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:19,290
Chastain a hospital that
goes any distance for patients?

460
00:20:23,246 --> 00:20:25,259
I will sign off
on your new surgeon.

461
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,486
If this goes wrong...

462
00:20:27,656 --> 00:20:29,603
it's on you.

463
00:20:31,508 --> 00:20:35,002
Considering where you sit,
and what you've achieved,

464
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,712
why are no women

465
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:38,939
being interviewed
for the CEO position?

466
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:42,978
Isn't that on you?

467
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:56,767
Hey, where are you two going?
I didn't discharge you.

468
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:58,153
Dr. Feldman did.

469
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:00,392
- He did what?
- Well, you treated the burn

470
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:03,040
and he gave us
some gauze to take home.

471
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,374
Your feet are dragging.

472
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:06,540
So the falls may not just
be because of balance.

473
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,892
Are you having trouble walking?

474
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:09,814
It's old age.
What can you do?

475
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:12,244
It's quite all right, dear.
We don't want to be a bother.

476
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:14,697
And I don't want Norman
to suffer if he doesn't have to.

477
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:16,876
Okay, the symptoms that
I'm seeing make me think this is

478
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:18,762
not Alzheimer's at all.

479
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:22,314
I'd like to do
a spinal tap.

480
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,421
Doc, I just want to go home now.
I'm tired.

481
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:26,890
You don't have to wait
back in line.

482
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:28,150
I'll bring the bed
to you right here.

483
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:29,940
Honey?

484
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:31,300
Give it a chance.

485
00:21:31,705 --> 00:21:33,201
For me?

486
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:36,758
Good.

487
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:38,498
I'll be back.

488
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:43,990
Kit.

489
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,450
Jake.

490
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:48,430
Dr. Wong, thank you for coming.

491
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,288
Thanks for the opportunity.
You, too, 'Dolph.

492
00:21:51,513 --> 00:21:52,601
'Dolph?

493
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,867
The patient will be prepped
and ready in a few hours.

494
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:57,969
We'll maximize time by
dissecting donor

495
00:21:58,155 --> 00:21:59,790
and recipient hands
simultaneously.

496
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,000
Working in tandem
to limit fatigue. Smart.

497
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:05,508
- Tell me about the patient.
- Andy lost his hands

498
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,524
from septic shock as a toddler.

499
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:09,969
Couldn't get comfortable
with prosthetics.

500
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:12,197
Besides, he wants to
feel things again.

501
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:14,289
A pencil, his mother's hand.

502
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:16,445
Especially his new
baseball mitt.

503
00:22:16,553 --> 00:22:19,121
Oh, he's a big fan
of our national pastime?

504
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:21,650
Yeah, even bigger than
you were.

505
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:24,963
Well, in that case,
I just have one question.

506
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:26,820
Where's the gift shop?

507
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:31,160
You know, a new mitt
isn't complete

508
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:32,617
without a new baseball.

509
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:35,023
Does that mean
the surgery is on?

510
00:22:35,108 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes.

511
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:38,354
Dr. Wong has agreed
to be your plastic surgeon.

512
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,340
But are you an all-star doctor?

513
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,677
He is, Andy.

514
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:44,315
Do you play baseball?

515
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,023
I did. T-ball right through
high school.

516
00:22:47,108 --> 00:22:48,922
- Position?
- Center field.

517
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:50,219
Best play?

518
00:22:51,023 --> 00:22:52,490
Seventh grade.

519
00:22:52,797 --> 00:22:55,518
Coach rode me all season about
getting ahead of the curveball.

520
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:58,354
Had me run laps when I didn't.

521
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:01,758
There were a lot of laps.
Lots of arguments.

522
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:03,993
Then, game one
of our World Series,

523
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,986
Coach puts me
in against a pitcher

524
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,258
who threw a curve
like Doc Gooden.

525
00:23:08,404 --> 00:23:09,822
And what happened?

526
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:13,508
I thought Coach did it
to teach me a lesson.

527
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:16,461
But I got ahead of the curve

528
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:18,891
and I won us the game.

529
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:22,602
I realized
he believed in me

530
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:25,195
more than any other kid
on that team.

531
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:28,495
So, how about it, Andy...

532
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,283
Is my résumé good enough
to make your team?

533
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:33,546
It's a late substitution.

534
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,016
But you're hired.

535
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:40,538
A fetal blood transfusion?

536
00:23:40,622 --> 00:23:42,737
It-It's risky,
and it's our only option.

537
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:46,026
- For the baby?
- Yeah, but we have to do it.

538
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,181
The alternative is we lose her.

539
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:51,642
Based on
what Gabbi's told me,

540
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:55,128
I think it's best
we put you under anesthesia.

541
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:57,252
If you're awake,
you'll see it all.

542
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:59,039
And if you flinch,

543
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:00,892
the needle could
hit the umbilical cord.

544
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:03,002
I'm a nurse,
I won't flinch.

545
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:06,087
But what if I wake up
and our baby's gone

546
00:24:06,172 --> 00:24:07,728
and I wasn't there for her?

547
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,008
Okay.

548
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,980
Then stay awake.

549
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:12,834
But there's
no upside to being awake.

550
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:16,002
Not for Nic, not for the baby,
and no reason, medically,

551
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,242
to put her through it.

552
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:19,447
Well, there's one giant reason.

553
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,188
She might want to be awake.

554
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:22,658
Well, thank you
for that, Billie.

555
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:23,994
- Okay, you know what?
- I just...

556
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,888
I can't even hear myself think.
Please.

557
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,212
Nic, we will sort this out
and get back on the same page.

558
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:34,283
Don't stress.
Billie, you got a minute?

559
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,339
<i>Nic was stabbed
two weeks ago, and</i>

560
00:24:40,423 --> 00:24:43,101
you think she needs to watch
a needle penetrate her womb?

561
00:24:43,185 --> 00:24:44,987
- What I think is...
- You're not her doctor,

562
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:46,679
you're not her husband.

563
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,745
This is about you being
important and making the call,

564
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,134
and the call is wrong.
You haven't changed.

565
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,422
- But I...
- No buts.

566
00:24:56,752 --> 00:24:58,548
You need to leave now.

567
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:02,285
This experiment failed.
Go. I'm not asking.

568
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,369
Pravesh.

569
00:25:17,928 --> 00:25:19,361
What is this?

570
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:24,976
He's not taking up a bed.

571
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,103
I applaud the ingenuity, but
you're performing a procedure

572
00:25:27,252 --> 00:25:28,682
on a discharged patient.

573
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:30,838
He might have
normal pressure hydrocephalus.

574
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:32,967
If so, this procedure
can cure him.

575
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:35,135
We can give him his life back.
But I need to complete

576
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:38,013
- this lumbar puncture.
- I get it. No stone unturned.

577
00:25:38,097 --> 00:25:39,848
But you treated his burn.
Now what about

578
00:25:39,932 --> 00:25:41,635
the other patients who are
in the waiting room right now?

579
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,995
What kind of hospital are we
if we can't spare 30 minutes

580
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,188
that might cure a patient
who's been misdiagnosed?

581
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:48,385
Admit him to Medicine
or have him make an appointment.

582
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,150
I won't ignore a patient.

583
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:51,986
That's what happened
to my father.

584
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,455
He looks
like Rain Man in there.

585
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:08,447
Could damage a nerve.
Put my plate sideways.

586
00:26:08,587 --> 00:26:10,930
Nerve.
Put my plate sideways.

587
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:13,766
And extra vein.
Extra vein,

588
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,176
always dissect extra vein.

589
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,937
Oh.

590
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:21,107
He's reciting a litany
of things that could go wrong.

591
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:23,684
So that's his process.

592
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:26,099
- Interesting.
- Mm.

593
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:37,024
We have four hours
to connect these arteries

594
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,879
and get blood flowing
into Andy's new hands.

595
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:42,904
Any longer, and this
beautiful gift will be wasted.

596
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,358
Ready to tag
the median and ulnar.

597
00:26:45,443 --> 00:26:46,966
Raring to go.

598
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,060
I like that. And you're
working at a good pace.

599
00:26:49,144 --> 00:26:51,764
So are you.
Thank you for letting me

600
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:53,490
join you on the dominant hand.

601
00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:01,722
The damn procurement team
did not

602
00:27:01,806 --> 00:27:03,908
cut this one down
to the right length.

603
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:05,835
Good catch.

604
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,269
- It's too long.
- Yeah.

605
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:09,912
In my experience, even
a small length issue matters.

606
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:11,249
These hands will grow with him.

607
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:13,185
I can work fast
to line these up properly.

608
00:27:13,295 --> 00:27:15,694
Do it.
We want this to be perfect.

609
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:19,506
All right. Let's cut these
mittens down to size, shall we?

610
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:32,201
Come in.

611
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:36,833
I'm here because the board
overlooked someone

612
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:39,521
who may be the best choice
for CEO.

613
00:27:41,295 --> 00:27:43,060
Dr. Voss.

614
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:46,069
That's an inspired choice.
It's about time.

615
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:47,780
Better late than never.

616
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,639
After Kit charged into
our meeting, it became clear

617
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:52,561
we don't want
a safe choice for CEO.

618
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:55,210
We want someone bold,
trailblazing.

619
00:27:55,295 --> 00:27:57,326
And Chastain needs
a new leader by end of day.

620
00:27:57,428 --> 00:27:59,249
Well, this operation
is just getting started.

621
00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:01,132
- They'll be here all night.
- I know.

622
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,060
The operation is her interview.

623
00:28:04,764 --> 00:28:07,498
So I will be here watching it
all night as well.

624
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,511
Safe to proceed.

625
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,295
Visualizing the umbilical vein.
I'm going to inject the fetus

626
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:27,599
with a sedative and paralytic.

627
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:33,209
Don't be alarmed when she stops
moving around. That's the goal.

628
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:38,427
Ready to start the transfusion.

629
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:47,655
Damn it.

630
00:28:47,756 --> 00:28:49,421
- What is it?
- The baby's heart's having trouble.

631
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:51,538
The blood might be too much
for the fetal circulation.

632
00:28:51,623 --> 00:28:53,819
Her heart rate's gonna
bounce back. Give it a moment.

633
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:55,522
We can't give the baby
any more blood.

634
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:58,097
Baby's bradying down.

635
00:28:58,181 --> 00:28:59,339
Might be a spasm of the cord.

636
00:28:59,423 --> 00:29:00,466
Let's get her on her left side

637
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,858
to improve uterine perfusion.

638
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:04,219
On my count.
One, two, three.

639
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,252
Need a liter of IV fluid.

640
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,123
Baby's still bradying down.

641
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:21,419
There's your little warrior.

642
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:24,679
Conrad, the baby's
still paralyzed.

643
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,327
We hope the blood
will be enough.

644
00:29:26,412 --> 00:29:28,373
But until the drugs wear off,
we won't know for sure

645
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:31,584
if she's okay
or if Nic's miscarried.

646
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:46,070
No blood.
Crystal-clear fluid.

647
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:47,460
What does that mean?

648
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:48,710
No obvious signs of infection.

649
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:50,374
This is what we call
a champagne tap.

650
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:51,686
When will we know if it worked?

651
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:53,811
Soon. We've taken out
enough spinal fluid

652
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:55,389
to see if he gets better.

653
00:29:55,474 --> 00:29:57,077
Okay, Norman,
you hold still, okay?

654
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,701
I'm gonna pull out this needle.

655
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:02,521
Okay, dear, it's done.

656
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:06,741
Okay.
How do you feel?

657
00:30:06,826 --> 00:30:09,685
Uh... I feel...

658
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:11,569
- okay.
- Yeah?

659
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,826
Why don't you walk for us.

660
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,334
Here.

661
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:25,133
Mrs. Katz, would you
like to go waltzing?

662
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:28,446
Baby steps, dear.

663
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,240
This is incredible.
Thank you.

664
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,468
So, Doc, I-I'm really
gonna be all right again?

665
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:36,874
Uh, what about my head?

666
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,397
All of your symptoms were caused

667
00:30:38,482 --> 00:30:40,428
by an accumulation
of spinal fluid.

668
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:42,655
When I took off enough,
you got better.

669
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,249
Your brain's gonna fully recover

670
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:46,252
and you'll be back
to your old self soon.

671
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:49,201
And you do not have Alzheimer's.

672
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:52,810
Thank you.

673
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,058
My pleasure.

674
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,023
We'll set him up
with neurosurgery

675
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,803
for a permanent shunt.

676
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,818
You were right.
I was wrong. Sue me.

677
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:06,763
No, I was wrong, too.

678
00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:09,415
I thought by working at a
public hospital that I would be

679
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,111
part of the problem, but what
I realize now is that I get to be

680
00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:16,189
part of the solution, and
treat patients who would never

681
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:17,529
have been able
to come to Chastain.

682
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:19,940
And give the kind of care...

683
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:22,170
- that my dad deserved.
- Right.

684
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,881
Insurance won't
cause us problems anymore,

685
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,050
but you know what will?

686
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,349
- An overwhelmed ER.
- Yeah.

687
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:29,061
We have to figure out a system
that helps triage

688
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:31,185
less urgent cases.
That can be done.

689
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,813
It will be done.
But right now,

690
00:31:32,912 --> 00:31:34,365
let's both go see more patients.

691
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,865
Good man.

692
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:53,373
I know you said go,
but I couldn't leave

693
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,537
until I knew
Nic was okay.

694
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:56,183
Nic's fine.
Not awake yet.

695
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:58,231
The baby?

696
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:00,639
We won't know until
the paralytic wears off.

697
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:04,005
This must be awful for you.

698
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:08,428
Look, I was insensitive.

699
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,021
Just not thinking about
the fact that there are

700
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:13,432
two parents involved,
and I'm an outsider.

701
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,959
That was wrong.

702
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,677
I continue to be wrong
about a lot of things,

703
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:20,295
despite my best efforts.

704
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:24,646
I'd like to revisit
what happened between us,

705
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:27,302
put it all out on the table.
I want to know you understand.

706
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:29,262
I think
I understand quite well.

707
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:31,849
Your patient had a meningioma
that had to come out.

708
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,976
At that point, I'd done
about a hundred of those.

709
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,115
Figured, "I'll pop this out,
no problem."

710
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:39,673
I'd started doing surgeries
without my attending present

711
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,685
because Aronson was
a lazy hack with rusty skills.

712
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:44,639
He hid behind his residents.

713
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:46,060
I didn't know that.

714
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:53,328
I cut with impunity,
I felt triumphant,

715
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:55,122
but when I tried
to wake your patient up...

716
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,166
Yeah, massive
left hemisphere stroke.

717
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,060
Because you didn't have
enough experience

718
00:33:02,254 --> 00:33:04,131
to know that
the arteries you cut

719
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,133
weren't feeding
the patient's tumor.

720
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,151
They were feeding
the patient's brain.

721
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:13,686
Now that lovely man
cannot walk,

722
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:16,184
cannot talk,

723
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:18,693
will live the rest of his life
in a nursing home.

724
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:21,779
Yes, I understand
what I did,

725
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,998
and I will never
get over it.

726
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,264
You had to report me.

727
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,685
I've always known that,
but it was easier

728
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,571
to blame you than face the truth
that it was my own fault.

729
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,545
Mm.

730
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,490
Man, that was
really freaking hard.

731
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,459
Anyway, it looks like
you've got this,

732
00:33:49,968 --> 00:33:51,381
so I'll jump.

733
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:54,068
See you in a few years.

734
00:33:54,285 --> 00:33:55,654
Hey.

735
00:33:57,506 --> 00:34:00,725
Say goodbye to Nic
before you leave.

736
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:04,154
She'll be hurt if you leave
without doing that.

737
00:34:13,145 --> 00:34:14,670
Plates and screws are in.

738
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:16,896
Length and
angle are perfect over here.

739
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:19,107
Dr. Wong, you're up.

740
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,287
Microscope.

741
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:35,756
Jeweler's forceps.

742
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,435
Starting arterial anastomosis.

743
00:34:40,826 --> 00:34:43,459
Microneedle holder
and 9.0 nylon.

744
00:34:54,982 --> 00:34:57,521
Dr. Voss is running
a smooth ship.

745
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,265
I wouldn't expect anything less.

746
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:03,124
And the new guy?

747
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,976
Is that your doing?

748
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:07,389
Dr. Wong deserves
all the credit.

749
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:10,631
What you're witnessing
is God-given talent.

750
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:20,209
Both arterial
anastomoses complete.

751
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,412
Complete? That's all you got?

752
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
- Brother, that's beautiful.
- It's the moment of truth,

753
00:35:24,645 --> 00:35:26,045
and you're bogging me down
with compliments?

754
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,482
Well, have it your way, Cochise.

755
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:30,646
No compliments till these
bad boys turn pink. Let's go.

756
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:35,967
All good here.

757
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:37,740
Nice.

758
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,592
No blood flow to the right hand.

759
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:44,069
Give me a Doppler.

760
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,865
It's a clot.

761
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,357
I'll try to milk
it out. Forceps.

762
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:56,046
The hand's too cold.

763
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,482
We need to help it perfuse.

764
00:35:57,567 --> 00:36:00,029
All right, let's
turn this OR into a sweatbox.

765
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,124
- Clot's out.
- Yeah, but the artery is short.

766
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:08,648
We need to connect it.

767
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:09,983
Time is of the essence.

768
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,410
We can't let this hand
die on us.

769
00:36:11,494 --> 00:36:12,599
We need a graft, and I dissected

770
00:36:12,684 --> 00:36:14,185
extra pieces of vein.

771
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:17,803
Of course. In his premortem.

772
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:22,834
I'll take the proximal end.

773
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,820
- You help out on the other side.
- Yeah. Got it.

774
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:26,482
We're running out of time.

775
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,717
Fine work, Dr. Austin.

776
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:37,862
See there,
compliments don't bog me down.

777
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:39,670
All set.

778
00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:41,948
All right, let's go.

779
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:48,692
Look at that.

780
00:36:48,777 --> 00:36:51,213
A boy's dream
finally becomes reality.

781
00:36:52,965 --> 00:36:54,633
I love this game.

782
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,201
She's not out of the woods yet.

783
00:37:02,357 --> 00:37:04,746
We won't know until
the paralytic wears off,

784
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,306
which should be soon.

785
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,135
I don't feel so good.

786
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:18,428
- She's tachy to the 140s.
- She's cold and clammy.

787
00:37:18,513 --> 00:37:20,155
Heart rate's in the 180s.

788
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,722
SVT. She needs meds
and a code cart.

789
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:23,982
- I'll get it.
- I know where it is.

790
00:37:24,066 --> 00:37:25,767
I'll be back in 30 seconds.

791
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:27,394
The baby can't handle this.

792
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,745
I need a 10cc syringe.

793
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:32,379
Here.

794
00:37:34,243 --> 00:37:35,944
Blow into this.

795
00:37:36,028 --> 00:37:37,946
Hard. Try to move the plunger.

796
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:41,906
Harder.

797
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,101
Normal sinus rhythm.
Thank you.

798
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:53,315
There are a lot of ways
to break an arrhythmia.

799
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,073
My favorite doesn't involve
an ice bucket bath

800
00:37:55,158 --> 00:37:56,635
that leaves the patient
wet and cold.

801
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,775
Okay, guys, that's great,

802
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,426
but can we figure out
what caused this?

803
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,136
Hey, Billie, let's put
our heads together,

804
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,278
shall we?

805
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,440
Yes, she went into an SVT.

806
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:14,088
Lots of things can cause that.

807
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:16,109
Anxiety, electrolytes, hormones.

808
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,400
Or thyroid.

809
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:19,198
But her thyroid function
was low.

810
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:21,526
It was, and we've been
giving her thyroid hormone.

811
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:24,572
And as her thyroid function
changes during pregnancy...

812
00:38:24,775 --> 00:38:26,415
Now it must be too high.

813
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:27,799
I'll send off
thyroid function tests,

814
00:38:27,884 --> 00:38:28,955
and we'll hold her next dose.

815
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,244
Sounds like a plan.

816
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:31,717
And now it's up to
our baby girl.

817
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:33,960
She's a fighter.
She'll rally.

818
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,611
They are beautiful, honey.

819
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,002
But will they work?

820
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,822
It'll take some time
before you feel much sensation,

821
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:05,049
but you might be able
to move a finger.

822
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:19,962
It's only a matter of time

823
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:22,166
till you're on the field
shagging flies.

824
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:23,981
Thank you.

825
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:37,104
Wasn't
exactly smooth sailing today,

826
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:38,595
but you made it happen.

827
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,501
With the help
of amazing surgeons.

828
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:42,729
Right, but you, Dr. Voss,

829
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:45,502
you took this on your
shoulders... at high risk...

830
00:39:45,587 --> 00:39:47,588
And gave a child back his life.

831
00:39:47,673 --> 00:39:50,283
I saw leadership
and calm under pressure.

832
00:39:50,376 --> 00:39:52,361
Qualities we need at Chastain.

833
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:57,212
The CEO job is yours
if you want it.

834
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:02,712
You're damn right I do.

835
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,461
I think I felt her kick.

836
00:40:16,009 --> 00:40:17,322
Conrad.

837
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,618
Thank you very much.

838
00:40:21,072 --> 00:40:22,377
What's going on?

839
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,790
I think I felt her kick.

840
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:29,171
No, you do it.

841
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:52,194
She's moving.

842
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:56,473
There's less fluid.

843
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:00,702
It worked.

844
00:41:11,712 --> 00:41:13,505
<i>Thank you so much for</i>

845
00:41:13,624 --> 00:41:15,202
bringing me in on this.

846
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:16,726
You did fantastic work.

847
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:19,702
It was a highlight
watching you today, Jake.

848
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:21,913
You're an artist.

849
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:26,982
How would you like to leave
rhinoplasty behind forever?

850
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,874
Chastain wants you here
permanently.

851
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:34,179
So, what do you say?

852
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:40,088
I'll be looking forward

853
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:41,577
to working with you again,
Dr. Voss.

854
00:41:45,014 --> 00:41:47,672
So, what does this mean

855
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:51,366
for, you know, our relationship?

856
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:53,607
That's up to you.

857
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,641
You take the lead.
I'll just be happy

858
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:58,757
to have the best
plastics man in Atlanta.

Just wasn't long enough.

00:42:44,804 --> 00:42:46,488
I love you, too.

876
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:49,432
And I love you...

877
00:42:50,933 --> 00:42:52,090
Tonya.

878
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:54,222
Tonya?
That's a nonstarter.

879
00:42:54,316 --> 00:42:55,239
No way.

880
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,028
And I love you, Posie.

881
00:42:58,113 --> 00:43:00,583
Posie? Not a chance.

882
00:43:04,406 --> 00:43:06,750
Seriously.

883
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:09,137
Zero percent chance.
