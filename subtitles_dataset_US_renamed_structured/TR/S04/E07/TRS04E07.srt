Dr. Voss, the CEO job

8
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:22,698
- is yours if you want it.
- You're damn right I do.

9
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:25,104
No one has the skill set
for a double hand replacement.

10
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:26,948
I might have someone.

11
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:28,533
Dr. Jake Wong,

12
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:29,869
<i>my former stepson.</i>

13
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:32,392
Chastain wants you here
permanently.

14
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:34,002
What do you say?

15
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:35,244
I'll be looking forward

16
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:36,768
to working with you again,
Dr. Voss.

17
00:00:36,882 --> 00:00:38,738
My O-1 visa is expiring,

18
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:40,808
and so I applied way in advance.

19
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:42,577
Yesterday, I found out
it was denied.

20
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:45,070
Cain may be down,
but he's definitely not out.

21
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:47,230
<i>Can't stay here.
Where is he being taken?</i>

22
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:49,316
<i>There's only one option.</i>

23
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:55,024
Hey, you're up.

24
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:56,151
Shh.

25
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,979
You hear that?

26
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:01,674
I don't hear anything.

27
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:03,849
Exactly.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,323
Silence.

29
00:01:05,502 --> 00:01:07,927
Once our baby comes,
you can kiss that goodbye.

30
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:10,112
I think we can handle
whatever she throws at us.

31
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:12,104
Yeah, sure.
But you know...

32
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,019
feedings, crying, diapers...

33
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:14,759
That's just the beginning.

34
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:16,808
- I did two rotations in Peds.
- Oh,

35
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:18,565
did you have to
deal with nightmares?

36
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,558
"Oh, Mom, Dad, can I come sleep
in the bed with you?"

37
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:22,989
Then, suddenly, she's a teenager
and she's out

38
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:23,940
with her friends
till 1:00 in the morning

39
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:24,744
and you can't sleep

40
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:26,456
because your heart's pounding
so hard.

41
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:27,908
I didn't think about that.

42
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:29,124
All I'm saying is let's just

43
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,533
enjoy the peace
while it lasts.

44
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:32,440
Technically, you are
a recovering patient.

45
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:34,369
Maybe I should stay home
with you today.

46
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:38,617
Mm...

47
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,179
Go.

48
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:46,244
Mwah.

49
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:52,622
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hawkins.

50
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:54,159
Man, I'm glad you picked up.

51
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:56,466
Hey, Captain, we still
on for drinks on Friday?

52
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:57,705
<i>Well, that depends.</i>

53
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,214
<i>You still work with
Search and Rescue, right?</i>

54
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:00,738
Yeah. What's wrong?

55
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:03,127
Decided to do
some free-climbing.

56
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:05,135
Let's just say
it didn't go my way.

57
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,290
Okay, what are we looking at
in terms of injuries?

58
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:11,659
Remember the shrapnel injury
that Rodriguez took

59
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:12,792
during the live...

60
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:14,471
<i>live fire exercise?</i>

61
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:16,313
- That bad?
<i>- It's worse.</i>

62
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:19,165
<i>I figured that you could, uh,
get SAR moving</i>

63
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:21,205
<i>'cause you know 'em personally.</i>

64
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,254
Well, I called
Search and Rescue.

65
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:27,599
They're trying to track his cell
signal before his battery dies.

66
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:29,168
Helped him stem the bleeding,
but it sounds like

67
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:30,585
- he's gonna need an OR.
- And who is this guy?

68
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:31,682
This is Captain Hill,

69
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,207
my commanding officer
in Afghanistan.

70
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:35,226
Of all of the stories
you've ever told me,

71
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:36,933
you never mentioned a Hill.

72
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,043
I know. I haven't spoken to him

73
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:39,582
in years.
A few weeks ago, he calls me,

74
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,511
says he wants to talk.

75
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:41,531
What aren't you telling me?

76
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:42,757
I promise
I'll tell you more later.

77
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,292
Just trust me, please?

78
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:45,494
Okay.

79
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,865
I love you.

80
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:05,747
He's in respiratory distress!

81
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:10,229
All right,
this may be uncomfortable.

82
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,432
Let me breathe!

83
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,369
He's-he's breathing.

86
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:45,694
Hill's cell signal puts him
within 100 meters

87
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:46,962
from this point here.

88
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,348
It's hilly terrain,
so we split up,

89
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,350
each cover a different sector.

90
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:54,948
Get Hill out
before the storm hits.

91
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,593
Next few hours are critical.

92
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:18,479
Hey. Here you go.

93
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:20,937
Four shots, extra dry cap.

94
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:22,217
No sweetener.

95
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,479
Not the reaction
I was expecting.

96
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:28,004
Because you're still thinking
about your immigration status.

97
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,471
My lawyer hasn't called yet.

98
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:32,831
She will. All right?
Just... just be patient.

99
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,875
Patience is for
kindergarten teachers.

100
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,300
They already denied
my visa renewal,

101
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:39,863
so this self-petition
is my last shot.

102
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:41,484
You know,
if only there were a...

103
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:44,847
a once-in-a-lifetime surgery
happening today

104
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:46,448
to take your mind off things.

105
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:49,152
Maybe something like,
I don't know...

106
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:51,566
a quadruple heart valve
replacement?

107
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:54,527
- Mm.
- One only done by 20 surgeons

108
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:56,806
in the entire world and now us.

109
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:59,971
I have been dreaming of those
40 sutures for weeks.

110
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:01,533
Oh, I know.

111
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:03,979
Last night you muttered
the valves in your sleep:

112
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:06,493
Aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid...

113
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:08,519
I did not.

114
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:11,729
- Did I?
- Hmm.

115
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:16,073
Ms. Williams, I'm Dr. Pravesh.

116
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,370
I see that you're experiencing

117
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:19,414
- some hip pain from sickle cell.
- Like I told your nurse,

118
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:21,683
I need Dilaudid.
Two milligrams IV.

119
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:22,903
It's the only thing that helps.

120
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:23,948
I see that you've been

121
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,113
to five different ERs
in the past few months.

122
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:27,385
IV opiates each time.

123
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,637
I'm not drug seeking.

124
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:32,777
Do you know what
a sickle cell crisis is, Doctor?

125
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:34,847
Your red blood cells
become misshapen,

126
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:36,549
like a sickle, not a sphere,

127
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:39,136
and it blocks blood flow
to your organs and bones.

128
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,350
Yes, you know the science.

129
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,276
But do you know
how it feels?

130
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,744
Sharp, stabbing pain in my back,

131
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:47,777
my shoulders,
even my cheekbones.

132
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:49,559
And when they come on,
they're more excruciating

133
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:51,112
than you can understand.

134
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:53,103
Ms. Williams,
that is not why I'm not...

135
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,416
I don't want to be here.

136
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,268
And if you're not going
to help me, then...

137
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:59,276
maybe I should leave. Ah...

138
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,323
Did that little movement
hurt you?

139
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,315
Tell me more about your pain.

140
00:06:10,948 --> 00:06:12,722
My hip feels like it's on fire,

141
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,066
even when I'm still.

142
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,777
It's not like
my usual crisis pain.

143
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:18,463
And when I move...

144
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,916
it tears through me,

145
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,908
like shards of glass
in my veins.

146
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:28,338
Here.

147
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:31,048
Stop.

148
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,464
Stop, stop, stop.

149
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:34,754
Okay. Tell you what.

150
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:37,721
I will give you
what you need...

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,426
if you let me take
an X-ray of that hip.

152
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:41,813
And figure out what's going on.

153
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:43,104
Deal?

154
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:52,788
Captain Hill!

155
00:06:57,404 --> 00:06:59,571
Captain Hill!

156
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,657
Found him.

157
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:11,208
We're a hundred meters northwest
of Many Point Creek.

158
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:12,726
<i>Roger that.</i>

159
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:18,531
Hang in there, Captain.

160
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:20,604
Let's have a look, shall we?

161
00:07:26,117 --> 00:07:28,308
Ah, deep gash
through the abdomen.

162
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:30,674
Looks like it's gone
through the peritoneum.

163
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,096
How far out are you?

164
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:38,910
<i>Ten mikes.</i>

165
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:43,248
That's not soon enough, is it?

166
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:46,185
You're bleeding internally,

167
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,505
into your abdomen
and likely into your chest.

168
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:53,650
I'm gonna die out here.

169
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:55,502
Well, not on my watch, Cap.

170
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:57,791
We need to buy you
some more time.

171
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:05,799
No idea what
you're making there,

172
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,667
but am I correct in guessing

173
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:09,274
- that it's really gonna hurt?
- Yeah,

174
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,109
afraid so.

175
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,447
This is an old trick
I learned back in training.

176
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:17,760
- You can handle it.
- Yeah.

177
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:20,065
I'll make a slight incision.

178
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:26,850
All right. You ready?

179
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:28,193
Do your worst.

180
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:30,987
Here we go. One, two, three.

181
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,315
That's better.

182
00:08:48,482 --> 00:08:50,237
Hey, everything all right?

183
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,207
Found him. We're going to
airlift back to Chastain.

184
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,574
Okay, I'll meet you there.

185
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,229
Page Austin for me.

186
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,979
I want him to meet us in the ER.

187
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,901
Keep pushing.
As hard as you can.

188
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:08,846
Well, Barrett,

189
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,477
you're doing quite well
for someone

190
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:12,675
who just came off the vent
this morning.

191
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:18,503
What about
the damage in surgery?

192
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:22,394
The medial cord
was completely severed.

193
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,440
Partial laceration
of the lateral.

194
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:26,511
Both primarily repaired.

195
00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:28,563
I'm sorry,

196
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,631
but the chances of you regaining
full function of your hand

197
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:33,183
are 50% at best.

198
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,965
Will I ever operate again?

199
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,488
I expect your strength
and mobility to return,

200
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:45,778
but it will take weeks,
maybe months of PT

201
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:48,496
before you can even think
about operating again.

202
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:50,480
It will be painful
and strenuous.

203
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:51,715
I can deal with the pain.

204
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,051
More than pain tolerance,

205
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:56,511
what this process requires
is patience.

206
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,705
We're done here.

207
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,513
I should get back to Chastain.

208
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:04,878
Tell the new CEO
I want to talk to him.

209
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:10,479
You just did.

210
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,306
So, I overheard
some nurses saying

211
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,214
you stole the show
at Waylan's last night.

212
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:35,393
It was an ambush.

213
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:38,081
They didn't tell me
it was karaoke night

214
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,956
and I ended up singing
"I Want It That Way"

215
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:43,792
with half of Radiology.

216
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:46,540
Well, I'm glad to see
you're making friends.

217
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,477
Thank you, but it's not like

218
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:51,011
I'm 12 years old,

for a ten-hour
valve replacement.

234
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:33,345
Ready for bypass.

So every time you have a crisis,
the sickled blood cells

238
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:45,074
block blood flow
to the hip bone right here.

239
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:47,276
Over time,
that bone starts to die.

240
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:50,529
We call it avascular necrosis.
It's why you're in so much pain.

241
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:52,439
Okay, so we treat the pain,

242
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,533
get me back on my feet,
I go back to PT.

243
00:11:54,702 --> 00:11:57,160
Well, I'm afraid pain management
and PT aren't gonna cut it,

244
00:11:57,245 --> 00:11:58,464
and that's why
I brought in Dr. Voss

245
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:00,140
- to see you.
- I'm sorry, Rose,

246
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:02,050
but you're gonna need
a hip replacement.

247
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,483
Sorry, I have to get this.

248
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:08,522
Let me know what you decide.

249
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:14,831
I'm not doing the surgery.
The risks are too high.

250
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,009
I know it's scary,
but a hip replacement

251
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:20,471
- is your best option, Rose.
- Doctors never get it.

252
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:22,405
You're the ones
with the medical degrees,

253
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:24,563
but I have to school you
on my disease.

254
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,325
- It's exhausting.
- I know from personal experience

255
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,410
that many patients of color
aren't heard.

256
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:32,174
Chastain is different.
I'm different.

257
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,690
Help me understand.

258
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:37,693
Surgery for sickle cell patients
is even riskier.

259
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,900
You could fix my hip
but leave me with other issues.

260
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,239
Tell me I won't have
an anemia crisis

261
00:12:43,324 --> 00:12:45,979
or a cardiac crisis or worse.

262
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:49,804
I can't imagine the pain
you've endured, and I understand

263
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:52,301
why you are reluctant
to think more time in a hospital

264
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:54,910
- would help you. I get it.
- It's more than just that.

265
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:57,815
It's about how I want
to live my life.

266
00:12:58,092 --> 00:12:59,682
I'm a dancer.

267
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:02,690
Was a dancer.

268
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:06,659
When the pain got to be so bad
that I had to stop,

269
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,003
I put all of my savings
into a studio.

270
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:12,529
Now I teach dance
to high-risk kids.

271
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:16,370
Tonight they have a recital
to showcase all their hard work.

272
00:13:17,618 --> 00:13:20,854
Those girls, they're my life.

273
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:23,104
And I want to be there tonight.

274
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:27,543
I'd rather limp and be alive
than die sooner

275
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:29,417
because of a surgery.

276
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:32,495
Your hip is about shot.

277
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:36,879
I want to do it today because
it's best that we take advantage

278
00:13:36,964 --> 00:13:39,288
of this window
while you're relatively well.

279
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:41,862
Because during
a sickle cell crisis,

280
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,659
there would be such
a high possibility

281
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:45,488
of a fatal blood vessel blockage

282
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:48,800
that a surgery would be
even more dangerous.

283
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:52,440
So, Rose, let me help you.

284
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:55,137
We will do everything we can
to keep you safe.

285
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,777
That's a promise.

286
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:04,159
All right,
first suture's in place.

287
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,495
Threading
through the suture ring.

288
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:09,824
Slight drop in pressure.

289
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:11,572
- Blood volume decreasing.
- Keep transfusing.

290
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:13,339
Some blood loss is not atypical.

291
00:14:13,491 --> 00:14:14,742
The call was for Dr. Austin.

292
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:17,009
Incoming abdominal trauma
with hemothorax.

293
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:19,011
Dr. Hawkins is requesting
you personally.

294
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:20,438
Conrad seldom does this.

295
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,064
Whoever the patient is
must be special.

296
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:24,073
Which is why I have to go.

297
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:26,566
But we're fine here.
I'll step out for a minute,

298
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,925
take care of this trauma
and be back the moment I'm done.

299
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:30,848
Anything goes wrong,
they'll blame the attending.

300
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:33,440
Mina, you got this.

301
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:38,792
38-year-old male
with penetrating injuries

302
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,199
to the chest and abdomen.

303
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:41,183
Initially hypotensive.

304
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:43,710
O2 sat falling despite
chest tube placed in the field.

305
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:46,435
It's been a long time since
I felt pain like that.

306
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,998
You're talking,
so airway's intact.

307
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,659
We need to get
two units of O-neg running.

308
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:51,169
We need a portable
chest X-ray ASAP!

309
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:54,072
On my count. One, two, three.

310
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:58,802
- Hemothorax?
- Drained about 750cc's in the left chest.

311
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:00,486
It was likely a rupture
to his diaphragm.

312
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:02,886
- Oh...
- That's more blood than we'd like.

313
00:15:03,055 --> 00:15:04,596
I need to get him to the OR.

314
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,832
His vitals are stable.
Stop by CT first?

315
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,714
Yeah. We'll get X-ray
then we'll pack him.

316
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:14,325
- I'll let OR know we're coming.
- Thank you.

317
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,833
- Hey. You made it.
- Hey.

318
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:24,743
What's going on?

319
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:28,147
Uh, he's stable at the moment.

320
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:30,834
I'm just waiting
on the chest X-ray.

321
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:32,003
Okay.

322
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:33,939
I want to see
the tube placement.

323
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:43,683
- This can't be right.
- Apart from the chest tube

324
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:45,893
and a few broken ribs,
looks clear to me.

325
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:55,229
Hey. Talk to me. What's wrong?

326
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,456
Nate's chest,
it shouldn't be clear.

327
00:15:58,573 --> 00:15:59,696
- Why?
- There should be

328
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,931
a bullet
next to his spine and...

329
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:03,082
there isn't.

330
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,379
Okay, so, the bullet
that you're talking about,

331
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,704
you think it migrated
to another place in his body?

332
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:09,621
Yeah, and I need
to help them find it

333
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:11,382
'cause Nate got shot
saving my life.

334
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,690
Nate and I were
approaching a target

335
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:21,257
in the Sangin Valley.

336
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,386
We got ambushed.

337
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,624
Take cover!

338
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:32,731
They got us surrounded!

339
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,491
Nate ordered us to pull back.

340
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:39,948
Flank up!

341
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,020
<i>But...</i>

342
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,457
<i>I thought one of our Marines
who got shot up</i>

343
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:48,568
<i>on the road ahead
was still alive, so...</i>

344
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:51,404
Hawkins, stay put!
That's an order!

345
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:53,971
Fall back! Fall back!

346
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,354
<i>I made my way up the road,
I get there,</i>

347
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:59,532
<i>and...
he's dead.</i>

348
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:03,011
<i>I start to head back,
to regroup with my company.</i>

349
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:15,839
<i>But I get blindsided by an RPG.</i>

350
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:22,027
<i>I had a dislocated shoulder,
broken knee,</i>

351
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,347
<i>shrapnel in my neck.</i>

352
00:17:24,432 --> 00:17:25,966
<i>Figured this was it.</i>

353
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:28,700
<i>And then Nate showed up.</i>

354
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,456
<i>Saved my life.</i>

355
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,140
<i>That's when he, that's when he
caught three in his chest.</i>

356
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:49,542
<i>But he kept going,
made sure we both got to cover.</i>

357
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,458
Doctors got two
of the bullets out,

358
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:55,783
but the third was lodged
near his spine

359
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,498
and it was too dangerous
to remove.

360
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,886
It wasn't giving him any
trouble, so they left it there.

361
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:05,246
And now it's gone.

362
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:11,589
I can't believe you kept this
to yourself all these years.

363
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:15,080
It wasn't my proudest moment.

364
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:19,009
I disobeyed an order
and it nearly cost my commander

365
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:20,928
and friend his life.

366
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:24,198
I was...

367
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:27,979
ashamed.

368
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,018
You were just doing your job,

369
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:35,979
and so was Nate
when he came back for you.

370
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:45,596
When I was a kid, my mom
used to make me practice needlepoint.

371
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:47,722
And I would get so annoyed
and I would tell her

372
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:50,357
that nobody uses that skill
in the real world.

373
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,144
I'm gonna call her tonight

374
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:53,996
and I'm gonna beg
for her forgiveness.

375
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:57,047
Well, this is needlepoint
times a thousand.

376
00:18:57,274 --> 00:19:00,495
If all 40 sutures
aren't perfectly placed,

377
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:01,949
the valve won't fit

378
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,586
or the heart muscle will rip,
and we start over.

379
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:07,039
Okay.

380
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:08,864
<i>♪ 'Cause I was dyin' ♪</i>

381
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:11,557
<i>♪ For this love, this love ♪</i>

382
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:16,698
<i>♪ Yeah, I was dyin' for
your love, your love... ♪</i>

383
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:19,659
Ah. Perfect fit.

384
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:22,105
Now, by the time I'm ready
to insert the next valve,

385
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:24,370
Austin should be here.

386
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:26,465
Actually, he won't.

387
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,151
That was Dr. Austin
on the phone.

388
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:29,846
He took care
of Dr. Hawkins' patient,

389
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:32,462
but an aortic rupture
just came in.

390
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,382
He wants me to keep going.

391
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:37,985
- Alone.
- He says to tell you

392
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,839
that you know this heart
just as well,

393
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:41,407
if not better than him.

394
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:42,865
You got this.

395
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:46,189
Then we keep going.

396
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:48,008
Okay.

397
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,159
Suction.

398
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:03,085
What's going on?

399
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,803
Get me a liter of normal saline.

400
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:07,677
Dr. Voss?

401
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:09,812
She's tachycardic,
hypotensive and hypoxic.

402
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:10,899
Could she be bleeding?

403
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,706
She was earlier,
but it was minimal

404
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,261
and I gave her a unit of blood.

405
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,995
Let's get her on 100% FIO2
and start norepinephrine.

406
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,589
Come on, Rose.
Come on, come on, come on.

407
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,809
- Good, good. She's settling out.
- Hopefully long enough

408
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,815
for me to finish and for you
to figure out what's going on.

409
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:38,342
Hey.

410
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:40,539
Your former CO pulled through.

411
00:20:40,624 --> 00:20:42,229
No complications.

412
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:44,465
And the bullet I told you about?

413
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,295
It wasn't in the surgical field.

414
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:48,889
- So, when is the head and neck CT?
- To be determined.

415
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:51,081
There were no symptoms
indicating that the bullet

416
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,362
- is migrating in Nate's body.
- But there is one.

417
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:56,789
I specifically remember
hearing the doctors say

418
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:58,235
there was a bullet
they couldn't remove.

419
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,793
Well, did Nate tell you
the bullet's still there?

420
00:20:59,877 --> 00:21:01,839
No. I haven't spoken to him
in, like, ten years.

421
00:21:01,924 --> 00:21:03,999
I can't justify a CT
on a postop patient

422
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:06,343
just to look for a bullet
that might not be there.

423
00:21:06,592 --> 00:21:08,668
Since when does my word
not carry weight with you?

424
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:10,250
Your word always carries
weight, Hawkins.

425
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:12,042
But the event in question
was a decade ago

426
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:13,559
and the patient is personal.

427
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:16,141
My emotions are in check

428
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:18,001
- and my memory's just fine.
- Hey.

429
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,152
- Austin's just doing his job.
- No.

430
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,673
He's ignoring
important information

431
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,483
that could save
his patient's life.

432
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:25,653
Nate is
unconscious, it's my call.

433
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:27,215
We will wait
for the medical records

434
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,893
to confirm what you're saying.

435
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:31,027
If he codes while
you're dotting your I's

436
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:33,475
and crossing your t's...

437
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:38,690
Look, Nate was badly injured
saving Conrad.

438
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:41,026
- He's carrying a lot of guilt right now.
- I get it.

439
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,839
He gets a pass.

440
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:45,779
Thanks.

441
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,012
I know what you're gonna say.

442
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:56,014
Really? Try me.

443
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,082
That guilt can play
with our mind,

444
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,436
but that's not
what's going on here.

445
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,629
Then why don't you tell me
what is going on?

446
00:22:01,714 --> 00:22:03,530
<i>I was there
when the doctors told Nate</i>

447
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,792
<i>they couldn't remove
the last bullet.</i>

448
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:10,214
<i>I heard them tell
a fifth-generation Marine</i>

449
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:13,331
<i>that his military career
was over.</i>

450
00:22:15,673 --> 00:22:17,753
He had to retire because of me.

451
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:24,961
All right. I'll see you at home.

452
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:26,479
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay?

453
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:39,149
Hi.

454
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:42,577
This, uh, this might...
May seem a little strange. Um...

455
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,542
I'm Randolph Bell.

456
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:46,052
Yeah... I-I know who you are.

457
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:48,001
- Yeah.
- You must be Jake's husband.

458
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,737
- Gregg, yes.
- Yeah.

459
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:52,159
I just wanted
to introduce myself, and, um,

460
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:55,190
you know, if you or Jake need
anything, I'm-I'm here, so...

461
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:59,335
You want advice
on how to open the door

462
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,172
so you can find a way back
into Jake's life.

463
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,839
Yeah, I... You know, I certainly
wouldn't turn it down.

464
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:09,027
But I have to stay out of it.
This is between you and Jake.

465
00:23:09,112 --> 00:23:10,706
Okay, yeah. No, I understand.

466
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,081
It was nice to meet you.

467
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,167
For what it's worth,
I'm rooting for you.

468
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:30,043
How's my new hip?

469
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:33,053
Ceramic on polyethylene
perfection.

470
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:40,185
I traded hip pain
for something else, didn't I?

471
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,482
Your body had
a dangerous reaction

472
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:45,366
to the blood that you received
during surgery.

473
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:48,460
Because of all the transfusions
I've had throughout my life?

474
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,581
You've developed antibodies that
our labs can't easily test for.

475
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,696
When we gave you blood
in the OR,

476
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,377
your body attacked it

477
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,737
and started to break down
your own blood.

478
00:23:57,821 --> 00:23:59,913
You're severely anemic.

479
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,926
We don't have compatible blood
to give you.

480
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:11,484
We're working
with the Red Cross.

481
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:13,402
We'll find blood
your body will accept.

482
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:14,855
And until then?

483
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,656
Your heart is working
very hard to keep up.

484
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:20,066
We're giving you
supplemental oxygen.

485
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:24,229
And if the extra oxygen
isn't enough,

486
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:29,943
my organs will fail
and I'll die, right?

487
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:39,787
Please leave.

488
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:02,269
Glad you're feeling better,
but your career is still

489
00:25:02,354 --> 00:25:03,144
in jeopardy.

490
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:06,253
As your lawyer,
I have to reiterate that

491
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:09,160
even if you manage
to recover physically,

492
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:10,986
you falsified a patient's file.

493
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:12,665
That's a criminal offense.

494
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,471
You could lose everything.

495
00:25:15,854 --> 00:25:18,589
Because someone at Chastain
told Mullins I lied to him

496
00:25:18,815 --> 00:25:21,814
to get him to the OR,
putting him at risk for COVID.

497
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:25,191
Exactly. And now that
whistleblower's gonna testify

498
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:26,835
against you at trial.

499
00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:29,212
Find out who they are.

500
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,331
I want to know
everything about them.

501
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:37,801
Hey. Just to be clear,
blindsiding my husband?

502
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:39,440
Totally out of line.

503
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:42,269
Well, that... look, that was,
that was never my intention.

504
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:43,845
- I just wanted him to feel welcome.
- Oh, my God.

505
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:46,188
Do you remember when you said
if I came to Chastain,

506
00:25:46,357 --> 00:25:47,867
it'd be up to me
if we had a relationship?

507
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:49,692
You told me you'd follow
my lead.

508
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,860
- You said that.
- Y-Yeah.

509
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:53,371
Of course. I ju... I'm...

510
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:54,697
Look, I'm here if you need me.

511
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:56,729
Oh, please. This isn't about me,
it's about you.

512
00:25:56,814 --> 00:25:58,613
It's always about you.

513
00:25:58,698 --> 00:26:00,379
I guess I was hoping
we could turn the page.

514
00:26:00,463 --> 00:26:02,463
The last thing I want to do
is drive you away.

515
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:05,276
But I... y-yeah.

516
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:07,995
I overstepped, and I'm sorry.

517
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:11,305
Okay, um...

518
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,143
I have a family.

519
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:15,077
And you are not in it.

520
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:21,307
Yeah, okay.

521
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:38,974
- That's your contract.
- I know.

522
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,505
- It's unsigned.
- I know that, too.

523
00:26:44,674 --> 00:26:48,175
- Well, do you need a pen?
- No, I need a do-over.

524
00:26:48,344 --> 00:26:50,085
It was a mistake
to take this job.

525
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:53,113
I can't work under
the same roof as Bell.

526
00:26:53,198 --> 00:26:55,424
- Can I ask why?
- He's trying to erase the past

527
00:26:55,576 --> 00:26:57,653
and I won't let him, and now
he's basically stalking me.

528
00:26:57,737 --> 00:26:59,012
You may not know this,

529
00:26:59,096 --> 00:27:00,894
but Randolph
used to have my job.

530
00:27:01,174 --> 00:27:02,493
How did he lose it?

531
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:04,988
Did his boss figure out
what a colossal jerk he is?

532
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:06,085
Quite the opposite.

533
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:08,242
They asked him
to turn on a fellow doctor.

534
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:10,441
He refused
and resigned on his own.

535
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,620
Randolph stood up for a good man
because he is also a good man.

536
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:17,303
And now I'm standing up for him.

537
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:19,866
I don't know what happened
between you

538
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,862
but I do know people can change.

539
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:26,298
Maybe you should give him
a second chance.

540
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:29,550
Who knows, it could be
the right thing for both of you.

541
00:27:31,073 --> 00:27:33,932
At least share
your reservations with him.

542
00:27:34,782 --> 00:27:37,016
He might surprise you.

543
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:45,284
Great. Thank you.

544
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:48,465
The Red Cross has
a blood match for Rose.

545
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,393
They're gonna put a rush on it.

546
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:52,276
You know that's good news,
right?

547
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:54,144
It wouldn't be necessary

548
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:55,762
if I hadn't pushed her
to do the surgery.

549
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:58,654
No. Hey, Pravesh,
this isn't your fault.

550
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:00,362
She didn't want the surgery.

551
00:28:00,447 --> 00:28:02,255
Okay? She knew there would be
an unexpected complication

552
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:03,597
and now it's happening.

553
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,961
Dude, if she doesn't make it...

554
00:28:08,907 --> 00:28:10,574
It's Rose. She's unstable.

555
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:12,012
I'll run the blood up
when it arrives. Hey.

556
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:14,002
You listened to her
and took her seriously.

557
00:28:14,155 --> 00:28:15,824
Another doctor might not have.

558
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:18,628
Whatever happens,
you did right by Rose.

559
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:25,589
Unstable tachycardia.

560
00:28:25,714 --> 00:28:27,052
I need an amio 150
and a code cart.

561
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:28,694
- I don't feel right.
- Your heart is working overtime

562
00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:31,620
to bring blood to your body,
and it's working too fast.

563
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,949
Hang on, Rose.

564
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,426
Your blood just got to Chastain.
It's on the way up.

565
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,581
My chest. Help me.

566
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,350
Hold on, hold on.

567
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:56,503
I need to cardiovert.

568
00:28:56,594 --> 00:28:57,685
120 joules.

569
00:28:57,891 --> 00:29:00,725
Rose, this is gonna hurt.

570
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,810
Clear.

571
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,588
I'm so sorry, Rose.

572
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:15,731
Your heart rate's rising.

573
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:20,050
- I might need to shock again.
- No. No, not again.

574
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,970
- Please.
- There may not be enough time.

575
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:23,055
Here it is.

576
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:25,776
- Lifesaver. I'll hang it.
- It's the closest match

577
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:27,972
they could find,
but, Devon, it isn't perfect.

578
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,812
- She could hemolyze this, too?
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:29:30,076 --> 00:29:31,559
I'll take the risk.

580
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,195
Hey.

581
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:58,848
Hey, Captain.

582
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:01,315
Surgery went well.

583
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,864
Though hold off
on hiking for a while?

584
00:30:03,948 --> 00:30:06,698
Yeah, I can do that.

585
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:10,455
I have to ask you,
that bullet in your chest,

586
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:13,054
did they ever get it out?

587
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:17,275
No. They never did.

588
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:19,558
I'm gonna call Dr. Austin.
I'll be right back.

589
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:22,848
Nic, can you fill him in?

590
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,644
We think the
bullet may have migrated

591
00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:27,561
to another part of your body.

592
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:31,659
- Well, that doesn't sound great.
- Don't worry.

593
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:34,818
We're all over your case
and we'll find it.

594
00:30:38,142 --> 00:30:40,314
Look, I know what you did
for Conrad.

595
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:43,527
It's a debt he'll never
be able to repay,

596
00:30:43,637 --> 00:30:45,299
but I know he's trying.

597
00:30:48,635 --> 00:30:50,908
You know, I have some regrets...

598
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:53,768
...about the way
I've treated Conrad.

599
00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:00,650
He's reached out to me, uh,
over the years, but, uh,

600
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:04,439
I've just been like a blockade,
you know?

601
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:10,135
Feel... feel real bad about it.

602
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,314
But I think I'm...

603
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:17,174
I think I'm ready
to clear the air now.

604
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:20,963
Sorry, could...

605
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:22,858
could you turn up the lights?

606
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:24,463
It's a little dark...

607
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,288
- Nate, are you feeling okay?
- Uh...

608
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,041
- Little light-headed.
- Hey, can you squeeze

609
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,699
- my hand?
- My face...

610
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:32,853
I can't feel the side
of my face.

611
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:35,111
I got
to call you right back, okay?

612
00:31:35,196 --> 00:31:37,141
He's showing signs of a stroke.

613
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,674
We need to get him to CT.

614
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:47,791
All right.

615
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:50,135
I don't see any foreign bodies
in his neck or brain.

616
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,237
- Just dental cavities.
- Yeah, but-but you see that?

617
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:55,057
The streak artifact
from Nate's dental work

618
00:31:55,142 --> 00:31:57,584
is distorting the images.

619
00:31:58,072 --> 00:31:59,145
Look outside the distorted area.

620
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:00,379
You can barely see it.

621
00:32:00,548 --> 00:32:02,397
There's a sharp outline
of something.

622
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:04,628
It could be the bullet.

623
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:06,118
Could be.

624
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,971
It's at the carotid bifurcation;
Explains the mini-stroke.

625
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:18,339
If it shifts position
even just a few millimeters,

626
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:19,714
it could travel up to his brain.

627
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:23,213
Blocking the blood supply,
giving him a massive stroke.

628
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:26,633
Austin needs to get it out
as soon as possible.

629
00:32:47,102 --> 00:32:49,978
Ooh. Yes.

630
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:58,408
Blood volume
in the circuit is dropping again fast.

631
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,237
There's no
blood loss in the field.

632
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:03,182
And there's
no blood on the floor.

633
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:05,879
He must be bleeding somewhere
we can't see.

634
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:08,878
- Why is he waking up?
- He's been dosed appropriately.

635
00:33:08,962 --> 00:33:11,017
I don't know why
he's not responding to the meds.

636
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:12,646
Blood volume approaching
critical levels.

637
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,517
Brain perfusion is at risk.

638
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:37,743
And what are
we looking for, Dr. Okafor?

639
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:45,134
- You fixed it.
<i>- We</i> fixed it.

640
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:52,119
The blood must be emptying
into the lung cavity.

641
00:33:53,368 --> 00:33:54,729
Need to make an incision

642
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:56,720
into the left pleura.

643
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:06,588
The vena cava has been
punctured by the central line.

644
00:34:06,673 --> 00:34:09,026
Not only has he been bleeding
out into the pleural cavity,

645
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:10,978
but all of
the anesthesia medication

646
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,986
has been
lost there, too.

647
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,362
Okay, on my mark, slowly

648
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:16,588
pull back
your central line catheter.

649
00:34:16,673 --> 00:34:18,431
I need a Prolene suture.

650
00:34:21,974 --> 00:34:23,501
Pull back your central line now.

651
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,205
And stop.

652
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:28,431
Okay. Push meds now.

653
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,439
Volumes are stable.

654
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:55,668
How are you feeling?

655
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:58,495
Well, for a guy who just got
a bullet taken out of his neck,

656
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:00,072
not half bad.

657
00:35:00,157 --> 00:35:02,962
All right, I'll let you rest.
Let's catch up tomorrow.

658
00:35:03,837 --> 00:35:04,837
No.

659
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:07,473
You should sit.

660
00:35:16,564 --> 00:35:19,415
I need this to sink in, okay?

661
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:23,065
I'm good.

662
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:33,072
I asked Dr. Austin
to save it for me.

663
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,603
This thing has been my...

664
00:35:37,431 --> 00:35:39,470
constant companion.

665
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:42,518
But I realized I wasn't
the only one carrying it around

666
00:35:42,603 --> 00:35:43,703
for all these years.

667
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:45,513
That's why I called you.

668
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:47,446
What happened...

669
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:49,665
The choice that I made...

670
00:35:52,353 --> 00:35:54,025
...is what we do for each other.

671
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:56,931
You made the exact same choice.

672
00:35:59,063 --> 00:36:00,072
So...

673
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:02,529
do me a favor.

674
00:36:03,707 --> 00:36:04,958
Throw this away.

675
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:06,700
'Cause when you toss it,

676
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:09,325
I want you to toss away
the guilt,

677
00:36:09,996 --> 00:36:11,676
and the shame

678
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:14,364
and anything else
that you've been holding onto.

679
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,066
Hey, you have got some friends
in high places.

680
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,067
The CEO put in a good word
for you.

681
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:46,223
Okay.

682
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,997
And you deserve
an explanation.

683
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,920
The reason that I can't
give you a second chance

684
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:55,285
is because
my husband and I are...

685
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:57,314
adopting.

686
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,031
Wow. Well...

687
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:06,027
- that's, that's great.
- Yeah.

688
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:09,255
I'm gonna be a parent,
one that will never bail

689
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,023
- the way that you did.
- Jake, I...

690
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:12,178
It...

691
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,503
It's fine.

692
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:15,129
I'm a grown man.

693
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:17,329
But the last thing
I'm gonna let happen

694
00:37:17,414 --> 00:37:20,259
is for you to become
some beloved grandpa,

695
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:22,964
only to pull the same
vanishing act on my kid.

696
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:27,504
Well, I get that.

697
00:37:29,027 --> 00:37:30,860
I really do.

698
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:36,847
But I'm not going anywhere.

699
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:48,839
Thank you, Miguel.
I'm so glad you came.

700
00:37:48,924 --> 00:37:50,372
Let's talk again
next week.

701
00:37:53,012 --> 00:37:55,425
- What's this?
- This is what happens

702
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:57,013
when you listen to the people.

703
00:37:57,098 --> 00:37:58,458
They're ideas from our staff

704
00:37:58,543 --> 00:37:59,824
on how to turn
this place around.

705
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:01,801
For example, we'll be starting

706
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:03,528
an insulin-by-mail service

707
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:05,434
to decrease wait times
at the pharmacy.

708
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,783
I'll be assembling
a task force to address

709
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:09,239
post-surgical admission times,

710
00:38:09,324 --> 00:38:11,287
which are far longer
than average.

711
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:14,169
And most importantly,
tri-tip sandwich day

712
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:15,706
will be more often
than once a month.

713
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,067
Well, sounds like you had
a great day.

714
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:21,045
And do I get the feeling
I'm not the only one?

715
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:24,660
I-I scored a coffee date
with my former stepson.

716
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,191
Here, tomorrow.
And I...

717
00:38:27,276 --> 00:38:29,271
I hear that you might've had
something to do with it.

718
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:30,886
I may have.

719
00:38:33,106 --> 00:38:35,676
Well... thank you.

720
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:37,313
You don't have
to thank me,

721
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:40,160
but you do have to
buy me a drink.

722
00:38:41,626 --> 00:38:44,691
- Oh.
- I'll make it a double.

723
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:49,657
Where did you get this blood
from, the fountain of youth?

724
00:38:49,742 --> 00:38:51,770
I haven't
felt this good in a year.

725
00:38:51,855 --> 00:38:53,894
Yeah, that's
what I like to hear.

726
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:57,144
So... where are we going?

727
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:59,879
Well, Rose, like I told you,

728
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,214
it's a surprise.

729
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:03,411
Mm, I hate surprises.

730
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:05,341
Wasn't that in my patient file?

731
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,345
Well, I think you're
gonna like this one, though.

732
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,594
'Cause I looked you up online,

733
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,254
- I made some phone calls.
- Oh.

734
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,268
And...

735
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:15,566
bam.

736
00:39:22,261 --> 00:39:24,183
No, you didn't.

737
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:34,751
You couldn't make the recital,

738
00:39:34,846 --> 00:39:36,871
so we brought
the recital to you.

739
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:03,314
You don't know
how much this means to me.

740
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:07,562
Thank you.

741
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:29,165
Ah...

742
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:32,946
Basking in
your own surgical glory.

743
00:40:34,588 --> 00:40:36,486
- A little bit.
- I don't think

744
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:38,572
you need to fear
being deported

745
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:40,830
before becoming
a world-class surgeon.

746
00:40:40,915 --> 00:40:43,913
Because today you have proven
that you already are one.

747
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:46,095
Not only does today mark

748
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,666
your accession to the upper
echelon of surgeons,

749
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:53,197
but it also marks
my last day as your mentor.

750
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:56,181
You really think so?

751
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:59,087
Yeah, you don't need a copilot.

752
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,206
You are more than capable
of flying solo.

753
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:04,969
So...

754
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:07,545
tonight I am preparing

755
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,798
a very special dinner,

756
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:13,251
among other things.

757
00:41:13,336 --> 00:41:14,771
Hmm.

758
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,537
Does this meal include...

759
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:19,728
- a chocolate soufflé?
- Mmm.

760
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,018
How'd you guess?

761
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,144
Indeed it does.

762
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:23,543
Okay, okay, okay.

763
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,482
And the other things?

764
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:28,733
Ooh, well...

765
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,181
those you will just
have to wait

766
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,273
and see.

767
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,216
Mm...

768
00:41:42,765 --> 00:41:45,460
How was your talk with Nate?

769
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,959
It was good.

770
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,634
It was really good.

771
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:51,812
I'm glad I got to meet him.

772
00:41:51,897 --> 00:41:53,455
Me, too.

773
00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:01,669
You know, as parents,

774
00:42:01,754 --> 00:42:03,255
we're gonna need
to lean on each other

775
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,770
in all kinds of different ways.

776
00:42:04,895 --> 00:42:06,011
I do.

777
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,396
I wish I would've told you

778
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,028
about what happened
with Nate sooner.

779
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:11,410
I just...

780
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:16,096
I couldn't and I'm sorry.

781
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:17,801
It's okay.

782
00:42:18,509 --> 00:42:19,824
I get it.

783
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:26,793
- You coming up?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
