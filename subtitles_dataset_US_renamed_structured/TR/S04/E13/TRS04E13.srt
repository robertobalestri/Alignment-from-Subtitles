00:00:02,398 --> 00:00:03,836
Look at this one-handed tie.

3
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:06,657
It's sloppy at best,
criminal at worst.

4
00:00:06,742 --> 00:00:08,938
I'm mortal.
You will witness mistakes.

5
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:10,383
I came back to apologize.

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,768
<i>Sammie will require ongoing care</i>

7
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:14,111
<i>with constant follow-ups.</i>

8
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:17,695
I don't know if we're
the best people for her.

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,460
We'll have to relinquish her.

500 million genetically-modified

red blood cells in your body.

12
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:31,832
I believe in you, Rose.

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,304
You're the strongest,
bravest person I know.

14
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:36,403
I'm pregnant.

15
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:39,258
Oh, my God, you are gonna
be the best mother ever.

<i>♪ Tastes like strawberries

17
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:48,898
What time is this big shindig?
Like, 5:00, right?

18
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,901
Yes, but no rush.

19
00:00:50,986 --> 00:00:53,244
Apparently, husbands are not
required at baby showers.

20
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:54,829
Are you kidding me?

21
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:57,578
Wouldn't miss this for the world.

22
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:00,242
I've always wondered what women
talk about at these things.

23
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,218
No, you definitely have not.

24
00:01:02,303 --> 00:01:03,877
Okay, true.

25
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:07,430
Hey, right on time.
Come on in.

26
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:08,758
- Need help?
- Nope.

27
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:11,203
The booze is heavy,
but the cake is light.

28
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,903
Say hi to the folks
at Chastain for me.

29
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,540
Will do.
You take care of Nic for me.

30
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,801
Dude, in a few hours
you'll have a house full

31
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:18,758
of doctors and nurses.
Nic hiccups wrong,

32
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:20,080
and the party will come
to a grinding halt.

33
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,688
That's a good point.
Bye, my love!

34
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:24,000
Bye.

35
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,782
Hello, radiant queen.
How are you feeling today?

36
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:28,487
Radiant.

37
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,649
Been trying to sleep, but I just
can't get comfortable.

38
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,384
Well, how about you stay
off your feet and let me

39
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,719
- handle all the preparations?
- No, let me help.

40
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:37,446
Nic, please.

41
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,131
I carved out the day
to prep your shower.

42
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,399
Allow me this.

43
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:47,982
It'll keep me focused. Okay?

44
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:50,722
Okay. Have at it.

45
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,600
Double espresso, almond milk.

46
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,925
Thank you. Tomorrow's on me.

47
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,760
And Friday will be back to me.

48
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,297
I'm really liking
our prework coffees.

49
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:06,593
Same here. I really am...

50
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,413
What is it?

51
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:17,218
Let's go.

52
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:25,795
That's your sickle cell
clinical trial patient, right?

53
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,422
Yeah. Rose Williams.

54
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:28,679
I haven't seen her in weeks.

55
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:30,820
I guess that means
the gene therapy is working.

56
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:34,374
And now she's with Dr. Cain?

57
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:37,442
Looks that way.

58
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:39,383
Although it's none
of my business.

59
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,551
Wait, were you and Rose...?

60
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:43,125
No. No, not at all.

61
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,952
Well, you can still get
too emotionally involved

62
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:46,218
if you're not careful.

63
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:47,640
It's not like that.

64
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:49,672
I cared about Rose as a patient.

65
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:51,345
And I know Cain,
and I know what he's like.

66
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,980
I just... I don't want her
to make a bad decision.

67
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:19,080
Hey. We're doctors at Chastain.
How can we help?

68
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,833
A lot of smoke inhalation injury
and not enough medics.

69
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,577
Here, take a couple tanks
for those who need it.

70
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,327
Next ambulance
is ten minutes out.

71
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,422
Hey.

72
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:30,275
Look at me. Slow breaths.

73
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:31,435
Get this over your nose.

74
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,695
Hold it on.

75
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,813
Get down. Slow breaths,
slow breaths.

76
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:37,023
My-my son.

77
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,531
He's still inside!

78
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:39,743
Ty!

79
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,256
Ty!

80
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank God
we made it.

81
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:54,441
Ty!

82
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:56,294
There's your mom.

83
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:58,544
Ty!

84
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,471
Mom!

85
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,382
Mom. Mom.

86
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,054
Oh, baby.

87
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:05,598
- What's your name?
- Doug Johnson.

88
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,961
- Is Ty gonna be all right?
- The boy's gonna be okay.

89
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:10,261
- Let's take care of you, all right? Oxygen.
- Okay.

90
00:04:14,347 --> 00:04:17,679
Take a deep breath. Deep breath.

91
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,290
Doug. Doug.

92
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,727
Doug, can you hear me?!

93
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,745
Hey! Doug.

94
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:26,633
Pulse is thready but it's there.

95
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:28,572
Probably smoke inhalation
and whatever he fell through

96
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:30,710
- in there.
- Doug. Come on.

97
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:32,360
Hey! We need that ambulance.

98
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:34,179
Our guy here can't wait
for the next one.

99
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:39,094
Come on, Doug. Hang on.

Your mother's pulmonary function
tests are much improved.

103
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:58,688
This is promising news,

104
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:00,358
considering the initial size
of the lung tumors.

105
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:01,898
And her labs?

106
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:03,103
All normal.

107
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,327
Carol, how are you feeling?

108
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:06,469
Uh...

109
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:07,625
better.

110
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,765
My cough is gone.

111
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:11,543
I've been eating organic
and no processed sugars.

112
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:15,922
And slow yoga has been a
wonderful way to start each day.

113
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:19,551
She wanted to do something
other than... swallow pills.

114
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:22,991
Well, I'm sure everything
you've been doing helped.

115
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,031
But we won't know
if your cancer's responding

116
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:27,305
to the targeted therapy
until we get your PET scan.

117
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,031
- Mm.
- You won't have long to wait.

118
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:31,445
- We'll try to schedule it for later today.
- Mom,

119
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,611
I feel really strongly
about this.

120
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:36,843
I think the targeted therapy's
working.

121
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:39,125
We should have a spot open
by this afternoon.

122
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,192
Why don't you two go home

123
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:43,507
and we'll text you
when we have a time.

124
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:46,289
Hey, they need me in the ER.

125
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:48,008
Go. Go. We'll be fine.

126
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:49,407
All right. Well, don't stress,
Mom, all right?

127
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:51,156
- Okay.
- It's gonna be all right.

128
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,749
It's gonna be all good.

129
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:02,305
What have we got?

130
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:04,453
Sheila in 3C... she has asthma.

131
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:07,344
And Ira in 5C...
He's allergic to penicillin.

132
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:09,781
And Rick in the basement,
he just worries a lot.

133
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,688
Mr. Johnson is
the building's superintendent.

134
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:14,124
So he pretty much knows
everything about everyone.

135
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:17,034
62-year-old male
with no known medical history

136
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:18,129
involved in a fire.

137
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:19,137
Syncopal episode on-site.

138
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:21,715
On my count. One, two, three.

139
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,320
- - He get anything en route?
- Liter of normal saline.

140
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:26,788
Okay, we got
three smoke inhalation patients.

141
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:29,215
One with second-degree burns
and one with a broken arm.

142
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:30,843
So far,
seems like we dodged a bullet.

143
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:32,865
Did anybody check
on Mrs. Hammer?

144
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,727
She's a fragile flower.

145
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:35,988
I'll go see.

146
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:38,452
Guys, I'm gonna take
the broken arm in Six.

147
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:42,996
No breath sounds on the left.

148
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:44,896
Fluid in the chest,

149
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,523
BP's dropping.

150
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,324
Distended neck veins.

151
00:06:48,477 --> 00:06:49,882
Tension hemothorax.

152
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:51,648
What's the course of action,
Devi?

153
00:06:54,574 --> 00:06:56,084
Chest tube kit. Stat.

154
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:57,335
All right, you guys got this.

155
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,679
I'll go deal with the
smoke inhalation on Bay Four.

156
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,343
Mr. Johnson.

157
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:04,354
You're gonna be just fine.

158
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,393
You good?

159
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:11,106
Mr. Johnson, we need to put
a tube in your chest.

160
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:13,508
- Uh-huh.
- This may hurt a bit.

161
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,413
Well done.

162
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,703
I'm gonna go check on the burns.

163
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:41,507
Now let's finish the surveys
and take him to CT.

164
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:45,640

Chinese restaurant in Atlanta.

178
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,827
Oh.

179
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:37,059
But, shh,
some of the other patients

180
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:38,360
might get jealous.

181
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:40,625
Oh,
Dr. Austin's parents' place?

182
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,442
Yeah, Yee Fan made
his very special congee.

183
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,850
It's perfect
for tender stomachs.

184
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:47,869
No, please.

185
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:50,273
I want to sleep now.

186
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:52,607
You stay with me?

187
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:54,727
Yeah, of course we're staying.

188
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:57,278
Remember?
We're adopting you, sweetie.

189
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:59,381
You're gonna become our child,

190
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:00,874
and we'll be your dads.

191
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:14,388
I have a serious thing
for hummus.

192
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:16,298
You know, I could eat
a pint of it in ten minutes.

193
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:17,667
And then eat another.

194
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:20,211
And what's going on
at Chastain anyway?

195
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:21,144
I feel so detached.

196
00:09:21,238 --> 00:09:22,571
You'll be back soon enough.

197
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:24,835
And, weirdly,
it keeps running without you.

198
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:26,654
But just barely.

199
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:27,898
No one knows what to do.

200
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,734
They're all like,
"Where's Nic? Ask Nic."

201
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,343
Hmm.

202
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,253
Oh, no, dad brigade.

203
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:34,991
- They're early.
- Stay put.

204
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,259
I'll handle it.

205
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:40,422
Guys, the party's at 5:00.
You're hours early.

206
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:42,342
- No, I just need to tell Nic one thing.
- We wanted to lend a hand.

207
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:43,758
- I-I wanted to...
- Gentlemen,

208
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,501
you want to help?

209
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:47,679
Here's a list of stuff
you can grab.

210
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:51,749
Uh, balloons, streamers,

211
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:52,843
cake plates.

212
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,344
Where do we get these?

213
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:55,937
Uh, party store.

214
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:58,539
8th and Piedmont. We're on it.

215
00:09:58,624 --> 00:09:59,482
Thank you!

216
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,765
Go with God.

217
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,736
But take your time.

218
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:06,117
Wow.

219
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:08,523
I mean, can you just run
everything in my life

220
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,859
from now on?

221
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,384
I think that's everyone
from the apartment fire.

222
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:14,478
Well handled.

223
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:16,781
Dr. Pravesh.

224
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,492
Rose.

225
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:22,214
- What happened?
- I don't know.

226
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:24,707
- My legs hurt and my chest, too.
- Okay.

227
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:25,859
When did this start?

228
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:27,703
Uh, about an hour ago,
maybe more.

229
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:29,133
We were taking a walk
in the park.

230
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:30,469
- Got it.
- All right,

231
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:31,602
let's get you in an ER bay.

232
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:34,046
Nurse Hundley,
can you prep Bay Seven?

233
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:35,056
Prepped and ready.

234
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:37,066
You are the best.

235
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:38,673
Come with me, Rose.

236
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,273
Take it slow.

237
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:52,382
Hey, Conrad.

238
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:55,372
Can I talk to you for a sec?

239
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:58,571
I need you to cover her for me.

240
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:00,491
She's your patient.

241
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,834
I know. I...

242
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:04,866
I just need to take a minute.

243
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:07,281
Okay. You want to talk about it?

244
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:09,152
Not yet.

245
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:12,640
Okay. Do what you got to do.

246
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:22,429
Dr. Pravesh and I
saw him carry this kid

247
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:23,738
from the burning building.

248
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,149
He saved a life
at great risk to his own.

249
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:30,226
How many truly selfless people
do you even meet these days?

250
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:32,523
Not too many.

251
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,141
I'm just saying, fingers crossed

252
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,296
his injuries aren't too serious
and we can fix him.

253
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:40,969
Dr. Devi, surgery 101:

254
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:43,129
Never let patients get
into your heart.

255
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,789
Don't worry about me.

256
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:47,390
I'm all about self-control.

257
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:49,890
That's good to know.

258
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:51,945
What have we here?

259
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,639
This man is either the luckiest

260
00:11:54,724 --> 00:11:57,023
or unluckiest patient
I've ever seen.

261
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,531
Broken rib lodged in the aorta?

262
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:02,321
That's
a one-in-a-million injury.

263
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:04,938
- Exactly.
- Most patients with aortic trauma

264
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:06,111
never even make it
to the hospital,

265
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:07,430
but you see right there?

266
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:08,545
His broken rib

267
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,480
is actually preventing him
from bleeding out.

268
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,999
We heard the staircase
collapse beneath him.

269
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:14,905
He got knocked around
really bad.

270
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,704
Okay. So, tell me,
how would you fix him?

271
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:23,914
Approach
with a lateral thoracotomy,

272
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:26,577
clamp it, remove the piece
of the rib, sew up the hole.

273
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:30,390
Well, sounds like somebody
just gained admission to my OR.

274
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:35,941
I won't let you down,
Dr. Austin.

275
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,659
Good.

276
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,815
Now go prep Mr. Johnson
and do not leave his side.

277
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:42,844
If he even sneezes wrong,

278
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,607
that rib could dislodge
and he could bleed out.

279
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:53,840
You're getting
a lot of text messages.

280
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:56,095
Is there some secret boyfriend
you're not telling me about?

281
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:00,062
Yeah, no. I've got
enough on my hands at work.

282
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,336
It's probably
just the siren call

283
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:04,337
of the online shoe stores
I've been consorting with.

284
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:07,921
Oh, my feet
are already a size bigger.

285
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,385
Could be an emergency at work.

286
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:14,710
Nope. Not on call.

287
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:16,379
How are you doing?

288
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:19,125
I just want to hide.

289
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,728
I mean, I love
that everyone cares so much.

290
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:23,127
I just...

291
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:25,721
could use some peace and quiet.

292
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,055
Okay, well, it's too late
to cancel the shower.

293
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,653
I mean, Kyle would be heartbroken.

294
00:13:32,738 --> 00:13:34,677
He's been in on the planning
from the word go.

295
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:37,105
No, I don't want to cancel.
I'm just venting.

296
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:38,528
It's very sweet.

297
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:40,544
And you're right,
he is... dead set

298
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:42,458
on being the best grandpa.

299
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:47,608
Mmm. Oh, that's good.

300
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:05,794
Her incisions
are healing nicely.

301
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,389
That's not where the pain
is coming from.

302
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:09,075
She keeps dozing off.

303
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,040
Shouldn't she wake up
when you're examining her?

304
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:14,144
Well, maybe.
Her abdomen is soft.

305
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:16,807
The loss of appetite
is concerning,

306
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:18,315
but until she eats,
we won't know

307
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:20,300
how her digestive system
is responding.

308
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,071
I could get some Jell-O
from the cafeteria.

309
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:24,280
It's worth a try.

310
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,887
Hey, guys. Just a word.

311
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,344
What's going on?

312
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:36,292
We just got
Sammie's latest labs.

313
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:41,090
She's showing signs
of kidney and liver failure?

314
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:42,548
And her lactate is climbing.

315
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:44,457
What does that mean?

316
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:46,251
That the-the post-op infection

317
00:14:46,404 --> 00:14:49,254
is taking a toll on her body,
and...

318
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:51,757
and if it continues
to get worse, then...

319
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:55,387
Her long-term prospects
are not good.

320
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,506
- Hey.
- Dr. Hawkins.

321
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:13,091
What's the word? Am I having
a sickle cell crisis?

322
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:14,989
Your chest X-ray looked good.

323
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:16,949
You're not having
a heart attack.

324
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:20,110
And your CT angioscan was clean,
too, so it's not a blood clot.

325
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:23,029
But you can't rule out that I'm
not having a sickle cell crisis?

326
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,230
That's good news, Rose.

327
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:25,699
- Take it.
- We won't

328
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:27,527
know for certain
about your sickle cell status

329
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:29,409
until the blood smear
comes back.

330
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,539
Every day since I finished
the gene therapy

331
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,995
had been feeling better
than my last.

332
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:37,839
I was walking without pain
and then jogging.

333
00:15:37,924 --> 00:15:40,206
Last week
I even taught at the studio.

334
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:42,282
Now this.

335
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:46,495
I'm scared.
What if the gene therapy failed?

336
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,402
Look...

337
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:52,481
You did the right thing
coming in,

338
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:56,406
but there is no reason to go
to the worst-case scenario yet.

339
00:15:56,808 --> 00:15:58,175
Where's Dr. Pravesh?

340
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:00,706
The ER is slammed.
There was a fire.

341
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:02,342
- He asked me to step in.
- Oh.

342
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,199
I hope everyone's okay.

343
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:06,842
Thank you, Conrad.

344
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,456
Sure.

345
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,090
Soon as I know more,
I'll come right back.

346
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:20,274
I've signed my life over,
Dr. Devi.

347
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:23,858
But I know I'm in good hands.

348
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:28,714
Actually, Dr. Austin
is your primary surgeon.

349
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,796
You're in the best hands.

350
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:33,379
I'm gonna insert
an arterial line.

351
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:34,841
You'll feel a pinch
when I insert it.

352
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:37,028
Yeah, I'm guessing
I can survive a pinch

353
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:40,040
since I've got a rib
jammed in my heart.

354
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,812
Y-You're gonna be
in the operating room,

355
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:45,183
though, aren't you?

356
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:46,810
I'll be assisting Dr. Austin.

357
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,059
Good.

358
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:51,855
Y-You're my lucky charm, huh?

359
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:53,820
If you hadn't helped
at the fire,

360
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:55,639
I might not have made it
this far.

361
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:00,895
Excellent.
That was close to painless.

362
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,097
And you are so young
to be this talented.

363
00:17:05,112 --> 00:17:07,700
I bet your parents
are really proud of you.

364
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:12,083
That's half true.

365
00:17:12,316 --> 00:17:14,474
Oh, which one's hard on you?

366
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:16,230
Mom?

367
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:19,528
- Dad?
- What we are doing today,

368
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:21,808
Mr. Johnson, is about you,
not about me.

369
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,892
I get it. I'm nosy.

370
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:27,011
You can tell me
all about it after.

371
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:30,232
If there is an after, that is.

372
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:32,192
Because there's a chance

373
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,409
I'm not gonna make it
off the table, right?

374
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,455
All surgery has risks.

375
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,611
This one, more than most.

376
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:45,004
I'll go over them again
with you.

377
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:46,364
No, thank you.

378
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,011
It's not like
I'm gonna change my mind.

379
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,590
Besides, you and Dr. Austin

380
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,962
will get me through this.

381
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:06,093
So far,
Rose's labs and scans look good.

382
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:08,535
So it's not
a sickle cell crisis.

383
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,300
We're waiting for her blood
smear to come back to be sure.

384
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:14,033
- I told her to stay put for a bit.
- Okay.

385
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:15,969
Thanks. Fingers crossed.

386
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:19,223
You ready to tell me
what's going on?

387
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,641
Why you turfed her to me?

388
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,478
Come here.

389
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm not sure myself, honestly.

390
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:32,019
Look, I care about Rose.

391
00:18:32,104 --> 00:18:33,664
And I'm open about that.

392
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:34,656
I've been her doctor

393
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,844
from the moment that she
stepped foot into Chastain.

394
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,181
I found her that clinical trial.

395
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:39,845
I've held her hand
through the worst of it.

396
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:41,672
I agree.
You've been exemplary.

397
00:18:41,757 --> 00:18:43,555
Top-notch physician.

398
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:47,741
But this morning I saw her
in a coffee shop with Cain.

399
00:18:48,014 --> 00:18:49,623
They were holding hands.

400
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:51,694
It's obvious they're together.

401
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:54,515
And I'm feeling...

402
00:18:57,155 --> 00:18:58,671
I don't know.

403
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:03,724
Jealous.

404
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,101
But to be clear,

405
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:07,398
I don't want an intimate
relationship with Rose.

406
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:08,867
She's my patient,

407
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:11,250
and that is a line
that I'm never gonna cross.

408
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:14,430
But why is Cain, who we know

409
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:16,211
is a problematic human being
at best,

410
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,335
taking a victory lap
with my patient?

411
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:21,960
I want her healed, okay?
I really do.

412
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,514
But all of a sudden,
you know, I'm feeling...

413
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,695
I'm feeling protective of her,

414
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,499
- which is...
- Yeah, not your job.

415
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:33,188
Our patients,
when they leave the hospital,

416
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,858
they're gonna do
whatever the hell they want.

417
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,125
And who knows?

418
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,993
Cain's been through a lot.
She's been through a lot.

419
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,353
Maybe they'll be good
for each other.

420
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:40,804
You never know.

421
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:42,380
Yeah.

422
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:45,093
- Mm-hmm. You never know.
- I mean,

423
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:47,077
who would've thought
you and Dr. Devi

424
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:48,446
would be so perfect
for each other?

425
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,980
- Oh, get out of here.
- What?

426
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,805
I'm just happy
for you guys, man.

427
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,734
That's never gonna happen.

428
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:57,672
You are so cute.

429
00:19:57,757 --> 00:19:58,734
Oh, my God.

430
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:01,753
Oh. Don't move.

431
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:04,601
Sorry that took so long.

432
00:20:04,686 --> 00:20:06,526
We had a, uh, kerfuffle

433
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:08,460
over the color of the streamers.

434
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:10,324
Welcome back, guys.
Let's put everything

435
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,891
on the dining room table
and see what we got.

436
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:15,027
Uh, Nic, I learned today
that your father

437
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:17,763
has strong feelings
about the color orange.

438
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:20,581
Oh, yeah. That's a thing.

439
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,575
Glad you guys worked it out.

440
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:25,430
I thought we
agreed to not do this.

441
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,284
I don't
like orange. It scares me.

442
00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:29,869
I wasn't making fun of you.

443
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:31,304
Can you just...?

444
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,319
Is that my phone?
What are you doing?

445
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:40,488
I heard it buzzing. It must have
fallen out of your pocket.

446
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,048
- You were reading my texts.
- No.

447
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,067
I... Well, I mean, yeah,
they-they popped up.

448
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:47,712
What... What is going on?

449
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,223
I mean, you've been powering
through the house all day

450
00:20:50,307 --> 00:20:51,732
like if you stopped
for one second,

451
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,826
your head's gonna explode.

452
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,162
And, I mean, who is this person?

453
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:55,763
Who's texting you those things?

454
00:20:57,784 --> 00:20:59,617
I will tell you, okay?
But not now.

455
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:00,953
Not in front of the dad brigade.

456
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:03,257
Coming through, child. But, hey,

457
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:06,173
maybe black is the new orange.

458
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,725
The meds should help get blood

459
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:12,162
to her organs now.

460
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:13,997
And...

461
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:17,140
now we're just standing here?

462
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:21,585
No, now we are being here.

463
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,578
Sometimes that's
what parents are for.

464
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:25,968
Parents.

465
00:21:32,173 --> 00:21:33,581
I didn't even touch her.

466
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,008
No, it-it's okay.

467
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,224
Her belly's rock-hard.

468
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:38,711
- What does that mean?
- It means

469
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:41,233
she needs an abdominal
CT scan right now.

470
00:21:41,318 --> 00:21:42,859
I'm paging Dr. Bell.

471
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,905
Here comes the doctor.

472
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:51,533
How's everybody else
from the fire?

473
00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:53,526
I'm not allowed
to give out patient information.

474
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,280
- HIPAA rules.
- Oh, what about Rita's dog, Chompsky?

475
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:58,032
He's a great pup, that one.

476
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,524
Don't tell me HIPAA covers dogs.

477
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:02,620
Ah, look
at that. I made you smile.

478
00:22:02,704 --> 00:22:04,881
All your neighbors are asking
about you as well.

479
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:06,452
You have a lot of fans.

480
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:07,847
When you wake up,
you should tell me

481
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:09,016
the secret of your popularity.

482
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,616
I'm the new kid around here.

483
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:11,913
I could use some tips.

484
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,556
Deal.

485
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:16,515
Has the, uh, patient
been completely prepped?

486
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,601
He has.

487
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:20,218
Informed of the risks and
has consented to the surgery?

488
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,481
Uh, Dr. Devi here
has laid it all out for me.

489
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:26,741
We've covered all the risks,
haven't we?

490
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:28,741
Excellent.

491
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:31,011
Well, let's scrub in
and get started.

492
00:22:35,114 --> 00:22:37,382
When we see you next,
you'll be all fixed up.

493
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:46,630
Acute mesenteric ischemia.

494
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:50,265
Yeah. Her hypercoagulable state
must have led to a clot

495
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,515
that compromised blood supply
to her bowels.

496
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,055
This could be fatal.

497
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,173
Well, if I perform
an embolectomy quickly

498
00:22:56,257 --> 00:22:57,825
before her gut dies off,
we can give her a chance.

499
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,460
No, no, I don't think her body
can handle another big surgery.

500
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,654
It's our only option...

501
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:05,085
if we're gonna have any chance
of saving her.

502
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:16,208
So, what did you get
for the baby?

503
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:20,521
A vacation home
in Aspen and an SUV.

504
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:26,370
Relax. I got her a basket
of ETFs and a trading account.

505
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,632
Almost as useful for a newborn
as an Aspen retreat.

506
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:30,468
You?

507
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:33,788
I got her a car seat
for that SUV.

508
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:40,288
Billie, what's going on?

509
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:42,148
Talk to me.

510
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:49,054
Okay. Okay,
so I told you, right?

511
00:23:49,382 --> 00:23:51,062
When I was 13,

512
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:53,578
you know,
after we lost touch...

513
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:55,851
that I was raped.

514
00:23:56,694 --> 00:23:58,410
Of course.

515
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:01,140
Well, I got pregnant.

516
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:03,784
Oh, my God. Billie.

517
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:05,866
I...

518
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:08,004
I didn't know.

519
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:10,329
This was your day, Nic.

520
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:11,897
I didn't want to make it
about me.

521
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:13,568
God, don't even think
about that, please.

522
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,233
I... Honestly,
I want to talk about this.

523
00:24:18,184 --> 00:24:20,163
I was so young.

524
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,413
By the time I realized
I was pregnant,

525
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,046
I had no options.

526
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:28,983
I went to live with my aunt
until the birth,

527
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,901
and...

528
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:33,694
then I gave the baby up
for adoption.

529
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:38,999
That must've been so scary.

530
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:43,140
It was.

531
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:49,671
They took him away
right after he was born.

532
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:52,464
I barely saw him.

533
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:53,894
A boy.

534
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:01,433
Yeah.

535
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,676
He's 18 now and wants to meet.

536
00:25:06,457 --> 00:25:08,054
He won't take no for an answer.

537
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:10,403
You know, the records are
supposed to be closed,

538
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:12,058
but nothing stays
hidden anymore.

539
00:25:12,152 --> 00:25:13,736
So those text messages...

540
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,653
It's him.

541
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:18,531
Wow.

542
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:25,238
Do you want to see him?

543
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:27,539
I mean, are you curious?

544
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:29,901
Yeah. Of course.

545
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:35,173
I wonder what he looks like.

546
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:38,335
You know,
what kind of person he is,

547
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:41,721
what he's doing with his life,
and...

548
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:47,519
But he's the product
of something awful.

549
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,022
Something I have worked
very hard to put behind me.

550
00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:54,651
It's not his fault,
but it's the truth.

551
00:25:57,438 --> 00:25:59,255
I mean,
what if I look at his face

552
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:02,158
and all I see is
the man who raped me?

553
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:11,869
And what if he asks about his father?

554
00:26:11,953 --> 00:26:14,103
Would I tell him?

555
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:16,132
Would that be fair to him?

556
00:26:16,216 --> 00:26:19,592
How does that help him in his life?

557
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:24,514
God, I don't know the answer
to that question.

558
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:27,310
Hey, Nic! People are here!

559
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:29,602
Sorry.

560
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:33,149
Okay, now you know my secret,

561
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,400
one I haven't told anyone.

562
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:37,643
And I'm gonna ask you
to keep it.

563
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,405
Of course.

564
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:44,409
Can we please just drop this
for tonight?

565
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,071
Let's go out there
and celebrate your shower, okay?

566
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:49,247
I mean, we can talk more,
but not now.

567
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:52,500
Whatever you say, but I want
to help you with this, okay?

568
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:55,670
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

569
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,346
Hi, Sammie.

570
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:07,748
You ready?

571
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:09,675
Yes.

572
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,177
Okay.

573
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:14,272
Is there anything you want
to say before we go?

574
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:20,696
See you on the other side.

575
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,449
Yeah.

576
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,994
We will see you
on the other side, kid.

577
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:37,420
Okay.

578
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:49,866
Congratulations.

579
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,885
You just completed your first
posterolateral thoracotomy.

580
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:56,722
- You keep this up, and next time I will let you...
- Dissect the aorta?

581
00:27:56,816 --> 00:27:58,142
...choose the music.

582
00:27:58,226 --> 00:28:01,653
Walk before you can run,
Dr. Devi.

583
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:05,149
Does this aorta look normal
to you?

584
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,157
No.

585
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:07,468
Below the level
of the rib injury,

586
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,051
I'd say that segment
isn't viable.

587
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:12,064
Well, he has a building full
of best friends who need him,

588
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,723
so let's get to work.

589
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:15,482
Yes, let's.

590
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:17,818
All right, this aorta
is starting to dissect

591
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:19,078
at the point of injury.

592
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,998
So sewing up
the puncture site alone

593
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,333
is no longer an option.

594
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,510
This has just gotten
way more complicated.

595
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:28,339
- Do we need to go on pump?
- No, we can't wait any longer.

596
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:30,998
We'll do it the old-fashioned
way with cut-and-sew technique.

597
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:33,092
Tell me, how confident are you

598
00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:36,187
in your vessel suturing skills,
Doctor?

599
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,839
Confident.

600
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:40,525
Good, because once we clamp...

601
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:43,027
We'll have only minutes
to remove the damaged portion

602
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,511
and sew in a replacement graft,

603
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:46,614
or Doug's lower body organs
will die of ischemia.

604
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:50,786
Clamp.

605
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,371
Let's go.

606
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:01,045
Excellent work in there,
Dr. Devi.

607
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,632
When Mr. Johnson wakes up,

608
00:29:02,716 --> 00:29:04,300
I'd like for you to do
his post-op exam.

609
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,050
Thank you, Dr. Austin.

610
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,470
I'll be the first face he sees.

611
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:14,300
Hey, Mom.

612
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:16,979
Listen, I just got a text
from imaging.

613
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:18,896
Can you come in
in about 20 minutes

614
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,714
to take a look at the scans?

615
00:29:20,808 --> 00:29:22,233
Right.

616
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:25,528
Great. All right, see you then.

617
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,301
I'm sorry.

618
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:33,986
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

619
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:36,289
I hope your mother's okay.

620
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,252
Rose's blood smear results.

621
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:53,924
Oh, my God.
No sign of sickle cell.

622
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:56,416
That's incredible.

623
00:29:56,511 --> 00:29:58,245
You should be the one
to give her the news, not me.

624
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,845
You're the one who got her here.

625
00:29:59,939 --> 00:30:02,398
I will. Thanks.

626
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:05,695
You're sure there's no mistake?

627
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:07,530
I'm sure.

628
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:10,689
On the right are your red
blood cells from the day we met.

629
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:12,276
Over half are sickle-shaped.

630
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,601
On the left are your cells
today.

631
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:16,621
Round and smooth.

632
00:30:16,772 --> 00:30:18,197
I'm gonna say perfect.

633
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:21,017
But if there are
no sickle cells,

634
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,211
then why was I in so much pain?

635
00:30:22,295 --> 00:30:23,855
Joint and muscle pain are
totally normal

636
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:25,214
when you start hitting the gym

637
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:27,049
and dancing and doing everything
you're doing now.

638
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:29,692
- What about my chest pain?
- That's costochondritis.

639
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:33,889
It's pain in the muscle
and cartilage between your ribs.

640
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:35,622
It's harmless.
It'll go away with time.

641
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:38,394
Your body just isn't used to
doing anything normal yet.

642
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:40,304
You were just so excited
to exercise,

643
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:42,473
so I think you just
pushed yourself too hard.

644
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:47,485
I'm gonna need you to say it.

645
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:52,657
Okay.

646
00:30:53,901 --> 00:30:55,493
Rose, your gene therapy worked.

647
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,580
And you're cured.

648
00:31:04,987 --> 00:31:07,580
I don't even know
where to begin.

649
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:08,506
Thank you.

650
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:12,593
From the bottom of my heart.

651
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:16,556
You've changed my life.

652
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:21,853
I should be thanking you.

653
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,913
You trusted me.

654
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:25,431
And because you did,

655
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:27,433
a lot of people suffering
from sickle cell

656
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,694
are gonna get the chance
to be cured.

657
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:35,575
You get the results?

658
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:38,703
She did.

659
00:31:38,854 --> 00:31:40,621
You tell him.

660
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:45,284
- I'm cured.
- You're cured.

661
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,421
I'm cured.

662
00:31:57,307 --> 00:31:58,656
How's our local hero?

663
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:01,289
Surgery went great.

664
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:03,308
Doug's vitals are stable.

665
00:32:03,393 --> 00:32:04,893
Uh, do either of you want, uh,

666
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:07,805
32 new but slightly barbecued
roommates?

667
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,083
I'm sure Dr. Pravesh has

668
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:11,796
a walk-in closet
he'd love to offer up.

669
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:13,541
Yeah, I'm sure they would be
more comfortable

670
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,050
with their friends and family.

671
00:32:15,221 --> 00:32:17,721
Well, you know, I'm just sorry
we can't stay under one roof.

672
00:32:17,806 --> 00:32:18,989
You know, it's a good group.

673
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:22,292
Are you uncomfortable, Doug?

674
00:32:22,377 --> 00:32:24,060
Uh, yeah, I am.

675
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:26,513
But I think I'm just
shaking off the anesthesia.

676
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:28,412
- Do you have any chest pain?
- Ah, just heartburn, yeah.

677
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:30,325
I've had it before.
I just... need some...

678
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:35,419
He's in V fib.

679
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:37,529
Let's get a crash cart
in here now!

680
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,269
Charging to 200. Clear.

681
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:02,172
How long has it been?

682
00:33:02,468 --> 00:33:04,152
27 minutes.

683
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:10,418
Stop compressions.

684
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:16,033
Leela.

685
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:17,895
Stop and check the pulse.

686
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,044
There's activity on the EKG.

687
00:33:20,177 --> 00:33:22,310
That's pulseless
electrical activity,

688
00:33:22,395 --> 00:33:24,037
with no true heart rhythm.

689
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:26,280
Despite three rounds of epi,
bicarb and calcium

690
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:27,973
and multiple shocks.

691
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:33,201
There is no return
of circulation.

692
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:46,662
Time of death: 19:14.

693
00:33:54,413 --> 00:33:56,964
Are you okay?

694
00:33:57,947 --> 00:34:00,873
I just need a minute.

695
00:34:21,232 --> 00:34:23,481
<i>Just a little longer, Mom.</i>

696
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:25,762
It can get really claustrophobic
in there.

697
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:28,088
Yeah, she doesn't do well
in small spaces.

698
00:34:28,178 --> 00:34:31,622
Spelunking is her idea
of a nightmare.

699
00:34:35,138 --> 00:34:37,084
Okay, so, this is
your initial scan.

700
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:39,399
You see that?
Yellow spots all over the place.

701
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:41,393
- Hmm.
- There's tumors everywhere.

702
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:43,569
And this is you now.

703
00:34:43,721 --> 00:34:45,238
No tumors.

704
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,506
- Not a one.
- Yes.

705
00:34:48,105 --> 00:34:49,538
The targeted therapy worked.

706
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:51,070
It's a miracle.

707
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:52,561
That it is, Dad.

708
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:56,844
You said it was gonna be fine,
AJ, and you were right.

709
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,843
You knew all along, didn't you?

710
00:35:00,928 --> 00:35:02,788
Sure, I knew all along.

711
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:06,834
We're not gonna let anything
happen to you, Mom.

712
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:15,181
Hey, guys.

713
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:21,599
So, uh, the operation went well.

714
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:24,107
And I restored the blood flow,

715
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,928
and the bowel resection
was minimal.

716
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:30,608
So Sammie should be able
to digest food normally.

717
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:33,077
- Oh, that's great, right?
- Yeah, it is,

718
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:36,522
but Sammie's
still on pressors, and...

719
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:39,427
given everything
her body's undergone...

720
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:45,715
There is a possibility that she
won't make it through the night.

721
00:35:47,385 --> 00:35:50,044
So why don't you guys...
go sit with her?

722
00:35:50,129 --> 00:35:53,413
I'll get cleaned up
and get us some coffees, and...

723
00:35:54,043 --> 00:35:56,401
and we can sit with her
in shifts.

724
00:35:57,517 --> 00:36:00,392
It's just gonna be a long night.

725
00:36:15,316 --> 00:36:19,177
I can't stop thinking
we must have missed something.

726
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,725
I just spoke with Dr. Austin,

727
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,964
and he said
you did everything right.

728
00:36:28,974 --> 00:36:31,085
Sometimes patients have
bad outcomes,

729
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,487
and it's no one's fault.

730
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:37,670
How am I supposed to do this job

731
00:36:37,755 --> 00:36:40,169
when getting close
to my patients

732
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:43,312
and keeping distance from them
both feel wrong?

733
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,576
I ask myself that all the time.

734
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:54,482
But there is no...

735
00:36:54,954 --> 00:36:56,520
right answer.

736
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,556
Not very helpful.

737
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,240
Okay.

738
00:37:08,304 --> 00:37:10,498
What kind of doctor
do you want to be?

739
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:16,522
Well, since medical school,

740
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:18,558
my goal has been to just...

741
00:37:19,005 --> 00:37:20,467
survive...

742
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:23,053
to minimize my liabilities,

743
00:37:23,138 --> 00:37:24,223
and to not...

744
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:27,291
get kicked out of the club.

745
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:31,904
To be fair, a lot of that came
from my father.

746
00:37:33,934 --> 00:37:35,557
Controlling...

747
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,703
what you thought needed
to be controlled.

748
00:37:40,235 --> 00:37:41,501
Yeah.

749
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:51,629
But I'm learning that being
a dispassionate robot...

750
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,483
Isn't in my nature.

751
00:37:56,668 --> 00:37:59,557
That it won't make me
a better doctor.

752
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:06,847
That's funny... that's
the same answer I came up with.

753
00:38:28,394 --> 00:38:29,325
Oh, wow.

754
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,474
It's a traditional
cheongsam baby dress.

755
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,771
The color stands
for prosperity, virtue,

756
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:36,067
warmth, happiness,
sincerity and truth.

757
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
That's beautiful.

758
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:39,239
Paul, thank you. I love it.

759
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:40,921
Thank you, man.

760
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:43,693
Aw, I can't wait to see her
in this.

761
00:38:43,777 --> 00:38:46,244
Okay, the next gift is
from Jessica and Irving.

762
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:48,106
Yep. So, it was too big to wrap.

763
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:49,410
I just have to say,

764
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:52,080
I want one of these for myself.

765
00:38:52,558 --> 00:38:54,090
Oh!

766
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:56,622
That's perfect. Look,
put that little girl in there,

767
00:38:56,707 --> 00:38:58,168
and she'll be asleep
in two minutes.

768
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,180
Yeah, that's after she's done
checking her stock portfolio.

769
00:39:01,265 --> 00:39:02,265
Thank you, Marshall.

770
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:04,966
Not sure where
we're gonna put all this stuff.

771
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,395
It's so generous. Thank you.

772
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:07,512
Well, lucky for you,

773
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:09,614
there's only one gift left,
mine,

774
00:39:10,174 --> 00:39:12,366
and it's small.

775
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:19,801
Oh...

776
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,038
Our moms.

777
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:24,785
It's beautiful.
Thank you, Billie.

778
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,004
Can we see?

779
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:29,707
Kyle and Marshall
got me the photos.

780
00:39:29,848 --> 00:39:31,649
It's for the baby's room,

781
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:33,075
so she never forgets
her grandmothers,

782
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:35,827
who I'm sure would have loved
to see her but...

783
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:38,042
left this world too soon.

784
00:39:38,149 --> 00:39:40,400
That's my mom.
That's Grace Nevin.

785
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:42,235
So pretty.

786
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:47,145
She's just about your age
in this photo.

787
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,139

854
00:42:42,924 --> 00:42:44,240
You tired?

00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:45,833

856
00:42:45,986 --> 00:42:48,336

we're gonna get much sleep.

858
00:42:49,931 --> 00:42:51,349
My contractions.

859
00:42:51,433 --> 00:42:53,491

860

to manage, but...

861
00:42:56,496 --> 00:42:58,513
they're getting closer together.
