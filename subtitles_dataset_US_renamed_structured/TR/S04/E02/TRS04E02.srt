what's going on?

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,859
I think I have a little flu,
that's all.

You put a patient

7
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:12,922
He won't get COVID
because my OR is spotless.

this shipment
is on its way.

11
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:20,859
You said
Red Rock wouldn't pay.

12
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:22,585
They won't.
But they did.

13
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:25,101
Don't worry,
I'm not expecting anything...

No, I just didn't think

00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:43,819
It's a life cut short
but certainly well-lived.

175
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:46,452
And you know, I don't know
if I was...

176
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:49,921
if I was feeling envy or...
or jealousy,

177
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:53,436
but I-I mean, I just,
I have to admit I...

178
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,444
I wish I had even a small part
of what he had.

179
00:08:56,647 --> 00:08:59,867
In the very distant future,
when you're on your deathbed,

180
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:02,500
I and every one
of your friends here

181
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,264
who you haven't outlived...

182
00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:05,921
will be at your bedside.

183
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:07,679
Well, I appreciate it.

184
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,210
I've just come to regret some of
the bridges I've burned,

185
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:12,876
the people I've hurt,
that's all.

186
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,827
Figure out who's worth
fighting for

187
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:17,773
to get back in your life
and get after it already.

188
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,751
Sat's 85.

189
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:28,421
You're not getting enough
oxygen. We need you

190
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:29,327
- off the phone...
- Senator Buxton,

191
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:30,312
I'd like to put you
on the phone

192
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:32,321
with one of your constituents.
Her name is Bianca.

193
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,694
She is a hardworking young woman
who can't afford childcare.

194
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,272
Yeah, tell her what you just
told me.

195
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:39,281
Sat's down to 83.

196
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:40,609
Nichelle!

197
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,015
I don't feel right.

198
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,241
What's happening?

199
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,181
Devon?

200
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:54,936
Devon.

201
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,234
Devon, give me the mask.

202
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,833
Let's get another X-ray, okay?

203
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,687
She's a little wheezy.
How about some nebs?

204
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:21,413
Mr. Mullins here came in with a
few weeks of worsening dyspnea.

205
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:22,790
And look at this.

206
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:27,905
Right axis deviation.
Right heart strain pattern.

207
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,937
And evidence of pulmonary
hypertension on bedside echo.

208
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,649
Also complained of
some dizziness,

209
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:35,054
so I sent him through
the answer box, which...

210
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,468
Fine. CT scanner.

211
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:42,125
His head CT revealed
some old ischemic strokes.

212
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,727
But the reason
I called you is...

213
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:47,822
Proximal filling
defects in the pulmonary artery.

214
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:49,565
It's consistent with
thromboembolic

215
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,807
pulmonary hypertension.

216
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,688
- Uh, what's that?
- Uh, blood clots

217
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:55,501
in the artery that leads
from your heart to your lungs.

218
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,103
That's why you're
having trouble breathing.

219
00:10:57,187 --> 00:10:58,391
Based on these images,

220
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,031
these clots could be
a few months old.

221
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:01,728
They could
have started last April.

222
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:03,862
That's when he had an urgent
spine surgery here

223
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,581
followed by COVID-19.

224
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:08,107
Oh. This sounds bad.

225
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:09,780
What happens now?

226
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:12,930
Well, based on your husband's
hemodynamic instability,

227
00:11:13,015 --> 00:11:15,349
we should plan for surgery
to remove the clots as soon

228
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,953
as possible.
Then he'll be able

229
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:18,851
to breathe comfortably again.

230
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,184
I knew he looked familiar.

231
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:28,352
I butted heads with Cain
months ago over this guy.

232
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,460
He reclassified his elective
spine surgery as urgent.

233
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:33,689
Which means if Mullins got COVID
here at Chastain...

234
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:35,312
He's another Cain casualty.

235
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:37,252
And we both know that that
surgery wasn't truly emergent.

236
00:11:37,336 --> 00:11:39,517
Well, we suspect.
We don't know for sure.

237
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:40,791
Okay, in Mina's kangaroo court,

238
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,461
Barrett Cain is sentenced
to death.

239
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:45,009
All right, I'm gonna
find out for sure.

240
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:01,243
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

241
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:03,251
You froze up before,
and then you took off

242
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,090
like a bat out of hell.

243
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,868
Yeah, I'm just fried.
It's jet lag.

244
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,432
Multiple small nodules

245
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,744
with surrounding
ground glass opacities.

246
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,654
It's consistent
with histoplasmosis.

247
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,696
And a lot of other types
of infections

248
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,305
- and inflammatory processes.
- Yeah.

249
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:26,250
Histoplasmosis is one
of the great imitators.

250
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:28,831
All of her test results
and symptoms

251
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,532
could mimic something else.

252
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:33,681
Her diagnosis
might not be straightforward.

253
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,763
- And she might not have histo.
- True.

254
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,339
But until we have something
more definitive,

255
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,931
we stay the course.

256
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:41,509
Have you heard anything

257
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,360
about who might be
replacing Kim as our CEO?

258
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,023
- Come in.
- Well, have you?

259
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:50,118
Not a word.

260
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:53,321
What are you doing?

261
00:12:57,336 --> 00:12:58,680
Who's he?

262
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,149
My former stepson Jake.

263
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:03,977
My first wife's kid.

264
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:06,110
I was with Donna for six years.

265
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:07,064
Gosh.

266
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:09,861
We've been out of touch
for a long time, and

267
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:12,235
I reached out
during the pandemic, and, um,

268
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,509
you know, didn't...
didn't hear anything back, but,

269
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:20,282
just, I'd like to try and...
to reconnect with him.

270
00:13:20,648 --> 00:13:23,452
I was with him
from when he was six

271
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,383
till just about 12, and...

272
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,305
Oh, God, we had fun.

273
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:32,297
And he was angry and-and...
and hurt

274
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:35,472
when I divorced his mother.

275
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:39,587
Then Donna threatened to kill me
if I reached out to him.

276
00:13:39,678 --> 00:13:43,152
Said I'd done enough damage
by abandoning them, and...

277
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:45,899
Oh, I shouldn't have
listened to her.

278
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,372
Tread lightly.

279
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,382
And good luck, Randolph.

280
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:11,450
Hey. Bianca.

281
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:13,381
Not sure if you're aware
of this,

282
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:17,435
but HR can help you find
affordable childcare, okay?

283
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:20,950
Um, great. But my name's not
Bianca and I don't have kids.

284
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,223
We need help!

285
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,006
What happened?

286
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:27,818
She fell.
And she's in a lot of pain

287
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,366
and she's having even
more trouble breathing now.

288
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,364
Please,
you got to do something.

289
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:33,827
- We're gonna get you on the bed.
- We got you.

290
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:34,957
We got you.

291
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:40,223
Nichelle, try to relax.

292
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:42,966
Try and relax. Try and relax.

293
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:50,544
- Bilateral crackles.
- Sats in the 80s.

294
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,481
Something's not adding up.

295
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:56,208
We'll run some more tests
and I'll order a chest CT.

296
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,247
Well-well, could it be the meds?

297
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:05,461
As I told Nichelle,
very unlikely.

298
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,951
Shingles. I saw a dermatologist.

299
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:15,280
They put you on an antiviral?

300
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:17,164
- Yeah, ten days ago.
- Good.

301
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:20,326
- She's gonna be okay, right?
- Yeah.

302
00:15:20,411 --> 00:15:22,567
If it's not a fungus,
we'll figure out what it is.

303
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,098
She's stressed
about the special election.

304
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:28,715
Mr. Randall
didn't want her to run.

305
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,103
And that's why
he's not here?

306
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,258
Tom Randall cares
about Tom Randall.

307
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:37,903
He puts in time for her
if there's a camera.

308
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,948
Nichelle cares about everybody.
Atlanta needs her.

309
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:43,157
Georgia needs her.

310
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,669
You know, I couldn't imagine
what we'd do without her.

311
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:02,711
Is he off his call yet?

312
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,829
I'm sorry, Mr. Yorn
is on a different call now.

313
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:08,185
Of course he is. When do you
suppose he might be available?

314
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,811
- Check back in an hour.
- That's what you said an hour ago.

315
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,795
Tell you what,
why don't you have me paged

316
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,966
- when he's off the phone?
- Certainly.

317
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:25,481
- Mr. Mullins.
- Hey.

318
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:27,865
I have a couple of questions
I'd like to ask you

319
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,927
- before we prep you for surgery.
- Yeah.

320
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:34,084
Have you continued to experience
acute onset bowel incontinence

321
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:36,154
post the discectomy
Dr. Cain performed

322
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,193
back in April last year?

323
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:39,915
Or was it only before surgery?

324
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:41,802
Say what?

325
00:16:41,887 --> 00:16:44,021
Were you having difficulty
controlling your bowels

326
00:16:44,106 --> 00:16:47,028
after the operation
or was it only before?

327
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:51,505
Neither. Um, I've never
had that problem.

328
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,146
Did Dr. Cain check
your rectal tone back in April?

329
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:01,318
Oh, uh, no.
Uh, I think I'd remember that.

330
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:03,145
Sure.
Of course you would.

331
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,490
All right. I'll see you
in the OR.

332
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:09,145
And we'll get you back
on your feet before you know it.

333
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:10,762
Okay.

334
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,333
Ben Mullins.
Remember him?

335
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,170
He's back
with chronic thromboembolic

336
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:25,107
- pulmonary hypertension.
- And you're telling me this because...?

337
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:27,295
Because the clots could be
the result of COVID.

338
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,138
Which he most likely
contracted here

339
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:31,068
after you conned him
into thinking

340
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:33,418
- his discectomy was urgent.
- I did nothing of the kind.

341
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:35,201
I know you fabricated
his symptoms

342
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:36,513
to justify the surgery.

343
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,334
Mullins was never incontinent.

344
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:40,809
He doesn't even remember
you checking his rectal tone.

345
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,052
I know I may look like I have
stupid written on my forehead,

346
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:46,896
- but I see what's going on here.
- Even if I did what you are

347
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:51,209
accusing me of, there are plenty
other white surgeons out there

348
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:53,229
who did elective surgeries
during COVID.

349
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:56,278
Why come after the only
other prominent Black cutter?

350
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:57,658
There are plenty of brothers

351
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,788
I left behind because they
weren't ready for the fight.

352
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,520
Not once did it ever occur to me
to pick them off.

353
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:06,765
But you're that one rising crab
in the barrel

354
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,770
who pulls the one
above you right back in.

355
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:14,278
No.
You got me wrong, bro.

356
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,301
That's not my M.O.

357
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:18,498
I don't want you gone, Barrett.

358
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,888
I happen to find strength

359
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,591
in our all-too-small
brotherhood,

360
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:23,896
but I'm about pushing
each other to excel,

361
00:18:23,981 --> 00:18:26,209
to be more prepared,
to be more skilled,

362
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:28,087
so our talent
cannot be discounted.

363
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,373
It doesn't matter
if we're better.

364
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:30,631
We're always gonna
be discounted.

365
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:32,591
It's about the money.

366
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:35,106
Money's the one thing
they can't ignore.

367
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,205
Which is why I'm gonna continue
to do whatever it takes

368
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,669
to be the top earner.

369
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:42,817
That's the way
the game is played.

370
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:47,810
Playing the game doesn't mean
you have to lose your soul.

371
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:52,544
You do you, and I'll do me.

372
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,380
Let the cards fall
where they may.

373
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,341
Devon.

374
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:38,942
Thanks.
What's up?

375
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:42,453
Nichelle and James
seem concerned

376
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:44,989
that she's taking
the antifungal meds.

377
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,952
It's a little weird.

378
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:49,747
When James asked me
if she was gonna be okay,

379
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:53,372
he looked like I'd look
if I thought I might lose Nic.

380
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:56,762
So you think there's something
going on between them.

381
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:12,317
Hey, what's up?

382
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:15,127
So, Cain lied
on Mullins' file.

383
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:17,672
Said he was incontinent
to justify the surgery,

384
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:20,903
- but he was not.
- That's it.

385
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:22,677
We have what we need
to get rid of him.

386
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:24,286
When you say "get rid of him,"

387
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,575
it means to potentially
destroy his career.

388
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,037
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, I-I need to sit with it.

389
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:31,895
I can't imagine why.
He's a proven menace.

390
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:35,189
- It's complicated.
- No, it's not.

391
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:38,067
It's simple.
Cain is dangerous.

392
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:39,553
He shouldn't be allowed
to practice surgery.

393
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:41,194
We can make that happen.

394
00:20:41,722 --> 00:20:43,591
It is incumbent
upon us to do so.

395
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,637
Like I said,
I need a minute.

396
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:48,164
All right?

397
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:50,879
All right.

398
00:20:58,964 --> 00:21:01,350
Nichelle, I'm gonna follow your
lead and speak truth to power.

399
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,928
- Conrad...
- I don't think you're telling me

400
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,317
everything I need to know.

401
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:05,964
And I'm worried that
whatever you're holding back

402
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:07,380
is putting you at risk.

403
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:10,934
It's okay.
You can tell me.

404
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,692
I can't feel my legs.

405
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:21,606
Can you feel that?

406
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:24,161
- You feel that?
- No.

407
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:30,505
Lesions in L3-L4.

408
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:33,553
That's the cause of the lower
extremity paralysis.

409
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:36,507
Histo only causes spinal lesions
in the immunocompromised.

410
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:38,177
Which the patient is not.

411
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:39,459
We're dealing
with something else.

412
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:42,295
My gut says infection, but our
work didn't turn up anything.

413
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,365
I still think she's not
telling me something.

414
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:45,810
And it may end up killing her.

415
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:48,927
Well, I'll leave the detective
work to you two smarty-pants.

416
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,606
Right now, our future governor
needs a spinal decompression

417
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:53,692
so her paralysis
doesn't become permanent.

418
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:04,084
Hey.

419
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:05,345
- There you are.
- Hey.

420
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:09,029
I have, uh, concerns
about this bypass thing.

421
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:10,606
- Okay.
- So, you're telling me

422
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:14,131
you're not just gonna run
my blood through the machine

423
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:17,138
but you have to...
have to stop my heart, too?

424
00:22:17,223 --> 00:22:18,255
Yes. The bypass

425
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,550
will act as your heart and lungs

426
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:21,010
- while we remove the clot.
- Okay. So,

427
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:24,013
what happens
if my heart doesn't, um,

428
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:25,795
start back up again?

429
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,490
Oh, well,
in that very remote possibility,

430
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:31,645
we would do everything we can
to get your heart beating again.

431
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:33,373
- "Remote possibility."
- Mm-hmm.

432
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:35,037
That isn't reassuring, okay?

433
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:36,841
I don't know if you've noticed,

434
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:38,402
but, uh...

435
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:42,911
but remote possibilities
tend to happen

436
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:44,567
- to me.
- Hey.

437
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:47,628
Forgive him.
It's just been a rough year.

438
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,982
First it was
the emergency back surgery

439
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:52,137
and then his COVID infection,
and now this.

440
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:55,185
I must be
the unluckiest man alive.

441
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,108
- Mr. Mullins?
- Sweetheart?

442
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:59,358
- - What's going on?
- He may be having a stroke.

443
00:22:59,442 --> 00:23:01,234
- Excuse me. I'll up his oxygen.
- Oh.

444
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:07,631
All right, his pupils are
still reactive, but he's lost

445
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:09,801
tone on his left side.
He needs a head CT.

446
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,731
We need to page Cain.

447
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:19,401
Hey.

448
00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:21,958
Holy crap.

449
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:23,906
What are you doing
lurking out here?

450
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:25,771
Well, I-I was actually
lurking inside.

451
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:27,724
Just out of sight.

452
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:30,365
I didn't want
to throw you off your game.

453
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,007
The bouncer told me
you come back here between sets.

454
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:35,059
Just thought I'd

455
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:36,357
come see what you were up to.

456
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:38,661
Seriously? 20 years go by,

457
00:23:38,746 --> 00:23:41,013
and you just thought
you'd come see what I'm up to?

458
00:23:41,098 --> 00:23:43,216
What do...
what do you want, 'Dolph?

459
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:45,497
So, how's-how's your mother?

460
00:23:45,645 --> 00:23:47,638
She's doing well.
She... Over you, finally.

461
00:23:47,723 --> 00:23:49,139
Listen, I've got
a lot of friends inside,

462
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:51,536
so if we could just get to it,
whatever it is?

463
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,281
Yeah. Of... Yeah. Of course.

464
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:58,031
Uh, like a lot of people,

465
00:23:58,216 --> 00:24:00,887
the pandemic has forced me
to reevaluate things,

466
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:03,247
and I realize I've...

467
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:07,247
I put my professional
and financial life

468
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:12,200
ahead of my relationships,
and I'm-I'm so sorry for that.

469
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:15,419
I've seen a lot of people die
this year, Jake.

470
00:24:16,786 --> 00:24:20,365
Some alone.
Others surrounded by loved ones.

471
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,839
Oh.

472
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,755
You're here because
y-you're scared of dying alone.

473
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,011
No.

474
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:29,732
- That's not why I'm here.
- But it's totally on brand.

475
00:24:29,817 --> 00:24:31,037
Oh, that's not entirely fair.

476
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:32,492
We had a lot
of wonderful times together.

477
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:34,567
I-I... And I-I blew it.

478
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:37,162
There's no way
around that. I-I...

479
00:24:39,497 --> 00:24:41,318
I cared for you, and I blew it.

480
00:24:41,403 --> 00:24:43,653
No, if you cared for me,
you would've stayed in touch.

481
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:45,988
Go find somebody else
to hold your hand while you die.

482
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,904
I already mourned losing you.

483
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:02,591
Ben Mullins has
a clotting disorder

484
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:05,364
that is threatening his heart,
lungs and now his brain.

485
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:06,682
This is your fault.

486
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,632
I know the hierarchy
between you two is fluid,

487
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,927
but I will not be spoken to
that way by a resident.

488
00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:12,271
Two things, bro,

489
00:25:12,356 --> 00:25:14,795
Dr. Okafor
is no ordinary resident,

490
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,631
and she happens to be right.

491
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:18,623
- This is on you.
- No, it's on the patient,

492
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:20,448
who was advised
of the risks.

493
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:22,749
And last time I checked,
I didn't unleash a pandemic

494
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,982
- on the world.
- Mm-hmm. Deny it all you want,

495
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,881
but you will be held responsible
for this.

496
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:29,294
Logan Kim isn't here
to protect you anymore.

497
00:25:29,512 --> 00:25:30,779
Hey.

498
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:33,380
Let's just, uh,
take a breath, all right?

499
00:25:38,981 --> 00:25:41,013
He had a stroke in his
nondominant frontal lobe.

500
00:25:41,098 --> 00:25:42,395
All right.

501
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,989
Well, looks like we can
proceed with the surgery.

502
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,295
The blood thinners he's on
should be adequate

503
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,146
to treat the clot,
but we need you to be on standby

504
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:51,888
in case there's
hemorrhagic transformation

505
00:25:51,973 --> 00:25:53,722
and the vessel bursts.

506
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:55,770
Always here
when you need me.

507
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,762
You'd both do well
to remember that.

508
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,012
Dr. Voss?

509
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:23,844
Kit, what's going on down there?

510
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,843
Better if I show you.

511
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,271
Nichelle has something
on her skin

512
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:38,864
that looks like shingles.

513
00:26:39,317 --> 00:26:40,864
You have shingles, too.

514
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:44,701
- Why?
- I don't know. Coincidence?

515
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:46,920
It's a symptom of something
you and Nichelle caught

516
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,623
when you were
out of town together.

517
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:51,115
- I'm guessing nowhere near Kentucky.
- I'm her driver.

518
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:52,935
- All right? That's all.
- Yeah, no, of course.

519
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:56,060
That being said, she's gonna die
unless I get the truth.

520
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:03,770
We were in the Caribbean.

521
00:27:04,614 --> 00:27:05,778
Jamaica.

522
00:27:07,684 --> 00:27:10,045
Are the meds you're taking
for the shingles working?

523
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,536
Not really. Why?

524
00:27:11,621 --> 00:27:14,442
Because I know what you both
have now, and it's not shingles.

525
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:34,810
All right.

526
00:27:34,895 --> 00:27:37,653
A massive clot removed
and a beating heart.

527
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:40,176
I say it's a beautiful day
in the OR.

528
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:43,424
Intracranial pressure

529
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:44,641
is rising.

530
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:51,616
- Pupils are blown.
- He's brain-hemorrhaging.

531
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,670
And herniating.
He doesn't have much time.

532
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,818
- Somebody call Cain.
- He's already here.

533
00:27:56,903 --> 00:27:58,067
Elevate the head,

534
00:27:58,152 --> 00:28:00,723
reverse the blood thinners,
prep for a craniotomy.

535
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,364
Incision.

536
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:27,373
Intracranial
pressure is up to 60.

537
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:28,615
I know how high it is.

538
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,458
Ready to enter the skull. Drill?

539
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:08,474
Blood pressure's rising fast.

540
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,677
What's going
on up there, Cain?

541
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:11,155
I stopped the bleed,
but he's still herniating.

542
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,467
- How is that possible?
- He's bleeding

543
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:13,973
from a place where I can't see.

544
00:29:14,137 --> 00:29:15,653
Other side of the brain.

545
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,233
- Ultrasound?
- Aren't you supposed

546
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:18,999
to drill a hole
in the other side of the skull?

547
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:21,355
No, he doesn't have
the time for two craniotomies.

548
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:23,132
I'm gonna pass the needle
from this side of the brain

549
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:24,525
to the other
to remove the blood.

550
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,476
You can't blindly poke
a needle through the sides

551
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,937
- of his brain. You'll kill him.
- I don't blindly operate,

552
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:31,161
and nobody asked
for your permission.

553
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:34,736
Yo, have you ever
done this before?

554
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:36,403
Nope. Never.

555
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,020
We need to stop this.

556
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:43,147
If we do, the patient will die.

557
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:45,310
Listen to your mentor, Okafor.

558
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:46,997
Stay in your lane.

559
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,325
Blood pressure's dropping.

560
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:53,248
Time to go to work.

561
00:30:11,825 --> 00:30:12,981
BP stabilized.

562
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:32,989
You're going to protect Cain.

563
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,926
He's done so much harm.

564
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:38,506
Yeah, but in his mind, he's just
doing whatever he can do

565
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:40,884
to survive in a system
that's been rigged against us.

566
00:30:40,968 --> 00:30:45,439
So you think systemic racism
excuses his behavior?

567
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:47,161
No.

568
00:30:47,403 --> 00:30:49,106
But it does explain it.

569
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,357
The frustration,
the-the pain, the anger

570
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:56,763
that builds up,
knowing that in this country,

571
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:59,069
your life can go south
at any moment

572
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:02,339
just because of the melanin
in your skin.

573
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:05,617
Now, I was raised not
to let the unfairness

574
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:08,200
of discrimination consume me.

575
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:09,985
But if Cain wasn't taught that,

576
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,161
can you blame him
for how he turned out?

577
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:14,216
I mean, what else do you expect?

578
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:16,333
I wasn't born in this country,

579
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:19,348
so my experience and history
with racism is different,

580
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:21,517
but this is
a mistake.

581
00:31:21,824 --> 00:31:24,302
I believe
Cain can be redeemed.

582
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:27,255
You're wrong.
People don't change.

583
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:30,692
Okay, well,
here's the bottom line.

584
00:31:30,777 --> 00:31:32,811
I've listened
to your input, Mina,

585
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:34,419
but at the end of the day,

586
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:37,153
it's my decision
whether to report him or not.

587
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:39,332
Not yours.

588
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:42,059
And I need you to respect that.

589
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:47,239
Are you asking me as m...
As my colleague or my boyfriend?

590
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:52,816
- Does it matter?
- What you do matters to me.

591
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:02,484
- How did it go with Jake?
<i>- Not well.</i>

592
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:04,486
- Oh, I'm sorry, Randolph.
<i>- You know, I've always</i>

593
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,770
felt guilty about leaving him.

594
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:10,033
And...
He needed a father.

595
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:13,902
<i>And I'm not so sure
about the choices he's made.</i>

596
00:32:13,987 --> 00:32:15,825
- Can you do anything about it?
<i>- No, he's...</i>

597
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,028
He's a grown man, he's moved on.

598
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:23,029
And I think my chance to have
any positive impact on him

599
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:24,738
- has passed me by.
<i>- You can't give up</i>

600
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:26,114
<i>so easily, Randolph.</i>

601
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,524
Put up a fight.

602
00:32:27,872 --> 00:32:29,344
Oh, I have to hang up.

603
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:32,630
It's time to ambush
the CEO of Red Rock.

604
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:34,908
<i>- What?</i>
- And your lunch

605
00:32:34,993 --> 00:32:37,926
is at 12:30 and...
Sir, I'll call security.

606
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:40,891
It's okay. Dr. Voss
isn't here to hurt me.

607
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:42,694
Although, given her mastery
of the spine,

608
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:44,301
I'm sure she could.

609
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,904
Listen, I'm sorry you got
the cold shoulder all day,

610
00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:49,208
but my assistant,
she's a bit overprotective.

611
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:51,854
All will be forgiven
if you answer one question:

612
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:54,481
Who's replacing
Logan Kim as CEO?

613
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:57,971
Chastain isn't
getting a new CEO.

614
00:32:58,056 --> 00:32:59,732
I don't understand.
Someone has to be in charge.

615
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:01,778
Who's gonna
run the hospital?

616
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:07,051
<i>Dr. Voss expects</i>

617
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:08,926
you'll be up
and walking again soon.

618
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:10,403
She said I had lesions
on my spine.

619
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,903
Please tell me you
know what I have.

620
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:12,771
We do.

621
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:15,012
You have a parasitic worm
called a Schistosoma.

622
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:17,533
And your spinal lesion biopsy
confirmed it.

623
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:19,317
They're usually found in places

624
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:24,020
like the Middle East,
Southeast Asia, the Caribbean.

625
00:33:25,215 --> 00:33:26,301
The Caribbean?

626
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:27,748
Do you have any idea
how lucky you are

627
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:29,700
that we had the time
and the patience

628
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:31,575
to figure out
what was going wrong with you

629
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,128
before your organs failed,
despite...

630
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:34,556
- Devon.
- No, no, no.

631
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:35,989
She needs to hear this.

632
00:33:36,418 --> 00:33:37,747
You lied to us.

633
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,511
We have sick people out there
who need our attention,

634
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:42,589
but we were stuck here wading
through your nonsense.

635
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:43,926
Let me talk to her.

636
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:54,606
We put you on antiparasitics
for the next four weeks.

637
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,770
James is on them, too.

638
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:08,255
Keeping secrets from
your doctors can kill you.

639
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,506
I don't want you to think
I'm just another politician

640
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,426
who had an affair.

641
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:13,045
- I am not here to judge you.
- Well, that's what

642
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:15,381
people do unless
you give them context.

643
00:34:16,411 --> 00:34:18,954
You know, I represent
the district I grew up in

644
00:34:19,038 --> 00:34:20,038
in Atlanta.

645
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:21,623
I love my people.

646
00:34:21,707 --> 00:34:23,533
And I've been able to
make a difference where change

647
00:34:23,617 --> 00:34:24,895
is hard to come by.

648
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:28,129
At first,
my husband understood that.

649
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:30,443
When we met,
he was an NFL megastar

650
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,801
and I was a judge
in small-claims court.

651
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,223
Now no one asks him
about football.

652
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:38,044
They ask him what it's like
to be married to me.

653
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:40,708
And his ego
can't handle that.

654
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,669
But James...

655
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:45,708
Yeah?

656
00:34:45,972 --> 00:34:48,716
He'd love to tell people what
it's like to be married to you.

657
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:51,987
Yes, sir.

658
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:54,137
He's a good man, my James.

659
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:57,684
While my husband might not
sleep with me anymore,

660
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:59,211
but he will do
a press conference tomorrow

661
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:01,638
and say, "My wife is stronger
than half the men

662
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:04,098
I played football with.
No bug's gonna stop her."

663
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:07,843
But if I was outed as unfaithful
to Atlanta's favorite son,

664
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,989
I would never make it
to the governor's mansion.

665
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,467
You know we're duty bound
to keep

666
00:35:11,552 --> 00:35:12,994
your personal life
confidential.

667
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,547
I know.

668
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:18,348
But it will get out eventually.

669
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:29,825
Can you ask James to
come in here?

670
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:47,130
She almost died
keeping a secret.

671
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:48,887
Anything you want to tell me?

672
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,203
After the memorial,
I went to the hospital

673
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,614
where my dad died.

674
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:59,583
I found the resident
that took care of him.

675
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:04,267
It was a good guy,
reminded me of you actually.

676
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,653
They were understaffed,
too few vents.

677
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:13,108
One nurse for every
ten patients.

678
00:36:13,193 --> 00:36:14,902
We have one nurse
for every two patients.

679
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:16,583
They intubated him.

680
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:19,294
He was stable until,
like, 2:00 a.m.

681
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:22,387
His sat dropped,
heart rate started to slow.

682
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:23,739
Ten minutes went by.

683
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:25,909
And when they finally
got to him, he was gone.

684
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:27,497
Cardiac arrest.

685
00:36:28,258 --> 00:36:30,585
My father, he died alone

686
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,140
because his public hospital,
in a poor brown neighborhood,

687
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:35,389
didn't have enough resources
to save him.

688
00:36:37,132 --> 00:36:38,929
I'm so, so sorry, man.

689
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,593
When the,
when the resident was...

690
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:01,530
When he was rereading his notes,

691
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:05,662
he started to cry.

692
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:07,046
And I said to him,

693
00:37:07,568 --> 00:37:10,568
"Hey, l-look, we all have
that patient we know

694
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:12,929
we could have saved."

695
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:14,495
And he said to me,

696
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:18,768
"If only it had just been one."

697
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:20,971
There had been dozens.

698
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:35,316
We'll continue to monitor him
but, uh, his prognosis is good.

699
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,561
Dr. Cain said the same thing.

700
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:40,403
He stopped by.

701
00:37:41,243 --> 00:37:43,807
His words were
such a comfort.

702
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:50,346
We are indebted to him, to all
of you, for saving Ben's life.

703
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:57,596
Mrs. Mullins, there's something
you should know.

704
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:12,143
You went behind my back
and told the Mullins about Cain.

705
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:14,424
- I explicitly told you not to.
- Oh.

706
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:15,565
Now they're suing.

707
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,949
You weren't listening to reason.

708
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:18,487
I was listening to my gut.

709
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:20,893
Which tells me to believe
in Cain's redemption.

710
00:38:20,978 --> 00:38:22,316
You don't get to override that,
Mina.

711
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,365
Barrett Cain broke the first
tenet of our profession,

712
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:25,838
"do no harm."

713
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:27,300
He shouldn't be allowed
to practice medicine.

714
00:38:27,384 --> 00:38:29,823
I did you a favor.
I did us all a favor.

715
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,609
You didn't do anybody
a favor.

716
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,436
You just carried out
your own verdict

717
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,068
in Mina's kangaroo court.

718
00:38:35,153 --> 00:38:37,129
And you
disrespected me.

719
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:41,713
If you're looking for me
to apologize,

720
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:44,597
that's not happening.

721
00:38:46,138 --> 00:38:48,651
You know, by my count,
it's been nine

722
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:51,612
consecutive nights of
soul-stirring sex

723
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:53,612
- and unparalleled conversation.
- Mm.

724
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:55,791
And, though I will deny
ever saying this,

725
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:57,461
my back hurts.

726
00:38:57,632 --> 00:38:58,824
Are you suggesting
we take a break?

727
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:01,201
- Yes.
- Agreed.

728
00:39:01,854 --> 00:39:02,924
Two nights.

729
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:04,366
Three.

730
00:39:06,395 --> 00:39:07,495
Agreed.

731
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,690
Rest your back
and reconsider your actions.

732
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:13,713
Yeah.
And you reconsider, too.

733
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,205
New driver, huh?

734
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:30,416
Can't move forward
without change.

735
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,416
But good news.

736
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:36,291
Senator Buxton freed up
some federal money

737
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:39,295
for our childcare needs,
so not a bad day's work.

738
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:41,002
I'll mention that to Bianca.

739
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:43,409
Trust me, somewhere
in Atlanta there is a girl

740
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:44,894
named Bianca with two kids

741
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:47,038
who can't afford
to take care of them.

742
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:52,073
Thank you for everything.

743
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:55,182
Best of luck to you, Conrad.

744
00:39:58,573 --> 00:40:00,752
Best of luck to you, Nichelle.

745
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,953
Oh, what the hell, man?

746
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:12,901
How do you go from absent
ex-stepfather

747
00:40:12,986 --> 00:40:14,096
to shameless groupie...

748
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:15,519
I'm here because
I want to be here,

749
00:40:15,603 --> 00:40:17,276
and because there's something
I need to say to you.

750
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,663
You needed a father,
and I dropped the ball.

751
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:21,832
You're a very
talented musician.

752
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:23,016
- Thanks.
- You know,

753
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,301
having said that, I know
it's-it's hard to make a living

754
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,587
in the music business no matter...

755
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:29,832
- without a lot of luck.
- Okay, this is priceless.

756
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:31,611
You know, I don't know how you
supplement your passion,

757
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,766
but I'd... I would like to help.

758
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,587
The thing is,
I don't need your help.

759
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:38,829
I play music to relieve stress.
I'm a surgeon.

760
00:40:40,226 --> 00:40:41,876
Plastics and ENT.

761
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:45,806
I...

762
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:46,946
I googled you.

763
00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:48,493
I use Wong,
my mother's maiden name,

764
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:49,633
for my medical practice.

765
00:40:49,718 --> 00:40:52,782
She is the one who put me
through medical school.

766
00:40:56,249 --> 00:40:57,834
Don't do that.

767
00:40:58,008 --> 00:40:59,876
- What?
- Smile

768
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:03,344
like you had any influence on
my decision to go into medicine.

769
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:15,290
I'm glad Devon finally
opened up to you.

770
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,930
You're a good friend.

771
00:41:17,043 --> 00:41:19,494
Oh, it's devastating.

772
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:21,844
- I hate that he's going through this.
- Mm.

773
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:26,688
Promise me,
let's never run for office.

774
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:30,329
Or become sports icons.

775
00:41:32,045 --> 00:41:34,679
And let's never, ever
keep secrets from each other.

776
00:41:35,824 --> 00:41:39,278
Right. No. Never.

777
00:41:42,314 --> 00:41:45,975
What is it?
You look adorably insane.

778
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:48,927
Well, in the spirit
of excellent rules

779
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:50,801
for a healthy marriage,

780
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,434
there's something
I have to tell you.

781
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:57,129
Okay.

782
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:05,692
I'm pregnant.

783
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,506
What? How?

784
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:11,989
Four years of medical school

785
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:13,216
and you still don't know
how this works?

786
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,622
I didn't know
we pulled the goalie.

787
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:17,223
We didn't. I know.
It's-it's...

00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:19,450
