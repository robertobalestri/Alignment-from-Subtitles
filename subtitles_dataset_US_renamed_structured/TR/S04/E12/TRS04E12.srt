2
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:04,313
Mom, we need to get you back
to Chastain.

3
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:08,102
Your mother has lung cancer.
You cannot come

4
00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:10,031
to Nigeria with me.

5
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:12,517
- I do want your job.
- I wouldn't want a resident who didn't.

6
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,235
We're cut from the same cloth.
No hidden agendas.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,593
There have been some
developments in gene therapy.

8
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:20,347
Recent clinical trials
with good outcomes.

9
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:21,855
These are uncharted waters.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,226
A lot of hospitals won't
risk hosting our trials.

11
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:25,851
It's gonna be a long, hard road.

12
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:28,102
- And nothing is guaranteed, Rose.
- But I have a chance?

13
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:29,375
Well, you have more than just

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,420
a chance,
you have a damn good chance.

00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:49,449
I am.

21
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:51,486
I was also just
enjoying the view.

22
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:54,104
Okay.

23
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:56,129
But your mani-pedi appointment

24
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,120
is on the other side of town
from your pregnancy message.

25
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:00,237
We got to plan it out if we want
to hit everything today.

26
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:01,869
You just finished
a night shift.

27
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:03,303
Are you sure
you're not too tired?

28
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:05,948
To knock out
a pre-baby bucket list

29
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,209
with my glowing wife?

30
00:01:09,098 --> 00:01:10,340
- Never.
- Mm.

31
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:14,750
You can say no if you want,
because it's your day.

32
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,468
But what if we make
a pit stop at home?

33
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:21,190
Someone told me alone time
will be hard to come by

34
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:23,275
- once the baby is born.
- Hmm.

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,854
I will definitely consider it.

36
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,645
Mm, good.

37
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,759
Then let's get
the hell out of here.

38
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:32,067
Oh, you want to see
the new baby picture?

39
00:01:32,152 --> 00:01:33,345
Of course.

40
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,642
Aw, another sonogram.

41
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:36,833
Let me see.

42
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:38,801
Aw, it's a fat little potato

43
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:39,736
with fists.

44
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:41,520
Did you just call my child
a fat little potato?

45
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:43,517
A cute, fat little potato.

46
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:45,775
- Thank you.
- I don't think that's a compliment.

47
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,509
No, I was thanking her
for helping

48
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:49,567
- plan our day.
- A fabulous nail studio,

49
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:52,737
a massage to die for
and I got you off the wait list

50
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,737
at Marino's Steak House.
You have a table at 8:00.

51
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:56,405
You are the best.

52
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,823
Why don't you come meet us?

53
00:01:57,908 --> 00:02:00,041
No way. Conrad wants you
all to his lonesome.

54
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:01,822
Yes, I do.

55
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:03,499
- And I'm here till midnight.
- Oh, God.

56
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:04,993
Have fun.

57
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:08,436
- No, no, no, no, no, no, we're leaving.
- Wait, what's up?

58
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:10,775
My shift is over
and you're on maternity leave.

59
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,434
Hang on,
what's going on?

60
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:14,943
Mr. Goldense canceled
his appointment,

61
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:16,150
third time this year.

62
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:19,114
And I've called,
but it only goes to machine.

63
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,720
You're the only one
he'll talk to.

64
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:22,154
Nic, don't do it.

65
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,791
Oh, come on,
you know, Pete Goldense.

66
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:26,761
History of A-fib.
He has cardiac meds

67
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,162
that need close monitoring.

68
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:30,017
We can go check it out.
It's not a problem.

69
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:33,496
You're impossible.

70
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:36,345
- It'll take two seconds.
- Okay.

71
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,486
I wonder if it'll be this

72
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:40,288
hard to say no
to our daughter.

73
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:42,955
- Probably.
- Yep.

74
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,564
Here's the problem, Dr. Voss.

75
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:48,315
We're still far in the red,

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,428
north of $25 million.

77
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:53,013
Well, the numbers are trending
in the right direction.

78
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:55,681
When I took over,
we were $35 million in the red.

79
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:58,767
No one wants to put a price
on saving lives.

80
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:00,670
But as CEO, you must.

81
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:03,316
I am not like other CEOs.

82
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,717
Which is why you hired me.

83
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,480
And now we're beginning
to question the wisdom

84
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:09,439
of putting someone with no
business experience at the helm.

85
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:12,697
You need to find more cuts,
Dr. Voss.

86
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:14,373
And we don't mean pennies.

87
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,699
We mean millions.

88
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,697
This isn't coming from me
or the board, Kit.

89
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,119
We're getting pressure
from the state.

90
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:25,346
They have given us...
And by "us," I mean you...

91
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,048
Two weeks to come up
with big solutions.

92
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:38,622
You okay?

93
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:41,302
Come take a look at this.

94
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:48,370
This was the scan
from my mother's diagnosis,

95
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:50,873
when she was stage IV
with pleural mets.

96
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:51,864
Mm-hmm.

97
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:53,542
And this...

98
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:56,127
is today.

99
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:58,795
Wow, that much progression?

100
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,874
Her lung cancer
is highly aggressive.

101
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,197
So sorry. I, um...

102
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:06,098
Has she started chemo?

103
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:09,452
She watched her father die
of cancer.

104
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:13,127
She remembers vomiting
and constant nausea.

105
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,138
He was in pain for months
until he died.

106
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,775
She is terrified of chemo.

107
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,561
Well, they do much better

108
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:23,414
managing side effects
these days.

109
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:26,168
Surgery's not an option.

110
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:28,706
There's only one hope left.

111
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:31,363
Well, targeted therapy.

112
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:35,267
It could buy my mother years
if she's a candidate.

113
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:38,736
We're waiting
for the genetics now.

114
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,244
Well, just, it's...
Keep me updated.

115
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,518
Yeah.

116
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:56,923
Hi.

117
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,259
Hey.

118
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:00,720
I've got a birthday present
for you.

119
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,314
Mm. My birthday isn't
until June.

120
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,517
Well, this is your new birthday.

121
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:10,092
500 million
genetically modified cells

122
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,777
ready to change your life

123
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:14,923
by making healthy
red blood cells in your body.

124
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,778
If we're lucky.

125
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,775
I know it's experimental and
there are no guarantees, but...

126
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:24,924
I can't believe
I have this chance.

127
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,073
Is there anyone you want to call

128
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,961
or FaceTime
for the big moment?

129
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,095
Friends? Family?

130
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,976
No.

131
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:35,768
Dr. Cain?

132
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:39,654
He, um...

133
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,478
hasn't been by for a while.

134
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,500
I'm sure he's busy.

135
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:48,074
Well, this is a really big deal.

136
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:52,273
You went through a lot
to get to this moment.

137
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,259
I wouldn't be here without you.

138
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,634
Rose...

139
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:08,947
...would you like
to do the honors?

140
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:33,212
Please work.

143
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:53,603
We started her gene therapy
an hour ago.

144
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:54,688
Now we wait.

145
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,957
Is she strong? Is she ready?

146
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,948
She's been through
a massive chemo blast

147
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,216
that devastated her bone marrow.

148
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,435
She's nauseous.
Her counts are dropping.

149
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,778
Her mouth sores are so bad
she can barely swallow.

150
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:06,882
So is she strong? No.

151
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,041
But she is the bravest person
I've ever known,

152
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:10,635
and she's ready.

153
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,141
Look, man,
Bio South is running on fumes.

154
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,977
Uh, we need cash,
and we won't get a new investor

155
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:22,146
if Rose has a bad outcome, so...

156
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:23,981
Everything is riding on this.

157
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,977
Look, if this works,
we stand to get FDA approval.

158
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:28,244
And then sky's the limit.

159
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,314
Thousands of other patients
with sickle cell disease

160
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:32,548
would line up
for this treatment.

161
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:34,517
And if it fails?

162
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,322
The company will shutter.

163
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:40,697
I will be bankrupt.

164
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,830
And Rose will have risked
her life for nothing.

165
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,607
You recommended me
to Dr. Wylie.

166
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,021
Yeah, she was in the market
for a... promising resident.

167
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:05,724
But you said
that I could work with you,

168
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,455
that we were a pair,

169
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,798
cut from the same cloth.

170
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:10,400
You need more practice.

171
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,360
And I'm focusing on my recovery.

172
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:18,730
You're not gonna get your skills
back hiding in this office.

173
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:20,122
I'm being cautious.

174
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:21,872
The last time I was in the OR,

175
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:23,708
you had to step in there
to save my ass.

176
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:25,710
Can't ignore that.

177
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:28,162
So you start with a softball,

178
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:30,132
something simple you used to do
in your sleep.

179
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:32,274
Can't afford another fumble.

180
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:34,136
Kit's gonna send me packing.

181
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,971
I have to know that,
when I come back,

182
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:38,597
my work is gonna be perfect.

183
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:45,137
Dr. Wylie is nowhere near
the surgeon you are.

184
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,565
I want to learn from the best.

185
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:55,580
Caution's not a good look
on you.

186
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:05,501
In case you don't remember,
Pete's not the easiest guy.

187
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:08,385
Took the gold medal
in the curmudgeon Olympics.

188
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,298
Well, if it doesn't take too
long, we can stay on schedule.

189
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,335
Hey, Pete! It's Nic

190
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,429
from Chastain.
I'm here with Dr. Hawkins.

191
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:20,088
Came to check on you.

192
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:21,650
We're worried that you missed
your appointment.

193
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,884
I'll survive.

194
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:27,431
You know your cardiac medication
needs monitoring.

195
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:28,857
Come on, Pete.
We'll do a quick check

196
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:31,275
and then you won't have to go
to the hospital.

197
00:09:35,097 --> 00:09:37,198
Put those masks and gloves on.

198
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:41,118
Okay.

199
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,529
You know, if you'd get
the COVID-19 vaccine,

200
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:45,874
you wouldn't have
to be so nervous about guests.

201
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,774
I have no need.

202
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:49,943
I have no risk of exposure.

203
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,870
I see no one.

204
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,623
It's Middle-earth.

205
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:54,873
Needs a dragon.

206
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:58,527
You all right?

207
00:09:58,612 --> 00:09:59,879
Yeah.

208
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:01,873
How long since
you've been out of your house?

209
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:03,267
Over a year.

210
00:10:04,056 --> 00:10:05,375
How you feeling, Pete?

211
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,791
I just woke up
from a nap, so a little groggy.

212
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:14,353
The good news is I can take naps
whenever I damn well please.

213
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,002
I see the judgment
in your faces. Proves my point.

214
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,005
You've never known real freedom
till you lock your door.

215
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:22,696
Look, no judgment.

216
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:24,841
We're just worried about you.

217
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,366
You're a little out of breath.

218
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:28,325
Why don't you
let us check you out,

219
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:29,993
just make sure
nothing serious, okay?

220
00:10:32,037 --> 00:10:33,078
Okay.

221
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:34,839
- All right.
- But first,

222
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,182
let me get something to drink.

223
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,338
- I'm thirsty.
- No, no, that's okay.

224
00:10:37,422 --> 00:10:39,211
I'll-I'll get you some water.

225
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,181
Fridge is close to empty.

226
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:02,785
Pulse is irregular and rapid.

227
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:04,818
Crackles at the bases.

228
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:06,344
Oh...

229
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:08,280
Hey.

230
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,378
You having
trouble wearing shoes?

231
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,047
When you don't go anywhere,
you don't need shoes.

232
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:16,180
Distended neck veins.

233
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:17,441
Sorry, Pete, but we're gonna

234
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:19,081
have to get you
to Chastain after all.

235
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,275
No.

236
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:22,702
- You can't make me go.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

237
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:24,638
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

238
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:27,308
Pete?

239
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,363
- Calling 911.
- Pete?

240
00:11:36,222 --> 00:11:39,281
You'd work much quicker
if you had gloves that fit.

241
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:42,323
What is this,
the JNCO jeans of surgical wear?

242
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:45,651
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Devi,
did we get you the wrong size gloves?

243
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:46,911
It's totally okay.

244
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,648
It is not totally okay.

245
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,867
Speak up for yourself.

246
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:53,001
A six and a half
would be great next time.

247
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:55,994
You got it. I think we're just
so used to prepping the OR

248
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:57,829
for Dr. Austin and Dr. Okafor...

249
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:01,091
And how would you think
that she could even fit in Mina's gloves?

250
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:03,587
Look at this one-handed tie.

251
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,755
Sloppy at best.

252
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,514
Criminal at worst.

253
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:10,509
And whenever we would do
a bypass,

254
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,763
Dr. Okafor and I chose
the pedicled approach.

255
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:15,765
That means there is a bit
to clean up,

256
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:20,352
so I would throw a stitch
and Mina would cut my suture.

257
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:22,187
Not there. Higher.

258
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,856
No, that's too high. Lower.

259
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,100
Like this?

260
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:28,527
Would you steady
your hands, Devi?

261
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:31,372
This is not a cadaver.
It's a father of three.

262
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,210
Damn it!
You cut the vessel I needed.

263
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:37,776
I'm sorry, Dr. Austin.

264
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:39,869
Is an apology
gonna console his children?

265
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:41,682
Small vascular clamp
and 8.0 Prolene.

266
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:43,926
Not to her.
To me.

267
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:47,409
I have to learn.

268
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:50,882
You stay, you watch...
or you leave.

269
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:52,616
It's your call.

270
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:17,158
Like this.

271
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,792
Nothing more satisfying than
teaching the important stuff

272
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:28,580
to young residents.

273
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:34,215
The day isn't going great.

274
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,268
I messed up in the OR
with Raptor,

275
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:39,987
and he yelled at me,
again.

276
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:41,681
Did you kill someone?

277
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:44,452
- No.
- Then don't worry about it.

278
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:47,847
I don't like to be humiliated.

279
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,010
It wasn't about you,
I promise.

280
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,158
He's under a lot of pressure
right now, a family thing.

281
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:56,331
Believe me, he's on a razor's
edge for a good reason.

282
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,417
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,627
So what's the hospital's CEO
doing in here, anyway?

284
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:07,442
Bit of a challenging day
on my end, as well.

285
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:09,698
The supply room
is a known resource

286
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:10,855
when you're at your wit's end.

287
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:13,048
It's quiet, private,
lots of pillows.

288
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,545
Come on, come with me.
I'll get you into another OR.

289
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:20,807
Dr. Austin isn't the only
fine surgeon at Chastain.

290
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,682
Dr. Voss?

291
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,973
I would love to work
with you sometime.

292
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:30,077
Well, if my ass isn't fired
shortly, we'll arrange it.

293
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,461
Come on.

294
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:36,146
Hey, Cindy. What happened?
You paged?

295
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:38,512
She has an elevated temp. 100.1.

296
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:41,718
- And she's tachy.
- Yeah.

297
00:14:41,803 --> 00:14:42,878
Hey, Rose?

298
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:44,472
Can you tell me
how you're feeling?

299
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:46,557
Tired, a little hot.

300
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:48,491
Let's give her a gram
of acetaminophen

301
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:50,614
and bolus her a liter
of lactated ringers.

302
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,035
Okay.

303
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:55,424
It doesn't hurt anywhere.

304
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,945
It's not like a pain
I've felt before.

305
00:14:58,095 --> 00:14:59,761
But I don't feel good.

306
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:03,265
It couldn't be
the gene therapy, could it?

307
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,175
I don't know yet.

308
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:08,753
We'll give you some fluid and
order a set of blood cultures.

309
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:12,403
I thought there was nothing left
that could scare me.

310
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,247
Whatever happens,
we'll manage it.

311
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,926
It's not that.

312
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:20,177
I know what it is to be sick.

313
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:24,582
But hope?

314
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:30,112
When I pressed that button,

315
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:32,028
it's what I felt.

316
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:36,247
And I haven't felt that
in so long.

317
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:38,473
I don't want to lose it.

318
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:49,877
65-year-old male with syncope
and blunt abdominal trauma.

319
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:51,779
All right,
let's put him in Bay Two.

320
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:54,847
BP 90/50,
heart rate 130 and irregular.

321
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:57,141
02 sat 95%.

322
00:15:58,637 --> 00:16:01,395
I fell on a chair. So what?

323
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:04,045
I thought you two were spending
a day away from sick people.

324
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,298
Well, best-laid plans...

325
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:06,979
- One, two, three.
- Three.

326
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,325
Nothing good can come of this.

327
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,743
Told you.

328
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:15,337
I'll order an EKG and labs.

329
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:17,122
Crackles halfway up.

330
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:19,192
- I need an X-ray stat.
- Yeah.

331
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:21,468
- And I might have to intubate.
- Okay.

332
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:24,071
Pete,

333
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:26,823
this isn't good,
and we have to fix it.

334
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:31,061
Tenderness and guarding
in the right upper quadrant.

335
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:41,271
Damn it. Free fluid.

336
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:46,427
He's on blood thinners
that weren't being monitored.

337
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:49,496
And now he's bleeding
into his abdomen.

338
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:06,380
Dr. Wylie already has
three residents.

339
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:10,559
Yep. And I told
you I didn't want the gig.

340
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:17,535
I need you and only you,
for a softball.

341
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:22,074
Aneurysm clip, OR 7,
in 15 minutes.

342
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:32,753
Dr. Wylie?

343
00:17:32,838 --> 00:17:34,171
I'm gonna have to pass.

344
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,282
Dr. Cain has requested me.

345
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:51,871
Hey. What's going on with Rose?

346
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:53,843
Elevated temps.
She's tachycardic.

347
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,301
Her blood pressure is dropping.

348
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:57,744
I called in her oncologist
to examine her.

349
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:03,537
- How is she?
- Responding to fluids.

350
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:04,706
Stable for now.

351
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:07,137
If this is
a systemic inflammatory reaction

352
00:18:07,222 --> 00:18:09,683
from the cells,
we support her through it,

353
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:11,334
and she should improve soon.

354
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:16,715
Okay. I'll keep an eye on her.

355
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,629
Okay, I have to see
another patient,

356
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:20,879
but tell me if anything changes.

357
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:23,006
Thank you.

358
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:30,056
Yee, if you don't sit down...

359
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:31,817
Your cancer is getting worse.

360
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:35,237
When we know the next steps,
I'll sit.

361
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,598
- So, until then...
- Your father has zero chill.

362
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,739
- Tell me about it.
- And at the moment,

363
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:41,871
mine is in limited supply, too.

364
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:45,005
Hello, Carol. Yee.
Lovely to see you.

365
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,267
Okay, Dr. Oliver, we can
dispense with the niceties.

366
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:49,610
- We're dying here.
- Literally.

367
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,520
- Carol.
- This will be short

368
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:52,929
and very sweet.

369
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:54,316
I am happy to say

370
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,358
that Carol's cancer
has a mutation

371
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:59,644
that qualifies her
for targeted therapy.

372
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:03,347
Thank you.

373
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:04,823
You hear that, Ma?

374
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,268
This is incredible.

375
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,293
Conventional chemo
is better than it used to be,

376
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:10,925
but it's still a blunt tool.

377
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,605
Targeted therapy
is exactly what the name says.

378
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:16,106
It attacks only the changes
in the cancer cells

379
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:20,075
that help it grow and spread
while sparing your normal cells.

380
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,086
And what does this mean for me?

381
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:25,255
I mean,
I know it's not a cure, but...

382
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,285
You still have stage IV cancer,

383
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:29,426
but we are buying time.

384
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,653
The cancer
will eventually come back,

385
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:35,608
but by then, we could have new
and even better treatments.

386
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:37,551
Mom.

387
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,153
Mom, this is great news.

388
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:51,738
So, the CT you ordered
showed a grade III liver lac.

389
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,972
- What's his most recent hemoglobin?
- 12.2.

390
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,113
The second one
should be back any minute.

391
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:58,133
Any guesses why he passed out
in the first place?

392
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:01,128
- No idea. It was so abrupt.
- Doesn't make sense.

393
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,020
So, what accounts
for the respiratory failure?

394
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:04,119
It's all a mystery.

395
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,212
His EKG and echo show evidence

396
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:08,985
of severe pulmonary hypertension
with right-sided heart strain,

397
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,504
and that's all new
from a year ago.

398
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:11,383
We thought it could be a P.E.,

399
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:13,657
but he's been
on his blood thinners,

400
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:15,465
- so it's unlikely.
- Severe pulmonary hypertension?

401
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,958
So we don't want to put this guy
under anesthesia.

402
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,402
Not if we can help it.

403
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:21,274
Lab just called
with a critical value.

404
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,564
Repeat hemoglobin 7.2.

405
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,649
He's bleeding out.
We don't have a choice.

406
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:27,481
Okay, yeah. Pack him up.
Get blood on hold.

407
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,033
Lots of blood. And
I'll meet him in the OR.

408
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:30,227
On it.

409
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,566
Randolph.

410
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,337
- A favor?
- Yeah. Sure, but quickly.

411
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:38,080
I have to prep a patient
for surgery.

412
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:39,830
I have
a first-year surgical intern

413
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,090
in need of a new mentor.

414
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,676
He have a falling-out
with someone?

415
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,093
She. Yes, and sort of.

416
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,754
AJ let her have it in his OR.

417
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:48,097
That's understandable.
AJ's under a lot of stress.

418
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:50,507
He is, which is why
I would be eternally grateful

419
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:52,168
if you could have her
in your surgeries today.

420
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,094
Yeah. Is she any good?

421
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:54,328
Judge for yourself.

422
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:03,837
Solid technique. Fast.

423
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,032
Clearly determined.

424
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:07,024
She's whip-smart, too.

425
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:09,493
Her name's Leela Devi.

426
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,290
Dr. Devi? I'm Randolph Bell.

427
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,917
How'd you like to throw
some of those in my OR?

428
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:19,094
I would love to.

429
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,954
Great. Let's go.

430
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:29,131
Rose, Rose,

431
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:31,215
you've got to settle down.

432
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:34,384
I don't... feel good.

433
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:36,812
Rose, steady.

434
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,140
Deep breaths.

435
00:21:38,224 --> 00:21:41,068
Deep breaths.

436
00:21:41,152 --> 00:21:43,570
- What happened?
- Well, she was holding her own,

437
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:45,562
and then her blood pressure
plummeted to 70/40.

438
00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:47,715
Okay, give her another liter,
wide open.

439
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,134
- Mm-hmm.
- And start her on norepi.

440
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,395
- I'm so hot!
- That's because you have a fever.

441
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,823
I have to examine you again,
okay?

442
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:57,500
Ow!

443
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:02,589
- Fever.
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,392
Hypotension, abdominal pain.

445
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:06,049
I don't think
this is from the gene therapy.

446
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:09,915
Rose, the chemo has suppressed
your immune system.

447
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,516
I think you have a bad
infection, likely from your gut.

448
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:14,583
So what... happens now?

449
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:16,937
We're gonna get you
on the right antibiotics.

450
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:20,516
All you have to do
is get some rest.

451
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:22,571
You stay hopeful.

452
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:24,326
Okay?

453
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:29,096
Aneurysm clip.

454
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:34,111
Proximal and distal clips
in place.

455
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:36,330
Now I'll ligate the aneurysm.

456
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,839
Oh, I trapped the aneurysm.

457
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,884
I'm certain
I did that correctly.

458
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,381
I don't... I don't understand
why this is happening.

459
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,857
Find the feeder vessel...

460
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,343
I don't need instruction
from a resident.

461
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,376
Cerebral perfusion pressure
is falling.

462
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:18,219
Get back in there, or this'll be
the last brain you ever touch.

463
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,654
Suction.

464
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:24,336
Need to see
what we're dealing with.

465
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:32,904
There's the feeder. Clip?

466
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:45,941
Nice work, Dr. Cain.

467
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:47,702
Yeah, please.

468
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:50,372
I almost whiffed a softball.

469
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:52,531
You close.
I'm finished here.

470
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,775
Maybe he is finished.

471
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:05,369
If so, no one will miss him.

472
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:07,354
His hands are back.

473
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,948
But surgeons thrive on hubris.

474
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:13,385
The problem now is in his head.

475
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,477
I got your page.

476
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,479
Hey, it wasn't the gene therapy.

477
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,640
Rose's blood cultures came back
positive. She's septic.

478
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:28,235
- And how's she doing?
- We started her on the right

479
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,237
antibiotics early.
She's stable now.

480
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:32,147
But her kidneys took a hit.
Take a look.

481
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,343
Is she making urine?

482
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:37,170
I have flooded her with fluids,
but no.

483
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:39,380
Her potassium is climbing.

484
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:45,419
Rose needs dialysis if she's
gonna make it past this crisis.

485
00:25:01,196 --> 00:25:03,122
Lap pad to me.

486
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:06,357
Have you ever operated
on a liver lac?

487
00:25:06,928 --> 00:25:09,109
Never as first assist,
but I've read a lot about it.

488
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:10,685
Okay, well, then tell me about
the blood supply of the liver.

489
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:11,959
Another lap pad.

490
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,220
Liver has dual blood supply...

491
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,655
Portal vein and the hepatic.

492
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,030
Mm-hmm.

493
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:18,726
All right, Dr. Devi.

494
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:21,015
Diffuse bleeding
from the liver. You're on.

495
00:25:24,178 --> 00:25:27,025
- What do you want to do?
- Manual compression.

496
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,778
I take the liver in my hand,
and squeeze it.

497
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,459
Okay, now do it.

498
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:35,377
It's not working.
He's still bleeding.

499
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:36,461
So what's your next move?

500
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:38,213
I identify
and suture the bleeder?

501
00:25:38,297 --> 00:25:41,820
Dr. Bell, our patient

502
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:43,535
- isn't enjoying this teaching moment.
- I think

503
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:45,203
- you should take over.
- No, there's no need

504
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:46,878
to take over.
We're a team.

505
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:49,314
3.0 Prolene to Dr. Devi.

506
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:55,386
I saw you do this perfectly.

507
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:57,722
It's muscle memory.
Just do it. Don't think.

508
00:25:57,816 --> 00:26:00,284
And if you have trouble,
I'm right here.

509
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:13,338
Mm-hmm.

510
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:21,221
Mm-hmm.

511
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:26,687
Suction.

512
00:26:34,336 --> 00:26:37,279
Well done, Dr. Devi.

513
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:42,110
Now, let's hope
Nic and Conrad can diagnose

514
00:26:42,194 --> 00:26:44,203
Pete's underlying problem.

515
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:56,077
It was touch and go in surgery.

516
00:26:56,162 --> 00:26:57,707
He's on two pressors now.

517
00:26:57,792 --> 00:27:00,234
- Water.
- Oh, thank you.

518
00:27:01,806 --> 00:27:05,215
So, Bell fixed his liver lac,

519
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,468
but that's still the least
of his problems.

520
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:09,703
Did his rheumatological studies
come back?

521
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:11,514
Yep. All normal.

522
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,030
He'll need a right heart cath

523
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:19,470
to measure
his pulmonary pressure.

524
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:22,186
I'll check with Cardio
on that and schedule

525
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:25,064
a chest angio with CT.

526
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:27,484
If we can't figure out
the underlying cause

527
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:29,991
- of his pulmonary hypertension...
- There are treatment options,

528
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:33,161
and we'll have to start looking
into them, but...

529
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:35,979
he could die.

530
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:40,101
Wait.

531
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:42,326
When I went to get Pete water,

532
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:45,282
all I saw in his kitchen
was rice and beans.

533
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:47,757
<i>Only</i> rice and beans.

534
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:49,518
No vegetables? No fruits?

535
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:50,744
None.

536
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,255
I mean, I know it seems crazy,

537
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,264
a one-in-a-million case, but...

538
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:57,124
Pete's suffering
from a vitamin deficiency.

539
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,780
Think about it. He's been shut
in from COVID this whole time.

540
00:27:59,865 --> 00:28:01,384
That explains
the pulmonary hypertension.

541
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:04,953
Nic, you may have just
saved his life.

542
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:12,875
Dialysis?

543
00:28:13,686 --> 00:28:15,703
My kidneys are failing?

544
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:18,960
I've had family members
on dialysis,

545
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,452
and they were miserable.

546
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:22,514
It's devastating news, I know,

547
00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:24,678
but I think
it's gonna be temporary.

548
00:28:25,781 --> 00:28:27,382
Okay? I-I really...

549
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:29,207
I really do, Rose.

550
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,561
We have to give your kidneys
time to recover.

551
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:34,906
And if they don't?

552
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:36,415
Remember, Rose,

553
00:28:37,161 --> 00:28:39,201
we're focusing on hope.

554
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:42,522
Look at me.

555
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:46,401
I am about out of hope.

556
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:48,635
I am out of everything.

557
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:52,084
Just answer the question,
please.

558
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:55,017
If your kidneys don't recover,

559
00:28:55,102 --> 00:28:58,108
you will be on dialysis
for the rest of your life.

560
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:05,428
Is dying
from renal failure painful?

561
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:07,812
- No, it is not, but that's not where...
- Look,

562
00:29:07,897 --> 00:29:11,341
I appreciate everything
that you and Dr. Voss have done,

563
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:14,826
but I am too tired
to go on any further.

564
00:29:16,334 --> 00:29:19,015
Rose, no.

565
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:21,276
Rose, you're not gonna be alone.

566
00:29:21,503 --> 00:29:24,197
I'm going to be with you
the whole time.

567
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:28,191
I have nothing left.

568
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:31,119
No dialysis, no anything.

569
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:33,455
Rose, giving up
is not the answer.

570
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,702
You have to fight,
you have to fight this

571
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:37,663
and hold on to
what your life could be

572
00:29:37,748 --> 00:29:39,015
when this is behind you.

573
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,881
I don't have any fight left.

574
00:29:43,918 --> 00:29:48,313
Call in hospice... please.

575
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:51,389
I gave it my best shot.

576
00:29:51,475 --> 00:29:52,790
It's over.

577
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:56,673
I can't do this anymore.

578
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:15,639
I told you I didn't want
to come here. They filleted me

579
00:30:15,724 --> 00:30:17,124
like a dead fish,
and now I'm farting

580
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,811
like a ten-year-old
Labrador retriever.

581
00:30:18,896 --> 00:30:21,585
Pete, if Dr. Bell hadn't
operated, you would have died.

582
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,843
So the blame's on me?
I didn't eat right.

583
00:30:23,928 --> 00:30:25,323
Food as medicine.
What a crock.

584
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,250
It's not a crock.
Not having

585
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:30,178
enough vitamin C in your diet
can be life-threatening.

586
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:32,323
It can increase the pressure
in the vessels

587
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:34,349
leading from your heart
to your lungs,

588
00:30:34,576 --> 00:30:36,076
causing pulmonary hypertension.

589
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:38,831
And that explains the strain
on your heart.

590
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:41,271
Which caused shortness
of breath, the swelling.

591
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:43,767
The lack of vitamin C
also explains the bruising.

592
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,111
I get the gist.

593
00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:47,771
You want the big dose of,
uh, gratitude.

594
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:49,357
Okay, here it goes.

595
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:51,758
Big thanks.

596
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:55,095
Here's the bag, Nic.

597
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:59,125
- Thank you.
- That's my vitamin C?

598
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:00,529
What about
a nice chewable tablet?

599
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:01,859
The kind I gave my kids?

600
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:03,879
If we're right about this,
we should see a change

601
00:31:04,106 --> 00:31:05,131
in the numbers immediately.

602
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:07,591
I'm not holding my breath.

603
00:31:12,257 --> 00:31:13,423
So you have kids?

604
00:31:13,508 --> 00:31:15,342
One more disappointment.

605
00:31:15,427 --> 00:31:17,097
You're pregnant.
I have eyes.

606
00:31:17,182 --> 00:31:19,709
You think it's gonna be all,
uh, hugs and kisses

607
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,627
and "I love you, Mommy,
with all my heart."

608
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:25,065
News flash: They become
teenagers, and they turn on you.

609
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:26,469
Then they spend the rest
of their lives griping

610
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:30,739
about that one birthday party
that didn't meet expectations.

611
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:36,645
You seeing what I'm seeing?

612
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,083
Pulmonary artery pressure

613
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,751
is still higher
than we'd like to see,

614
00:31:42,893 --> 00:31:44,759
but it's coming down.

615
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:47,598
Feeling better, Pete?

616
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:50,472
Maybe.
A little.

617
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:52,512
Okay, great. We'll take that
as a rave review.

618
00:31:52,596 --> 00:31:55,348
Nic's on maternity leave. I'll
be back to check on you, though.

619
00:31:55,432 --> 00:31:58,102
Control that impulse
as much as possible.

620
00:31:58,187 --> 00:32:00,379
We'll see you later, Pete.

621
00:32:03,468 --> 00:32:05,394
Not the day we hoped for.

622
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,720
Eh, but the kind we live for.

623
00:32:07,836 --> 00:32:10,042
Grumpy patient or not.

624
00:32:10,588 --> 00:32:12,496
Gratitude not required.

625
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,320
Carol.

626
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:20,766
Your new
meds have just arrived.

627
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,245
Once a day
with a glass of water.

628
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:31,191
I'm glad I lived
to see this day.

629
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:34,573
And we hope
there'll be many more, Mom.

630
00:32:36,189 --> 00:32:38,832
Enough to find the next miracle.

631
00:32:40,811 --> 00:32:42,557
Science wins.

632
00:32:43,956 --> 00:32:45,378
Thank you, Dr. Oliver.

633
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,096
Here, honey.

634
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:49,420
Thank you, son.

635
00:32:51,084 --> 00:32:53,919
Listen, I got to, um,
finish up a couple of things,

636
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:56,741
but I'll be back
to walk you guys out, all right?

637
00:32:59,054 --> 00:33:00,988
- Thank you.
- Of course.

638
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,559
- Hey.
- Evening.

639
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:30,033
Hey, I got the good news
about your mom.

640
00:33:30,715 --> 00:33:32,388
I'm happy for you.

641
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,271
Thank you.

642
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:39,183
The medicine gods
were smiling down on us.

643
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:43,863
- Yeah, I love when that happens.
- Whew. Me, too.

644
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:48,130
Hey, by the way,
uh, Dr. Devi assisted me

645
00:33:48,215 --> 00:33:50,692
on a liver lac today
and did some very good work

646
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,286
in a messy situation.

647
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:54,661
So, you know, if you don't mind,

648
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,451
I'd like to keep her in my OR.

649
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:58,229
Yeah.

650
00:33:58,314 --> 00:34:00,064
Sure, she's all yours.

651
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:03,119
That's good news.

652
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:05,463
Thanks, man.

653
00:34:17,137 --> 00:34:19,137
Rose is refusing dialysis.

654
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:21,513
- Why would she do that?
- I tried to convince her

655
00:34:21,598 --> 00:34:23,151
to keep fighting,
but she won't hear me.

656
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,246
I thought maybe
she'd listen to you.

657
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:27,529
Will you talk to her?

658
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,142
What's that?

659
00:34:38,227 --> 00:34:39,705
Meds to lower your potassium.

660
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,474
Oh, stop, stop.
No more medication.

661
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,743
- Rose...
- I'm refusing all treatment.

662
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,340
Leave me alone.

663
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,925
I know what you're gonna say.

664
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:57,326
Don't bother.

665
00:34:57,419 --> 00:34:59,678
Devon said you're having
a rough time.

666
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,023
Rough time?

667
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:02,858
I know about a rough time.

668
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:06,102
This is...

669
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:09,521
There's a limit
to what a person can endure,

670
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:11,615
and I found it.

671
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:13,513
Yeah, I understand.

672
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,203
I get it.

673
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:22,793
After my accident,
I was on a vent.

674
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:28,230
Hopeless. Totally alone.
I wanted to die, too.

675
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,257
And I'm glad I didn't.

676
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:36,974
I don't want you to die,
either, Rose.

677
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:41,553
This dialysis...

678
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:43,732
No, I don't want it. No.

679
00:35:43,816 --> 00:35:46,334
Dialysis may be temporary.
There's no reason not to try.

680
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:48,443
There's no guarantee.

681
00:35:48,616 --> 00:35:51,202
It probably won't work.

682
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:53,165
The odds...

683
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,958
so long.

684
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,951
I can't. I can't.

685
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,323
Rose, you can.

686
00:36:00,407 --> 00:36:02,295
You can.

687
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,646
I believe in you, Rose.

688
00:36:07,173 --> 00:36:10,382
You're the strongest,
bravest person I know.

689
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:15,128
You just got to dig deep,
just for that last fight.

690
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:18,348
Just dig.

691
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:24,271
I promise you this, Rose.

692
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,581
If nothing works...

693
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:32,029

<i>♪ You never gave

705
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:12,748
So, how about we celebrate
Mom getting targeted therapy

706
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:16,053
- at Dominick's?
- Ah, my favorite.

707
00:37:16,149 --> 00:37:20,077
Son, you have no idea
how proud we are of you.

708
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:22,304
Operating on all those patients

709
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:25,500
and still finding time
to look after your mother.

710
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,502
Such good care.

711
00:37:27,586 --> 00:37:28,994
So compassionate.

712
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:31,061
You are a shining example

713
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:32,952
of what a doctor should be.

714
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:34,245
AJ...

715
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,084
you're heartbroken over Mina.

716
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,053
You still do your job
with grace and dignity.

717
00:37:39,138 --> 00:37:40,830
I'm so proud of you.

718
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,835
Hey, thanks, guys.

719
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,687
You know, I just realized

720
00:37:47,772 --> 00:37:50,327
there's one more thing
I need to do before I leave.

721
00:37:50,412 --> 00:37:51,492
I'll meet you guys
at Dominick's.

722
00:37:51,576 --> 00:37:52,873
- All right?
- Okay.

723
00:38:09,944 --> 00:38:11,703
Dr. Devi.

724
00:38:11,855 --> 00:38:13,273
Dr. Austin.

725
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,132
Before you yell at me again,

726
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,709
I know my dexterity
wasn't up to par.

727
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:19,424
I'm working to change that.

728
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,713
Well, that's a promising start.
Listen...

729
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:23,473
Excuse me, but I'm not finished.

730
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:27,717
I understand your last resident
was superhuman.

731
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:31,023
I'm sorry you find me
a poor replacement.

732
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:33,817
I will work as hard as I can,

733
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:36,964
but there is no doubt
I'm mortal.

734
00:38:37,452 --> 00:38:39,364
You will witness mistakes.

735
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,030
Verbal abuse won't help.

736
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:45,822
I do better
with constructive criticism.

737
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:47,474
And if that doesn't work
for you,

738
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,156
Dr. Bell has offered
to take your place as my mentor.

739
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:51,908
Well, he can't have you.

740
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:55,246
True, your dexterity needs
a little bit of love,

741
00:38:55,341 --> 00:38:57,837
but your determination
and your work ethic

742
00:38:57,922 --> 00:39:00,181
are quite admirable.

743
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:01,921
Now, if I may...

744
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:05,424
I came back to apologize.

745
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,288
I can't expect you to do things
the way I want them done

746
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:11,709
if I don't take the time
to show you, right?

747
00:39:12,202 --> 00:39:15,244
So tomorrow morning,
I have an aortic valve replacement

748
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:16,421
at 8:00 a.m.

749
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:19,279
"Bright" and "early"
are the key words.

750
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,710
Will you join me?

751
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,162
I will see you bright and early.

752
00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:33,877
Good.

753
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:57,006
Hey.

754
00:39:57,393 --> 00:40:00,087
You're still here this late.

755
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:02,135
How's Rose doing?

756
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:03,390
She's better.

757
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:05,242
She was brewing an infection,
but, um...

758
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,996
Her kidneys took a hit,
but she's okay.

759
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,804
So it wasn't the therapy cells?

760
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:12,657
- No, it wasn't.
- Ah, that's a relief.

761
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:14,251
For all of us.

762
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,145
Though we're not thrilled
she's on dialysis.

763
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:20,147
- I think it's temporary.
- Another good sign.

764
00:40:20,491 --> 00:40:22,148
Thank you, Pravesh,
for hanging in.

765
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:23,753
It's much appreciated.

766
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:27,311
Yeah.
Rose is my priority, too.

767
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:31,518
Marshall.

768
00:40:32,537 --> 00:40:34,273
This is Phillip Bondman,

769
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:37,695
the founder of Bio South Labs,
the company we partnered with

770
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,531
for our sickle cell
clinical trial.

771
00:40:39,616 --> 00:40:43,202
Mm. Kit has great things
to say about you.

772
00:40:43,671 --> 00:40:45,475
Please, have a seat.

773
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:48,870
Marshall is chairman
of the board at Chastain.

774
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:51,546
Dr. Pravesh told me

775
00:40:51,631 --> 00:40:53,189
you're looking
for an angel investor

776
00:40:53,274 --> 00:40:55,506
in return for a stake
in the company.

777
00:40:55,591 --> 00:40:59,528
Kit has proposed that Chastain
become that angel investor,

778
00:40:59,614 --> 00:41:00,964
and I'm interested.

779
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:04,695
We could inject cash
into Bio South right away,

780
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,937
and the hospital
would share in your risk

781
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:08,921
as well as
the potential returns.

782
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:11,148
You understand the risk is real
with Bio South?

783
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:12,468
We are still speculative.

784
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:16,480
Chastain needs
new sources of revenue badly.

785
00:41:16,631 --> 00:41:19,057
Yes, it's a risky investment,

786
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:22,202
but if we are going to spend
our risk currency,

787
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:25,445
it will be on someone who's
looking to do good in the world.

788
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:29,405
That, and your product
seems promising.

789
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:33,163
With enough cash,
we believe you can do more.

790
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:36,381
This-this sounds like a godsend.

791
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:38,834
Could be a perfect partnership.

792
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:46,410
<i>"Lightning" by Mehro playing...</i>

793
00:41:49,923 --> 00:41:51,841
You don't have to do this,
you know.

794
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:54,092
I do not break promises
to my wife.

795
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:56,335
You were promised

796
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:57,772
a spa day...

797
00:41:57,856 --> 00:42:00,524
and you will get a spa day.

798
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:02,442
Okay.

799
00:42:04,676 --> 00:42:06,175
I researched.

800
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,980
And apparently, the spas
put fruits and vegetables

801
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,395
in their water.

802
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,956
That's a very nice touch.

803
00:42:14,394 --> 00:42:16,323
Thank you.

804
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:19,323
All right.

805
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,880
Okay, we have got...

806
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,294
Passionate Peach...

...and Redder than Red.

809
00:42:36,403 --> 00:42:39,716
I mean, I think Baby-Oh-Baby
seems appropriate.

810
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:41,373
Baby-Oh-Baby it is.
