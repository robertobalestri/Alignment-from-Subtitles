<i>He's one of a kind, isn't he?</i>

5
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,211
Yeah.

<i>Our relationship...</i>

7
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:13,406
It is perfect just like this.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,953
My father owns his own cab.

9
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:16,320
He put me
through medical school

10
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:18,656
working very long hours,
and I'm very proud of him.

11
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:20,711
So, y-you think this place
in Savannah...

12
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:22,228
You really think
they can help me?

13
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:24,610
It's one of the best inpatient
centers in the country.

14
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,447
I really want to be there
for all those moments

15
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:28,368
- that you talked about.
- Me too.

16
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:29,783
Cain and Bell had their chance

17
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:31,061
to be the star of this company,

18
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:32,321
but they couldn't deliver.

19
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:33,673
Our future is brighter

20
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:35,703
with Conrad Hawkins
front and center.

21
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:45,806
I don't know.

22
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,361
I'm still jonesing
for that powder blue tux

23
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:50,758
with the ruffled shirt.

24
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:53,829
No, no, no, no, no,
you are not allowed to look

25
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:55,891
like a lounge singer
on your wedding day.

26
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:58,906
Seriously... thoughts?

27
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,813
You fishing for compliments?

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,866
Come on.

29
00:01:04,026 --> 00:01:05,242
Okay.

30
00:01:11,952 --> 00:01:13,186
Baller.

31
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:15,367
Slightly different guy
than that jerk you met

32
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:17,428
your first day of residency.

33
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:19,741
You were just doing your job
the wrong way.

34
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,506
I must've done something right.

35
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:23,733
You turned
into a damn fine doctor.

36
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:31,209
Yeah, well, it...
hasn't always felt that way.

37
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:35,069
When all hell breaks
loose,

38
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:36,764
you find out what people
are made of.

39
00:01:37,342 --> 00:01:38,678
You excelled.

40
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:42,928
That's very kind of you,
but let's stick to you.

41
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:44,837
How you feeling?

42
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:46,686
Any last-minute jitters?

43
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,342
None.

44
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:51,905
I'm as happy as I've ever been.

45
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:54,537
I'm about to marry my soul mate.

46
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,724
Okay, last stitch.

47
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:04,319
Something borrowed
and something blue.

48
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:05,717
It's a twofer.

49
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,600
Those earrings are beautiful.

50
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:08,815
Whose are they?

51
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:11,022
They were Jessie's.

52
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:13,817
My dad bought them
for her 16th birthday.

53
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:17,295
I wish she were here.

54
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:19,670
Me, too.

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,077
But she's always with me.

56
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:23,827
- So is my mom.
- Hmm.

57
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:28,944
And now you get to wear
her circa-1980

58
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,093
wedding dress.

59
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:34,178
When my dad begged me
to wear it, my heart sank.

60
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:36,453
Luckily you have Mina.

61
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,147
Something old is now new.

62
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:40,553
I mean,
you're a miracle worker.

63
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:43,171
- Thank you.
- Of course.

64
00:02:44,943 --> 00:02:47,600
Is it bad to be this happy after
everything that's happened?

65
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:49,819
No,

66
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:53,233
but... I wish
things had been different,

67
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:57,616
that we could all be here
together today.

68
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:59,475
Yeah.

69
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:04,608
2020, man,
what a year.

70
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,428
I mean, we had no idea
what was about to hit us.

71
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,975
Okay, since the service
is outside,

72
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,155
I was thinking,
instead of throwing rice,

73
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,531
people could throw birdseeds?

74
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:24,139
Environmentally conscious...
I like it.

75
00:03:25,761 --> 00:03:27,795
Okay, how do you feel
about a buffet

76
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,123
instead of a seated dinner?

77
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:31,154
I feel nothing.

78
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:32,755
Defer.

79
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,295
Band or DJ?

80
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,464
Up to you.

81
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:37,123
Oh, my God,
we're bad at this.

82
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:38,647
Okay, I'm going DJ.

83
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:39,881
All right.

84
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:42,545
And I think I want
burgundy flowers.

85
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:44,569
Dahlias, peonies.

86
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:48,467
Really? I was hoping
for blue wildflowers.

87
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,163
You don't care
what music we play

88
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:52,408
and yet you have an opinion
on the color of my bouquet?

89
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:55,772
Remember that first date we had,
hiking at Sweetwater?

90
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,061
The flowers I picked
for you that day?

91
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,819
Blue wildflowers it is.

92
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:02,727
And whatever DJ
you decide on,

93
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:05,022
they have to play
"Mr. Brightside."

94
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:07,225
You asked.

95
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:09,185
I thought you had
better taste than that.

96
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,470
Oh, you're about to be
Mrs. Conrad Hawkins.

97
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,139
- We both should have better taste.

269
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:49,661
- I can't just leave.
- Listen, first off all,

270
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,030
are you feeling okay?

271
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:54,144
Good. So, your mom wants you
to go home and isolate.

272
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:55,879
Take care of yourself,
and I will call you

273
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:57,667
as soon as she's settled, okay?

274
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,245
I'm so sorry.

275
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:06,715

00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,707
Uh, you hold the fate

278
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:14,160
Red Rock needs you
to start cutting again.

279
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:16,096
Can't cut. Everyone's afraid.

280
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,347
Especially the sickest people

281
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:18,527
who need the operations
the most.

282
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:19,832
They're afraid COVID
is gonna kill them.

283
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,596
Then-then focus
on elective surgeries.

284
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:25,229
Stents, uh, knee replacements,
disc repair, uh, plastics.

285
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:26,898
It's against CMS guidelines.

286
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,199
Elective surgeries
use precious PPE,

287
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:30,818
hospital beds and resources.

288
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,886

290
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:37,823
D-Do you understand
that this hospital will close?

291
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:40,247
- Thousands of jobs are at stake.
- Yeah, but the only job

292
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,972
you're worried about
is your own, Kim.

293
00:14:42,057 --> 00:14:43,409
- That's not true.
- Really?

294
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:45,958
I-I know we haven't
always been on the same side,

295
00:14:46,043 --> 00:14:47,761
but we need to work together
this time.

296
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,564
There's a
government bailout coming.

297
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,305
- Where will that money go?
- Red Rock's bank account.

298
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,143
Yeah. We're done here.

299
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,369

Take the lowest-risk
elective surgeries

303
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:09,862
and-and schedule them
as urgent.

304
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:13,128
Okay, on one condition.

305
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:16,613
Don't ever threaten my job again
or replace my face

306
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:19,698
on the side of this building
with a shiny new object.

307
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,620

308
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:43,346

310
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:46,468
I'm afraid so.

311
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,972
Listen, I know that I told you

312
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:49,581
your back surgery
could wait, Ben,

313
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:53,667
but... I took another look
at your last scan this morning.

314
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:55,871
Is there a problem?

315
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,691
<i>Yes. I see some progression</i>

316
00:15:57,776 --> 00:16:01,206
in your disc herniation
at your L5-S1 vertebrae

317
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,715
with some potential involvement
of your spinal cord.

318
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,846
- My spinal cord?
<i>- Yes, yes, - and it's getting worse.</i>

319
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:09,242
I need to get you
into the OR immediately.

320
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:12,082
But it's not safe
at the hospital.

321
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:15,198
- The coronavirus is...
<i>- Oh, no, our surgical - facilities are pristine.</i>

322
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:16,906
Yeah, never been cleaner
or safer.

323
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,057
And you won't be anywhere near
a COVID patient.

324
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:20,546
<i>We'll take every precaution.</i>

325
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:27,159
I don't know.
Um, I have to think about this.

326
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,581
See, here's the thing, Ben,

327
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:33,449
if you put this off,
you take one bad step,

328
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,299
<i>you slip and fall
in the bathroom...</i>

329
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,071
you'll end up paralyzed.

330
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:40,781
Oh, my God, Dr. Cain.

331
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,323
Okay.

332
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,312
I'll do whatever you say.

333
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:02,025
Devon?

334
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,526
How are you?

335
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:06,807
Are you driving your cab again?

336
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:08,645
That's one of the riskiest
things you could do.

337
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:09,950
You promised me you'd stay home.

338
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:12,620
- And who is going to pay my rent, Devon?
<i>- I will.</i>

339
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,660
<i>Listen, Dad, our ER is packed.
Our ICU, too.</i>

340
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:17,592
Think about Mom.
You could get infected,

341
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:19,434
<i>you could take it home to her,
she could die.</i>

342
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:20,479
<i>You both could.</i>

343
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:23,284
I need you to turn that cab
around and go home now.

344
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:26,316
Dad, you need to leave
the facility and quarantine now.

345
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:28,418
It's really not a good time,
Nicky. I'm only...

346
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:29,581
I'm halfway through treatment.

347
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:31,200
- If I leave...
<i>- I know, but I wouldn't be asking</i>

348
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,721
<i>if it wasn't serious.</i>

349
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,597
Please. I'll get you
a hotel room.

350
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:36,534
Just tell me you'll do this.

351
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:41,104
Yeah, okay.
Okay, okay. Uh...

352
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:43,637
Anything for you, Nicky.

353
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:45,512
Okay.

354
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:49,082
Dad, where are you?

355
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:52,176
I finally got a guy
who's willing to manufacture

356
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:53,988
the new mask prototypes,

357
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,265
<i>but now he is telling me that
there are no more materials.</i>

358
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,933
You have Crohn's disease
and a compromised immune system.

359
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:02,932
We agreed that you were
gonna work from home.

360
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,605
Hear my voice.
This is me not happy with you.

361
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,324
<i>You need to solve
this issue from home.</i>

362
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:08,695
As soon as I'm finished here.

363
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,612
Hello?

364
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:19,307
<i>This is Marshall Winthrop.
Unfort...</i>

365
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:30,214
Hey, you, nurse. I've
been waiting for two hours.

366
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:32,065
I got gold-plated insurance.

367
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:34,309
- The taxes I pay, I should be first in line.
- Hey, hey, hey.

368
00:18:34,393 --> 00:18:36,097
There's no special treatment
in this ER.

369
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,294
Put your mask up, six feet apart
or you're out of here.

370
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:40,234
I am six feet apart.

371
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:42,556
What are you trying to do,
set a world record for people

372
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,003
in an ER in the middle
of a pandemic?

373
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:48,308
I understand the male temptation

374
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,112
to exaggerate length...

375
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,362
but you need to back up.

376
00:18:54,987 --> 00:18:56,623
What... Don't touch me!

377
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,800
He's not six feet apart!

378
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:05,627
We've got five
minutes before our next crisis.

379
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,340
- It is crazy out there.
- And unsafe.

380
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:10,035
I really wish
you were back in the OR

381
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,089
working as a scrub nurse.

382
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:13,007
I'm right where I want to be.

383
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,503
I'm laying my head
on your shoulder right now.

384
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:28,658
I'm holding you and
rocking you back and forth.

385
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:30,710
Aw. Thank you.

386
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,863
"Lower extremity weakness
and acute onset

387
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:55,267
of bowel incontinence requiring
urgent operative management."

388
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:59,862
Come on, he's a 58-year-old
with a simple bulging disc.

389
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,804
We are in the midst
of the single most devastating

390
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:10,136
public health crisis
of our lifetimes.

391
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:11,965
Barrett, you can't be
doing surgeries

392
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,168
that don't need to be done.

393
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,675
You put a patient at risk
of getting COVID.

394
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:18,971
20% of surgeries
are unnecessary.

395
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,713
I made a judgment call.

396
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:24,675
And he won't get COVID
because my OR is spotless.

397
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:31,128
You know, you had a chance
to do the right thing.

398
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:34,808
Pitch in with the rest of us
and help, but no.

399
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:38,260
You just followed
Red Rock's marching orders.

400
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:40,237
I'm a neurosurgeon.
I cut.

401
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:43,479
When that pandemic
can be cured by brain surgery,

402
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:45,393
shoot me a page.

403
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:53,823
It's okay, Raylee.

404
00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:59,057
If you get a fever or cough,
don't panic.

405
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:02,636
Most people don't get this sick.

406
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:05,270
You're gonna be okay.

407
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:08,429
My doctors are here.

408
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:10,446
I'll call you back soon.

409
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:12,422
- I love you.
<i>- I love you, Mom.</i>

410
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:14,102
Hey, there.

411
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,146
Proning isn't working, is it?

412
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:21,985
Well, your O2 sats
are still dipping too low,

413
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,469
so we're gonna try
a high-flow nasal cannula now.

414
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:25,955
It is a little outside the box,

415
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,362
but otherwise
we have to intubate.

416
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:34,074
If you put me to sleep
and put that tube in,

417
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:39,070
there's a good chance
I won't wake up again.

418
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:43,656
Which is why high-flow
is worth the risk.

419
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,359
Okay.

420
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,805
On three. One, two, three.

421
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:12,605
Uh-oh, we disconnected something.

422
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:15,507
- Where do these go?
- Haven't a clue.

423
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,076
White electrode...

424
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:19,992
under right clavicle.

425
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,187
Black under left.

426
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,682
Red above and left of umbilicus.

427
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:29,293
What about the beeping?

428
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:31,087
Just press "silence."

429
00:22:36,392 --> 00:22:39,096
Surgeons, huh?

430
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:41,143
Nurses aren't paid enough.

431
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:43,072
Tell me about it.

432
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:51,356
You're gonna be okay.

433
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:25,439
Snapped when I was in the room.

434
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:27,494
I thought I felt something.

435
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:32,221
<i>Europe, South Korea, China,</i>

436
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:34,338
they all have state-of-the-art
protection; Look at this.

437
00:23:34,422 --> 00:23:36,409
Dr. Voss is a surgeon.
Could have gone home

438
00:23:36,494 --> 00:23:37,886
'cause she doesn't have
any patients, but she's working

439
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,621
in the ICU, and this is all
that protected her

440
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:42,853
from exposure to COVID-19.
She's been exposed.

441
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,760
You are sending our soldiers to
face the enemy without any armor.

442
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:48,862
We have a top ER nurse
in the ICU

443
00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:50,385
fighting for her life.

444
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,744
Two transpo workers are dead.
Med students, residents,

445
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,375
they're isolating
from their families,

446
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:56,860
they're sick and alone,
and some of them may die.

447
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:58,932
Everybody is chasing
the same shipments.

448
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:00,620
I keep getting outbid
by other hospitals.

449
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,472
You need to protect our staff.
That's your job.

450
00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:04,674
I feel your frustration.
I-I do.

451
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,855
- My frustration?
- Why-why don't you come down to my ER

452
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:08,464
and share my frustration
instead of sitting

453
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,650
in your ivory tower
doing nothing?!

454
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,740
All of you think I don't care.
I care.

455
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:16,948
I can't escape this either.

456
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:19,537
This morning, a woman,
a total stranger,

457
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:21,521
called me a bat eater.

458
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:23,889
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

459
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:26,427
The "China Virus,"
the "Kung Flu."

460
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:28,248
I was born in Savannah.

461
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,405
This is being used to turn us
all against each other.

462
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,685
And yes, I am trying
to save this hospital.

463
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:35,101
I'll-I'll bend the rules
to do it,

464
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:36,858
but do not think
for one moment

465
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:38,866
that this hasn't hit me hard.

466
00:24:39,701 --> 00:24:40,761
I am human.

467
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,710
Prove it.

468
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:48,967
Prove it.

469
00:24:57,514 --> 00:25:00,615
Yo. How you holding up?

470
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:05,904
I don't know.
It's pretty rough in there.

471
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,818
I'm proud of you for
working the ER;

472
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:11,192
However, I need you
in the OR.

473
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:13,463
We have our first COVID trach.

474
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:17,738
Sounds delightful.

475
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:22,262
Well, seriously,
you could use the break.

476
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:25,075
I'm worried about you.

477
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:27,622
I'm worried about you, too.

478
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:34,451
Okay.

479
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:36,809
You know where to find me
if you need me.

480
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:39,697
I certainly do.

481
00:25:45,654 --> 00:25:49,044
The high-flow
bought us time, but...

482
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:53,904
your sat is 82% on 100% oxygen,

483
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:56,044
and it is dropping.

484
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,838
We need to intubate.

485
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:08,951
- Can you get Chu?
- He's on his way.

486
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:14,803
Can you please tell Raylee
I love her again?

487
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:18,740
You will tell her yourself
because you will wake up.

488
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,669
Now let us fight for you.

489
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:33,279
I'm here, Hundley. I'm here.

490
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:36,162
You're gonna be okay.

491
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:38,747
We're here.

492
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:51,795
We're gonna put you to sleep
now, my friend.

493
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,380
Just relax.
Just relax.

494
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,966
- You haven't eaten all day.
- I can't eat.

495
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,239
Hundley's a single mom.

496
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,269
I don't want to have to
tell Raylee that

497
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:38,153
she's never gonna see
her mom again.

498
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:43,334
She's around the same age you
were when you lost your mom,

499
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:44,520
isn't she?

500
00:27:52,817 --> 00:27:54,982
If you get COVID,
I get COVID.

501
00:28:05,832 --> 00:28:08,141
The good news is
I can smell that coffee.

502
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:09,683
And I could taste that bread.

503
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,128
If it's my last meal,
I'm going out with carbs.

504
00:28:12,354 --> 00:28:14,229
Don't even say that.

505
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:18,425
How's Kit?

506
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,872
Her mask broke.

507
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:23,190
She's been exposed.

508
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,675
I told her to go home.

509
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:29,878
She's scared.

510
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:42,854
You'd rather wear a PAPR
than shave your beard.

511
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:45,878
You know how long
it takes to grow this beard out?

512
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:47,551
You know we have
a limited number of these?

513
00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:49,645
They're for people who can't
wear N95s because of the way

514
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,739
their ...faces are shaped,
or because they have

515
00:28:51,824 --> 00:28:54,136
a religious objection
to shaving their beards.

516
00:28:54,245 --> 00:28:56,722
Yeah, well, let's just say
I do have a religious objection.

517
00:28:56,823 --> 00:28:58,284
I worship this beard,
all right?

518
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,195
Well, you certainly are
conceited as you are vain.

519
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:02,848
Isn't it itchy?

520
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,261
Not at all.

521
00:29:06,238 --> 00:29:08,479
- All right, let me help you.
- Aw, thanks.

522
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,582
Without the beard,
I look too young.

523
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:12,695
It adds wisdom and gravitas,

524
00:29:12,848 --> 00:29:15,129
- and it's reassuring to my patients.
- Mm.

525
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,190
Well, you don't
look reassuring to me.

526
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:25,078
You look like you're
about to go into space.

527
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,362

639
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:15,306

640

send love to our dear friend Devon,

645
00:36:32,714 --> 00:36:34,764
and he almost lost
his mother.

646
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,512
He's on his way
to his dad's memorial right now.

647

00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:23,721
You don't want to lose
what we have in the OR.

705
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:26,197
I get it. I don't want
to lose that, either, Mina.

706
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:30,220
Look, you asked me, right?
So I'm telling you the truth.

707
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,350
That's what we do, right?

708
00:40:34,371 --> 00:40:37,121
Don't worry,
I'm not expecting anything.

709
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,458
This changes nothing.

710
00:41:00,813 --> 00:41:02,480
How about that?

711
00:41:19,654 --> 00:41:22,386
<i>Dr. Pravesh,
your father's respiratory failure</i>

712
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:23,421
<i>is getting worse.</i>

713
00:41:23,506 --> 00:41:24,700
<i>We need to intubate him.</i>

714
00:41:24,784 --> 00:41:26,351
<i>What's the prognosis?</i>

715
00:41:26,435 --> 00:41:27,829
<i>We are doing everything we can,</i>

716
00:41:27,913 --> 00:41:29,912
<i>but he's very sick.</i>

717
00:41:30,063 --> 00:41:32,690
<i>Uh, I need to speak to
him before you intubate, please.</i>

718
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:34,139
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

719
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:43,396
<i>Dad, can you hear me?</i>

720
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,679
<i>Dad, hang on.</i>

721
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:49,045
<i>They're gonna intubate,
but don't give up.</i>

722
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,634
<i>Keep fighting.</i>

723
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:52,382
<i>People recover from this.</i>

724
00:41:52,467 --> 00:41:54,061
<i>People just like you. You...</i>

725
00:41:54,655 --> 00:41:57,584
<i>You can make it, you just...
you just got to fight.</i>

726
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:03,001
<i>So proud of you, Devon.</i>

727
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:08,663
<i>Take care of your mom.</i>

728
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,725
<i>I will take care of
Mom, no matter what. I promise.</i>

729
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:17,959
<i>Dad, listen to me.</i>

730
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:21,924
<i>I would be nothing without you.</i>

731
00:42:22,147 --> 00:42:23,792
<i>You helped put me
through medical school,</i>

732
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:26,530
<i>driving nights and weekends,
working overtime.</i>

733
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:30,303
<i>I believed in myself
because you believed in me.</i>

734
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:33,584
<i>And I always knew, no matter
what, that you loved me.</i>

735
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:38,209
<i>You are... everything.</i>

736
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,272
<i>Dad?</i>

737
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:45,897
<i>Dad?</i>

738
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:48,450
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

739
00:42:49,217 --> 00:42:51,027
<i>Can you hear me? Dad?</i>

740
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,121
<i>Dad, can you hear me?</i>

741
00:43:03,532 --> 00:43:05,507
I love you, Dad.
