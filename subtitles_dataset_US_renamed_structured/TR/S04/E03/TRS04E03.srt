<i>My father,
he died alone</i>

3
00:00:04,156 --> 00:00:06,569
because his public hospital
in a poor brown neighborhood

4
00:00:06,654 --> 00:00:08,530
didn't have enough resources
to save him.

5
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:11,632
There's something
I have to tell you.

6
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:15,045
I'm pregnant.

7
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:18,746
Oh, my God, you're gonna be
the best mother ever.

8
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,456
Listen, I'm sorry you got
the cold shoulder all day.

9
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,851
All will be forgiven if
you answer one question.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,018
Who's replacing Logan Kim
as CEO?

11
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:27,886
Chastain isn't getting
a new CEO.

12
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:29,983
I don't understand.
Someone has to be in charge.

13
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:31,483
Who's gonna run
the hospital?

14
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,140
Ben Mullins

15
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:34,727
has a clotting disorder
that is threatening

16
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:36,843
his heart, lungs
and now his brain.

17
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:38,249
This is your fault.

18
00:00:38,343 --> 00:00:39,515
This is on you.

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,250
No, it's on the patient,
who was advised

20
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:43,555
- of the risks.
- Mm-hmm, deny it all you want.

21
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,520
But you will be
held responsible for this.

22
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:46,938
His prognosis is good.

23
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:49,949
Dr. Cain said the same thing.

24
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,508
We are indebted to him.

25
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,030
Mrs. Mullins, there's something

Dr. Bell.

Thank you.

EKO composite barrel.

Feel this thing.

00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,640
- Wow.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:34,164
It's for my son.
That's him right here.

58
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:35,897
He's got a hell of a swing.

59
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:37,789
Little man's living
his best life.

60
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:40,038
- You got any rug rats?
- Uh, no.

61
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:43,038
Yeah, you don't know
what you're missing.

62
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:46,561
So, listen, uh,

63
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:49,670
I caught your show.

64
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:51,694
Um, not for me.

65
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,601
Numbers are pretty good though.

66
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,776
Well, I'll get right to it.

67
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:58,663
I spoke to Dr. Voss
and I know that you're...

68
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:00,866
I haven't hired a new CEO
for Chastain.

69
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,591
You're here because you want
the job back.

70
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:03,983
No...

71
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:05,606
No, not at all, but I do

72
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:07,705
want to see the chair
filled with someone

73
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,374
who can put Chastain
back on its feet

74
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,297
and overcome the losses
we suffered during COVID,

75
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,987
so I'm offering to help you
in that search.

76
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:17,147
I'm sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

77
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:19,241
Excuse me?

78
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,780
We have no need
for a new CEO.

79
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,297
Not now.

80
00:03:23,382 --> 00:03:24,679
Not ever.

81
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,580
You're selling the hospital?

82
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:29,727
Yeah, Red Rock

83
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:31,585
doesn't throw good money
after bad.

84
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:33,421
Hey...

85
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,694
maybe someone else
will.

86
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,585
Mina?

87
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:44,703
We need to talk.

88
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:47,421
You didn't seem to want to talk
when we woke up this morning.

89
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:55,819
All right, listen.

90
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:58,523
We are both passionate

91
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,007
and opinionated people.

92
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,693
Inside and outside
of the operating room.

93
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:04,763
- So we need ground rules.
- Exactly.

94
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:06,960
Inside these walls,
we keep it

95
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:08,788
strictly professional
at all times.

96
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,702
Agreed, no physical contact
of any kind.

97
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:16,616
Well, we can table that part
of the discussion for later.

98
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:19,249
But for now, in general,

99
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:21,437
it's understood
that we will not always agree.

100
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,226
Like your choice of OR music?

101
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:26,249
A bypass should never be
performed to the blues.

102
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:29,750
Or your choice
of furosemide drip over boluses.

103
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,405
It's the only way
to diurese.

104
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,093
Why you choose
interrupted suture

105
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:34,883
for skin closure is beyond me.

106
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:36,977
Or how you told Mrs. Mullins

107
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:38,858
that Cain lied to her.

108
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,967
Mina.

109
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:44,560
I'm giving Barrett a chance

110
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:46,086
to see if he can redeem himself.

111
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,730
I'm not gonna
hold my breath for that.

112
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,202
I'm not asking you to.

113
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:50,961
But I am asking you
to remember

114
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:52,586
that I am still your attending.

115
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:55,397
Well, there's just one more
ground rule.

116
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:57,591
This lounge...

117
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,421
It is the Residents' lounge.

118
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:02,390
Just because you are
dating a resident

119
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,444
does not mean
you have access.

120
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,140
Oh, really?

121
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,319
So it's like that, huh?

122
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:12,421
Yeah, it's like that.

123
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:20,312
I never really liked
the coffee in here anyway.

124
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,775
Hey.

125
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,812
Paged to the ER?

126
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:36,545
Yeah.

127
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,429
Me, too.

128
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:48,057
You okay?

129
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:49,405
Yeah, just...

130
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,897
in my head.

131
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,212
Those home pregnancy tests

132
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:56,899
are 99% accurate.

133
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:59,789
I know, I just, I don't,
I don't feel any different.

134
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:00,970
I'm not tired, I'm not nauseous.

135
00:06:01,054 --> 00:06:03,522
You want to do a blood test
so we're not guessing?

136
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,398
I want to know for sure.

137
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:06,650
Today.

138
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,718
Without anyone else finding out.

139
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,992
What's going on?

140
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,719
Incoming multi-vehicle accident.

141
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:16,156
A dozen cars,
two dead on scene.

142
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,421
Let's get ready.

143
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:20,711
25-year-old male
with blunt abdominal trauma.

144
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:22,562
BP 92/62, pulse 110.

145
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:24,110
Laceration of the left forearm,
bleeding controlled.

146
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:25,743
- What's he have?
- Two liters normal saline.

147
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:27,493
- Let's get him in Bay Three.
- This is so intense.

148
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:29,765
67-year-old male
with burns on his face,

149
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,383
arms, chest and legs.
BP 100/60,

150
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,031
- pulse 120.
- My car caught on fire.

151
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:36,296
- I tried to get out, but...
- Easy, easy. Don't talk.

152
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,952
We're gonna take care of you.

153
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:41,343
That man saved my life.

154
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:46,949
It's Cain.

155
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,445
- Go, I got this.
- Dr. Cain.

156
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,937
48-year-old male.

157
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,452
Ambulance versus pedestrian,
with right shoulder pain.

158
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:55,183
BP 110/80.

159
00:06:55,268 --> 00:06:56,542
Heart rate 120.

160
00:06:56,735 --> 00:06:58,836
I hear you're a hero,
saved one of the victims.

161
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:00,538
No good deed goes
unpunished.

162
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:02,374
Just came out of nowhere.
All right.

163
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:04,852
- On your count.
- All right, we're good... one, two, three.

164
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:06,969
Aah!

165
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:09,162
Get the ultrasound.

166
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:11,115
Yeah, we know the protocol.

167
00:07:15,753 --> 00:07:17,187
Clear breath sounds bilaterally.

168
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:18,623
My airways are fine.

169
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,709
See any free fluid?

170
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:21,960
Negative.

171
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:23,858
Pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.

172
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,623
Touch your fingers together.

173
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,606
Now grab my fingers.

174
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,054
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

175
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,499
Grip strength five out of five
and symmetric bilaterally.

176
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,311
Does this
feel the same as this?

177
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:38,021
Again.

178
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:44,143
This. This.

179
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:49,312
Cain?

180
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,734
Get me to CT.

181
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,938
Talk to me.
Not each other.

182
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,107
I'm the patient.
I'm right here.

183
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,592
<i>Dr. Cain,</i>

184
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,260
<i>put down the tablet.</i>

185
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:14,621
<i>You shouldn't move.</i>

186
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:16,990
<i>It could exacerbate
your injuries.</i>

187
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,678
Scapulothoracic dissociation.

188
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:21,742
My arm must've been yanked
with significant force,

189
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:23,921
ripping the scapula
from my thoracic cage.

190
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:29,552
Tearing the nerves
in my brachial plexus.

191
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:35,532
Can't close my hand.

192
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,989
Can't touch my fingers together.

193
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:44,693
He's gonna need surgery
if he ever wants to operate again.

194
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:47,241
That is a complex procedure,

195
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,061
even for the best
orthopedic surgeon.

196
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:56,521
Page Dr. Voss.

197
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,225
Hey.

198
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,996
Well, that was certainly
a hot mess.

199
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:09,084
- You heard about Cain?
- Yeah.

200
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:10,471
How is he?

201
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:11,896
In imaging.

202
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:13,748
He may be seriously injured.

203
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:15,498
Well, nobody deserves that.

204
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,084
Listen.

205
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,185
I saw Yorn.

206
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:22,789
And?

207
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,226
Did he say
why he hasn't hired a CEO?

208
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,228
They're selling the hospital.

209
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:28,865
God.

210
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,815
Uh, is there a buyer?

211
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,459
I mean, Red Rock's been
a disaster.

212
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,803
I-I don't know,
but any big corporation's gonna

213
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:36,703
put profits over patients.

214
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:38,818
You think we're better off
with the devil we know?

215
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:40,428
I need to show Yorn

216
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,523
that Chastain is worth
a hell of a lot more

217
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:44,033
than he thinks it is.

218
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:47,506
You have a rather unsettling
sparkle in your eye.

219
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:49,865
I'm guessing you have a plan.

220
00:09:50,576 --> 00:09:52,381
Oh, Randolph.

221
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,099
I don't like this.

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,037
Look, we need
to show Red Rock that we can

223
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:00,557
remedy our anemic bottom line
or it's over.

224
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:03,631
And filming a segment
highlighting Chastain's value

225
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:06,225
to the community is
the quickest and best way

226
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:07,593
to get rich people
to write checks

227
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:09,111
and sick people
to flock to us.

228
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:11,053
Surgeries have complications.

229
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:12,637
Things can go wrong.

230
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:15,039
Worse than they have already?

231
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,396
It's Cain.

232
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,217
Don't do anything crazy.

233
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:26,193
And let's keep Red Rock's plans
to ourselves.

234
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:28,936
The last thing we need to do
is panic the staff.

235
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,881
Mm.

236
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,053
Really?

237
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,646
Come on.

238
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:42,193
- Ready?
- Mm, no.

239
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,908
Too bad.

240
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,995
Mm, maybe I should've
married a nurse.

241
00:10:50,756 --> 00:10:51,795
Here.

242
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,939
I won't quit my day job.

243
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,500
We'll know soon.

244
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:02,131
Now all we do is wait.

245
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:08,803
Hey, Doc, how long do I
have to be like this?

246
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:12,412
Mr. McCloud,
your condition is critical.

247
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,732
We need to discuss it.

248
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:18,178
I know I look like a burrito,
but it can't be that bad.

249
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:19,563
I can't even feel any pain.

250
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:21,842
The fire destroyed
your pain receptors.

251
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:24,912
And we're gonna give you fluids
to make you feel comfortable.

252
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:28,959
- But that's all we can offer you.
- Wait a minute.

253
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:31,453
What are you telling me?

254
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:34,811
You might not survive this.

255
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,577
Is there someone we can call
to be with you?

256
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:41,021
I saw that your daughter was on
your emergency contact list.

257
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:42,863
No. No.

258
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:45,366
I don't want Ariana
to remember me like this.

259
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:46,859
You shouldn't be alone.

260
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:48,443
And I'm sure that your daughter

261
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:50,826
- wants to see you.
- My daughter and I... she...

262
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,462
we don't talk much.

263
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:56,303
There have been problems.

264
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:02,514
When I was growing up,
my father was always

265
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:03,867
driving his cab.

266
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:06,029
Nights, weekends,
birthdays, you name it.

267
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:08,615
Then there was this one day
that I asked to ride along.

268
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:10,686
We drove all night.

269
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,701
He let me sit up front, he even
taught me how to spot a fake 20.

270
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:18,021
And then we just
started talking.

271
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:20,765
He spoke to me about India,

272
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,100
what it was like
immigrating to Queens.

273
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:25,535
Starting a family.

274
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,404
We never talked like that again.

275
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,365
When he died,
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

276
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:40,587
What I would do
for just one more day,

277
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:45,545
one more ride,
one more talk with my dad.

278
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:51,100
My point is that maybe your
daughter would feel the same.

279
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:53,967
You don't know our story.

280
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:56,924
It's our story.

281
00:12:57,623 --> 00:12:59,162
It's not yours.

282
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:02,178
Just be my doctor,

283
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,076
and try and get me through this.

284
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:11,951
Okay.

285
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,439
C-spine is cleared.

286
00:13:27,788 --> 00:13:30,139
I know what you're thinking.

287
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:33,983
That this is karma,
the accident.

288
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:37,468
The sooner we operate,
the better chance you have

289
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:39,138
to restore your hand function.

290
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:40,731
That's what
I'm thinking.

291
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,498
I assume you'll be accessing
my brachial plexus

292
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,053
- from my neck?
- Yes.

293
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:48,271
Once I have, we'll decide
on the best approach

294
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:50,710
to reattach your scapula
to your thoracic cage

295
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:51,904
and perform a nerve repair.

296
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:54,507
I want my surgical residents
to observe you in the OR.

297
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:57,610
You don't trust me.
Fine.

298
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,811
There are other
orthopedic surgeons here.

299
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:01,488
No, no, I want you.

300
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:04,546
You're the best.

301
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,889
But I nearly killed
your son-in-law.

302
00:14:08,403 --> 00:14:09,881
Yes, you did.

303
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:13,972
And now I'm gonna try
and save your surgical career.

304
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:23,436
His neck veins are
distended.

305
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,010
Heart sounds are faint.

306
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,364
That combined
with your low blood pressure

307
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:31,850
and tachycardia...

308
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,420
Beck's triad.

309
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:37,240
Which means I have bigger
problems than just my hands.

310
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,468
I have to tell you something,

311
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,032
otherwise I'm going to explode,
but you can't get mushy,

312
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:51,618
and have to agree this
conversation never happened.

313
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:53,599
Okay.

314
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:56,826
I'm seeing someone.

315
00:14:57,332 --> 00:14:58,740
He works here.

316
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:05,959
Well, it's about damn time.

317
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:08,068
Who else knows?

318
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:10,303
Just you and AJ's cats.

319
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:11,881
Oh, my God,
I have so many questions.

320
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:13,896
- When did it start?
- First kiss, your wedding.

321
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:15,218
First hookup,
shortly after that.

322
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:17,237
First fight, here.
Now you're caught up.

323
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:18,754
Wow, you're terrible at this.

324
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,573
I don't know
what else to tell you.

325
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:22,909
He and I are totally
on the same page.

326
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:24,084
Most of the time.

327
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:25,586
But that's another story.

328
00:15:25,754 --> 00:15:27,194
- Now we have ground rules.
- Mm.

329
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,490
- I know all about the ground rules.
- Exactly.

330
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:32,317
I had to tell someone, and
obviously that someone was you.

331
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:35,499
I'm so happy for you.

332
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:36,739
Thank you.

333
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:38,818
Wait. Where are you going?

334
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,513
Man or woman
is fine. They just...

335
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,265
they need a face
for camera, okay?

336
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,351
I'm not looking
for a supermodel, just

337
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:50,444
- someone to share the frame with you.
- I get it, I get it, a face

338
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:53,249
- for camera.
- And a nice, safe surgery.

339
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:54,429
Okay? Nothing too messy.

340
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:55,646
Or... or sad.

341
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,013
- A quick fix with a "ring the Bell" ending.
- Nice and safe...

342
00:15:58,097 --> 00:15:59,850
does not make
for impactful television.

343
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:02,432
- We have to take a risk here, Terry.
- Okay. Okay.

344
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:03,882
A<i> small</i> risk.

345
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,919
On a charismatic patient.

346
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:24,345
Bingo.

347
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:28,779
You look familiar.

348
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:32,373
Are you one of those...
dancing doctors on TikTok?

349
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:36,472
Mr. Mackey.

350
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,733
I'm Dr. Bell, general surgeon
here at Chastain.

351
00:16:38,818 --> 00:16:40,303
I'll be operating
with Dr. Okafor today.

352
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:43,506
- Where's Dr. Nolan?
- There was a schedule change.

353
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,514
Let me get to the big question
right at the top.

354
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:47,865
Will I have a scar?

355
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,685
- A small one.
- A lot of my followers online are ladies, and,

356
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,155
well, let's just say they don't
follow me for my pithy captions.

357
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:54,936
They come for this.

358
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:57,744
And a handful of gents, too,
if I'm being honest.

359
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:59,909
So I got to keep it
looking prime time.

360
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:02,086
Well, Emmett,
I'm not just a doctor

361
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:03,350
here at Chastain.

362
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:06,350
I also... host a TV show.

363
00:17:06,545 --> 00:17:08,732
And I would like to do
a feature on you.

364
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,296
We'd interview you

365
00:17:10,381 --> 00:17:11,858
and then film the surgery.

366
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,624
With your permission, of course.

367
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,188
I love it. Have at it.

368
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:17,447
Exploit me.

369
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:21,368
<i>CT, pick up line 2292.</i>

370
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,521
<i>CT, pick up extension 2292.</i>

371
00:17:23,803 --> 00:17:25,539
Why are there cameras here?

372
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:27,545
I don't want to be filmed.

373
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:30,794
They can't film you
without your consent.

374
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:33,686
Um, your chart said that

375
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:36,047
you have rheumatoid arthritis.
Are you on any medications?

376
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:38,546
Not anymore.
Nothing ever worked.

377
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,554
Hmm.

378
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,791
Sorry.

379
00:17:45,186 --> 00:17:46,219
Where you from?

380
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:47,584
The Midwest.

381
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,881
Oh, my God.

382
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:55,976
No. I'm on television.

383
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:57,272
Take out my IV.

384
00:17:57,357 --> 00:17:58,585
No, we're still waiting
on your lab results.

385
00:17:58,669 --> 00:17:59,956
Hey, don't do that.

386
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,474
Hey!

387
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,508
We need some help over here!

388
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:16,037
Yep, just as expected.
The fluid around your heart

389
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:18,092
is preventing it
from pumping properly.

390
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:19,990
You know I'm a doctor,
too, right?

391
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:25,138
Your pericardial effusion is
growing and causing tamponade.

392
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:26,566
Why didn't you
catch this earlier?

393
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:28,959
When I did your initial
FAST exam in the ER,

394
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:31,138
it wasn't there,
which means

395
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:32,935
two hours ago,
you couldn't even see it.

396
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,655
- So now you drain it.
- Yes.

397
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,826
But you might have
a cardiac or aortic injury

398
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:38,140
- that needs repair.
- My hands are

399
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:39,888
the painfully obvious
priority here.

400
00:18:39,981 --> 00:18:42,036
Heart before hands,
I'm afraid.

401
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,639
How long until I can operate?

402
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:44,967
Just enough time
for me to perform

403
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,513
a pericardiocentesis
and drain.

404
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:47,880
Then he's all yours.

405
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:49,198
Okay.

406
00:18:58,019 --> 00:18:59,443
This is Eva.

407
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,872
She tried to run
when she saw herself on TV.

408
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:03,600
Any explanation?

409
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,622
She's still in Bay One refusing
to answer any questions.

410
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,787
I mean, she understands
that she needs to stay, but...

411
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:11,127
she's still visibly shaken.

412
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:12,975
Head CT's negative.

413
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,381
But the labs show
she's in renal failure.

414
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:16,530
Spiking a fever.

415
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:17,835
I'll send for a new set of labs,

416
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,629
but we're
definitely missing something.

417
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:21,591
I'll try
her emergency contact,

418
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:24,380
see if they can help us
figure out what's going on here.

419
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:28,412
Any news
on that other blood test?

420
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:30,572
The important one to us?

421
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,193
Still waiting.

422
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:34,401
Hi. This is Dr. Hawkins
at Chastain Park Memorial.

423
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm calling about Eva Wolman.

424
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:38,168
We just admitted her.

425
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,380
That's correct.

426
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:45,802
Okay. I understand.

427
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,794
Thank you.

428
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:53,836
The number Eva listed belongs
to an FBI agent.

429
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,161
He's on his way.

430
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:57,053
He says we need to secure
her area.

431
00:19:57,138 --> 00:19:59,241
No visitors.
Direct medical personnel.

432
00:19:59,326 --> 00:20:01,905
I'm guessing she's in some sort
of witness protection program.

433
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,662
Okay, well, then we should get
her a guard and a private room.

434
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:05,639
I'll call security.

435
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:08,901
If someone wanted to hurt Eva,
now they know where to find her.

436
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:19,107
All right, fluid has drained
from your heart.

437
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:21,089
Confirm with echo.

438
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,132
Hmm.

439
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,558
Ham and cheese crepe.

440
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:36,866
I was in the cafeteria,
dining on that savory galette

441
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:40,381
when they told me
Chastain's next recruit

442
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,395
was<i> the</i> Barrett Cain.

443
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,655
The food wasn't inspiring,
but the name was.

444
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,951
Why?

445
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:48,194
Come on, man.

446
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:51,912
Another surgical god
under the same roof?

447
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:54,623
And a brother at that.

448
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,123
I had hoped for...

449
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,745
a colleague,

450
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:01,747
a comrade.

451
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:04,897
But, brother,
you have managed to alienate

452
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:07,753
every single doctor
in this hospital.

453
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:11,839
And even still,
I have my instincts.

454
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:16,161
That hope I felt
is still very much alive.

455
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,522
We know traumatic events
like this

456
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:22,302
can have a profound impact
on one's constitution.

457
00:21:22,568 --> 00:21:25,991
You know? So maybe you come out
on the other side of this,

458
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,521
surgical gifts intact...

459
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:31,294
with a different outlook
on life.

460
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:35,580
Are you testifying against me
in the Mullins lawsuit?

461
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:41,552
You're too proud
not to tell me if it was you.

462
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,198
So who is it?

463
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:48,115
I will tell them
to prep the OR.

464
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,160
♪

465
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:04,857
So, how soon
can we transfer her?

466
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:06,387
We don't know.

467
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:07,629
What do you mean you don't know?

468
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,538
We're trying to figure out
what's wrong with her.

469
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:11,171
Eva wasn't severely injured
in the crash

470
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:12,351
and yet her organs are failing.

471
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:14,550
We need to figure out
what's going on with her.

472
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:18,545
We pulled this
from your cameras.

473
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:19,968
This guy approached
the front desk

474
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:21,062
looking for her room number.

475
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:22,828
When they asked his name,
he disappeared.

476
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:25,162
Let's notify Chastain...
Tell them to report

477
00:22:25,247 --> 00:22:26,287
but not engage him.

478
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:27,896
Should assume he's dangerous.

479
00:22:28,574 --> 00:22:30,178
How much danger is she in?

480
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,820
She testified
against some powerful people.

481
00:22:31,904 --> 00:22:33,255
That's all I can say.

482
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,908
So figure out
what's wrong with her,

483
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,725
'cause she's not safe here.

484
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:43,959
Emmett's crits
are drifting down.

485
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:46,037
He may have a bleed
from his spleen or liver.

486
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:47,319
Surgery is risky,

487
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:49,037
with the potential
for complications.

488
00:22:49,122 --> 00:22:51,272
- Agreed.
- So filming it is unethical.

489
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,185
The patient consented.

490
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,303
Just because he said yes
doesn't make it right.

491
00:22:55,388 --> 00:22:57,561
I think we should attempt
this laparoscopically.

492
00:22:57,646 --> 00:22:59,670
We need to be focused
on what happens in the OR.

493
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,061
Our minds should be fully on
Emmett,

494
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:02,264
- not on cameras, which could...
- My mind is

495
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,100
exactly where
it needs to be.

496
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:06,076
You don't understand...

497
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:08,101
No, I understand. They took
your face off the building,

498
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:10,216
so you had to find
some other place to put it.

499
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,951
I'm a surgeon first.

500
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:13,576
- Mm.
- Not today.

501
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:30,487
Good news.
Your labs are improving.

502
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:35,396
<i>Available RN to Surgical.</i>

503
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:37,514
That looks painful.

504
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,412
Must have been
from the accident.

505
00:23:39,497 --> 00:23:41,115
I've always bruised easily.

506
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,006
No, no, it's okay. It's okay,
it's okay. I just wanna see her.

507
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:50,525
It's all right.
I won't let him hurt you.

508
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:51,984
He's not here
to hurt me.

509
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,400
I'm the one who hurt him.

510
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,932
I think it would be good
for them to talk to each other,

511
00:24:07,016 --> 00:24:08,359
under supervision.

512
00:24:08,552 --> 00:24:10,055
Eva's very happy
to see him.

513
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:12,436
Says they've known each other
their entire lives.

514
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,357
That doesn't mean
he's not a threat.

515
00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:16,601
Until we complete a full
background check on this guy,

516
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:17,866
we keep them separate.

517
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:19,724
- Understood?
- Okay, yeah. Fair enough.

518
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:21,982
- I'll talk to her.
- Mm.

519
00:24:25,776 --> 00:24:28,350
I was moonlighting
at this little dive bar down on

520
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:30,463
Park Street, and, uh...

521
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:33,449
one day, she walked in.

522
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,842
She looked at me, and...

523
00:24:36,927 --> 00:24:39,448
we basically had our first date
right then and there.

524
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:42,115
Only a few months in,
we were already talking

525
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,576
about marriage.

526
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:45,233
I wanted a summer wedding.

527
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,592
Eva hates the cold.

528
00:24:46,677 --> 00:24:49,162
So much that I-I had to get rid
of my Bobcats season tickets.

529
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:51,002
That's how much she hates it.

530
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:53,320
He stopped going
to hockey games.

531
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,338
That's how much he loved me.

532
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,060
And then, one day,
she was gone.

533
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,550
No calls.

534
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,130
Nothing.

535
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,108
She wouldn't return my messages.

536
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:16,464
My friends all said
that I had moved too fast and...

537
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:18,232
I spooked her,
that she ghosted me.

538
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,872
But that didn't make any sense,
'cause we were good together.

539
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:24,787
My sister lives in Atlanta.
So when she texted me

540
00:25:24,872 --> 00:25:25,890
and said that she saw Eva on TV,

541
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:27,685
I just got on
the next flight here.

542
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:29,496
Even if she never wanted
to see me again,

543
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,896
I needed to know why.

544
00:25:31,473 --> 00:25:33,677
I couldn't tell him why.

545
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:40,341
I blew the whistle
at the firm where I worked.

546
00:25:41,177 --> 00:25:43,505
Insider trading.

547
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:46,409
My words sent guys
to prison.

548
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:48,683
FBI said I had to go
into witness protection,

549
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:51,392
and I didn't want
to bring Darren into that.

550
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:55,104
I've been where you are.

551
00:25:55,363 --> 00:25:57,255
I was a whistleblower.

552
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:59,184
Yeah.

553
00:25:59,784 --> 00:26:01,458
And I was afraid
that doing the right thing

554
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:03,488
would hurt someone I love.

555
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:08,519
So, I know the pain
that comes with that.

556
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,912
I didn't want to hurt him.

557
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:14,738
I still don't.

558
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:19,037
But I still think about him.

559
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:21,058
You could tell him that.

560
00:26:23,941 --> 00:26:25,609
Might give you closure.

561
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:27,212
Closure.

562
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:28,503
Yeah.

563
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,630
That could be good
for both of us.

564
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:34,161
- Could you...
- Eva. Eva.

565
00:26:34,354 --> 00:26:37,171
Eva. Squeeze my fingers.
Squeeze my fingers.

566
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:40,620
Call a code stroke!

567
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:43,144
What?

568
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:44,487
What is it?

569
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:47,527
I'm sorry. It's an emergency.
I have to go.

570
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:51,974
Wide... we want
to feel the whole room.

571
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:53,996
Get all the toys,
everything that's...

572
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:56,081
Soon as they land,
tight on Bell.

573
00:26:56,331 --> 00:26:58,856
Get a few shots of the surgery,
but I don't want to see

574
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:00,170
<i>too much mess.
You, I don't want...</i>

575
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:03,006
Hope it's more fun being on your
show than it is watching it.

576
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,675
You've seen it?

577
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:06,118
Once.

578
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:07,847
While folding laundry.

579
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:10,429
You oversimplify science.

580
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:13,394
You referred to a minor study
as "evidence."

581
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,988
And now you're bringing
your entourage into the OR.

582
00:27:16,206 --> 00:27:17,370
Also,

583
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:19,183
you wear too much makeup.

584
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:22,666
His pressure's plummeting,

585
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:23,919
- heart rate's rising.
- He must be bleeding out.

586
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:25,360
We got to move.

587
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:30,007
♪

588
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,019
Hey.

589
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:49,427
You okay?

590
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:52,458
Yeah. I lost a patient.

591
00:27:52,543 --> 00:27:53,964
It was expected,

592
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:55,480
but still...

593
00:27:55,714 --> 00:27:57,625
Is the family here?
I'll notify them for you.

594
00:27:57,794 --> 00:27:59,454
There's no one.

595
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:01,706
He died alone.

596
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:05,943
Sorry.
Losing someone's never easy.

597
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,396
I tried to get him to...

598
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:12,917
call his daughter, talk to her
one last time, but...

599
00:28:14,857 --> 00:28:16,140
I'll get someone
to cover for you.

600
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:17,816
No.

601
00:28:18,557 --> 00:28:19,653
I'm okay.

602
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:21,238
I just need a minute.

603
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:32,777
When do we expect Dr. Voss?

604
00:28:34,355 --> 00:28:35,422
She's late.

605
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,614
She must be wrapping up
her last surgery.

606
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:40,222
Cain's already under.

607
00:28:40,527 --> 00:28:42,744
He always lets us start
without him.

608
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:44,896
He used to say,

609
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:46,389
"How else will we learn?

610
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,158
"Closed eyes mean cut away.

611
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:49,925
No need to wait
for the attending."

612
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,355
I need the practice.

613
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:53,250
10-blade to me.

614
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:55,844
Oh, crap. He's awake!

615
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,456
Up his sedation!

616
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:58,706
Dr. Cain!

617
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:05,340
Dr. Cain, please...

618
00:29:10,061 --> 00:29:11,560
10-blade to me.

619
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:27,131
Uh, Dr. Bell?
A little camera right, please.

620
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:30,990
Perfect.

621
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,913
Spleen is dry.
We should have done an ex-lap.

622
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:40,261
The source of the bleed must be
coming from the liver lac.

623
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,596
Is it coming
from the arteries or the vein?

624
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,640
I still... I can't see a thing.

625
00:29:44,873 --> 00:29:46,248
He's gonna bottom out soon.

626
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,771
Let's try the Pringle maneuver.

627
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:54,774
<i>Transition
team to OR Four. Transition team...</i>

628
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,116
How is she?

629
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:57,873
I wish we had better news.

630
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:01,419
Eva had a mild stroke.

631
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:03,453
Are you saying she could die?

632
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,123
We're monitoring her.

633
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,561
I finally find her after
all this time, and now this?

634
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:10,803
We're doing everything we can,
Darren.

635
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,701
But we need your help.

636
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,178
I don't understand.

637
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:17,072
We don't know Eva,
but you do.

638
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:18,699
Is there anything
about her medical history

639
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:19,724
that you could tell us?

640
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:21,561
Something that could help us
figure this out.

641
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:22,978
Anything out of the ordinary?

642
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,912
I-I-I'm sorry.
Nothing's coming to mind, no.

643
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,545
You know,
when you love someone,

644
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,154
we... dismiss certain things.

645
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:34,279
- Certain quirks become normal.
- Yeah.

646
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:36,606
What about those types
of things?

647
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:40,189
Yeah, yeah. She used to, uh,
try to hide her stress.

648
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:42,685
Um, especially during midterms
or finals.

649
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,558
Not many people could tell,
but I knew.

650
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,327
She used to talk in her sleep.

651
00:30:47,693 --> 00:30:49,482
Sometimes it was creepy,
but...

652
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:51,318
most of the time,
it was pretty hilarious.

653
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:53,232
And she would eat, uh,
odd foods

654
00:30:53,317 --> 00:30:54,639
at weird times.

655
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:56,233
And she would break out
in this, um,

656
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:58,238
purple rash
every once in a while.

657
00:30:58,322 --> 00:31:00,750
But I'm only remembering that
'cause she was so self-conscious

658
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:02,904
- of it.
- Did this rash look like a bruise?

659
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:04,296
U-Uh, yeah. Sort of.

660
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:06,318
And would it come at
a certain time of year?

661
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,256
Now that you mention it, yeah.

662
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:09,331
In the winter.

663
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:10,960
Purpuric lesions.

664
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:12,344
Renal failure. Fever.

665
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:16,940
Combine that with her diagnosis
of rheumatoid arthritis...

666
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,467
Eva, you have a condition
called cryoglobulinemia.

667
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:27,478
It's rare and can be mistaken
for rheumatoid arthritis.

668
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,545
And it's why your meds
never helped.

669
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:31,474
And why you always hated
the cold.

670
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:34,295
Cryoglobulins
are proteins in your blood.

671
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,084
They clump together
during the cold,

672
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:37,604
get trapped
in your blood vessels,

673
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:39,296
like a... like a traffic jam.

674
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:41,047
And why am I so sick
now?

675
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,699
It was cold outside
during the accident

676
00:31:43,784 --> 00:31:45,044
- and you weren't kept warm.
- And the nurse

677
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:47,121
turned the temperature down
in your room

678
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,447
because of your fever.

679
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,532
And this rash is...
It's actually called "purpura."

680
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,459
And it's due
to the cryoglobulins clumping

681
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:53,693
in the vessels in your skin.

682
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,679
And they're doing
the same thing in your brain,

683
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,920
which is why you had
a mild stroke.

684
00:31:58,005 --> 00:32:00,271
But now we can treat you.

685
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,120
We're just gonna get this blood

686
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:04,232
to the lab, confirm it.

687
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:07,623
We'll be right back.

688
00:32:15,364 --> 00:32:17,560
Who told you
to start without me?

689
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,498
We always start
without Dr. Cain, so...

690
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,865
Well, this is my OR.
And in my OR,

691
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,850
residents
never cut unsupervised.

692
00:32:24,057 --> 00:32:25,271
You should have waited.

693
00:32:25,356 --> 00:32:26,549
Step aside.

694
00:32:26,762 --> 00:32:29,088
O2 sats and BP are falling.

695
00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:30,702
- What the hell did you do?
- We just started

696
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:32,538
the dissection.
It was going perfectly.

697
00:32:32,623 --> 00:32:34,040
Well, this situation
says otherwise.

698
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:37,217
You went too deep and punctured
Cain's pleural cavity.

699
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:39,904
We need thoracic.
Page Dr. Austin.

700
00:32:44,854 --> 00:32:46,443
I still don't have
source control.

701
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,032
Activate
massive transfusion protocol.

702
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:49,701
- Get the cameras out of here.
- Just keep rolling.

703
00:32:49,785 --> 00:32:51,194
- Don't stop shooting.
- We got this.

704
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:53,111
Converting to open.

705
00:32:59,966 --> 00:33:01,256
Hold down on the liver.

706
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,250
What next?

707
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,194
Partial hepatectomy.

708
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:08,686
Resecting a part of his liver
could cause more bleeding.

709
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:09,887
He's already lost
half his volume.

710
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:11,279
He can't afford to lose more.

711
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,639
It's a risk we have to take,
and we've got to be perfect.

712
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:15,639
Retractors.

713
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:17,810
Stapler. Blue load.

714
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,631
There it is.

715
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:25,248
- Hepatic vein bleeding.
- Right angle to me.

716
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:28,115
One more staple.
Blue load.

717
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,801
Ligating the vein.

718
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,040
Bleeding stopped.

719
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:47,249
Call down to the blood bank
for more blood products.

720
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:48,665
More suction.

721
00:33:48,918 --> 00:33:50,568
All right, Kit, lay it on me.

722
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,920
Tension pneumothorax.

723
00:33:52,005 --> 00:33:54,220
We decompressed it,
but now he needs a chest tube

724
00:33:54,305 --> 00:33:55,562
and a vessel repair.

725
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:58,681
Which one of you neophytes
punctured Cain's lung?

726
00:33:59,635 --> 00:34:02,048
I need a chest tube. Scalpel.

727
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:05,552
- How's the view?
- Better.

728
00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:07,360
I found the bleeder.

729
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:20,699
All right, normally, this is

730
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:22,983
the part of the story
where he stabilizes.

731
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:25,628
Then why the hell hasn't he?

732
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:32,939
What is this, Bikram ICU?
It's hot in here,

733
00:34:33,024 --> 00:34:34,103
- even for me.
- Well,

734
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:35,660
we have to keep you warm
so this machine

735
00:34:35,744 --> 00:34:38,353
can remove the abnormal protein
from your blood.

736
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:41,307
You're gonna make a full
recovery. And now that you have

737
00:34:41,392 --> 00:34:42,752
a proper diagnosis,
you're gonna feel

738
00:34:42,836 --> 00:34:44,228
better than ever.

739
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:46,048
Thank you.

740
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:00,937
- Hi.
- Hey.

741
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,834
So, on a scale from one to ten,

742
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:07,017
how, um, upset/angry are you?

743
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,769
At the moment,
I'm just glad you're okay.

744
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:22,132
I owe you
a long explanation and...

745
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:27,523
I really missed you.

746
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,087
I guess I thought about you
a little bit, too.

747
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:36,595
Eva...

748
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:39,867
I got a job that I hate

749
00:35:39,952 --> 00:35:41,867
and a special-needs bulldog
that I love.

750
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,708
Would it be crazy
if we came with you this time?

751
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:49,194
Darren, this...

752
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:52,190
isn't a decision
you make in a moment.

753
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:54,171
Trust me.

754
00:35:54,483 --> 00:35:57,046
I've lived it.
You have to be sure.

755
00:35:58,436 --> 00:36:00,500
I would love
for us to be together again,

756
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:03,810
but I understand
if you can't do this.

757
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,186
Don't try to talk me out of it.

758
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:07,711
I'm sure.

759
00:36:22,238 --> 00:36:23,943
That's Mr. McCloud's daughter.

760
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:25,288
He called her before he died,

761
00:36:25,373 --> 00:36:26,732
but she came too late
to see him.

762
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,626
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

763
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:31,577
Hi, I'm Dr. Pravesh.

764
00:36:31,662 --> 00:36:33,163
I treated your father.

765
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,436
I'm...

766
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:37,866
I'm sorry.

767
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:40,843
If it helps,
he wasn't in any pain.

768
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,139
I wanted to see him.

769
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:54,769
It had been too long.

770
00:36:55,616 --> 00:36:57,561
I thought there was time.

771
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,243
At least he called me.

772
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:06,706
We got to talk for a bit.

773
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,991
I got to apologize.

774
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,108
I'm s...
I'm so glad he reached you.

775
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:18,983
And I'm so grateful to you.

776
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:22,972
He said
you convinced him to call.

777
00:37:25,718 --> 00:37:28,874
We always think there's
so much more time, and then...

778
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:32,249
something happens
out of the blue.

779
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,593
I'm so sorry for your loss.

780
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:43,483
I'll send one of our counselors
to come talk to you.

781
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,725
Thank you.

782
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:50,944
Well, as you've seen,
medicine is unpredictable.

783
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:52,812
No matter how much
you prepare,

784
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:57,022
the human body
is full of surprises.

785
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:58,686
How you feeling?

786
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,765
Warm. Tingly.
Like I could hug you.

787
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,553
Well,
that could be the pain meds.

788
00:38:05,811 --> 00:38:07,158
What's your handle?

789
00:38:07,928 --> 00:38:09,366
For Twitter.

790
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,953
- Insta.
- I...

791
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,741
So I can follow you.

792
00:38:13,537 --> 00:38:14,888
I don't do that.

793
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:17,928
Give me your phone.

794
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:24,534
Well, I guess
I'll be doing that.

795
00:38:25,452 --> 00:38:26,929
<i>Every day,</i>

796
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,108
patients walk through the doors
of Chastain

797
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:31,046
with different needs,

798
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:33,775
and our staff is ready.

799
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:37,382
Our doctors and nurses
work tirelessly.

800
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:39,132
They care deeply.

801
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,790
Sacrifice willingly.

802
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,455
This hospital is a cornerstone
of this community

803
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,924
and a center
for medical innovation,

804
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:52,361
and...
that's why I'm so proud

805
00:38:52,447 --> 00:38:54,947
to call
Chastain Park Memorial home.

806
00:38:55,104 --> 00:38:58,026
And cut! Fantastic.

807
00:38:58,111 --> 00:38:59,573
We got it, Dr. Bell.

808
00:38:59,658 --> 00:39:00,895
- All right?
- Yeah.

809
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,853
Hey, thanks, Randolph.
You were right.

810
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,400
This was a smart play.

811
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,743
Thanks.

812
00:39:11,593 --> 00:39:13,783
Bet you're glad
the circus is leaving town.

813
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:15,726
I was wrong.

814
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:18,880
You didn't bring
the cameras here for you.

815
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,758
You're trying to help Chastain.

816
00:39:24,283 --> 00:39:25,970
How bad is it?

817
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:29,776
Bad.

818
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:33,419
You're not the only one
who loves this place.

819
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,022
So, what can we do?

820
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:40,359
What happened in there?

821
00:39:40,899 --> 00:39:42,104
Cardiac tamponade.

822
00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:44,346
I thought he had
a pericardial drain in place.

823
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:46,018
Yeah, he did.
And it clotted.

824
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:48,323
By the time I cracked his chest
and got him on bypass,

825
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:49,768
15 minutes went by.

826
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:51,221
Even with cardiac massage,

827
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,174
there's no way to know
if his brain

828
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,283
was adequately perfused
for those 15 minutes.

829
00:39:55,368 --> 00:39:59,009
But we do know we don't want
survival for survival's sake.

830
00:39:59,337 --> 00:40:02,634
We want our patients to be more
than just a body in a bed.

831
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,251
No matter who it is.

832
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:06,666
- And his hands?
- We'll have to wait

833
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:08,237
to do his brachial plexus repair

834
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,002
when he's stabilized.

835
00:40:10,286 --> 00:40:12,503
Yeah. That's<i> if</i> he wakes up.

836
00:40:16,537 --> 00:40:19,251
I got to go.
Keep me posted.

837
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:37,988
Can we agree that if one of us

838
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:40,751
goes into witness protection,
we both do?

839
00:40:40,953 --> 00:40:42,970
Yep, definitely.

840
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:44,617
With our chickens.

841
00:40:44,712 --> 00:40:45,962
We got to raise them right.

842
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,095
Now that we're clear on that...

843
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:55,362
Are the results in?

844
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,368
Just a click away.

845
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,799
I may have already ordered

846
00:41:01,884 --> 00:41:04,290
a case of nonalcoholic
sparkling cider for you.

847
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:07,852
And a few other things.

848
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:09,127
Like what?

849
00:41:09,212 --> 00:41:10,616
Prenatal vitamins.

850
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,635
Pregnancy pillows.

851
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,408
What?

852
00:41:14,618 --> 00:41:16,470
- Support bands.
- Wow.

853
00:41:16,555 --> 00:41:18,699
- Oils for your stomach.
A heat wrap for your back. - Conrad.

854
00:41:18,783 --> 00:41:20,502
And a foot massager. I know,

855
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:22,651
I jumped the gun
just a little bit, but...

856
00:41:22,736 --> 00:41:25,096
I may have bought
some oils, too.

857
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:27,024
- Huh.
- And some leggings. Lots of leggings.

858
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,967
Oh.

859
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:36,393
I think we're ready.

860
00:41:37,447 --> 00:41:38,811
Let's do it.

861
00:41:49,493 --> 00:41:50,830
It's official.

862
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:54,234
It's official.

863
00:41:56,593 --> 00:41:58,009
Aw.

864
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:03,753
♪

865
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:18,309
Now, that is the only face
I want to see

866
00:42:18,394 --> 00:42:20,370
after the day I had.

867
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:23,990
Our rule was no physical contact

868
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:26,529
inside the hospital.

869
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,396
Yeah, I don't think we ever
locked that one down completely.

870
00:42:30,802 --> 00:42:33,803
Besides, you know rules
are always subject to revision.

871
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:35,037
- Mm-mm.
- No?

872
00:42:35,732 --> 00:42:38,204
Moot, as we're not...

873
00:42:39,177 --> 00:42:41,240
- inside.
- Mm-hmm.

874
00:42:57,365 --> 00:42:58,536
You okay?

875
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,095
Yeah.

876
00:43:00,817 --> 00:43:03,227
But there's something
about Chastain you should know.
