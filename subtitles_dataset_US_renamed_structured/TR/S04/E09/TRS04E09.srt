<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color=#ffff80>"The Resident"...</font>

2
00:00:02,193 --> 00:00:05,205
My husband and I
are adopting.

3
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:06,494
But the last thing
I'm gonna let

4
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:08,775
happen is for you to pull
the same vanishing act

5
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:10,791
- on my kid.
- I'm not going anywhere.

6
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,993
- Just give me another chance.
- I'm willing to watch

7
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:14,227
and see how you do,

8
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,558
but I see no place for you
at Chastain.

9
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,618
<i>It's Cain.</i>

10
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:18,727
He's out for revenge.

11
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,303
And your chance for a visa.

12
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,564
You ruining Mina's life
and career

13
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,065
will not heal you, Barrett.

14
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,643
I'm in Atlanta for
my yearly Moyamoya checkup.

15
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,137
<i>I have a surprise for you.</i>

16
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,146
Is that little prince your son?

17
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:37,487
Uh, it seems you,
Pravesh, could be a father.

18
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,973
There's no way that is my kid.
Nadine would've told me.

19
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:42,250
Are you sure?
She did say she had a surprise.

20
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,535
- That's the definition of a surprise.
- Wait, wait!

21
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:47,627
Shh.

22
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,892
When was the last time you spoke to her?

23
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:56,180
When she went back
to her country, you know,

24
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,204
we spoke every few days.

25
00:00:57,288 --> 00:00:59,158
Then a couple months went by,

26
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:01,516
and-and then she called and said
she wanted to stop it

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,103
and that we should move on.

28
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:04,606
And I...
and-and she was right.

29
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,129
- Mm.
- What?

30
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:08,501
Or she stopped because
she was pregnant.

31
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:10,918
There's no way.

32
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:13,615
All right? It's been,
what, something like...

33
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,915
ten or 11 months.

34
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:16,343
How old do you think
that kid is?

35
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:18,353
I don't... I didn't really get
a good look at him,

36
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:20,530
but I'd say
three or f-four months.

37
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,106
So, mathematically speaking,

38
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,881
it's within the realm
of possibility.

39
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:29,911
Oh, my God,
you know...

40
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:33,485
I-I can't have a kid.
I-I'm a resident.

41
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,195
I have, uh, an apartment
with-with one bedroom.

42
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,955
Nadine and this kid,
they live across the world.

43
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,813
Well, you have to go find out.

44
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,673
No, I-I just need a minute.

45
00:01:41,757 --> 00:01:43,812
Nadine texted earlier
and said that she'd be

46
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,647
at Chastain tomorrow, okay?
So there's time.

47
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,153
Okay.

48
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,936
So you process tonight,
and tomorrow you figure out

49
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,203
whether or not you're a father.

50
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:00,208
So now I've got Mina Okafor
facing imminent deportation.

51
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:03,291
And who knows when Barrett Cain
can start operating again,

52
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,892
or if I'll even allow him to?

53
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:09,843
I'm looking at losing
two of Chastain's best surgeons.

54
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,864
Oh, stop with the ego.

55
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:13,490
I said "two of the best,"
not "the two best."

56
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:15,918
Look, I of all people appreciate
the woes of the CEO,

57
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,904
but can we just put
a pin in this?

58
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:19,978
You should've bought wine.

59
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:23,910
Look, Jake is a man
who walks the OR by day

60
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:25,928
and dive music bars by night.

61
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,111
I-I'm confident
he's a whiskey guy.

62
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,951
A nice Bordeaux is
always in style.

63
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:40,235
Hey, hey. Right on time.
Welcome.

64
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:41,796
Is that whiskey?

65
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:45,540
Gregg makes an amazing
whiskey cocktail.

66
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,041

I'll ask my dad about
his contact at the DOJ.

79
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,737
I have a connection
with Congressman Snyder.

80

I'll make a call tomorrow.

- Mina,

you know who you have to ask for
those research reports you did

84
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:25,548
when you were in Nigeria, right?

85
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:26,973
I'll call my mother tomorrow.

86
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:30,234
For now,
this conversation is over.

92
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,360
Oh.

93
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:50,465
So, Gregg made
the changing table by hand.

94
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:51,955
He spent hours in the garage.

95
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,182
Well, is there anything
you don't have?

96
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,626
Something I could look out for?

97
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,353
Uh, I don't think so.
Baby's due in six weeks.

98
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,780
Think we're all set.

99
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,606
Jake started
getting ready the day

100
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,008
we heard from
the adoption agency.

Oh. The oven timer.

- Oh, yes. I'm starving.

00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:21,492
Rose, we need to run
some more tests, but all signs

136
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:23,805
point to this being
another sickle cell crisis.

137
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,117
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:27,909
I don't know why I said that.
You can go.

00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,375
You didn't sign up

No, no, I can stay.

At least until
your family gets here.

142
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,995
I don't have any family.

143
00:06:57,354 --> 00:07:00,106
Given your chest pain
and degree of hypoxia,

144
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,958
we need to consider
the possibility

145
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:03,610
of acute chest syndrome.

He's with other patients

00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:21,543
- It hurts so much.
- I know.

173
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,331
Should be able to get you
something for the pain soon.

174
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:28,901

00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:30,828
Looks like you're doing
a great job caring for it

176
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:34,606
- even before it's born.
- I'm trying.

177
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:36,948
Before I ask you
any more questions,

178
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:39,244
is there a-anyone
I can call for you?

179
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:41,005
Is this Tina? Tina Miller?

180
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,362
Um, yes.
Do you two know each other?

181
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:47,278
No, I-I don't know
who that is. Uh...

182
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:49,987
- Jake, Jake. Gregg.
- Tina.

183
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,939
Hey. We're here.

184
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,745
Y-You're gonna be fine, honey.

185
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,395
Thank you so much for coming.

186
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,470
- Where's the OB?
- Uh, we just paged her.

187
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,549
Tina, look at
me. I know it hurts.

188
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:03,200
Let's breathe through it, okay?

189
00:09:05,323 --> 00:09:07,901
This is Dr. Bell.
He's my stepfather.

190
00:09:07,985 --> 00:09:11,439
Hi. Uh, thanks for raising him.

191
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:15,073
I've done so much wrong.

192
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:16,666
That's how I ended up here.

193
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,830
But the one thing I got right
was picking Jake and Gregg.

194
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:22,432
They've been amazing.

195
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:26,317
Please. You are doing
the hard work here, okay?

196
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:28,721
As long as y'all are here.

197
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:30,932
And how close
are the contractions?

198
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:34,253
She's not having contractions.

199
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:37,298
Tina's not in labor.

200
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:50,402
Devon.

201
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,485
Nadine.

202
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:00,613
This is Azad.

203
00:10:01,397 --> 00:10:03,282
Azad...

204
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:05,577
Is he...?

205
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:08,556
Wow, you should
see your face right now.

206
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,581
Sit.

207
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:15,750
Devon, no.

208
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,929
He's not yours.

209
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:19,650
He's only two months old.

210
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,817
Wow. Well, sorry, you said
that I would be surprised,

211
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:24,577
and I am.

212
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:26,929
- That was fast.
- I know.

213
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:30,236
When I got home, my father
literally had a man waiting

214
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,969
to meet me when
I stepped off the plane.

215
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:33,046
So you married him?

216
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,506
No. No.

217
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,741
He was old and rich
and terrible.

218
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:41,502
I said, "No
more," but my father didn't listen,

219
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:44,005
and the next man,
he made more sense.

220
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:46,784
Well, Azad, he's...

221
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:49,343
...he's beautiful.

222
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:50,862
Thank you.

223
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,906
I love him so much.

224
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,169
But I'll be honest.

225
00:10:57,295 --> 00:11:01,729
When I first got back home,
I thought about you a lot.

226
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:06,647
But I got through it,
and I'm hoping you did the same.

227
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:08,547
I'm hoping you found
someone amazing.

228
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:10,607
You know how it is.

229
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,942
I've been busy, and just...

230
00:11:13,026 --> 00:11:14,702
Not a lot of time, you know.

231
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:18,171
Well, I have a full day
of scans and bloodwork

232
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:20,800
and appointments,
but this was nice.

233
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:22,877
Maybe we can catch up
more later?

234
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:26,198
- Text me if you have time.
- Uh, will do.

235
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,884
Well, that's disappointing.

236
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:31,929
You had the perfect opportunity
to tell her

237
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:34,357
you were dating
a contessa or something.

238
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:36,434
- Well, that would be a lie.
- Whatever.

239
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:38,361
I think you're disappointed
it's not your baby.

240
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:40,622
You would've liked
having a little Prince Pravesh.

241
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:42,532
I don't need a royal infant.

242
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:45,368
What I need is
some stability in my life.

243
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:46,631
Oh, and by the way, that date

244
00:11:46,715 --> 00:11:48,204
that you engineered for me
last night was terrible.

245
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:50,632
She was uninsured and looking
for free medical advice.

246
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:52,025
Sorry about that.

247
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:54,027
My night was great,
thanks for asking.

248
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:55,637
I locked down
our elopement venue.

249
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:58,365
- Amazing. Where?
- Eloping means it's a secret.

250
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:00,475
And you're sure you don't want
your best friend there?

251
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,794
Eloping also means it's private.

252
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:04,479
All right, well, look,
I really hope

253
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:06,389
to celebrate
with you guys properly.

254
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:09,225
And someday I hope to go
on a date with a woman

255
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:11,227
who isn't looking
for free medical care.

256
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:12,470
Wrong way.

257
00:12:12,554 --> 00:12:14,381
Dude, I'm doing
the best I can do.

258
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:17,043
No, that.

259
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:26,335
Hi, there. I'm Dr. Pravesh.

260
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,486
- Myra.
- Hi, Myra.

261
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,504
This is Dr. Feldman.

262
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:31,155
Tell us what happened.

263
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:33,783
What happened is the nice lady
in the ambulance

264
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:37,662
gave me a shot of the good stuff
and now I'm flying high.

265
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,089
Pain meds will do that.

266
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:41,091
But what happened to get you
into the ambulance?

267
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:44,744
Right, that.
Well, I was cruising along,

268
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:47,004
doing a little business,
and bam.

269
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:48,915
I'm upside down with this.

270
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:50,750
What do you mean,
"doing business"?

271
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:54,588
Mm, fine, I was texting.

272
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,940
But only because
it was an emergency.

273
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:59,609
- Nothing is that urgent.
- Oh. So says a person

274
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:01,352
who isn't
in the business of love.

275
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:03,538
One of my clients
was trying to cancel a date,

276
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:06,190
and Matchmaker Myra
does not let cold feet

277
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:08,210
stop eternal happiness.

278
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:12,473
I set up marriages between
Indian Americans in Atlanta.

279
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:14,732
You don't say.

280
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:16,157
Stop.

281
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,154
Please. I'm all over this.

282
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:20,548
No ring,
a faint look of desperation.

283
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,912
- You're available.
- He definitely is.

284
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:25,135
No, he's not. Myra,

285
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:27,804
before we can fix your arm,
we need to order a CT

286
00:13:27,888 --> 00:13:29,217
to make sure
that you didn't damage

287
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:30,962
anything more serious, okay?

288
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,220
Okay.

289
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:33,632
We'll be back.

290
00:13:33,716 --> 00:13:36,912
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

291
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,056
This is fate. This is kismet.

292
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,892
This is the universe
working to help you

293
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:42,553
- never go on another bad date.
- No.

294
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:44,312
That is texting while driving.

295
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,939
I don't want to be set up.

296
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:51,175
So, what do you
think? Ovarian torsion?

297
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,826
Appendicitis?

298
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,572
Uh, the symptoms
are nonspecific.

299
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:57,481
Uh, guys, I need someone
to speak human, not doctor.

300
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,285
Tina has gallstones.

301
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,582
That's why you're in pain.

302
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,841
Will she be okay?

303
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,919
Well, she has slight gallbladder
wall thickening

304
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:10,605
with pericholecystic fluid.

305
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:12,540
Acute cholecystitis.

306
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:14,585
Again, human please.

307
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:20,681
So, your gallbladder is showing
early signs of infection.

308
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:22,783
And normally we would just
take it out in the OR.

309
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:24,399
What about the baby?

310
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:26,302
That's what
makes this complicated.

311
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,261
Any surgery, even routine,
is a risk for the baby.

312
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:34,698
What about an, uh, IR perc tube?

313
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:37,555
Not an option at the moment
with the recent staff cuts.

314
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:41,114
Okay, uh, if we treat
with antibiotics,

315
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:43,220
we could potentially get her
through this and then

316
00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:46,048
go into surgery
after she delivers in six weeks.

317
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:49,845
Uh, but if-if you don't respond

318
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:52,524
and you worsen,
then we'd be taking you

319
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,141
to surgery in much worse shape.

320
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:57,298
So I put the baby in danger
to save myself

321
00:14:57,382 --> 00:15:00,252
or I put myself in danger
to save the baby.

322
00:15:00,336 --> 00:15:02,156
What do I do?

323
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:07,161
I will talk you through
all your options

324
00:15:07,245 --> 00:15:10,072
so you can make
an informed decision, okay?

325
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:11,925
And we'll be here.

326
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,853
Whatever you decide.

327
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:17,746
Can we call your parents
for you?

328
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,173
No. No.

329
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:21,298
No, don't-don't call my parents.

330
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:23,906
I'm 19 and I can do this
by myself, okay?

331
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,155
O-Of course you can.

332
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,924
You guys don't have to be here.

333
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:30,592
I-I'm sure you have busy lives.

334
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:34,520
Stop. Uh, there is nowhere else
we'd rather be than right here.

335
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:46,697
I got it.

336
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:48,019
You're eloping
at the Four Seasons.

337
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:49,511
Too expensive.

338
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,172
Four Seasons Total Landscaping?

339
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:52,765
Really?

340
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:55,026
I'm just saying,
I'm a really good witness.

341
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,838
Yeah. No.

342
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:02,850
Myra, your CT results are in.

343
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:04,002
You got lucky.

344
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:06,612
A few broken ribs,
but... but nothing major.

345
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:08,447
Oh. That's why my chest hurts.

346
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:10,191
All the nerves
and vessels in your arm

347
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:13,695
are intact, so we can reduce it
and put it back right here.

348
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,638
But don't worry,
we're gonna numb you first.

349
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:17,699
You shouldn't feel any pain
when we put your arm

350
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:19,819
back in place, all right?

351
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:24,205
Oh.

352
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,542
I want to admit you overnight
for observation, okay?

353
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:30,378
Fine. I'll distract myself
by observing you

354
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:33,472
to see if you're worthy
of my matchmaking skills.

355
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:35,233
I don't need matchmaking.

356
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:38,143
How did your parents meet?

357
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:39,570
- Well...
- Allow me.

358
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:41,222
It was an arranged marriage.

359
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:43,500
They were blissfully in love
and produced the bright

360
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:45,025
but stubborn doctor
you see before you.

361
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:48,579
They were lucky
and it was a different time.

362
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:50,398
Now, let's focus
on getting your arm

363
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:51,691
back to where it belongs.

364
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,918
- I'm not ready. I need a minute.
- No thinking.

365
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:56,087
- One, two, three.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

366
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:58,232
Ow!

367
00:16:59,007 --> 00:17:00,424
Ooh.

368
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:03,502
That, uh, wasn't so bad.

369
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:07,598
Seems like the anticipation
was worse than the actual event.

370
00:17:07,682 --> 00:17:10,202
A bit like getting match-made.

371
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:15,273
What happened?

372
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:16,682
Tina's infection
is getting worse,

373
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,044
and the IV antibiotics
aren't working.

374
00:17:19,678 --> 00:17:21,186
Tina, we'll take
good care of you.

375
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,967
Yeah, and we'll see you just as
soon as you're out of surgery.

376
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,694
Jake, I know you've told
a thousand families

377
00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:30,605
their loved one
is in good hands.

378
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:33,532
- It's time for you to trust that.
- Okay.

379
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:35,269
- Okay.
- I got her.

380
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:39,001
Let's find you two
a place to get some fresh air.

381
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,385
How are you feeling?

382
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:57,632
Like the pain meds are working.

383
00:17:57,716 --> 00:18:00,243
You didn't have to stay.

384
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:02,303
You don't have anyone else here.

385
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:06,732
Well, I'm grateful you're here.

386
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:11,096
Being alone for this,
it sucks.

387
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:12,997
Yeah.

388
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:17,093
Sickle cell can be a nightmare.
I know that firsthand.

389
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:19,939
A patient?

390
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:25,176
It was a friend of mine
in medical school.

391
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,161
You know, he was a great guy.

392
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,771
Best person I ever knew.

393
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:31,241
What happened to him?

394
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:35,636
- Oh. I'm-I'm sorry.
- No, no.

395
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,596
I shouldn't have even
brought it up.

396
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,023
Just that you remind me
of him a little bit.

397
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:43,102
Right, because of the whole
impending death thing.

398
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:44,436
No, no.

399
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,356
It's your compassion.

400
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,183
The way you handle yourself
with such grace,

401
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:51,095
even through the pain.

402
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:54,693
You know,
medicine has come a long way

403
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:56,102
since he was
fighting sickle cell.

404
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:58,363
Yeah, that's why I keep going.

405
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:02,701
You know, possibility for
new discoveries on the horizon.

406
00:19:02,785 --> 00:19:05,518
Got to keep your hope up
and all of that.

407
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:09,528
My stomach.

408
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,470
- Her heart rate is spiking.
- Rose, I got you.

409
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,958
Up the pain meds.

410
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,867
We'll get you to CT.

411
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:31,942
Are you sure
we can't call Tina's parents?

412
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:35,625
Uh, to be honest,
we're-we're not actually sure

413
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:37,222
she told them she's pregnant.

414
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,458
She doesn't talk about them.

415
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,933
We get the feeling
there's a rift.

416
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:41,298
Yeah, and legally,
she's an adult,

417
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:44,391
so we have to respect
her wishes.

418
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,536
I can't imagine my children
feeling like

419
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,466
they couldn't tell me
if they were in trouble.

420
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:54,644
- Why is it taking so long?
- Hey, hey.

421
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:57,348
No news can be a good sign.

422
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:00,926
Tell you what.
Why don't I go and see

423
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,308
if I can find out
how it's going, okay?

424
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:05,887
Thanks.

425
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:11,590
Her blood pressure's dropping.

426
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:12,938
What's happening with the baby?

427
00:20:13,022 --> 00:20:14,456
Baby's heart rate's

428
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,257
all over the place.

429
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,853
Oh, signs of fetal distress.
We need OB in here now!

430
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:21,838
Oh, Tina's gallbladder's
adhered to the wall.

431
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,264
Get ready for an open surgery.

432
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,858
Scalpel.

433
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:26,451
We've got to get
this baby out now.

434
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:28,425
- I can get it done in two minutes.
- She's starting to brady.

435
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:29,936
Okay, we don't have two minutes.

436
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,460
Suction.

437
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,472
More sponges.

438
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:40,857
How much longer?

439
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:42,025
Seconds.

440
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,708
She's bottoming out.

441
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:47,482
Almost there, almost there.

442
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,802
The cord's around
the baby's neck.

443
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:53,979
We've lost the mother's pulse.

444
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:56,539
Damn it.
I'm starting compressions.

445
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,389
Baby's clear.

446
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,820
She's not breathing.

447
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:04,248
Give her one of epi, fast.

448
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,335
And save that baby!

449
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:18,721
Baby's in the NICU.

450
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:23,559
And doing great.

451
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:27,230
Thank you.

452
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,576
Fine work, sir.

453
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,331
You saved two lives today.

454
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:58,710
- Hey. Is everything all right?
- How is she?

455
00:21:58,794 --> 00:22:00,361
There were complications.

456
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,240
Tina coded. Dr. Bell had to call
OB for an emergency C-section.

457
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,394
Oh, God.

458
00:22:05,478 --> 00:22:06,712
Dr. Bell saved her.

459
00:22:06,796 --> 00:22:09,138
She's in ICU recovering,

460
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,804
and you have a beautiful
six-pound baby girl.

461
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:17,287
They're both okay.

462
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:18,304
Yes.

463
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:19,622
Oh!

464
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,409
Congratulations.

465
00:22:24,486 --> 00:22:26,494
- Myra.
- Oh.

466
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,817
- How are you feeling?
- All things considered, fine.

467
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:33,340
And I've been
asking around about you.

468
00:22:33,424 --> 00:22:36,656
- Oh, is that so?
- Mm, your coworkers have a lot to say.

469
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,157
And since it's 98% positive,

470
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:40,067
and you've taken
such good care of me,

471
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,087
I've decided to give you
a freebie.

472
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:44,163
I will find the future
Mrs. Pravesh.

473
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:46,567
I really do
appreciate the offer.

474
00:22:46,651 --> 00:22:47,926
Seriously. But no thank you.

475
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,411
It would be a distraction
from the pain.

476
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,007
Don't you think that's
a healthy thing, Dr. Pravesh?

477
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:55,622
Besides, my intuition

478
00:22:55,706 --> 00:22:57,418
and ability to read people
is so spot-on

479
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,829
that I already know
how this is going to end:

480
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,164
You will say yes.

481
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:02,941
So let's save time
and get started.

482
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:05,259
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type. I don't...

483
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,780
Yes, he has a type.

484
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:11,024
Dr. Pravesh's type
is "unavailable."

485
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:13,950
Either emotionally,
geographically or both.

486
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:17,697
Interesting.

487
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:19,015
Next question.

488
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,351
When your
last relationship ended,

489
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:23,870
what did you feel
you were missing out on?

490
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:26,223
Oh, I got this one.

491
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,226
A baby.

492
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:31,854
I'm sorry,
Irving tells me everything.

493
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:44,313
I hope that little girl
knows how lucky she is.

494
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:47,995
She won't. They never do.

495
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:54,157
Her name's Lucy.

496
00:23:56,078 --> 00:23:59,340
Look who just became "Gramps."

497
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,761
I think I like it.

498
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:16,147
My situation is not good.

499
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:18,969
Okay, well...

500
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,260
Got a ton of e-mails
coming in from the community.

501
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:24,094
- I can get more...
- Come on. Let's sit down.

502
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,202
My attorney filed for an appeal,

503
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:42,022
but it will be months before
a decision is made either way.

504
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,951
Visa expires next week.

505
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:48,070
So we fight
and we continue to fight.

506
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:51,958
But if it doesn't work,
I'll be deported.

507
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,868
Then it will be
very unlikely for me

508
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:56,564
to be able to return
to the country.

509
00:24:57,306 --> 00:24:59,966
If I go to Nigeria
on my own accord,

510
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:04,613
I could apply to return
in the future.

511
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:08,716
But it's not a guarantee.

512
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,551
No.

513
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,478
It's not.

514
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:16,480
Which is why I need for you
to prepare for the worst.

515
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:32,832
Your patient Rose has
a splenic sequestration.

516
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,241
It's starting to infarct.

517
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,743
We got to get this
out of her right away.

518
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,654
Well, that's not gonna be easy.

519
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:39,839
She's been transfused
so many times

520
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:42,568
her body destroys
everything we give her.

521
00:25:43,352 --> 00:25:45,770
She can't take
any more transfusions.

522
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:48,088
You're giving me
a patient who needs

523
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,257
an extremely bloody surgery

524
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,760
and asking me
not to spill any blood?

525
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,687
Yep.

526
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:57,333
Got it.

527
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:08,184
A few more hours and
Rose's spleen would have ruptured.

528
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:09,676
I don't think
a sickle cell patient

529
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,944
would have survived
that complication.

530
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:17,169
All right, careful.
We don't want to lose

531
00:26:17,253 --> 00:26:19,090
even a few drops of blood.

532
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:20,895
You forget who
you're operating with.

533
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,965
I'll drop even less than I did

534
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:25,215
with the traumatic
aortic rupture patient

535
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:26,559
we had earlier this year.

536
00:26:26,643 --> 00:26:29,403
Yeah, that was
a rough one, but not as bad

537
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,551
as the IVC tear from
the stab wound last month.

538
00:26:32,635 --> 00:26:33,818
Mm.

539
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:36,819
And yet, we made it work.

540
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:42,169
We always make it work.

541
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,738
Ever since
our first surgery together.

542
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:47,223
Although you had a hissy fit

543
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:49,075
when I asked
for Cooley scissors.

544
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:50,692
Oh, well, now, hold up.

545
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,652
I wouldn't quite call it
a hissy fit.

546
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:56,121
I would describe it
as struggling to find the words,

547
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:59,827
since only a prima donna would
ask for something so specific

548
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:01,254
that early in their training.

549
00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:02,922
But we both know
who the prima donna

550
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:05,439
turned out to be.

551
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:09,295
<i>"Are You Even Real?"
by James Blake playing...</i>

552
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:13,674
I want you to know

553
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:19,582
that you have made me
a better surgeon.

554
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:28,299
Well, don't let it get around,
but I feel the same.

555
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:32,261
And I am a better person
because of you.

556
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,291
And, you know,
the best part of it all

557
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:43,946
is our journey has only begun,
Mina Okafor.

558
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,707
<i>♪ Dream of connection ♪</i>

559
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:51,062
<i>♪ Tell me how you feel,

560
00:27:51,146 --> 00:27:54,457

561
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,125

♪ <i>Tell me how you feel</i> ♪

563
00:27:58,654 --> 00:27:59,887
Perfection.

♪ <i>Are you even real?</i> ♪

565
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:15,420
Oh, this looks good.

566
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:18,785
So, we're not gonna get you up
and walking right away,

567
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:20,589
but it'll be soon, okay?

568
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,657
O-Oh, no.

569
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:28,933
My roommate told my parents,

570
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:31,160
and now they're on their way
up from the lobby.

571
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:32,660
This is so, so bad.

572
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,997
Well, I'm sure they've been
worried about you.

573
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,424
- Uh...
- Tina,

574
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:41,520
do your parents know
that you were pregnant?

575
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:43,840
Y-Yeah.

576
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:48,286
They-they were upset,
like, really upset.

577
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,512
Only way I could
calm them down was by saying

578
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,553
I would give the baby
to a good family.

579
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:58,472
A-A good... traditional family.

580
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,858
You don't understand.

581
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:05,756
Getting pregnant by accident
and going through with it,

582
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:09,305
it was the hardest thing
I've ever done, but...

583
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:12,676
you guys made me feel like
I wasn't a screwup,

584
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,801
like all of this had
a purpose and a meaning.

585
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:18,816
My mom and dad won't
understand any of that.

586
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,512
And it's not just that they'll
stop paying for my life.

587
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:24,792
They... they won't want
to see me anymore.

588
00:29:24,877 --> 00:29:26,714
Well, maybe they're more
open-minded than you think.

589
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:27,897
They're not.

590
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:32,087
I-I know that makes them sound
terrible, but they're my parents.

591
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:35,236
And I can't lose them,
so one of you has to go.

592
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,561
Um, a-and maybe the other one,
someone could pretend to be your wife?

593
00:29:39,646 --> 00:29:42,099
Just-just while they're here.

594
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:45,918
You know, coming out
in the South,

595
00:29:46,002 --> 00:29:50,496
and living in the, in the open
like this...

596
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:54,593
...it's great now,
but it wasn't...

597
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:56,989
wasn't always this easy.

598
00:29:58,273 --> 00:30:01,115
We're not gonna start
her life with a lie.

599
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:06,847
Are you okay?

600
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,425
- Honey, we're here now.
- I'm fine.

601
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:13,446
Uh, Mom and Dad, uh,
th-this is Dr. Bell.

602
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,689
Uh, he-he saved my life.

603
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:16,782
Your daughter's a real fighter.

604
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:19,428
We can't thank you enough.

605
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:22,547
Who are these men?

606
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:25,517
They are the adoptive fathers.

607
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:30,397
I'm sorry?

608
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,775
What?

609
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:56,215
Well, you're...
you're making progress.

610
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,141
What can I do for you, Hawkins?

611
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,994
Your friend Rose came through
surgery with flying colors.

612
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:05,182
Dr. Austin and Dr. Okafor...

613
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:08,435
...they were brilliant.

614
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,850
I'm glad to hear it.

615
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:24,413
Losing Mina would be
a real blow to Chastain.

616
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:27,936
And to a lot of us personally.

617
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:31,670
You do get that
she came at me first, right?

618
00:31:32,311 --> 00:31:33,761
I did what I had to do.

619
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,862
You didn't have to do anything.

620
00:31:40,385 --> 00:31:43,867
It went further than it should
have, I will give you that.

621
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,239
But I'm not alone in this.

622
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,349
Okafor shares
some of that blame.

623
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:58,012
Whatever lets you sleep
at night.

624
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:20,042
I'm sorry, but...
we can't let you have this baby.

625
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:24,018
Dad, please, Jake and Gregg have
been with me through everything.

626
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:27,076
Prenatal visits, ultrasounds.

627
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:28,911
They already named her.

628
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:31,158
You two seem like nice men.

629
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:32,659
It's not personal,

630
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:37,012
but we don't agree with
the lifestyle you've chosen.

631
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:39,389
We haven't chosen anything.

632
00:32:39,473 --> 00:32:41,275
This is who we are.

633
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:45,563
Just like your daughter
is who she was born to be.

634
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:47,475
And she's perfect.

635
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:50,898
Our daughter obviously
has different values than we do.

636
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:53,826
And we hope that that will
change when she grows up

637
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,720
and matures a little bit.

638
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:59,165
In our family,
we believe in traditional values

639
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:00,725
and structure.

640
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:02,335
Tina will have to accept that

641
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:05,396
if she wants to continue
being a part of it.

642
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,000
So if I give them the baby...

643
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,355
...you really will
kick me out of our family?

644
00:33:15,247 --> 00:33:17,091
Uh, you weren't here today,

645
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:21,078
so you didn't... you didn't see
what we witnessed.

646
00:33:21,162 --> 00:33:24,190
Uh, Jake and Gregg held this
little girl for the first time.

647
00:33:24,274 --> 00:33:29,596
And they've-they've hoped and
they planned and they've waited.

648
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:31,772
And I don't know
if you've heard the saying

649
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:36,086
that children and parents
are born on the same day...

650
00:33:36,953 --> 00:33:40,264
...but today,
we saw that happen.

651
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:42,208
That love.

652
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,210
And it's-it's the same love

653
00:33:44,294 --> 00:33:48,140
that you felt the first time
you held Tina.

654
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:52,639
Isn't that the most important
thing here?

655
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:57,941
Let love be what guides you.

656
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:00,560
And let that little girl go home

657
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:03,563
to the family
that already wants her

658
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:07,156
and to the parents
who already love her.

659
00:34:26,336 --> 00:34:28,085
I know you love the ocean.

660
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,078
Almost as much as I love you.

661
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,394
- It's even prettier at night.
- Yeah.

662
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,265
It's incredible.

663
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:40,341
I knew you'd think it's perfect.

664
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,250
We had a big public engagement,
and now we'll have

665
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:44,103
the most private wedding.

666
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:45,846
It's kind of like us.

667
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:49,942
We love big crowds and parties
and game nights, but...

668
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:52,756
We also love quiet nights
at home on the couch.

669
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,515
Just the two of us.

670
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,599
I never doubted you.

671
00:34:57,683 --> 00:35:00,128
You know what's the best part?

672
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:03,530
- You in that dress?
- Yes.

673
00:35:03,614 --> 00:35:08,286
But also, this will always
be our place.

674
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,298
Even when we visit the aquarium
with all the tourists,

675
00:35:12,382 --> 00:35:16,144
we'll have this secret about
what it means, and I love that.

676
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:21,066
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

677
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:28,889
Are you two ready?

678
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:30,557
Jessica, you want to do
this thing?

679
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:34,228
100%.

680
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:37,154
All right. Marry us up.

681
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,060
Okay, you're all set, then.

682
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,229
<i>Dr. Kingsley, call Dr. Braun...</i>

683
00:35:52,313 --> 00:35:53,989
Hey.

684
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:56,676
I was hoping I'd see you again.

685
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,253
- How'd the tests go?
- Everything looks good.

686
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:00,587
They'll see me back in a year.

687
00:36:00,671 --> 00:36:02,983
- Walk me out?
- I'd love to.

688
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:06,593
So, I actually have
a question for you.

689
00:36:06,677 --> 00:36:07,745
Mm?

690
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:10,856
Um, I mean,
you just seem so happy.

691
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,419
Was it weird having your father
choose a husband for you?

692
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:17,771
What's this about?

693
00:36:17,855 --> 00:36:20,849
There's this matchmaker here

694
00:36:20,933 --> 00:36:22,609
who wants to set me up
with someone.

695
00:36:22,693 --> 00:36:25,779
Okay. I get it now.

696
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:28,356
You want to know what
an arranged marriage looks like

697
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,617
in this day and age.

698
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:33,195
- Mm.
- It's like any other marriage.

699
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:38,442
My father made the introduction
but I didn't have to say yes.

700
00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:42,221
And now I can't imagine
a world where I didn't.

701
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:44,706
Because you fell in love.

702
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,950
I did.

703
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:48,561
And if your matchmaker
is good at her job,

704
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:50,955
you might, too.

705
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:53,241
So what have you got to lose?

706
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:58,404
Yes. See? I knew you'd do it.

707
00:36:58,488 --> 00:37:01,482
Okay, so, uh, what's the process
like? What's the timeline?

708
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:04,134
Your to-do list: Send me three
hobbies, three favorite movies

709
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:07,137
- and an example of what makes you laugh.
- What? Why?

710
00:37:07,221 --> 00:37:09,656
Also submit shirt and jacket
photos for my approval.

711
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,992
Those eyes?
I'd go with warm colors.

712
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:15,737
My to-do list:
Look for women who don't mind

713
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:17,147
a slightly uptight type,
contact your mother...

714
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:19,984
Wait, hold on. What does
my mom have to do with this?

715
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:22,761
It's traditional for parents
to be at the first meeting

716
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:23,929
of a prospective couple.

717
00:37:24,013 --> 00:37:26,173
Don't worry,
first you'll look at the photos

718
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:27,415
and résumés I send you.

719
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:29,861
My email address.

720
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,315
Contact me
when you've done everything.

721
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:42,165
- I'm not uptight.
- Please.

722
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:59,023
You're still here.

723
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:01,133
I work here.

724
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:02,784
Or at least, I'm trying

725
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:05,856
to get back to a place
where I can again.

726
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,534
Just wanted to stop by
and check on you before I go.

727
00:38:10,618 --> 00:38:12,536
I think you should sit down.

728
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,480
No, I'm-I'm fine.

729
00:38:14,564 --> 00:38:17,242
I'm saying I'd like the company.

730
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:30,812
I guess I should
thank you for today.

731
00:38:30,896 --> 00:38:31,831
Thank me?

732
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:35,059
I didn't do anything,
except scream

733
00:38:35,143 --> 00:38:39,654
and need help and cause
everyone a lot of extra work.

734
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:44,186
No, you reminded me
that I should keep hope alive.

735
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:47,141
- I needed to hear that.
- Yeah?

736
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:51,461
Well, I needed someone
to pick me off the floor

737
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:56,966
and haul me into the ER,
so... I guess we're even.

738
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,704
That's fair.

739
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,669
I'm only resting.

740
00:39:06,226 --> 00:39:08,387
You stay in that chair.

741
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,479
I'm not going anywhere.

742
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:21,491
- Ready to go?
- Yes, but first,

743
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:25,587
what do you think about
lavender bisque or...

744
00:39:25,671 --> 00:39:28,015
strawberry brûlée or...

745
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,834
- sea-foam margaritas?
- Is this your dinner plan?

746
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:33,595
No, paint names.

747
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,189
Huh?

748
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:38,083
Turns out baby room colors
are very therapeutic.

749
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,768
It's weird, I know.

750
00:39:39,852 --> 00:39:43,179
Ridiculous names, okay colors.

751
00:39:43,263 --> 00:39:46,884
Well, our baby girl needs
a pretty nursery, right?

752
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,754
Yeah, she does.

753
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,676
You're still worried about Mina.

754
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,470
Yeah.

755
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:01,048
She is lucky to have you.

756
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,942
Well, I'm lucky to have her.

757
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,770
And you.

758
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,356
Let's go.

759
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:21,327
Is there anything we can do?

760
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,570
No.

761
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,374
The adoption agency
confirmed it.

762
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:30,378
We can't have her.

763
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:35,490
Yeah, uh, Lucy...

764
00:40:35,574 --> 00:40:41,055
I mean, Tina's baby will go
to a traditional family.

765
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,309
I'm so sorry.

766
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,319
Our baby's still out there.

767
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,441
We just don't know
who he or she is yet.

768
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:55,695
Uh, we did the right thing.

769
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,364
Ah.

770
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:11,618
There she is,
just in time to celebrate.

771
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,845
- Celebrate what?
- Well,

772
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,014
I just hung up with my mother,

773
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,366
and, well,
there's no surprise here,

774
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,444
but she and my dad
absolutely love you.

775
00:41:21,528 --> 00:41:23,446
So...

776
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,115
I'm thinking Italian.
I'm thinking champagne.

777
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,117
I'm thinking a little
fireplace action.

778
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:31,046
I spoke to my mother, too.

779
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,807
Finally. All right, great.
What'd she say?

780
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:38,312
Um, she had been working
in the OR for hours today.

781
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:41,540
There aren't enough
Nigerian surgeons.

782
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,828
The system is crumbling
and people are dying.

783
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:47,212
Yeah.

784
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,990
- It's terrible.
- Mm-hmm.

785
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:54,161
It's because
good Nigerian surgeons leave.

786
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,769
They come to America.

787
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,093
Like me.

788
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,318
I am part of the problem.

789
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:05,247
I thought about
sending supplies,

790
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:09,519
starting an outreach program,
but none of it is enough.

791
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,663
My mother won't always
be able to sustain

792
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:16,401
this many surgeries a day.

793
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:18,852
- She'll need help.
- Yeah.

794
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,020
We'll find her help.

795
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,838
- We'll find mentors in the area.
- No.

796
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:23,098
- No. No.
- We will find her help.

797
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:25,675
- We can find her...
- AJ, AJ, AJ, no.

798
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:29,664
This is the answer
to my visa problem.

799
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,543
It's the answer to everything.

800
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,297
I don't want to fight anymore.

801
00:42:38,197 --> 00:42:42,552
Leave on my own
before I can be deported.

802
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,982
I'm going back to Nigeria.
