this yet, but we're a thing.

Where can I get an
amazing present for Priya?

4
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,874
I'll take that one. This
will definitely work.

You came in here
ready to save lives,

8
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:16,715
but today, you
saved a brain stem

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,967
- 'cause you didn't listen to me.
- You look well.

10
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:21,336
- Atlanta suits you.
- Why are you here, Dad?

11
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:23,806
I'm looking for worthwhile
investment opportunities.

12
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:26,908
Making you CEO was the
smartest thing we ever did.

13

new boss, Marshall Winthrop.

No, no, no, don't. I got it.

People will have to take
care of you for a while, Micah.

Relax and get used to it.

20
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,331
Yeah, the invalid
thing? Not my style.

21
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:51,382
You're ten days

Yeah. I get that.

23
00:00:53,037 --> 00:00:54,703
But you know.

24
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,371
What's wrong?

25
00:00:56,424 --> 00:01:00,275
No one wants to talk
about what's ahead for me.

26
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,294
Tell me the truth.

27
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,356
What's the average life
expectancy of someone

28
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,297
after a heart transplant?

29
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:08,400
You're not average.

You're young and you're strong.

31
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:13,856
Micah, we almost lost you.

32
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:16,442
Let's just enjoy this moment.

Bad doggy.

Bad, naughty little
baby puppy-wuppy.

such a nice night.

Have you arranged for
someone to teach you Bhangra?

would be so much fun.

You can do it for me, can't you?

48
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,835
All right.

49
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,274
You have to make sure
the fish isn't overcooked.

It's good, though, right?

have patients to see.

179
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,406
Take them with.

180
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,314
Impart your wisdom.

181
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:45,150
- Be their Conrad.
- Conrad 2.0.

182
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,268
Uh, no. No. No.

183
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:49,904
Hi. Aaron Holt.

184
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,155
Hey.

185
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,425
- Justin.
- Okay, okay.

186
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,545
Hi. All right. Uh...

187
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,098
Yes, thank you.

188
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,787
You wanted to see me?

189
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,234
No.

190
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:09,957
He did.

191
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,522
In my opinion, it's
wholly inappropriate

192
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,959
for a third year resident to
attend a meeting between the CEO

193
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,481
and the chairman of the board.

194
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,935
We're discussing recent
unfortunate events at Chastain.

195
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,788
Residents are on the
frontline of patient care.

196
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,673
I want my son's input.

197
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,677
Conrad, if you had a magic wand,

198
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,413
what would you do first
to improve the hospital?

199
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:34,093
Easy, weed out
problematic staff.

200
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:36,095
Starting with a resident
who breaks the rules

201
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,485
whenever he damn well pleases?

202
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,848
Excellence comes
from the top down.

203
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,972
What is your plan

204
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,858
- to balance the budget,
Dr. Bell?
- Increase volume.

205
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,989
Screen patients, cut those
at risk for nonpayment.

206
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,157
Every single one of those
ideas threatens patient safety.

207
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,009
This is a business,
it's not a charity.

208
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,699
No money, no mission.

209
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,830
Okay, you want to go
there? Yeah, let's go there.

210
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,894
- How much does he make?
- A million five.

211
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,606
A million five. Why does
Dr. Bell make a million five

212
00:10:58,642 --> 00:11:01,108
when the average hospital
CEO salary is $600,000?

213
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:03,828
I'm not average.

214
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,197
The CEO at Atlanta
General makes $3 million.

215
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,116
We both earn every penny.

216
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:10,963
You have no idea
what this job entails.

217
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:13,182
All ten floors of this
hospital rest on my back.

218
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:16,874
There are 30 departments,
45 surgeons, 200 internists,

219
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,860
ten CT scanners that do not

220
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,662
and will never
pay for themselves.

221
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,632
And while you are feeling
the pain and triumph

222
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,350
of helping a relative few,

223
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,871
I will be thinking of ways
to raise or cut a dollar

224
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,906
so that I can keep you working,

225
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,158
nurses attending,
janitors cleaning,

226
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,543
those machines humming,

227
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:36,989
so Chastain's patients
keep breathing.

228
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:39,647
Exhibit A.

229
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:42,350
A medevac
helicopter coming here,

230
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,570
and not Atlanta General.

231
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,106
Why? Because I pushed Chastain

232
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,525
to buy that air transport
company so it brings patients

233
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,894
to our top-of-the-line,
level one trauma center.

234
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,229
Perfect example of
profits over patients.

235
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,260
Air ambulances used
to be run by the county.

236
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:00,752
Now they're for-profit. You
know how much we charge

237
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,682
for that ten-minute
flight? 40 grand.

238
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:04,400
You could fly around
the world ten times...

239
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,302
Insurance pays.
It's not our problem.

240
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,071
News flash. Millions
of people are uninsured.

241
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,805
That flight could
equal bankruptcy.

242
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,974
- Would they rather be dead?
- Well, that's the option...

243
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,231
- Your money or your life?
- Gentlemen, enough.

244
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,468
I set up this meeting
to find solutions.

245
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,237
Chastain needs
revenue to make payroll.

246
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,707
It also needs to be a
beacon of excellence.

247
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,476
You both have a point.

248
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,278
You're gonna have to
learn to work together.

249
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,393
How long have you been diabetic?

250
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,963
Since I was ten. Three years.

251
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,067
Because you're a minor,
we have to wait on your mom.

252
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,135
Okay.

253
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:54,455
Take a seat, and when she
gets here, come back, okay?

254
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:57,758
14-year-old male,

255
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,395
skating accident,
abdominal trauma, BP 80/40

256
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,314
- and dropping. Pulse is 126.
- All right, Trauma Ten.

257
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,693
- What's his name?
- Jack Alderwood.

258
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,278
- Jack, where's the pain?
- Everywhere.

259
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,622
- Jack! Ja... T-That's our son!
- All right, on a scale...

260
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,750
Sir, we're gonna take
care of him, I promise you.

261
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:12,001
- We just need some space.
- The doctors

262
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,503
are taking good
care of your son.

263
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,793
On a scale of one
to ten, ten being

264
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,112
- the most severe...
- Ten. Can't breathe.

265
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,648
Okay, here's my credit
card and insurance.

266
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,512
- Let's get you
to registration, okay?
- Right now. One, two, three.

267
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,597
We need another large-bore IV.

268
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:28,038
Hang one liter normal
saline, get blood ready.

269
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,523
Trauma to the upper abdomen.

270
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,543
He's distended, diffuse pain.

271
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:36,880
Okay, hang in there,
buddy. You're doing great.

272
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,634
His FAST is positive. Free fluid
everywhere. He's bleeding out.

273
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,769
Hang two units O
neg. Don't worry.

274
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:44,839
We're gonna take care
of you. He needs an OR.

275
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,969
- Where's Nolan?
- Bowel surgery. Busy for another three hours.

276
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,372
- Who's available from trauma?
- I am.

277
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,340
- You're cardiothoracic.
- Well, actually,

278
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,681
I'm triple board
certified... Cardiothoracic,

279
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,629
general and trauma. I'm also IFR
licensed on a twin engine plane,

280
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:58,686
and I can scuba
dive up to 150 feet.

281
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,220
Kill me now.

282
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:04,291
All right, he's out.

283
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,227
Let's get him to OR One.

284
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:13,584
Let's look in on your very first
patient. And don't be nervous.

285
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,402
There are no wrong answers.

286
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:19,540
Mr. Warden, these
are medical students

287
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:21,509
rounding for the
very first time.

288
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:23,088
I'd like them to
listen to your heart.

289
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,523
Would that be
all right with you?

290
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:27,031
- Sure. Have at it, Doc.
- All right.

291
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,557
Heart sounds are
notoriously tricky, but they are

292
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,394
a key diagnostic tool.
So, what do you think...?

293
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,674
I can clearly hear a diastolic
rumble with an opening snap,

294
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,593
which is indicative
of mitral stenosis

295
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,117
secondary to
rheumatic heart disease.

296
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,848
Actually, I hear a crescendo
decrescendo systolic ejection

297
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:50,600
murmur radiating
to the carotids,

298
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,468
with soft S2 and
precordial thrill.

299
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:57,078
You know, I kind of just
think it sounds like Ken-tucky.

300
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,607
And sometimes, it
kind of sounds like

301
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,715
Tennes-see, Tennes-see,

302
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,630
- Tennes-see.
- What do you think?

303
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,723
Um... I didn't really
hear anything abnormal.

304
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,143
I thought I was in for
gallbladder surgery?

305
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,645
You are. You have a
perfectly normal heart.

306
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:18,299
Are you sure? I distinctly
heard a diastolic...

307
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,903
Thank you. Let's go.

308
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:04,090
It's, uh, pretty quiet up here.
Couldn't we go to the ER, OR?

309
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:06,375
See some trauma, you
know, blood and gore?

310
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,928
It's your first day. Just
do what I tell you to do,

311
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:10,596
- no questions asked.
- Heads up.

312
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,853
There's a device rep
in the conference room,

313
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,790
luring in doctors to hear her
sales pitch. Free Thai food.

314
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:17,345
Oh.

315
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,362
Come on in, guys.

316
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,796
- Have some food.
- Thank you.

317
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,780
- Mm-hmm. You're welcome.
- Thank you.

318
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,707
Come on in, Doctor.

319
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,193
I'm Julian Booth,
device rep for Quovadis.

320
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,279
Hi. Uh, Dr. Pravesh.

321
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:40,626
Um... Devon.

322
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,985
I have some cool
gear to show you.

323
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,070
Let's see what you might need.

324
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,800
You're not a surgeon.

325
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:49,489
How do you know that?

326
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,908
It's my superpower.

327
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,022
I can guess a doctor's
specialty at a glance,

328
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,545
even before they know it.

329
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,514
Take your medical students.

330
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,166
Born rad. Destined
to spend his life

331
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,179
inside windowless rooms
with imaging machines.

332
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:02,698
He does look like a submariner.

333
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,054
Mm-hmm.

334
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,574
Okay, what about
that one over there?

335
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,142
Peeds.

336
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:09,905
No way. My money's on derm.

337
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,929
No, I'm right.

338
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,536
That is impressive.

339
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:24,170
Good, right? And your shy
one will probably cure cancer.

340
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:26,172
All right, the one
on the end here.

341
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:28,696
Annoying gunner... neurosurgeon?

342
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,509
No. He'll get his MD,

343
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,900
skip residency and head
straight to Silicon Valley.

344
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:34,563
That's what all the gunners do.

345
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,704
They invent devices like these.

346
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:38,790
Artificial sphincter.

347
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,519
You laugh,

348
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:42,437
but the urologist
who came up with this

349
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,877
hauled down $40 million.

350
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,897
- You're kidding.
- Medical devices

351
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,432
are even bigger than pharma.

352
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,384
Pacemakers, cardiac caths,

353
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,954
cochlear implants,
artificial knees, skin, hips.

354
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,641
I was a dancer until one
day I was hit by a car.

355
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,577
It shattered my pelvis.

356
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:03,209
A total hip replacement
gave me my life back

357
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:04,815
and made me a true believer.

358
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,569
You're interested in ER, right?

359
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,383
Okay, now you're
batting a thousand.

360
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:13,657
You won't be just
a doctor, though.

361
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,042
You're too smart for that.

362
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:18,629
All the best ones do
more than one thing.

363
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,559
Maybe you'll
invent one of these.

364
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:24,918
No. I'm good.

365
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,954
- Thank you.
- You never know.

366
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,690
$40 million.

367
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,011
Jack came through the
splenectomy with flying colors.

368
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,507
- Thank God.
- Oh.

369
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,526
I don't know what we
would do if we lost him.

370
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,650
He's the center of
our world. Jack is

371
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,819
the brightest, kindest...

372
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:46,290
This boy is the only thing
that pulled us through when...

373
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:50,160
Amber, Jack's sister, passed
two years ago from a brain tumor.

374
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:56,417
Am I okay?

375
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:58,314
- Yes, darling.
- Hey, buddy.

376
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,149
You're gonna be fine.
Isn't he, Dr. Hawkins?

377
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:04,208
Yeah. Jack, we had to do a
procedure to remove your spleen.

378
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,978
Spleen filters blood, helps
your body fight infections,

379
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,607
so you'll need a regular
schedule of vaccines,

380
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:10,308
but other than that, you
won't even know it's missing.

381
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,945
Hear that, Mom? It's okay.

382
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,987
She worries.

383
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,958
Why don't you two get some
food while I do a post-op on Jack?

384
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:27,498
Okay, okay.

385
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,650
And thank you, Dr. Hawkins.

386
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,062
Looks like you have
a touch of jaundice.

387
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,186
Is that serious?

388
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,205
Not necessarily.

389
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,840
Tell me about your
weight. Any changes lately?

390
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,559
You're a thin guy.

391
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,595
I just dropped ten pounds.

392
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,364
I wasn't even
trying, but I like it.

393
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,083
How were you feeling before
the accident? Everything okay?

394
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,354
I have been having some
back pain, but it's no big deal.

395
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,367
Probably pulled a
muscle roller dancing.

396
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:11,025
Show me where it hurts.

397
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:29,360
- Ow. Ah.
- I'm sorry to hear
about your sister.

398
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,045
Any other history of
cancer in the family?

399
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,952
My grandfather died young.

400
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,871
I never knew him.

401
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,457
Colon cancer, I think.

402
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:46,777
And Mom had breast
cancer, but she's okay now.

403
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,467
Have to run a few more
tests before I can let you go.

404
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,269
I'll go write up the orders.

405
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:15,155
Can I help you?

406
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,462
Hey, call security.
We got a drug seeker.

407
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,550
Hey! Hey!

408
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:36,526
Okay, every doctor needs
to know how to place an IV.

409
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,562
I want you to
practice on each other.

410
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,534
Good work.

411
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,297
This is child's play.

412
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:48,221
Did all summer in my
Dad's neurosurgery clinic.

413
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,228
Steady. Steady. Steady.

414
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,947
See, this is why you're
going into radiology.

415
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:03,949
Steady.

416
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:05,890
Just watch.

417
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,620
- Feel it. Touch it. There you go, you feel that?
- Uh-huh.

418
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:10,706
- Uh-huh.
- That's the vein. That's where you want to go.

419
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,397
- The pulsing thing.
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:17,295
Lower your hand.

421
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,953
Can I get a new partner?

422
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:20,321
He-he can't find the vein.

423
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,134
Maybe I can help.

424
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:23,457
Here.

425
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:24,970
Try this.

426
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:26,914
It uses infrared
to find the vein.

427
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,712
- Here you go.
- Oh.

428
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:29,907
- There you go, that's
it right there. See it?

429
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,310
That right there?

430
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:33,400
Yeah.

431
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:36,597
Got it.

432
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:42,927
I did it.

433
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,178
T-This device rocks.

434
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:45,846
- Whoa!
- Oh!

435
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,065
You have to remove
the tourniquet first

436
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,933
before you withdraw the needle.

437
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,319
Apply pressure
to slow the bleed.

438
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:55,072
All right.

439
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,607
There you go.

440
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,809
Everything is gonna
be perfectly fine now.

441
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,447
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Whoa, whoa.

442
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:06,178
- You all right? Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

443
00:23:06,202 --> 00:23:08,235
Amazing catch, Conrad.

444
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,953
Don't tell me I guessed right.

445
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:13,223
You ordered a CT with a
pancreas protocol on a 14-year-old.

446
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,575
How in the world did you know?

447
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,205
Uh, the family
history was a red flag.

448
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,896
It was a long shot,
but I had to check.

449
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:23,416
Jack has pancreatic cancer.

450
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:32,092
I know you may not
feel lucky right now,

451
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:34,228
but you are.

452
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:37,364
The accident brought
you into the hospital,

453
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:40,233
and Dr. Hawkins caught it early.

454
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,369
Am I gonna die?

455
00:23:42,405 --> 00:23:45,271
There is every reason to
believe that surgery will be

456
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,874
a total cure.

457
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:48,119
If we get him to
Houston tonight,

458
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:49,721
will MD Anderson
have a room for him?

459
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:52,612
Okay, please let me
know as soon as possible.

460
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:56,050
- Thank you.
- Mr. Alderwood.

461
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:59,219
Randolph Bell, Chief of
Surgery, CEO here at Chastain.

462
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:02,006
I'm so sorry to hear
about your son's diagnosis.

463
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,986
Now, you should know
that Chastain's cancer wing

464
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,487
- is state of the art...
- No, no. MD Anderson

465
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,760
is a top five cancer center.

466
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:07,994
Only the best for Jack.

467
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,474
We need to get him
there as soon as possible.

468
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:12,315
I understand. You know,
we do have a connection

469
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,834
to a helicopter company

470
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,764
that can handle the
transfer to the airport.

471
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,415
They're not cheap.
You might want to check

472
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,720
- with your insurance first.
- No, money is no object.

473
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,076
Well, I'm glad we could help.

474
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:24,873
The next step is
to stage the cancer,

475
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,914
check for metastasis, make
sure Jack's lymph nodes are clear.

476
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,928
Okay?

477
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,886
Thank you.

478
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:38,209
Baby...

479
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,977
You're gonna be okay, okay?

480
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:01,064
♪ ♪

481
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,471
- What's up?
- There's a young girl

482
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:26,485
running around the
hospital. About 12 or 13.

483
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:27,919
I caught her stealing
from the drug cart.

484
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,705
I think she's in withdrawal.
She's blonde, pale.

485
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:31,711
- I'll check Five East.
- Thanks.

486
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:40,570
Hey.

487
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,022
Check me out.

488
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,356
I got it, I got it.

489
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,676
No, Micah, don't!

490
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,426
No, I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

491
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,416
I just twisted it a little bit.

492
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,929
- That's all.
- There's someone in here!

493
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:56,419
- Mina, hurry!
- Go.

494
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,088
Go. I'm fine.

495
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,573
I see legs.

496
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,943
Okay. Careful, careful.

497
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,078
Oh, my gosh.

498
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:11,585
She's alive. Let's
clear her from the door.

499
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,597
- Call a rapid response team.
- Yeah.

500
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:15,701
Nic!

501
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:18,125
She's in here. She's diabetic.

502
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,630
Oh, my God.

503
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,065
She was looking for insulin.

504
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,417
- Is she in DKA?
- Probably.

505
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,548
She tried injecting herself,
but she was too late.

506
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:31,315
All right, let's get her out
of here and find a vein.

507
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,467
If we don't get access,
she's gonna code.

508
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,718
Hey. Just got the call.
What do you need?

509
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:35,959
She's dry.

510
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,223
- Want me to do a central line?
- Yes, but not here. Not sterile.

511
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:40,058
- Let's get her a room.
- I discharged 5027

512
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:41,292
earlier this morning.
Should be clean now.

513
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:42,511
Okay, go to the
crash cart at the end

514
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:43,562
of the hall. Get
me a central line kit.

515
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:45,468
And ask a nurse to help you. Go.

516
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,954
- Okay. One, two, three.
- Three.

517
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,477
No, no, no. Here, here,
here. Just take that.

518
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,762
Got it.

519
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:59,600
- But he said get a nurse.
- I got it.

520
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,603
Pulse is tachy at 130.

521
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:05,572
Here.

522
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:07,252
This is a Foley catheter kit.

523
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:09,004
This is for urine. I
told you to ask a nurse.

524
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,638
No kit, no choice.
We have to do an EJ.

525
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,374
All right. I'm gonna crank the
bed down so she's headfirst.

526
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,898
Prepping for an IO in
case you can't get access.

527
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:17,788
Prepping for an EJ.

528
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,556
Swab, please.

529
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,381
We're in.

530
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,994
All right, let's hang
fluids. Two liters to start.

531
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:35,319
- Wait. Let me get
the blood first.
- Okay.

532
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:47,164
Glucose, 583.
Bicarb, undetectable.

533
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,565
PH, 6.8. She's DKA.

534
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,816
A little longer in a coma,

535
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,129
- she would have died.
- Let's get her to the ICU.

536
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:52,752
She still might.

537
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,879
You're Dr. AJ Austin. I'd
recognize you anywhere.

538
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,715
I'm sure you have a job to do,

539
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,634
but salespeople should not be
roaming the halls of Chastain.

540
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:10,754
The AJ Austin who did an
ascending aortic reconstruction

541
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,890
with a coronary
artery reimplantation

542
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,674
in two hours, skin to skin.

543
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,242
I might be that guy.

544
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,422
Okay, I am that guy,
but I'm still not buying.

545
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,081
No agenda, I swear.
I'm just a fangirl.

546
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,750
Dr. Benedict at Atlanta
General told me all about you.

547
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,680
Said you were the best
student he ever had.

548
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,003
You know Abe?

549
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,504
Quovadis has a fantastic,

550
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,774
new left atrial appendage
occlusion device.

551
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,393
Dr. Benedict has been
putting it in for the past year.

552
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:36,429
I can show it to you
if you're interested.

553
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,010
All right. You got
about five minutes.

554
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:40,733
- Lead the way.
- Great.

555
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,624
I have your lawyer,
Mr. McCrary, line two.

556
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,709
All right. This
is a private call.

557
00:28:49,745 --> 00:28:51,661
There's no need to take notes.

558
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,464
Yeah?

559
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,634
Turns out your
hooker cop was wired.

560
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,186
We aren't gonna get
a not guilty verdict.

561
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:02,099
The arraignment's first
thing in the morning.

562
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:04,391
We'll try to plea bargain.

563
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,459
Look reasonable and contrite.

564
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,874
Judges want to see a defendant
who knows he's made a mistake

565
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:10,580
and won't make another.

566
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,592
Micah?

567
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,279
Are you okay? I...

568
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:27,547
I'm sorry I had to
leave you like that.

569
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:29,299
I'm fine.

570
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,635
I don't want to
be a distraction.

571
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,069
You're a doctor.

572
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,733
I understand you have
important things to do.

573
00:29:34,757 --> 00:29:37,624
You are important.

574
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,594
This isn't working.

575
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,064
I see what's going on.

576
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:45,915
So do you.

577
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,918
We may be a thing, but
we're a brand-new thing.

578
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,005
And this is not what
you signed up for.

579
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,491
I can't be a burden.

580
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:56,922
Dr. Okafor,

581
00:29:56,946 --> 00:29:58,311
please report to OR One.

582
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:00,007
Dr. Okafor, please
report to OR One.

583
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,631
I must go now.

584
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,667
But I am not agreeing with you.

585
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:08,822
No big decisions until
we make one together.

586
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,561
Conrad. Jack's lymph
nodes look clear.

587
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:34,047
The cancer is most likely
localized to the pancreas.

588
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,044
- Okay, that's good news.
- But the trauma.

589
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,029
The accident, it looks
like it started a bleed

590
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:40,020
on the tumor itself. Right here.

591
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,883
It was too small
to pick up before,

592
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,707
but there it is.

593
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:53,767
Stop!

594
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:55,902
He can't fly.

595
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,058
The helicopter's waiting.

596
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,816
His tumor is bleeding
into his abdomen.

597
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,174
He needs to have
the surgery now.

598
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:03,410
You put him on that helicopter,

599
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,365
he dies before he
gets to Houston.

600
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,316
Okay, patient's name
is Jack Alderwood.

601
00:31:10,352 --> 00:31:11,729
Confirmed.

602
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:13,414
Procedure is partial
pancreatectomy.

603
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,333
Surgeon is Dr. Albert Nolan.

604
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:17,757
- Consent form signed?
- Signed and in the chart.

605
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,709
All right.

606
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:21,244
Partial pancreatectomy.

607
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,341
Isn't that right up your alley?

608
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:25,343
I've done over 500
of these in my career.

609
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:26,611
More than anyone
else in Atlanta.

610
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,079
Maybe more than
anyone in the country.

611
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:30,887
Yeah, well, CEO is
an important job, too.

612
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,438
At least, I think it is.

613
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,875
It is.

614
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:39,195
I still miss the OR.

615
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,225
Just keep me updated
on how this goes.

616
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:42,849
I'm here if they need me.

617
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:44,885
Yeah, you got it, boss.

618
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:56,146
Where are your med students?

619
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,431
I sent them home.

620
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:00,700
I'm done babysitting.

621
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:02,301
Thank you, Carol.

622
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,906
That's too bad, Conrad. Oops.

623
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,459
- I mean, Devon.
- I'm not Conrad.

624
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,277
And they're sure not me.

625
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:14,381
That gunner nearly killed Abby.

626
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:16,749
Didn't your first patient
end up brain-dead?

627
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,732
The kid who screwed
up is still here.

628
00:32:20,756 --> 00:32:23,401
He's in the ICU watching
them work on Abby.

629
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:25,375
Thought you should know.

630
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,684
Hang in there, sweetie.

631
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,601
O2 sats dropping.

632
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,473
She's in respiratory failure.

633
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:40,968
Uh, we need to intubate.

634
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,008
Get the kit.

635
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,890
They're putting her on a
vent. She may never recover.

636
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:02,045
We all make mistakes.

637
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,799
I've made plenty.

638
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:10,086
What matters is that
you learn from them.

639
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,204
Poor thing. We got
her name, Abby Arlen,

640
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,572
but we still can't
find her parents.

641
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,063
- I'll go find them.
- Good. Go.

642
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,760
Okay.

643
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,466
Pancreas is fully exposed.

644
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:43,203
Prepare a specimen cup

645
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:45,872
for tissue sample.

646
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,892
They're doing a
resection of the pancreas,

647
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,655
which is a bitch.

648
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,345
The organ is like Jell-O.

649
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:55,031
Soft, warm Jell-O.

650
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:58,901
You cut it wrong, the
whole thing falls apart.

651
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:02,772
You got to cut out that
tumor, leave yourself margins,

652
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,158
keep the tumor cold
when you walk it...

653
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:08,778
Speed walk it,
double-time... To pathology...

654
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:12,515
where the pathologist
runs a stain,

655
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,846
puts the specimen
under a microscope,

656
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,055
and looks for those nasty
little cancerous mites.

657
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:22,058
But you got to do it fast;
time is of the essence.

658
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,977
Our boy is still on the table.

659
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,068
Uh, margins not clear.

660
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,569
Pathologist says to keep going.

661
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,772
It means they didn't
get all the cancer.

662
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:37,702
They have to take another
slice of the pancreas,

663
00:34:37,726 --> 00:34:39,806
and start the whole
process all over again.

664
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,429
Margins still not clear.

665
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:20,283
Margins still not clear.

666
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,050
Margins still not clear.

667
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,840
What's going on?

668
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:46,309
There's hardly
any pancreas left.

669
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,106
They'll have to
remove the entire organ.

670
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,024
Worse still. They
have to resect parts

671
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,193
of the gallbladder, the small
intestine and the bile duct.

672
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,817
It's a Whipple procedure.

673
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,719
Even I've only done a
handful of Whipples in my life.

674
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,449
Dr. Nolan cannot handle this.

675
00:35:58,473 --> 00:36:01,224
You know who
has to do this, right?

676
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,314
Oh, the prince walks into my
office without even knocking.

677
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:09,844
Let's not make this
harder than it needs to be.

678
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,980
I'll make it as hard as I want
to every single time we meet.

679
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,402
I don't care who your father is.

680
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:15,905
We have an emergency in
OR One. The Alderwood boy.

681
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,969
Pancreatic margins keep
coming back cancerous.

682
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:19,442
He needs a Whipple procedure.

683
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:22,962
Back in the day,

684
00:36:22,998 --> 00:36:26,232
you were the unsurpassed master
of the Whipple, but we both know

685
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:29,235
an appendectomy
patient died in your OR.

686
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:32,150
Your complication rates
are through the roof.

687
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:36,175
Can you do this
procedure safely?

688
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,679
I can do it flawlessly,
and it's not your call.

689
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,170
Right angle, Cooley
scissors to me.

690
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,421
Team HODAD.

691
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:36,236
The surgery was more
radical than we'd hoped, but...

692
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:37,804
it went off beautifully.

693
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,983
Thank you, Dr. Bell. And
thank you, too, Dr. Hawkins.

694
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,769
Ah. The most important thing

695
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,237
is that Jack is
likely cancer-free.

696
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,745
And I'll roller
dance again, right?

697
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,230
Absolutely.

698
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,465
Jack, unfortunately,

699
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,062
due to the nature
of your surgery,

700
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:53,080
you will be a diabetic for
the rest of your life, but...

701
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,004
Maybe not the rest of your life.

702
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,440
Scientists are working on
growing organs in the lab.

703
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:58,853
Some day, we may
get you a new pancreas.

704
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,943
Okay, and who are you?

705
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,079
Ms. Booth works
for Quovadis Labs.

706
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,792
It's a cutting-edge
medical device company.

707
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,594
I'd like to show you
our new insulin pump.

708
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:09,986
The drug is delivered
continuously over 24 hours,

709
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,348
and that keeps your blood
glucose levels in range,

710
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,488
even overnight.

711
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,740
How much is it?

712
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:15,495
Around ten grand.

713
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,446
We'll take it.

714
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:21,331
Great.

715
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,270
Is that our new
uninsured patient?

716
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:48,907
I hear she could end up
costing Chastain a fortune.

717
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,530
That's one way to look at it.

718
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:57,316
Or you could see
a 13-year-old girl,

719
00:38:57,351 --> 00:38:59,318
who's fighting for her life.

720
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:01,838
Her name is Abby.

721
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,239
According to her mom,

722
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:08,160
she loves astronomy and Beyoncé.

723
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,580
She's a straight A student,

724
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:13,232
and got diabetes
when she was ten.

725
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,813
Her mom works two jobs

726
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:19,071
but still can't
afford the medicine.

727
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,491
It's over $2,000 a month.

728
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,762
So Abby didn't want
her mom to know

729
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:29,014
that she needed more insulin.

730
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,719
Started rationing her
doses and ended up here.

731
00:39:32,754 --> 00:39:34,937
She gonna make it?

732
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,574
Maybe.

733
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:43,262
Is there any way this
could have been prevented?

734
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,295
Technically, the
hospital's a non-profit.

735
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,114
In order to keep our
tax-exempt status,

736
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,066
we're supposed to have programs
that benefit the community.

737
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,634
- What are we doing now?
- Nothing.

738
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:55,436
Not true. We have
health fairs and flu clinics.

739
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,105
- All kinds of...
- Window dressing.

740
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:58,705
The price of insulin has gone

741
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,414
from $21 a vial to $275,

742
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:03,027
and the drug hasn't
changed one bit.

743
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:05,034
That's a 1,200% increase,

744
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,780
and it's destroying
people's lives.

745
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,187
Mina and I have an idea.

746
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:09,722
Let's hear it.

747
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:11,619
What about an outpatient
clinic for the uninsured,

748
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,371
with community outreach.

749
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:15,623
I used to volunteer for one run
by Partners in Health in Boston.

750
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,407
We'd love to start
something like that here.

751
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:19,127
It could have helped Abby;
we missed that chance.

752
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:20,711
We can't miss
chances like that again.

753
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:21,751
With what funding?

754
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,770
How much would this cost,

755
00:40:23,805 --> 00:40:25,955
and how much would it save?

756
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,102
I need to see data before
making a commitment.

757
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:31,127
Is that a polite
way of saying no?

758
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:32,494
I told you we need balance.

759
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,966
Patient safety and
financial stability.

760
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,396
So get us numbers,
we'll have a look at it,

761
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,603
maybe bring it up at
the next board meeting.

762
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,707
Okay.

763
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,267
I can't say that was a win.

764
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:57,331
It wasn't a no, either. Your
father left us an opening.

765
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:59,515
Yeah, I'll start putting
together the numbers.

766
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,857
Okay. Hey.

767
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,077
Hey.

768
00:41:04,112 --> 00:41:06,128
Maybe it's a good
thing that he's here.

769
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,881
Maybe things will be different.

770
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,462
I'm still giving you an out.

771
00:41:22,497 --> 00:41:24,097
And I'm not taking it.

772
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:27,016
You'll go to rehab,
and you'll get better.

773
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,451
No big decision until then.

774
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,407
You sure you
want to wait for me?

775
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,852
♪ ♪

776
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,968
♪ ♪

777
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:30,363
You told me the judge would
show mercy for a first offense.

778
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:31,714
Luck of the draw.

779
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,249
We caught a hard-ass.

780
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,035
And this will be reported
to the state medical board?

781
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,520
Not exactly.

782
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,906
By law, you now
have to self-report

783
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,041
your conviction
for solicitation.

784
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:44,176
Here are the forms.

785
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:48,164
You're the one who must report
this to the state medical board.

786
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:52,279
You mean, if I
don't file the forms,

787
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,286
they'll never know
I was arrested?

788
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,405
The only way
anyone would find out

789
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:58,052
is if they went to
the police department

790
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,137
and requested a copy
of your criminal record.

791
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,895
Who is ever gonna think of that?

792
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:07,132
I'm a doctor.
