00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:02,162
<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

2
00:00:02,186 --> 00:00:03,518
You're not wearing a ring.

3
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:06,187
I haven't made my decision yet.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,839
You love Micah.

5
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,208
You love Conrad.
You're not getting married.

6
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,044
You know why I stay, don't you?

7
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,246
You're here.

8
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,915
We make a great team.

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,145
Don't you look dapper?

10
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:21,420
- I could say the same thing...
- Shall we?

11
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,722
One of my investigators
was able to locate

12
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,406
a former QuoVadis employee

13
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,154
who witnessed
fraud at the company.

14
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:28,960
Will they come forward?

15
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,432
A special M&M?

16
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,067
Run by Bell.

17
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,436
With the entire board present.

18
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,687
Why?

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,090
Man, I wish I brought popcorn.

20
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,020
Maybe we're gonna get
an update on QuoVadis.

21
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,544
There's nothing to update.

22
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,678
QuoVadis is dead.

23
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,746
We killed it.

24
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,982
Gloriously.

25
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,051
Take your seats, please.

26
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:57,016
I called you here
today because we have

27
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,022
an unusual patient to discuss:
Chastain Park Memorial.

28
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:06,231
Our speaker will explain
exactly how Chastain fell victim

29
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,801
to an unscrupulous
device company.

30
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,603
Former QuoVadis
device rep, Julian Booth.

31
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:21,963
Did you know?

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,233
I thought she was dead.

33
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,548
Thank you, Dr. Bell,
for having me here.

34
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:31,623
I look out today

35
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,908
and I see dedicated
doctors and nurses

36
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:36,962
who come to work each
day to heal their patients.

37
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:39,498
That was my mission as well.

38
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:43,051
But, like Chastain, I
was misled by QuoVadis.

39
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:45,653
The results were harm

40
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,235
and, in some cases...

41
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,590
death.

42
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,856
And the most
frightening thing is

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,345
the fraud committed by QuoVadis

44
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,025
was far too easy to accomplish.

45
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,501
And that is why I'm here
today... So that, moving forward,

46
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,637
we can make sure the devices

47
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:04,272
put into Chastain patients heal

48
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,607
instead of harm.

49
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,578
I can't believe
that you're here.

50
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:11,629
What happened to you?

51
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,299
Gordon's bodyguards
were following me.

52
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,851
I lost control of the car

53
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,786
and I crashed into the river.

54
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:22,758
Almost drowned, but managed
to get out and swim to safety.

55
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:24,387
Yeah, but where have
you been this whole time?

56
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,211
Hiding out in my parents'
house in Savannah.

57
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,765
Why didn't you just let
me know where you were?

58
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,050
I was afraid of what
Gordon would do

59
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,102
if he found out where I was.

60
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:35,820
And I...

61
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,890
I thought you'd be
in Silicon Valley.

62
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,190
No.

63
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,394
I didn't marry Priya.

64
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,697
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,649
It was for the best.

66
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,651
Julian, there is something

67
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:51,806
that we need to talk
about that can't wait.

68
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,341
- Your cat.
- What?

69
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,826
I've been taking care of him.

70
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,395
You have Bailey? Wow.

71
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,080
Uh, thank you.

72
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,385
Uh, so... my shift is over.

73
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,021
If you want to come
by, reunite with Bailey,

74
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:12,140
and talk some more...

75
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:16,244
Sure. I'd love to talk.

You still haven't given
Micah your answer?

90
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,143
I make decisions based
on rational thought,

91
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,978
long-term analysis,

92
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,280
and coldhearted
logic. That takes time.

93
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,160
Emotion needs to
factor into that, too.

94
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,650
Talk later.

95
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,919
Come on, you can't
dodge Micah forever.

96
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,772
He deserves an answer.

97
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,434
I'll handle my
situation with Micah

98
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,959
- if you handle yours with Alec.
- What situation?

99
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,622
You're never at the
clinic when he's there.

100
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:24,229
You're avoiding him. Why?

101
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,247
- Talk later.
- Mm-hmm.

102
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,895
- Am I night owl or
an early bird? Uh-huh.

103
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,969
Well, I guess it
depends on the company.

104
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,254
And how is the company so far?

105
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,568
Let me just say
I'm here for you.

106
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:38,238
Okay. How do you
feel about co-pays?

107
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:40,278
Well...

108
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,466
Are you single?

109
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,772
Uh, I think you're
in the wrong place.

110
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,408
This isn't really speed dating.

111
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:55,459
We're helping
patients find doctors.

112
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,457
Oh, I know. But my
mom's been begging me

113
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:59,561
to find a nice doctor
to bring home, so...

114
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,118
No. Uh, just...

115
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,132
- No.
- Okay.

116
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:08,017
Craziest disease
I've ever treated?

117
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,176
The weirdest place
I've practiced medicine.

118
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,014
Valerie, right?

119
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,010
That gymnast training
for the Olympics.

120
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,447
Doctors who listen
and retain information.

121
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:22,198
It's like Christmas.

122
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,806
Look, uh, my whole life has been
about getting into the Olympics.

123
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,053
I moved away from my
family to train at the best club,

124
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,155
sacrificed having friends,
delayed going to college.

125
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:32,213
But a few weeks ago, I had
some shortness of breath

126
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,843
and dizziness that
came out of nowhere.

127
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,151
And I sprained my
calf a few days ago,

128
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:38,798
but it could be because
of the extra training hours.

129
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:41,400
- Well, to be safe,
we could examine you.
- Hmm.

130
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,110
But which doctor to choose?

131
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,917
Two for the price of one.

132
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,719
Let's see how this shakes
out. So, what's wrong with me?

133
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,316
I didn't hear any
murmurs in your heart

134
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,540
- and your lungs sound clear.
- No signs of edema.

135
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,370
We'll do a CBC
to rule out anemia.

136
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:03,011
We'll run an EKG to
have a look at your heart.

137
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:06,264
Valerie, you did good, girl.

138
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,018
Any pain besides the shoulder?

139
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,889
My back has been giving me
the blues, but that's old news.

140
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,102
I want to check your
gait. Let's take a loop.

141
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,315
Ooh, ooh.

142
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,635
I'd know that bum anywhere.

143
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:32,174
Hello, sweet cheeks.

144
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,187
Mwah.

145
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,961
- First husband.
- You mean best husband.

146
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,548
Well, number two<i> was</i> a bit of a
bore. What are you doing here?

147
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,449
That's between me and my doctor,

148
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,735
not between me, my
doctor and my ex-wife.

149
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,389
We have two children and
a grandchild. I beg to differ.

150
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,074
I bought Josie a scooter,

151
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,642
and I took it for a test
ride and I failed the test.

152
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,489
- Brett...
- Though, to be fair,

153
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,958
that garbage truck
came out of nowhere.

154
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,959
I thought we agreed,
no gifts for Josie

155
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,951
- until her next report card.
- And when did "we" decide that?

156
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,404
When I said, "No gifts for
Josie until her next report card."

157
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,378
Ooh. Careful,
that's a little tender.

158
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,998
Dr. Feldman, what did you feel?

159
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:17,435
Not 100% sure. I'll grab an
ultrasound, get a thorough look.

160
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,422
I got a call from Jessie's
doctors at her rehab.

161
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:22,790
She's fatigued and nauseous.

162
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:24,487
You think this is
residual effects

163
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,177
from the drug trial she was in?

164
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,606
I'm bringing her in
for some bloodwork.

165
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,409
- Let me help you with Jessie.
- Thanks,

166
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,733
- really, but I'm fine.
- Who's picking her up?

167
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:33,935
- Kyle.
- Kyle?

168
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,948
Jessie reconnected with
him. He offered to help.

169
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,441

Kyle offer to help?

Gosh, I missed you, baby girl.

178
00:08:06,136 --> 00:08:08,286
Glad you're doing okay.

179
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,905
- I missed you too, Daddy.
- Hop in. Let's go.

180
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,213
♪ ♪

181
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,621
You broke up with Karen.

182
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,084
How could you
possibly know that?

183
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,502
Your blood pressure's
high, which usually means

184
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:30,992
you started smoking again,

185
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:32,255
and since she was the
only thing between you

186
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,372
and your hand-rolled
Cuban cigars...

187
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:35,296
Damn, she's good.

188
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,982
- Imagine being married to her.
- I liked Karen. What happened?

189
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,584
She wasn't the one.

190
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,020
And once you know
that... why waste time?

191
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,048
A focal dilation in the
aorta about 5.6 centimeters.

192
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,883
Add that to his
abdominal tenderness,

193
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,770
and Brett has an
abdominal aortic aneurysm.

194
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:05,576
I-It's an enlarged area in
the lower part of the aorta,

195
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,780
the major blood vessel that
supplies blood to the body.

196
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,532
Am I gonna die?

197
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,718
It's treatable.

198
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,187
We'll consult with
our surgeons, the best.

199
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,967
Until then, I'm gonna

200
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,552
put you on a drip to get
your blood pressure down

201
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:22,294
and admit you to the ICU.

202
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,346
ICU?

203
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,466
Come on, be straight with
me. Do we need to call the girls?

204
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,452
Yes, but don't worry.

205
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,505
I've got you.

206
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:38,176
That was incredible.

207
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:43,398
- Unless I'm kidding myself.
- No, you're not.

208
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:46,417
That was incredible.

209
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,747
- Then why are you making
a run for it?
- Uh, I'm not.

210
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:51,489
I'm not. I have a-a
meeting later this afternoon,

211
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,724
so I-I, um, I need
to get Bailey home

212
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,743
because he's
clearly pissed at me.

213
00:09:58,148 --> 00:10:00,498
Okay.

214
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,501
Look... I am figuring out

215
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,504
pretty much
everything in my life.

216
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,323
I just don't want you to
get caught up in that mess.

217
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,510
- You deserve better.
- Julian, stay.

218
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:16,631
Okay? Trust me, I am still
figuring out my own mess.

219
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,567
Maybe we do this together.

220
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,202
This was nice.

221
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,957
But I have to go.

222
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:38,369
Given the size and-and potential
for rupture with this triple A,

223
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,087
do you think he needs surgery?

224
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:42,089
Oh, there's no doubt in my mind.

225
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,641
Well, isn't there an alternative

226
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,154
that won't require him
to go under the knife?

227
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:48,012
He's the father of
your children. I get it.

228
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,114
Go on, get a second opinion.

229
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,633
Just quickly circle back to
mine before your first love

230
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:55,469
dies waiting.

231
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,440
This all looks good.

232
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:00,870
You don't have to
run these by me.

233
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,343
Just wanted to make sure.

234
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,058
Look, Nic, you've
been avoiding me

235
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,294
ever since I told you
how I feel about you.

236
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:11,152
No. Look, I just... I have

237
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,304
- a lot going on.
- Hey.

238
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,006
Hey.

239
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,492
Is that Valerie's blood work?

240
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:18,793
You guys sharing a patient?

241
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,189
- Yeah.
- Oh.

242
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,897
Cool. Well, I will
let you get back to it.

243
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,385
Valerie's EKG is normal.

244
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,753
So her heart is fine.

245
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,383
What if the intermittent
shortness of breath

246
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:34,542
and dizziness is a lung
issue... A pulmonary embolism?

247
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,038
Well, Valerie
also has calf pain.

248
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,729
Maybe it's a DVT.

249
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,391
Well, we should get a CT
angio to see what's going on.

250
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:42,534
No, I-I think a CT is premature.

251
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,068
Years on the road has taught me

252
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,332
that speed and efficiency
in diagnosis is key.

253
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:48,284
80 million CT scans
are done a year.

254
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,524
Many of them are unnecessary.

255
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,175
All right, fine.

256
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,377
We'll do it your way.

257
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,396
For now.

258
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,102
I agree with Dr. Austin.

259
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,871
Brett's gonna need surgery.

260
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:06,902
- Well, thank you for
taking a look. Ditto.

261
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,627
It's not every day you get
seen by the hospital CEO.

262
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,545
Happy to do it. Kit's a friend.

263
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,114
When he says "friend,"
does he mean<i> good</i> friend?

264
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,183
- No. Stop it.
- Another F.O.W.?

265
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,247
- I mean, haven't you had
enough of those? F.O.W.?

266
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,754
What am I missing?

267
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:22,056
Stop worrying about me.

268
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,058
Just this once,

269
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:25,993
I'll let you worry about me.

270
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:37,233
All right, I checked upstairs.
They're gonna let me know

271
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,640
when they're ready for
you. How you feeling?

272
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,410
- Tired and just still nauseous.
- Well, if your blood work

273
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,775
- comes back inconclusive, we'll
tag in Conrad. How's he doing?

274
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,509
Things still good
between you two?

275
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,251
Fine. Yeah.

276
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:52,720
Things are... things are great.

277
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:54,567
- How was the drive?
- Traffic jam.

278
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:56,652
We'd still be staring at
bumpers if I hadn't improvised

279
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,110
a well-timed U-turn,
creating my own lane.

280
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,407
Which worked like a charm
until we saw the flashing lights

281
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:03,681
- behind us.
- Yeah, okay, look.

282
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:07,852
I'm developing this app to help
the people who keep us safe.

283
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,656
FBI, firefighters, cops.
It's a dream of mine.

284
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:14,141
So, I get to talking to this
very handsome young officer

285
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:15,788
who pulls us over.

286
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,589
And I told him about
this passion of mine.

287
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:21,098
Nic, ask yourself. What if
law enforcement agencies

288
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,117
could share information

289
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:25,420
ten times faster than
they do right now?

290
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:29,424
Huh? Game changer.

291
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,759
The cop loved the
pitch, and Dad promised

292
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:35,547
to drive like a normal person,
so no ticket, no big deal.

293
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,693
I thought your dream job
was at that real estate firm

294
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,128
after you left your
other dream job

295
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,563
reinventing public
transportation.

296
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,035
Fickle markets.

297
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,121
I read the tea leaves,
and thankfully...

298
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,984
You'll need to know a
lot about programming.

299
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:48,776
Sweetheart, I can hire other
people to dig into the details.

300
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:50,778
Right.

301
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:53,447
- They... are ready for you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

302
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:55,344
Wait, wait, wait. You know what?

303
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,736
What if I converted my app

304
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,688
to help the health
care industry?

305
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:03,123
What do you think?
That sounds amazing.

306
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,125
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

307
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:07,128
We should get going.

308
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,542
You have a deep
vein thrombosis...

309
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,083
A blood clot in your leg.

310
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,201
That's why you
were having calf pain.

311
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,320
Yeah, we want to put
you on blood thinners

312
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,756
to treat this clot and
stop it from getting worse.

313
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,591
Valerie...

314
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,711
you will need to suspend
your training for a few months.

315
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,524
A bad fall could
cause internal bleeding.

316
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:28,182
No. No, if I do that, I won't
be ready for the qualifiers,

317
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:30,178
and I'll miss out on
joining the Olympic team.

318
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,036
Look, I'm 18.

319
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,755
That's old for my sport.
This is my last shot.

320
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,958
We wouldn't ask this of you
if your life didn't depend on it.

321
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,263
Hey, you know, Valerie,

322
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,132
my sister...

323
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:47,635
she had the same condition.

324
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,538
And she was torn between

325
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:53,674
playing professional
basketball...

326
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,710
and taking this treatment.

327
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,630
She chose her
career and lost her life.

328
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,317
I can't watch you
make the same mistake.

329
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,904
Okay.

330
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,624
Give me the blood thinners.

331
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,087
I'm sorry about your sister.

332
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,388
When did she pass?

333
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,856
She lives in Buffalo.

334
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,588
Please tell me you didn't
just lie to our patient.

335
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:31,946
Well, I could, but
that would be a lie.

336
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,671
We don't coerce patients
into treatments they don't want.

337
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,105
Even if it's for their own good

338
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,451
and they don't understand
what they're choosing?

339
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,807
That's why we take the time

340
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,109
to explain it to them.

341
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:46,460
Look, when I treated people

342
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:47,662
in underserved communities,

343
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,074
I didn't have the
luxury of time.

344
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:51,616
I did what I had to do
to save my patient's life.

345
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,629
Yeah, but you're not out
there anymore, are you?

346
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,096
- You're at Chastain.
- Yeah, and maybe

347
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,531
you've been in
here way too long.

348
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,857
Are you sure you were
a medic in Afghanistan?

349
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,092
Oh, I know who I am.

350
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,678
Question is who are you?

351
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,079
I've been summoned.

352
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,921
Must be important.

353
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:16,507
Dad, what's going on?

354
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,711
I'm leaving Chastain.

355
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,695
Leaving?

356
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,981
Why? Was there a
shake-up on the board?

357
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,718
No. I resigned.

358
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,119
I came here to
rebuild our relationship

359
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,221
and we've done that.

360
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,608
Yeah, we just got
to a great place.

361
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:35,493
I know.

362
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,511
And, as a result
of your influence,

363
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,229
I've come to realize

364
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:42,332
that I want to use
my vast resources

365
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,618
to change the medical
industry for the better.

366
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:46,454
But you can do that here.

367
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,072
There's still work to be done.

368
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,557
But there's even more
in the device industry.

369
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,643
I'm considering

370
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,345
- righting the QuoVadis ship.
- What?

371
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,365
- Why?
- I am putting that plan

372
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,967
- together as we speak.
- Dad...

373
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:02,086
I think you are
making a huge mistake.

374
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,316
We should discuss
this over dinner.

375
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,009
It's important to me
that you're on board.

376
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,595
Fine.

377
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,586
Oh, thanks for being here.

378
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,999
I know you have
got a lot on your plate

379
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,372
and more important things to do.

380
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,541
Nothing's more
important than you.

381
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,494
Listen, I'm s-sorry,
I-I just got to ask.

382
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,396
"F.O.W."?

383
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:31,594
If you don't tell me, it's just
gonna keep me up all night.

384
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,034
Brett knows I write my
dance card in pencil.

385
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:37,905
He was asking if you were
my current "flavor of the week."

386
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,740
As an ex-husband,

387
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:42,727
I find it interesting
that Brett cares.

388
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,712
He wants me to be happy.

389
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:48,132
And in his mind, happiness
includes finding someone

390
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,567
to share my life with.

391
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,686
Which is sweet,
considering I broke his heart

392
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:54,304
into a million pieces.

393
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:59,260
I was dedicated to
my career, wanted out.

394
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,912
Didn't have it in me
to end our marriage,

395
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:05,533
so I gave him a
reason to divorce me.

396
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,568
I cheated on him.

397
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:15,392
I s-sometimes wonder if I...

398
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,195
should have fought harder to
have a marriage and a career.

399
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,251
One of them would have suffered.

400
00:18:23,286 --> 00:18:25,436
Yeah, see, people
like you and me...

401
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,054
We believe that.

402
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,956
And here we are.

403
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,757
Alone.

404
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:46,273
Well, it seems appropriate
that we're both here

405
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:48,425
- in the ruins of QuoVadis.
- How so?

406
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,528
The information that you
gave my investigator...

407
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,681
That QuoVadis made
their devices in China...

408
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,117
Started the chain of
events that led to this.

409
00:18:56,152 --> 00:18:58,336
Thank you for convincing
me to come forward.

410
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,032
- Hmm.
- And for not telling anyone

411
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,306
where I was. What
was the final nail

412
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,707
in the QuoVadis coffin?

413
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,159
It was a study.

414
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:06,627
Called "SEVER."

415
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:10,014
20 people were implanted
with a VNS device

416
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,015
and 15 of them died.

417
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,433
Oh, my God.

418
00:19:13,469 --> 00:19:16,504
But my experience here
has shown me that we need

419
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:19,340
medical device companies
that care about their patients.

420
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,309
So I'm thinking...

421
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:23,511
about buying, rebranding

422
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,646
and retooling QuoVadis.

423
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:26,998
Okay.

424
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,298
Uh, but why am I here?

425
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,352
Because I was moved by
your speech at the M&M.

426
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,404
See, I bet on people.

427
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,000
And not the letters
after their name.

428
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:37,875
I wish I could
share your vision,

429
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,338
but I don't know what
I believe in anymore.

430
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:40,739
Yes, you do.

431
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,246
You believe that the industry

432
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,032
needs to be changed.

433
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,351
Gordon used
words just like that.

434
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,736
- Yeah, that's not me.
- That remains to be seen.

435
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,308
I have to do my homework on
you before I give you an answer.

436
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:55,926
Very well.

437
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,111
You'll let me know
what you decide.

438
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:02,266
Administer the anesthesia.

439
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,335
He's having a
hypertensive crisis.

440
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,220
Despite the meds
we've given him.

441
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,056
Systolic pressure's at
250. If we don't stabilize

442
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,240
- his BP...
- He'll bleed out and die
before we make a single cut.

443
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,644
Phentolamine, now.

444
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,049
This is a temporary fix.

445
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:37,596
We can't go forward until we
get his hypertension under control.

446
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,671
Till then, we need
to abort the surgery.

447
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:51,298
She still in there? How
long you think it's gonna be?

448
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,261
Well, these things
can take a while, so,

449
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,325
- if there's somewhere else
you need to be, just go.
- Ouch.

450
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,440
Nic, what's the problem?

451
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,044
Why are you here, Kyle?

452
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,780
I thought you could use
an extra hand with Jessie.

453
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:08,260
An extra hand? Seriously?

454
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:11,435
I was going to Jessie's
parent-teacher conferences

455
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,137
when I was 16.

456
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,766
Where were you when I
had to bail her out of jail

457
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,990
on my prom night, or
when she OD'd last year?

458
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,458
Or the year before that?

459
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,148
- Ah, sweetheart, how'd it go?
- Fine. You know.

460
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:27,067
They won't have the
results till tomorrow.

461
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:28,519
So, um, see you at home?

462
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,349
Yeah, yeah. Call
if there's anything.

463
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:31,666
Oh, we'll be fine.

464
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,535
I got this guy to wait
on me hand and foot.

465
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,692
- Yeah, you do.
- We'll make dinner.

466
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,162
- Love you.
- Love you.

467
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,526
I'm thinking lobster thermidor.

468
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,633
I bet you are.

469
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:55,529
I was a jerk. You were
sweet, and it's not who I am.

470
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:59,400
Not that that's an
excuse, but can I come in?

471
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:04,287
We should have started
with this conversation

472
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,140
and not, you know, sex.

473
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,626
But it happened, and
we can't take it back.

474
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,628
- Would you?
- No.

475
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,630
No. That's-that's not the point.

476
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,634
The point is you
were great and kind.

477
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,671
I want to take
you out for dinner.

478
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,539
My treat.

479
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:26,210
A thank you for
taking care of Bailey.

480
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:29,013
And time for us to
talk about everything.

481
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,310
You, me, what the hell
we're gonna do with our lives.

482
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:32,850
Mostly mine.

483
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,252
- Before you say no...
- I wasn't gonna say no.

484
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:38,188
Good.

485
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,152
How long do you think
he'll be staying with you?

486
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:42,676
You know Kyle. When
things get tough, he'll bail.

487
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:46,013
Not too long ago, the same
could have been said about me.

488
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:49,399
Well, you wanted to
change. He doesn't.

489
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,486
Anyway, enough about my dad.

490
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:53,904
What about yours?

491
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,022
I heard rumors.

492
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,584
They're true.

493
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:00,060
He's leaving Chastain
to pursue a new passion.

494
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:03,664
I don't know. I should be happy.

495
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:06,867
But part of me
just feels like...

496
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,785
Like he's leaving you again.

497
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,471
Yeah.

498
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,185
I need help!

499
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,062
Valerie, what's going on?

500
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,125
I'm scared. I don't
know what's going on.

501
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,193
She has hemoptysis.

502
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:22,899
She needs a CT now.

503
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,903
There's a sharp
pain in my stomach.

504
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:30,035
<i>Add an abdomen pelvis sequence.</i>

505
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,230
Valerie doesn't have a uterus.

506
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,266
Incredible. What's going on?

507
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,312
Her ovaries aren't cystic,
and there's no torsion.

508
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,755
What if they're masses?
They are smaller.

509
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,274
Inflammation caused by
cancer could explain the DVT

510
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,475
and the abdominal pain.

511
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,310
We need to schedule a biopsy.

512
00:23:56,985 --> 00:23:59,219
These are cancerous cells.

513
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:01,888
Well, that explains the
pelvic pain and DVT.

514
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:04,391
Wait, I see sertoli cells.

515
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:08,011
Seminiferous tubules.

516
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:12,199
Are you saying our female
gymnast has testicular cancer?

517
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,701
Did you get sneaky
and go behind my back?

518
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,692
I was supposed to pay for
dinner. That was the deal.

519
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:26,480
Okay, the chef remembered me
from the ER on Valentine's Day.

520
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:27,981
I saved his pinky, which meant

521
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:29,812
he could cook
dinner for his wife.

522
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,763
He insisted on
covering our meal.

523
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:34,354
That's romantic-adjacent.

524
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,640
Pretty impressive.

525
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:42,512
Hey, can I ask you
about your wedding?

526
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,682
I've been secretly
hoping I wasn't the reason

527
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:46,900
it all blew up.

528
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,188
You know, if I was..

529
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,824
Truly in love with Priya,

530
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,309
I wouldn't have
had feelings for you.

531
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:59,045
Now, what I don't know is...

532
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,165
I did and I do

533
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,183
have feelings for you.

534
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:07,404
And now you're back.

535
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,174
With a job offer from
Marshall Winthrop.

536
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,677
I don't know if
I should take it.

537
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:16,546
To be honest, it
scares me a little.

538
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:17,742
Wait, that's a good thing.

539
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,286
If it doesn't scare you, it's
probably not worth doing.

540
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,261
It's our job as parents
to push our kids.

541
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,357
You tell your husband
to get on the train,

542
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:35,549
- but let you drive.
- Oh, yeah.

543
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,501
Oh, I'm so sorry.

544
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,164
You came to see Mr. Winthrop,
and I talked your ear off.

545
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:41,572
Oh, that's okay.
Is-is he available?

546
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,740
Uh, well, you don't
have an appointment,

547
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:46,338
and he has a board
meeting soon, so...

548
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:48,090
Well, good news is I
have another appointment

549
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,224
and a board meeting myself,

550
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:51,532
so I'll just be five minutes.

551
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:56,086
Not to mention my
daughter is dating his son.

552
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,958
Mr. Winthrop, I put Mr. Nevin

553
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,022
- on the schedule
for a quick hello.
- Hey, there.

554
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:06,180
Kyle Nevin. Nic's father.

555
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:08,432
It's great to finally meet you.

556
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,250
A pleasure.

557
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:14,204
Your daughter is the best thing
that's ever happened to my son.

558
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,473
Well, what, uh,
what brings you by?

559
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,475
Marshall...

560
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,811
yeah, I've spent
my entire career

561
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,979
building a brand
with little regard

562
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,531
for anyone other than myself.

563
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:27,651
It's always been
about me. My legacy.

564
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:30,654
Now I find myself
wanting to give back.

565
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,724
So I'm on the cusp of
revolutionizing the way

566
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,909
doctors communicate
with their patients.

567
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:37,889
It's a very personal
venture for me.

568
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:39,657
I'd like to keep
it in the family.

569
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,500
So, I'd love to
explore a partnership...

570
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,436
if you're interested.

571
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:48,405
Unfortunately, I'm not looking

572
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:51,141
for new business opportunities.

573
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:54,127
But I wish you the best of luck.

574
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:56,079
Ah.

575
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,782
Okay.

576
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,500
Thank you.

577
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:03,136
Thank you for your time.

578
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,024
Hey, you know where to find me.

579
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,678
We got to figure out
Brett's hypertension pronto.

580
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,641
We had to put him into a
medically-induced coma.

581
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,283
Well, you just rescanned him.
Tell me you learned something.

582
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,418
A mass in his right adrenal.

583
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:20,203
I think it's a pheochromocytoma.

584
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,156
I mean, it produces hormones
that spike blood pressure.

585
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,354
We paged the lab
to add on plasma

586
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:26,655
and urine
metanephrines to confirm.

587
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,961
How bad is this?

588
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,629
Well, it's-it's bad.

589
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,709
Look at that. The
aneurysm is dissecting

590
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,977
and blocking flow
to the kidneys,

591
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:34,267
so if we don't operate,

592
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:36,164
we risk organ failure
and possibly death.

593
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,056
If they operate on Brett
with an uncontrolled pheo,

594
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,652
he could have a
hypertensive crisis,

595
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:43,843
leading to a stroke,
a brain bleed or...

596
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:45,457
rupture of his aneurysm.

597
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:47,180
This is an impossible choice.

598
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:49,983
And it's-it's one we
don't get to make.

599
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:51,729
This is up to his
power of attorney.

600
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,187
Did he list one on his intake?

601
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,229
He did.

602
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,281
You.

603
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,308
My ovaries are
actually testicles?

604
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,042
That never descended.
It's a genetic condition

605
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:18,061
known as androgen
insensitivity syndrome.

606
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:20,764
The disorder prevented your
male DNA from processing

607
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,699
testosterone in utero.

608
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:24,529
And because you could
only process estrogen,

609
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:26,748
you were born with external
female characteristics.

610
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:30,940
- But now one of those
testicles has cancer. Yes.

611
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,593
But the good news is
the cancer didn't get far.

612
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,779
Once we remove your testes,

613
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:39,616
you have a high
chance of full recovery.

614
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,569
And knowing you, cancer's
the underdog in this fight.

615
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,789
What does this all make me?

616
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,775
- Who am I?
- The same person
you've always been.

617
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,778
Did the testosterone
give me an edge?

618
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,347
Then the Olympic committee
could deem me ineligible.

619
00:28:54,383 --> 00:28:57,100
I just traded one
obstacle for another.

620
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,295
Look, we've only been
together a couple days,

621
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,355
all right? But game
recognizes game.

622
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:04,891
You're like me. You
break down doors.

623
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:07,443
When one closes, we
climb through windows.

624
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,490
Windows won't open, we
barrel through the ceiling.

625
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:12,215
We chew up obstacles and
find a way to move forward

626
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,251
no matter what.

627
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,718
None of that changes,

628
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,302
unless you let it.

629
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,291
So what's it gonna be, Valerie?

630
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:23,293
Let's remove these bad boys.

631
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,208
I have the
Olympics to train for.

632
00:29:29,752 --> 00:29:32,669
What man puts his
life into the hands

633
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,988
of the woman who
broke his heart?

634
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,507
A man capable of forgiveness.

635
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:40,293
I guess that's true.

636
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:43,463
I don't know why
he's forgiven me.

637
00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:45,948
What am I supposed
to do, Randolph?

638
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,934
There is no logical choice.

639
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:51,588
Well, you know, sometimes
logic just goes out the window,

640
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,584
and you have to
trust your instincts.

641
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:59,396
I know Brett
wouldn't want to wait.

642
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:03,762
Send him to the OR.

643
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:05,285
Okay.

644
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,385
<i>Micah, hi.</i>

645
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,771
Wow. I'd nearly given up on you.

646
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:28,558
I've been considering
your proposal.

647
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,212
<i>We need to talk.</i>

648
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,765
I know.

649
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,952
I assume you have your answer?

650
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:42,789
Well, your record appears
to be different from the man

651
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:44,791
you say you are today.

652
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:47,210
I don't take gambles on men
I don't know. Not anymore.

653
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:50,480
Well, I'm sorry you
won't be working for me.

654
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,700
That doesn't mean I
won't take your money.

655
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:57,220
I want to start a nonprofit
that will hold device companies

656
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,322
like QuoVadis and
the FDA accountable.

657
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,759
Something that will become
a solution to this epidemic.

658
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,195
I knew I was right about you.

659
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:13,837
Hey, w-what's going on?
Why do I need to be in the ER?

660
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,373
Your potassium
levels are elevated.

661
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,502
Okay, well, what does that
mean? Am I gonna be okay?

662
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:21,928
Um, we just need to try
to normalize your levels.

663
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,626
- Okay.
- Here, why don't you
lie down here.

664
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,460
Hang a liter and let's get
her up on the monitors.

665
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,102
I need to talk to
Kyle for a second.

666
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,943
You pitched your
thing to Marshall.

667
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,090
You used my name and
put my boyfriend's father

668
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:41,298
in the position to have
to reject your offer.

669
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,634
I mean, do you see how
weird this is for everybody?

670
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,086
- He struck up a conversation.
- You orchestrated this.

671
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:48,049
- That's why you're at Chastain.
- Don't you do this.

672
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,690
- I am here for Jessie.
- You called me weeks

673
00:31:50,726 --> 00:31:52,454
before Jessie
needed to leave rehab.

674
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:53,989
You knew that Conrad's father
was chairman of the board,

675
00:31:54,013 --> 00:31:55,223
and when I didn't
return your call,

676
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,230
you just found another way in.

677
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:59,226
It doesn't mean
I'm not here for her.

678
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,038
Okay, yes, look...

679
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:07,924
I know I crossed a line.

680
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,260
But I'm telling you,
if this app takes off...

681
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:13,441
we'll never have to
worry about money again.

682
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,265
I did this for the two of you.

683
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,666
I can't...

684
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:19,335
It could be my legacy.

685
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,255
You think this app

686
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:23,940
is gonna change your legacy?

687
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,906
Growing up, our school
didn't have your number

688
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,507
for emergencies, they
had our neighbor's.

689
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,158
Even the nurse
knew that our father

690
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,932
couldn't be trusted to be there.

691
00:32:32,968 --> 00:32:36,581
There isn't one person who
relies on you in a time of need.

692
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:39,039
That is your legacy.

693
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,614
Look, Jessie needs
stability, okay?

694
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,485
If that's not you, just leave.

695
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,621
Nic...

696
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:57,924
this time I'm here.

697
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,393
For her, for you.

698
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,568
You're just gonna have to
give me a shot to prove it.

699
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,645
- You mind if I join you?
- Oh, I prefer it.

700
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,675
There aren't enough
bones in this surgery.

701
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,376
I'm bound to get
lost in the weeds.

702
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,512
Well, I can walk you
through it if that's helpful.

703
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:27,837
It is. And thanks again
for being here for me.

704
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:32,298
Well, Brett's under, his blood
pressure seems to be holding.

705
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:34,138
So we're already
off to a great start.

706
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:37,396
You know what's even
more helpful? Honesty.

707
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,965
Don't sugarcoat this.

708
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:40,921
Walk me through
it like a surgeon.

709
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:45,655
So, by manipulating
the pheo, it could release

710
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,057
even more "catecholamine"
hormones into his body,

711
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,876
causing a hypertensive crisis,

712
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:53,513
resulting in a
stroke or rupture.

713
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:55,548
That's more like it. Thank you.

714
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:59,018
Now what's Dr. Austin doing?

715
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:02,083
He's trying to get
control of the distal

716
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:04,441
and proximal abdominal
aorta, and this way,

717
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,687
if the aneurysm ruptures, he
can clamp it off immediately

718
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,778
so Brett doesn't bleed out.

719
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:12,598
Gerald Forceps and
vessel loops for the iliacs.

720
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,183
Right angle to Mina.

721
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,523
Chu, I need you to
max out those drips.

722
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,359
We maxed out two minutes ago.

723
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,957
- Austin, do you have control yet?
- If he can't get control?

724
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,615
He will. These are our
most talented surgeons.

725
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,578
U-Uh, guys, I think
he's gonna stroke out.

726
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,796
- We need to abort. If we
abort now, we'll never get

727
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,449
another shot at this.
It's now or never.

728
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:35,639
Dr. Austin.

729
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,456
Dr. Okafor.

730
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,509
Aortic clamp.

731
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:44,876
We now have proximal

732
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,316
and distal control.

733
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,262
I am ready to open
up that aneurysm sac.

734
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,986
Potts Scissors to me.

735
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:52,455
Nolan, your days of
being a wallflower are over.

736
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,140
Come join the party, brother.

737
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:57,560
Aortic graft is going in.

738
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,964
BP's normalizing.

739
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,084
Brett's almost there.

740
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,571
God, the nonprofit
sounds awesome, Julian.

741
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,318
And you got Marshall on board?

742
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:11,736
- Impressive.
- You should know

743
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,176
that a teeny, tiny part

744
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,277
of what you said was helpful.

745
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,230
Oh, yeah?

746
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:19,077
Which teeny, tiny part?

747
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:22,452
"If it doesn't scare
you, it isn't worth doing."

748
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,021
I lost my life once as a
dancer and then in a job

749
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:26,455
that I settled for.

750
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,142
What scares me is living
a life without meaning.

751
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:34,447
It is inspiring to watch
you dedicate yourself

752
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:36,311
to moving the
needle in health care.

753
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:40,186
- And I know you will.
- I'll have to devote everything

754
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,622
to making this project
work, which means

755
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:46,976
leaving Atlanta and
traveling the world.

756
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,646
I understand.

757
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,267
Now is not our time.

758
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:56,469
Well, eventually,
I'll have my sea legs.

759
00:35:56,504 --> 00:35:58,054
You'll have your research year.

760
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,873
- And who knows what'll happen?
- True.

761
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,359
And we still have tonight.

762
00:36:05,147 --> 00:36:07,067
And I want to
make the most of it.

763
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,764
So we got Valerie all
set up for her surgery.

764
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,402
A hundred says she
wins a gold medal.

765
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,521
I'll put a grand on seeing her
face on a box of cereal one day.

766
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:35,091
Ooh. High roller.

767
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,428
No dice.

768
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,423
She's sharp, you're
probably right.

769
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:44,200
So, listen, about
our disagreement...

770
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,486
Look...

771
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:48,921
we're just two doctors who
do things differently, right?

772
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,102
Which means we probably
shouldn't work together again.

773
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,944
But if you ever
want to grab a beer...

774
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:55,411
Yeah.

775
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,447
I know where to find you.

776
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:06,450
How's Jessie?

777
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:11,011
Well, we stabilized her,
but her kidneys are failing.

778
00:37:11,046 --> 00:37:14,047
Is the damage reversible?

779
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,210
We don't know yet. There
are still more tests to be done.

780
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,551
Sorry to interrupt.

781
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,886
Conrad.

782
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,238
Kyle.

783
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:29,712
I was talking to
Jessie. Do you think

784
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,599
her kidney damage is
related to her opioid use?

785
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:36,385
No. It's most likely
experimental meds she was given

786
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,370
during a drug trial.

787
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:42,258
Well, I-I know we're
gonna get through this.

788
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:45,861
The Nevins will do whatever it
takes to help one of their own.

789
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:51,167
That is, if I'm welcome.

790
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:53,586
Let's go see her together.

791
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:06,682
You've died and
gone to hell, darling.

792
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,265
You'll be in critical
condition for the next week

793

for at least six months.

we're doing at the clinic

866
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:08,768
