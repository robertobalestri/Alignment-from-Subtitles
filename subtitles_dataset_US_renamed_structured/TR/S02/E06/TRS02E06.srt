1
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:03,830
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- Tell me about your mom.

2
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:06,655
- Nic.
- Mom or dad, you pick.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,408
Parents split, my dad
kept me from my mom.

4
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,337
And then she passed
away, you know that.

5
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:13,306
<i>The love of my
life turned out to be</i>

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,690
<i>a psychopathic doctor who
poisoned her own patients.</i>

7
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:19,684
Oh, come on, Bell, we all know

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,640
you're the most
eligible bachelor.

9
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,100
- Jessie.
- I screwed up.

10
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,069
- Look at me, what did you take?
- What's going on?

11
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,659
My sister. She OD'd on oxy.

12
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:31,096
<i>- She could've died.</i>
- Eight months clean.

13
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,565
Happiest I've been in forever.

14
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,268
Just like that I
threw it all away.

15
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,164
We got to get you
better for good this time.

16
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:40,272
Whatever it takes.

17
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,357
I'm such a liability.

18
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:12,587
Trick or treat!

19
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:48,756
Trick or treat.

20
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,278
Trick or treat.

21
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,795
Oh, please.

22
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,201
Aah!

23
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:37,856
Oh... oh, God.

24
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,561
No!

25
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,152
No!

26
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:52,404
- No, no!
- She's having an episode.

27
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:54,623
What's her name?

28
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:56,708
Laurie Dante.

29
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,161
- Can you hear me?
- Laurie, you're okay.

30
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:01,007
Two of Lorazepam
I-M for sedation. Go, go.

31
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,826
She must have dozed off.

32
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,761
She said she
hadn't slept in days.

33
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,162
- Oh, make them stop.
- All right, Laurie,

34
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,219
Laurie. You're
okay. You're safe.

35
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,426
Hey. Laurie.

36
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,194
You're in the hospital.

37
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,445
We'll take care of you, okay?

38
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:24,614
Let's admit her
to the fifth floor.

39
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,621
- And page Conrad, stat.
- Okay.

40
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,896
♪ ♪

41
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:49,511
Guess what this is?

42
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:51,395
I know what that is.

43
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,109
Yeah, but have
you ever tasted it...

44
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,883
The chocolate, caramel, nougat?

45
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:57,769
You're hilarious.

46
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,315
Let's break some
rules, Conrad Hawkins.

47
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,259
- After all, it is Halloween.
- Mmm.

48
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,640
I'm listening.

49
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,559
Get a resident to cover for you.

50
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,194
Pick a costume.

51
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:09,730
I'm thinking something
from the Marvel universe.

52
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,566
Come to Mina's party.

53
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,445
And I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

54
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:16,038
but eat a bunch
of candy with me.

55
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:18,824
That sounds scary.

56
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,225
And amazing.

57
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,127
I wish I could,

58
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,112
- but I can't.
- Mm.

59
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:26,665
We're understaffed.
It's Halloween night.

60
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,099
You know how crazy it can get.

61
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,452
- Are you waiting for someone?
- My dad.

62
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,449
I was supposed to meet him
before work 45 minutes ago.

63
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:35,007
That's strange. Maybe he forgot.

64
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,476
Yeah. Very strange. He
never forgets. Anything.

65
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:39,827
Go.

66
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:40,929
Get out of here.

67
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,075
Have enough fun for both of us.

68
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:44,382
Oh, I plan on it.

69
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,953
Happy Halloween.

70
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,627
I admitted Laurie Dante.

71
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,090
Nightmare girl with
the psychotic breaks?

72
00:04:58,114 --> 00:04:59,197
Yep.

73
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,465
How is she?

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,866
Oh, she's scared.

75
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,168
Conrad's on his way.

76
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,653
Good. I'm off for the night.

77
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,204
The place is all yours.

78
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,268
First Halloween
in the ER. Enjoy.

79
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:09,257
What are these?

80
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:11,543
Costumes. For Mina's party.

81
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,628
I have backups on hand

82
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:16,059
because Mina must approve
before she lets you in the door.

83
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,298
Last year I got rejected.

84
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,551
Twice. But not this year, baby.

85
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,202
This year, I'm money.

86
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,470
What are you gonna be?

87
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,506
Werewolf.

88
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,691
Good luck, buddy.

89
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,573
Concussion. Needs
observation for another four hours.

90
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,146
I got it.

91
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:34,210
Vampire in two should
have stuck to drinking blood.

92
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:35,895
Hang two liters of
saline and discharge

93
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,547
when he can count
backwards from ten.

94
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,532
You suck for taking tonight
off and leaving me here

95
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:42,306
with the most juvenile
med student in history.

96
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,826
I can't argue with you on that
one, but here's the good news:

97
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,528
Halloween is a notoriously
slow night in the ER.

98
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,542
You're a terrible liar.
Now leave, please.

99
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:50,894
Hey, right arm for reattachment.

100
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,034
Patient is still
trapped in his vehicle.

101
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,231
We have to get back to scene.
Dr. Feldman has the details.

102
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,905
- Thank you.
- You knew about this?

103
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,252
The call might have come
in about 15 minutes ago.

104
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,486
I thought it would
be a fun surprise.

105
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,228
You know, trick or treat?

106
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,813
Let's get this arm on ice.

107
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,247
Hold down the fort, Pravesh.

108
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,883
Keep that arm viable
for reattachment.

109
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:12,154
Hmm. Girlfriends?

110
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:14,106
They're cool. I got one myself.

111
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,275
Isn't that your name?

112
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,628
Yeah. What?

113
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:25,033
I cannot believe that you
made these by yourself.

114
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:26,279
Well, when you don't
leave the house very often,

115
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,203
you look for things to do.

116
00:06:28,238 --> 00:06:30,055
How long has it been?

117
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,006
Since I've had a wild night out

118
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,875
or since I got sober?

119
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,410
I'm kidding.

120
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:36,845
Four weeks rehab.

121
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,097
Two weeks sober living.

122
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,615
One week on your couch.

123
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,068
- Well, I am proud of you.
- Thank you.

124
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,130
And thanks for inviting me
tonight. I'm really excited.

125
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,116
Are you kidding me?
The costume's at Mina's

126
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,223
Halloween parties are legendary.

127
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:52,043
Everybody should
experience it at least once.

128
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,429
Well, I know you're
worried about me staying

129
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,159
son the straight and
narrow, but I just want to say,

130
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,043
I'm not just doing
this for me anymore,

131
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,596
I'm staying clean
for both of us. Okay?

132
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,904
I'm not worried.
Do I look worried?

133
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,473
Yeah, you have like
a resting worried face.

134
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,448
Laurie, I'm Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

135
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:16,835
I'm here to help, okay?

136
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,089
I'm really sorry.

137
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,904
This is embarrassing, actually.
I-I just have bad dreams.

138
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:26,906
You have people
who need you. I...

139
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,025
I'm not even sure I should
have come in. I'm-I'm fine.

140
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,016
Laurie, I'm happy you're here,

141
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,745
because I'd like to make
sure it's nothing serious.

142
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,136
Sound like a plan?

143
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:36,938
All right, tell me...

144
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,408
When'd you start
having these episodes?

145
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,510
Uh, couple weeks ago.

146
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,363
I figured they'd just go away,
but they keep happening.

147
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,915
Getting more intense.

148
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,250
Now...

149
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:51,953
I'm afraid to fall asleep.

150
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,771
Go ahead...

151
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,768
Tell me to go home, that
there's nothing wrong with me.

152
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:58,043
It's exactly what the
other three doctors said.

153
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,172
Actually, women under 35 are
the most misdiagnosed subset

154
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,297
of patients in the
country, so, no,

155
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,099
I don't want to tell you that.

156
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:06,601
Whatever you're experiencing
is taking a toll on you.

157
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,386
That's very clear.

158
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,456
Dang it.

159
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,208
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,478
Sorry, I don't know
why I'm crying.

161
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,814
Because you're scared.

162
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:27,522
Laurie, just tell me everything.

163
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,834
Where you work. The
medications you're on.

164
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,458
Don't leave anything out.

165
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:33,295
The smallest of things
can lead me to a diagnosis.

166
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,796
No meds.

167
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,682
I don't have a regular job.

168
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,219
I... nanny for a
family in Inman Park.

169
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,266
- There's nothing wrong
with that.
- Says you.

170
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,024
My family hates the whole idea.

171
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,760
We have a farm near Statesboro.

172
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,606
They didn't want
me moving to Atlanta.

173
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,159
They think I'm gonna get
into trouble in the big city.

174
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:55,199
We don't talk much anymore.

175
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:01,573
Actually, we don't talk at all.

176
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,242
That sounds difficult. That
must put a lot of stress on you.

177
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,493
They're wrong.

178
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:08,029
I can handle it.

179
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:10,749
I'm gonna run some
tests... Blood panel,

180
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,867
lumbar puncture, MRI.

181
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:15,062
We're gonna get to the
bottom of this together.

182
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:24,190
What would cause a website
not to load on my computer?

183
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:27,081
Uh, the hospital
server blocks porn.

184
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm the CEO of the hospital.

185
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,135
I don't look at porn.

186
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,737
Everyone looks at porn.

187
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,089
I'm not watching porn.

188
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,307
Right, 'cause it's blocked.

189
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,526
Remind me why I hired you?

190
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,289
Uh, 'cause your
last assistant quit

191
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,780
and my dad is Zip Betournay.

192
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,660
He owns the Crystal
Springs Golf Club.

193
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:44,827
Pretty sure he
jumped you to the top

194
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:45,929
of the wait-list to get in.

195
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,535
That was rhetorical.

196
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:49,549
Oh.

197
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:06,654
There is nothing
abnormal, is there?

198
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,517
Radiologist will have
to give the final read,

199
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,581
but it looks that way.

200
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,017
- Have transpo
take her to her room.
- Okay.

201
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,987
Dad.

202
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,816
<i>I'm sorry I missed you earlier.</i>

203
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840
<i>I had some
business to attend to.</i>

204
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,575
At 9:00 at night?

205
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,177
Can I make it up to you?
I'll swing by Chastain later.

206
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,679
<i>I'm on a shift.</i>

207
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,863
Could be a long one.

208
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,332
<i>Of course.</i>

209
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,001
I understand.

210
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,536
- Where are you taking me?
- It's gonna be okay.

211
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,132
- Let me out of here.
- I got to go.
<i>- I'll find you.</i>

212
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,684
I'm gonna take you
to your room, okay?

213
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,269
No, t-take me
out of this building!

214
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:44,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's the problem?

215
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:46,277
She wants to get discharged.

216
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,140
You can't keep me
here against my will.

217
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,376
Laurie, we talked about this.
I need to run some more tests

218
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,944
so we can figure
out what's wrong.

219
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:53,802
Who are you?

220
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:56,521
I'm your doctor.

221
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,189
No.

222
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,191
My doctor is Conrad Hawkins.

223
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,360
I just talked to him.

224
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:06,881
I've never met you
before in my life.

225
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,627
Pravesh, I got a page about
a reattachment surgery...

226
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:22,647
A delicate operation that
demands my unique skills.

227
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,815
Where's the arm?

228
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,816
I'm keeping it cool on ice.

229
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,553
Good. I'll start its
admission process.

230
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,305
But you can't admit an arm.

231
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,217
It's not alive. It
doesn't have insurance.

232
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,541
Doesn't have a name.

233
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:36,177
Okay, I'll give it
a name. Clyde.

234
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,229
Clyde? That's the
best you can do?

235
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,892
Well, it's uninspired,
but whatever.

236
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,677
When I reattach
Clyde to the patient,

237
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,151
it will be both
alive and insured.

238
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:45,920
All right.

239
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:51,642
I don't know who did that.

240
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,597
It wasn't me.

241
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,783
Relax. Clyde has
a sense of humor.

242
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,735
I approve.

243
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,265

You know, for a bunch of doctors

270
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,682
and nurses, I thought
this party would be...

271
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,083
- Tame?
- No offense.

272
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:14,658
No, nothing I do is tame.

273
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,095
The prescription drugs
that you have for your clinic...

274
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,164
Are they in the
apartment tonight?

275
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,533
Please give me some
credit. I'm not a fool.

276
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,340
Perhaps you should
let go of Kitty's leash.

If you really are Dr. Hawkins,
why can't I recognize you?

280
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,887
It's called Capgras
syndrome. It's very rare.

281
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,706
People see a familiar face, but
the emotional charge necessary

282
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,375
for recognition is lost.

283
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,288
It's lost because
the area in the brain

284
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,707
that controls emotions has
some sort of disconnect there.

285
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,681
And that disconnect
is telling you

286
00:13:53,716 --> 00:13:56,036
that you are seeing an
imposter when you really aren't.

287
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,719
But why is it happening?

288
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,738
There's a number
of possible causes.

289
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:04,575
Earlier, you told
me not to hold back.

290
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,327
So you do the same.

291
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:07,928
Just tell me the truth.

292
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:17,755
Do you have any family
history of schizophrenia?

293
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:22,726
Oh, God.

294
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,261
My cousin was schizophrenic.

295
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,691
H-He heard voices.
He couldn't take it.

296
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,410
He jumped off the
Jackson Street Bridge

297
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,512
- two years ago.
- Slow down. Hey, hey, hey.

298
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,886
There is a lot of ground to
cover between where we are

299
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:33,665
right now and diagnosing
what's really going on.

300
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:35,857
I've paged a neurologist.

301
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,542
He will be here very soon,

302
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,110
and he will walk us
through everything.

303
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,071
What a noob.

304
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,844
Lag. Lag. Why is
it lagging? Okay...

305
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
Clear out your desk.

306
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:02,583
It's your first and last day.

307
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:05,553
Wait, no, are... R-Really?

308
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,137
This is called a job.

309
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,967
You may not be
familiar with jobs.

310
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,742
They usually entail work.

311
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,760
You've done no work.

312
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:13,989
You can break the
news to your dad.

313
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,396
I'll find myself a new club.

314
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,948
I get fired, he
kills me. For real.

315
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,712
Well, that's something for
you to consider in your next job.

316
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:21,702
If you ever get one.

317
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:24,088
I can hook you up.

318
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,323
- Excuse me?
- I've seen you

319
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,791
swiping right all day.

320
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:31,478
I can find you a
smoking hot date, tonight.

322

Look, just hear me out.

323
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,883
I match people together, okay?

324
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,496
It's a thing I do.
I have no skills

325
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,165
in life whatsoever
except for my ability

326
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,671
to put man and woman together.

327
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,684
Sometimes man and man,
sometimes lady and lady.

328
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,925

Short-term, long-term, whatever.

330

It's a gift that I
have, and it's a gift

331
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,614

332
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,516

00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,371
Okay, who did this?

355
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,974
Wow.

356
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,821
- No, it's not funny.
- Yeah, but don't look at me.

357
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,444
The Raptor does not prank.

358
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,064
Although he appreciates pranks.

359
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,872
A man lost his arm.

360
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:13,474
And he could very well
be dying, for all we know.

361
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,592
Still seem funny
to you? Is this why

362
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,128
you wanted to become a doctor?

363
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,562
Chill, Pravesh.

364
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,381
I'll reattach Clyde the Arm

365
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:24,301
to the living body it belongs to
as soon as it gets to Chastain.

366
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,004
Incoming! Left
leg. Same patient.

367
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,807
Patient is still trapped
at scene. 20 minute ETA.

368
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:35,062

Okay, you're in charge now.

382
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:08,690
- What?
- Three things:

383
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,475
one, don't let anyone
throw up on my rug;

384
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:13,851
two, don't let Irving in
without a better costume;

385
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,103
and, three, you can have
the weight of the world

386
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:19,723
on your shoulders at Chastain
but not in my apartment.

387
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,453

390
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,310
How about you fill
in all the numbers

391
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,863
on this clock for me?

392
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,614
<i>The fact that you
drew all the numbers</i>

393

394
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,867
that there's a biological
basis for your illness.

395
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,858
This is actually good news.

396
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,505
- Because I'm not schizophrenic?
- Exactly. The test

397
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,206
shows us that only
one half of your brain

398
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,209
seems to be interacting
with the outside world.

399
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:19,177
You don't know
what's causing it yet?

400
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,418
No. There's still
something going on

401
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,764
that our tests
didn't pick up yet.

402
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,583
- What could it be?
- Inflammation.

403
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:26,958
Autoimmune diseases. Toxins.

404
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,720
I want to keep you in
the hospital overnight.

405
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:30,628
We're gonna order an EEG,

406
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,129
start you on empiric antibiotics

407
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,059
to treat for possible
infectious causes.

408
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,249
I keep thinking...

409
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,968
I brought this on myself.

410
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:41,405
I-I walked away from my family.

411
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,807
Maybe it's karma or something.

412
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,821
Had I never left, maybe
none of this would be

413
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,462
happening to me. I-I
deserve the nightmares.

414
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,482
Everyone gets nightmares.

415
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,752
I get my own from time to time.

416
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:58,305
You didn't bring
this upon yourself.

417
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,042
We're gonna give you a
sedative through your IV.

418
00:21:01,077 --> 00:21:04,912
Should help you get
a good night's rest.

419
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,153
Whatever's
happening in her brain,

420
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,088
it's progressing quickly.

421
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:17,675
We need to find the source fast

422
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,143
to avoid any permanent damage.

423
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:20,522
Check her in an hour.
If she needs more meds,

424
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,196
we'll do it then.

425
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:25,115
She gonna be okay?

426
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,945
Diagnosis is a
needle in a haystack.

427
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,697
But I'll keep
looking till I find it.

428
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,187
You seem tired.

429
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:31,838
You sleeping much?

430
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,274
Residents don't get to sleep.

431
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:38,195
Son, when was the last time
you took just a few days off

432
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,848
to recharge your batteries?

433
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,449
I have no idea.

434
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,784
I did the same thing
when I was your age.

435
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,204
Burned it at both
ends until I burned out.

436
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,639
You going somewhere with this?

437
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:52,626
I'd like to go
somewhere together.

438
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:54,328
You and me.

439
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,431
I have a place in Anguilla.

440
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:58,765
Condo by the beach.

441
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,528
We could fly out
for a long weekend.

442
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,614
Why didn't you show
up for coffee tonight?

443
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,305
I told you, I had
business crosstown.

444
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,035
Do you want to try
that explanation again?

445
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,379
Because I have never known
you to miss an appointment.

446
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,874
Riley, sweetie, watch
your sisters, okay?

447
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,493
Where's my husband?

448
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:27,995
Frank Tanner.

449
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,164
- Uh, he was in a car accident.
- The tattoos.

450
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:32,666
Riley, Gemma, Eve.

451
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:34,067
Not lovers. Children.

452
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,504
And I just got word:
Frank is one minute out.

453
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,566
All right, I'll move them
to the waiting room.

454
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,058
Ms. Tanner, I'm
Dr. Devon Pravesh.

455
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,155
Come with me.
Your husband hasn't

456
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:44,772
made it to the ER yet,
but the moment he does,

457
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,358
we'll take care of him,
okay? Just wait there.

458
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:48,232
- Okay. Girls.
- Guys, come on.

459
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,997
46-year-old male.
Prolonged extrication.

460
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:53,499
- Oh, my God, Frank!
- Suffered amputation
of his arm and leg.

461
00:22:53,523 --> 00:22:55,250
- Oh, my God!
- Multiple liters
of blood loss on scene.

462
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:57,794
- Ten.
- Frank!
- Wait here.

463
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,595
Okay.

464
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,998
One, two, three.

465
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,499
Get me cordis.

466
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:06,917
Call out vitals.

467
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,536
70/40. Pulse is 50 and falling.

468
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,572
- Hey, he's about to code.
- I know.

469
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,441
Start a rapid transfuser.
Hang two units of O neg now.

470
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,556
Heart rate dropping. 30.

471
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:18,796
All right.

472
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,934
One of epinephrine.
Get me the pacer pads.

473
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:27,220
Heart rate at 20.

474
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,092
Ten.

475
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,457
Zero. All right, somebody
better start pumping.

476
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,948
Let me do it. I can do this.

477
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,416
Okay.

478
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,212
Hold compressions. Check pulses.

479
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:52,391
- Nothing.
- Come on, Pravesh.

480
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:53,831
Frank dies, I've got nobody

481
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,249

482
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:57,534
Is he breathing?

483
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:03,791
Shock him.

484
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:05,320
Charging.

485
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,677
Clear.

486
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,319
Nice. Frank lives.

487
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,182

00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,769
this was a mistake. I shouldn't
have brought you here.

527
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:19,537
- You said you trusted me.
- I guess I thought...

528
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,323
I don't need a babysitter,
Nic. And you're not Mom.

529
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:23,458
- Mom would never act like this. You know why?
- Oh, come on.

530
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:24,659
Because she actually
made things better.

531
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,416
So why don't you leave me alone

532
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:29,152
and go out there and drink
something with alcohol in it,

533
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,816
and I'll drive us home
because, guess what,

534
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,822
- I'm sober.
- Jess.

535
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:59,783
Trick or treat.

536
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,136
Laurie!

537
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:22,872
Lau... Laurie.

538
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:26,176
- No...
- Laurie! Laurie!

539
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,347
Laurie!

540
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,102
<i>Laurie!</i>

541
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:40,624
Laurie, stop!

542
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,337
It's okay. It's okay.

543
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,621
- No, no, no, no, no!
- It's okay, it's okay.

544
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,712
We can help you. John!

545
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,708
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am...

546
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:59,559
Femoral bleed!

547
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,495
Gauze, now!

548
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,800
Hawkins, help me hold her down!

549
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:09,052
I'm on it.

550
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:16,993
I got her. We're
good, we're good.

551
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,668
40 of ketamine.

552
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:23,616
Come on. Ready?

553
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,553
- Ready.
- All right,

554
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,705
ready when you are.

555
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:39,845
I got-I got pressure
on the artery.

556
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:42,002
CT angio and then
prep for the OR.

557
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:44,299
- You have a handle on this one?
- Thought I did. It's unlike

558
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,506
anything I've ever seen before.

559
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:48,286
Well, find me if you
need fresh eyes.

560
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,360
I will.

561
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,247
♪ ♪

562
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,824
Nic, what are you doing?

563
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,995
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- Okay. Okay.

564
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,824
Are you having a panic attack?

565
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,559
Since when do you
have panic attacks?

566
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:31,468
Hey, hey. Leave the room.
Genie, back in your bottle.

567
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,615
- Since when?
- It's not something I advertise.

568
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,071
Seriously? How long?

569
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,507
Over a year.

570
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,102
You can't just take care
of everyone except you,

571
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:39,743
you know that, right?

572
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,923
- Look, I'm managing.
- Are you? Because you're sitting

573
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,931
on a kitchen floor,
hyperventilating.

574
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:45,410
I'm sorry.

575
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:47,751
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

576
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,753
You're okay.

577
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,507
You're okay. Just breathe.

578
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,610
- I'm trying to.
- I know.

579
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:04,117
It's so scary.

580
00:30:04,152 --> 00:30:07,653
I'm right here. I'm
right here, okay?

581
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,990
Look who you're talking to.

582
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:12,809
You're always here for
me, Nic. I'm here for you.

583
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,828
Lean back.

584
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,637
Bell told me what's up.

585
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,061
Give me good news.

586
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,012
Decent'll have to do.

587
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:34,692
Surgery on Laurie's femoral
artery's gonna take about

588
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:36,661
a half hour if there's
no other arteries or veins

589
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:37,700
that are severed.

590
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,469
All indications are they aren't.

591
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,666
Let me know if that changes
once you get in the OR.

592
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,490
Will do.

593
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,141
Dr. Nolan.

594
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,043
Check Laurie's lower abdomen

595
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:50,213
while you're in there, between
the right hip and umbilicus.

596
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,666
I'll be nearby, getting
proximal control for the repair,

597
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:54,078
but I prefer to stay
out of her abdomen.

598
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,070
Why do you want me to do that?

599
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,055
Oh, that's-that's
an incidentaloma.

600
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,035
- It's a benign growth. It's nothing.
- Yeah, or it could be

601
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,059
something that
explains everything.

602
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,763
I'll give it a look.

603
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,836
Dr. Bell.

604
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:32,638
Vivian.

605
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,862
Oh.

606
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,213
Comes with the territory.

607
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:42,632
You save their life?

608
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,952
- I did.
- You do this often?

609
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,638
Save lives?

610
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:51,073
Get set up on a blind
date by your assistant.

611
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,776
Never.

612
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,344
Me either.

613
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:58,148
I'm not kicking
myself at the moment.

614
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,783
Me either.

615
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,614
Go save your patient.

616
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,602
And I'll do my best

617
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:21,104
to be patient.

618
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,858
Dr. Bell. Sorry about
the 11th-hour page.

619
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:31,659
I thought three surgeons
would do the trick.

620
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:32,994
You definitely need a fourth.

621
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:35,251
I can go arm, leg, or
float between the two.

622
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,580
I don't know, Dr. Voss
here is excited

623
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:39,272
to reattach homeboy's
missing getaway stick.

624
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:40,785
You and I will rock
the arm, all right?

625
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:42,854
Well, wouldn't it be
great if we could give

626
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,039
this father of three the
ability to walk his daughter

627
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,963
down the aisle one day?

628
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:49,193
Hate to break your delicate
heart, Dr. Austin, but...

629
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,594
I'll take Mina.
There, it's settled.

630
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:53,653
Ladies on the leg.
All-stars on the arm.

631
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:56,006
Is there a person to
go with the limbs, or...

632
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,355
He's crashing.

633
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,172
Austin, you're on the
scans. Voss, circulation.

634
00:33:02,196 --> 00:33:04,948
Pressure's 70/55.
Plummeting fast.

635
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,984
- He have any other injuries?
- Uh, broken ribs, bruised lungs.

636
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,780
Contained mediastinal
bleeding we need to watch.

637
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:12,199
Abdomen and pelvis look good.
This is all hemorrhagic shock.

638
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,624
Are we good with the
massive transfusion protocol?

639
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,059
Got four units in the ER.

640
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,572
Well, hang another
two, get the TXA ready,

641
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,040
and call down to the blood bank.
We're gonna need everything

642
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,824
- they've got.
- So much for walking
down the aisle.

643
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:24,300
Let's make sure he lives
to see his children again.

644
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,304
Quote: "In nothing
do men more nearly

645
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,791
approach the gods than
in giving health to men."

646
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:33,827
- Cicero.
- Quote:

647
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:36,629
"Check Laurie's abdomen."

648
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:39,332
Hawkins.

649
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:42,068
Uh, Andy, I'm gonna need you

650
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,705
to give me a little bit
more of that in this.

651
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:49,020
How long has the
leg been severed?

652
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:50,994
Somewhere around five hours.

653
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,347
I'm guessing 20 minutes
before that limb loses viability.

654
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:55,749
Then perhaps the focus should be

655
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,412
on the limb <i>you're</i>
trying to save.

656
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,596
Uh, correction, lovey.
The limb we<i> are</i> saving.

657
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:03,773
Suction.

658
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,359
Sponge.

659
00:34:06,395 --> 00:34:08,394
Clamp.

660
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,893
All right, keep
transfusing. Put him on

661
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,085
Trendenlenburg.
He's bleeding out.

662
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,898
You're taking too
much blood away

663
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:19,922
- from the leg. He'll necrose.
- We're losing the arm.

664
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,919
- And who's blunder was that?
- The artery was weakened.

665
00:34:21,943 --> 00:34:23,554
- What's taking so long?
- I don't know

666
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:25,795
what you're talking about.
The problem's solved.

667
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:28,447
New problem.

668
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,850
He's bradying down.

669
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:33,553
Get the ultrasound.

670
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:40,110
Tamponade compressed his heart.

671
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,157
The mediastinal bleed
must have opened up.

672
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:45,531
Lacerated P-A.
Sternal saw to me.

673
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,120
- Need to go on pump?
- No. We're good.

674
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,267
Another two units PRBCs.

675
00:35:13,428 --> 00:35:15,327
Still trending down.

676
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,496
I'm gonna need
more cardiac support.

677
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,148
Slam that blood into him.

678
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,444
Vitals are improving.

679
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,013
KIT and MINA: Show-off.

680
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:53,027
Hey, if you got it, flaunt it.

681
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:54,612
As we were.

682
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:58,171
#TeamChastain, baby.

683
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:00,567
Laurie's recovering.
You were right.

684
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,591
Checking the abdomen
was a good call.

685
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,831
- This thing has teeth.
- It has<i> a</i> tooth.

686
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:11,534
It's a teratoma. It's not
gonna bite you, Ricky.

687
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,970
Teratomas are genetic
anomalies that reproduce organs,

688
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:16,889
or sometimes bone or teeth,
all within a pocket of flesh.

689
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,302
Rare. Unpleasant.

690
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:19,309
Perfectly appropriate discovery

691
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,044
on All Hallows' Eve.

692
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,991
Some teratomas create
antibodies that attack the brain,

693
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,375
and this can lead
to encephalitis.

694
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,027
- They can.
- We'll rerun her CSF panel

695
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:29,536
for Anti-NMDA antibodies.

696
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:31,588
I think we got this.

697
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:37,560
Okay, that's enough.

698
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:50,390
I'm really gonna be okay?

699
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,191
Yes. Yes!

700
00:36:56,798 --> 00:37:00,182
Yeah. You have
Anti-NMDA encephalitis.

701
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,729
It's a rare infection
of the brain.

702
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,381
It was causing
all your symptoms.

703
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:04,849
We're gonna give
you a combination

704
00:37:04,873 --> 00:37:06,456
of steroids and immunoglobulins.

705
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,018
Your night terrors
might persist for a bit, but

706
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:10,593
you should be back to
your normal life in no time.

707
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,578
Ah. I haven't
spoken to my family

708
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:16,532
in two years, but right now...

709
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,802
can't wait to tell them
I'm gonna be okay.

710
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,570
I just hope they
pick up the phone.

711
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,956
Family is complicated.

712
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,075
You just have to hope

713
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,243
that they'll be there
for you in the end.

714
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:41,608
You were right.

715
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:45,244
I should string a few days
together, recharge my batteries.

716
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,597
- Just say the word.
- I will.

717
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,333
When you tell me the truth.

718
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,485
Where were you today?

719
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,240
Maybe when you stop lying to me,

720
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,493
I'll consider going
to an island with you.

721
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:04,096
Sharing everything all the time

722
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,465
is not something
I'm interested in.

723
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,735
Well, I am.

724
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,603
Son, I'm a lot of things,

725
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:13,339
but a hypocrite
isn't one of them.

726
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,641
What's that supposed to mean?

727
00:38:15,676 --> 00:38:17,676
I'm not exactly sitting

728
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,329
across from an open book.

729
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:23,766
You left home and didn't tell
me where you were for ten years.

730
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,953
I had to hire a private
investigator to track you down.

731
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:30,156
So don't ask of me

732
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:34,177
what you refuse
to ask of yourself.

733
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,066
Get some rest.

734
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:56,215
Welcome back, Frank.

735
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:01,570
What... what happened to me?

736
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:04,006
Wee bit of a car accident.

737
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,959
Dr. Voss and I were part
of the team that reattached

738
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:09,912
your arm and your leg.

739
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,697
Did-did I almost die?

740
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:13,750
Couple of times.

741
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:16,518
The important thing
is you're here now.

742
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,539
Yeah, m-my wife?

743
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:22,241
And daughters?

744
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,393
Do-do they know?

745
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:28,214
Yeah. They're on
their way up here now.

746
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,756
Hi.

747
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,658
Hi. Um...

748
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:42,111
Oh, it's-it's okay,
sweetie. It's okay.

749
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,580
Daddy loves you, honey.

750
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:49,869
Nice assist in the
ER today, Pravesh.

751
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:51,404
Thanks, Dr. Austin.

752
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:53,101
And what you
pulled off in the OR...

753
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,741
Shh. I know what I did well.

754
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:58,044
Isn't this the loveliest
part of the job?

755
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,612
What part are we talking about?

756
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,196
The part that makes you want

757
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,294
to pick up the phone
and call your own kids.

758
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,151
American Bobtail and a Maine
Coon are the only kids I got.

759
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:10,139
Wait. You have human kids?

760
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:12,258
Two, from my first marriage.

761
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:13,893
All grown now.

762
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:16,095
And one of my kids has a kid.

763
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,397
Good night, chaps.

764
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,203
Her kid has a kid.

765
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:25,421
She's a grandmother.

766
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:32,661
You know, I...

767
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,050
You know, I was thinking

768
00:40:38,085 --> 00:40:40,553
that this indelible session

769
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:42,254
would be...

770
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:44,623
One time. No strings.

771
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,595
I now find myself reconsidering.

772
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:53,499
- Me too.
- Hmm.

773
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,329
I got to say, my new
assistant was right

774
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,002
about his matchmaking skills.

775
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,988
We raised him right.

776
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:03,075
My ex-husband is so hard on
Grayson, but I'm proud of him.

777
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,295
He's a good son.

778
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:09,398
What?

779
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:22,761
Uh, where's Nic?

780
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:24,814
Oh, I gave her the night off.

781
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,983
So, the damage:

782
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:30,553
three broken glasses,
a clogged sink, and...

783
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,339
Holly Golightly spilled
a drink on your rug.

784
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:35,369
It's never coming
out. I know. I'm sorry.

785
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:38,110
Stop it.

786
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:40,446
No,<i> you</i> stop it.

787
00:41:40,482 --> 00:41:42,682
You silly little minx.

788
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:46,519
Oh, it's been
going on for a while.

789
00:41:46,554 --> 00:41:49,488
- It's actually kind of adorable.
- Stop it.

790
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:51,107
What a nightmare.

791
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:18,584
Mom!

792
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:20,604
Mom!

793
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:25,541
MAN ; Go now, boy.

794
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:27,460
Get out of here, boy!

795
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:34,349
Dad, no! Please!

796
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,819
Please.

797
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,244
Shh, shh. It's okay.

798
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,451
Shh.

799
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,988
Want to talk about it?

800
