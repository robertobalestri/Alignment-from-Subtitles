00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,743
Dr. Bell. What a surprise.

179
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,057
Please tell me you didn't
come all the way down here

180
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,709
- to cut our funding.
- Oh, no.

181
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:44,582
I can do that via e-mail.

182
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,429
Then to what do
I owe this honor?

183
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,614
Well, I understand you have
an expertise in infectious disease

184
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:51,373
and flu season has
our ER short-staffed.

185
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:55,210
You don't want paranoid
patients scaring off profitable ones.

186
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,239
But I don't have
privileges at Chastain.

187
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,414
Check again. I had you instated.

188
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,934
Well, then I'd be happy
to help thin the crowd.

189
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,502
Glad to hear it.

190
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,582
In exchange for a few
ultrasound machines.

191
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,484
Oh, sorry. They're
all spoken for.

192
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,188
Ah, too bad. So am I.

193
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,578
One ultrasound.

194
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:19,662
- Three.
- Two.

195
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:20,701
Done.

196
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:37,802
An open splenectomy
is faster. Ten blade.

197
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,672
For the surgery, yes,
but not the recovery.

198
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,424
And a minimally invasive
approach has less complications.

199
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,003
Chastain has more
than adequate facilities

200
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,044
to help Mr. Fleming
with his recovery.

201
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,774
And the hospital bills the
insurance ten times more...

202
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,610
No wonder Bell likes you.

203
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,767
Allow me to make this
a teachable moment.

204
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:54,135
Please don't.

205
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:01,526
We're a perfect match.

206
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,979
Is it weird if, when we're
married, I take her name?

207
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,614
It was one date, Sam.

208
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,783
Now get this, we're
both closer to our moms,

209
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,631
love Thai fusion and trap music.

210
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,204
So does most of Atlanta.

211
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,650
She just went
hiking in Yosemite.

212
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,541
I did the same hike last year.

213
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,342
Match made in heaven.

214
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,828
- So how's your breathing?
- Fine.

215
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,258
Well, my heart's
racing a little bit,

216
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,509
- but that's probably...
- Aw, don't say

217
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,966
it's 'cause of Sue.

218
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:27,685
Oh, come on man, you never
felt that connection with someone?

219
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,475
Oh, you totally have. Who
is she? What happened?

220
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,227
Don't tell me she got away. Oh.

221
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:37,707
I can't let that
happen with Sue.

222
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,325
She leaves for Spain
tonight. I got to see her

223
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:41,816
- before she goes. Am I good?
- You're dehydrated.

224
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:44,831
I'm gonna keep
you for IV fluids.

225
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:48,272
Sit tight.

226
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,936
I'm about to make an
announcement, so just

227
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,676
sit tight, okay, you guys?
Please, please, please

228
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,240
- keep thinking.
- Hey, what's going on?

229
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,998
- Uh, right side.
- Ask him.

230
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,583
You guys are
together... That's perfect.

231
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,369
Um... okay, listen up.

232
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:04,422
Okay, people, it's 1918,
okay? No microwaves,

233
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,541
Babe Ruth is pitching,

234
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:11,295
and life expectancy
drops 12 years.

235
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,498
Anyone know why?
Was it World War I?

236
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,068
Wrong. War only
killed nine million,

237
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,255
but the Spanish flu killed
over 50 million people.

238
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:23,424
Do I have your attention yet?

239
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,976
All right? I've divided
you into thirds.

240
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,546
Left side got their flu
shots, right side didn't.

241
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,299
Middle group, you guys
can't seem to remember.

242
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,417
Middle group, do better.

243
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,381
Right side, stay.

244
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:38,272
Left side, good news: you're
going home with a care bag.

245
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,085
Chances are you'll catch
something worse waiting here.

246
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:42,109
All right?

247
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,440
Move for me,
let's do it. All right.

248
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,930
Gonna get you all better,

249
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,606
- promise.
- Thank you.

250
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,447
It's like Moses
parting the Red Sea.

251
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,207
When the next wave
comes, get creative.

252
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,016
I don't really want
to raise chickens.

253
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,479
Definitely seemed like

254
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:09,137
you wanted to
raise some chickens.

255
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:11,183
Look, I don't have my heart
set on that place anyway.

256
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,624
We could check out some others.

257
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,442
Uh...

258
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:15,743
I think I just...

259
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,112
need a minute.

260
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,449
I get it. It's...

261
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:23,501
a big decision.

262
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,766
You called for an
extra set of eyes?

263
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,452
Hey, yes. Thank you for coming.

264
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,875
We were hoping that an
infectious disease doctor

265
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,961
could tell us not
to worry as much

266
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,964
as we are.

267
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,949
Our patient Meg has
petechiae, her fever's rising.

268
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,702
Hasn't responded to treatment.

269
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,989
- Leukocyte inclusions
in the cytoplasm of neutrophils.
- Right.

270
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,052
And Dohle bodies
and toxic granulations.

271
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,493
And she's around a
high-risk population in the jail.

272
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,778
I mean, are we crazy,

273
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:53,497
or could this be a
new, rampant flu?

274
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,783
I'm hoping you're crazy,
but you might be right,

275
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:57,858
which means we have
to assume the worst.

276
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,249
<i>It's possible Meg
has a type of flu</i>

277
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,393
<i>that we don't even
have a name for yet.</i>

278
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:07,361
<i>She could be highly contagious.</i>

279
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:08,946
Look out!

280
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,806

00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:20,436

289

Get your head up, get back, Meg.

290
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,247
Deep breath for me. Deep breath.

291
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,399
It's okay, we're
gonna take care of you.

292
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,729
Deep breath.

293
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,736
Breathe in for me.

294
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:05,352
Can I panic now?

295
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,204
You call the CEO

296
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,574
before you initiate
quarantine at his hospital.

297
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,209
I know how you like to operate,
Dr. Hawkins, but it's a rule.

298
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,239
There's a good chance
we contained this.

299
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:16,124
You contained one
patient. I have to stay

300
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,750
ahead of the curve to contain
fear among hundreds of patients

301
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,469
- and an entire staff.
- You guys realize

302
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,749
you're saying the
same thing, right?

303
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:26,307
We all want to solve
this as soon as possible.

304
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,664
What are the facts right now?

305
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,732
At this point, we
only have theories,

306
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,395
the leading one being
a possible epidemic

307
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:38,435
- strain of flu.
- I've got something.

308
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,056
It may not be infectious.

309
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:44,809
Meg's taking levothyroxine
for low thyroid function.

310
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,827
So we could have
held off on the tent

311
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,691
- and all the speculation
it generates.
- No, because

312
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,794
there's a better
chance this is infectious.

313
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,747
Meg also said that some of the
inmates at the prison were sick.

314
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,815
They could've had visitors
who traveled internationally.

315
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:59,034
- I mean, she doesn't know.
- Jails are a nest for disease.

316
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,098
This could be where
her symptoms started.

317
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:03,444
Levothyroxine or jail.

318
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,313
An etiological fork in the road.

319
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,083
I'm not gonna gamble,

320
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:11,085
so go down both avenues.

321
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,654
Okay, I'll get her started on
broad-spectrum antibiotics

322
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:14,872
and send a thyroid panel

323
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,635
off to the lab, but
my gut instinct...

324
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:17,936
- It came from the jail.
- Right.

325
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,677
So I'll head there, try to find

326
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,939
whoever or whatever
made Meg sick.

327
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:22,630
I'll go with Alec.

328
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,099
Are you sure you
want to go back there?

329
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,000
I know the lay of the land.

330
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:29,448
Well, handle this discreetly.

331
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:32,590
Rumors of an outbreak are
just gonna fuel the chaos.

332
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,647
We have to thin the ER
again before a riot breaks out.

333
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:43,500
Dr. Shaw said to get creative.

334
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,720
Ooh. M... Mm, I got nothing.

335
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,325
Okay, listen up.

336
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:54,244
If your temperature checked
in over 100 go to the left.

337
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,425
If you're over 65 or have a
chronic medical condition,

338
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,415
make your way to the right.

339
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,330
- Uh, who are these people
and why are they in VIP?
- Flu patients.

340
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,754
ER's overflowing,
but you've got space.

341
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,073
Orders came from you-know-who
from you-know-where.

342
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,125
We'll be out in 90 minutes flat.

343
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,580
Thinking outside the
box might lead to Bell

344
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,016
putting our medical
careers in a pine box.

345
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,707
Never thought I'd
be back here so soon.

346
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,208
As a nurse?

347
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,278
Inmate. Cell block 6.

348
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,241
Relax. I was framed for
breaking and entering.

349
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:30,665
Liquor store?

350
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,182
Oncology clinic.

351
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,896
<i>Well, either way,</i>

352
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,631
- I'm impressed.
- Mm. I'm sure you've fought

353
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,600
some incredible battles
practicing medicine

354
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,174
- all over the world.
- Uh, here and there.

355
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,937
But I never stayed in
one place long enough

356
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,606
to stir up Nic Nevin's
kind of trouble.

357
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,196
What about now?

358
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,027
Is the clinic just a pit stop

359
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,779
or you planning on
sticking around for a while?

360
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,202
We'll see where
tomorrow takes me.

361
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,700
Today I'm just trying
to find patient zero.

362
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:10,654
This could take a while.

363
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,981
Conrad got Meg's test results.

364
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,315
It's not a thyroid storm.

365
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,750
As predicted.

366
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,898
Now we try to find an
atypical infection in the crowd.

367
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:27,138
Mm-hmm.

368
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:30,424
Hello, ladies, up here. Hi.

369
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:31,926
Uh, this is Nurse Nevin.

370
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:33,489
I'm Dr. Shaw.

371
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:37,243
Uh, it's a life-or-death
situation today,

372
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:38,660
so I really need
your cooperation.

373
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,863
If you check the following three
boxes, please raise your hand.

374
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,770
We want triple threats only.

375
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:46,106
Rash... anywhere
from the ankles up.

376
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:47,870
Swelling in the
pits, neck, or groin.

377
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:50,144
Sky-high fever.

378
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,300
Me, over here.

379
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,796
Betsy, faking it

380
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,431
to the infirmary... Not
gonna happen today,

381
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,089
unless you're actually sick.

382
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:04,959
- She was my cellmate.
- Wow.

383
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:07,027
The unhealthy trinity.

384
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,824
They've gotten
something from Meg,

385
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,716
given it to Meg, or
none of the above.

386
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,184
Well, we've isolated one.
Now we interrogate three.

387
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:21,992
The rash started around
the time I got cleanup duty.

388
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,527
When was that?

389
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:26,147
- Few months ago.
- Is it just on your arms?

390
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:28,999
- Yeah.
- Latex allergy.

391
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:35,722
Mild fever.

392
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:44,760
Have you had this
your whole life?

393
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,702
- Maybe.
- It's a birthmark.

394
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:55,343
Okay.

395
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,811
- Flu shot?
- Don't offer 'em.

396
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,631
- Any direct contact with Meg?
- Just about every day.

397
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,664
These marks on your
hand... Can I see them?

398
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:07,971
Yeah, but it ain't a rash.

399
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,743
Are those bites?

400
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:16,080
I feed a family of
pigeons on the yard.

401
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,365
One of them's
got a bad attitude.

402
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,599
Did Meg feed them, too?

403
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,045
So I feed a few pigeons

404
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:35,733
and now I'm gonna
die of what... bird flu?

405
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,562
You may not have the flu
at all. We think it might be

406
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:39,103
cryptococcosis.

407
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,356
It's a fungal infection

408
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,203
you can get from
pigeon droppings.

409
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,463
Listen, Handsome Head,

410
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,033
I been shivved twice,

411
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:53,400
several concussions,

412
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,652
mononucleosis, shingles.

413
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,838
I-If it's bad, tell me.

414
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,952
I want to know exactly
what's making you sick

415
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,426
before I answer that.

416
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,268
Do you want to call
someone... Friends, family?

417
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,838
Just...

418
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,490
tell them where you are?

419
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:19,977
I'd like to call
my ex-girlfriend,

420
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:22,346
but I really blew that one.

421
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,953
Looks like I'm not so good

422
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,738
at this relationship thing.

423
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,857
Not so sure I am either.

424
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:37,644
You better tighten it up.

425
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:41,032
Nic's a catch. She's a gem.

426
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:44,318
Don't let that one go.

427
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:46,353
Doing my best.

428
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,857
You hang tight.

429
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,892
Be back to do the
scope on your lungs.

430
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,516
I got the answers you want.

431
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,528
- You ready for this?
- Just spit it out.

432
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,020
The last hospital
QuoVadis was involved with

433
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,839
was Jacksonville General.

434
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:06,869
Gordon worked with
them extensively...

435
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,342
Define "extensively".

436
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,355
It was the hospital
where he ran trials

437
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:11,657
for another device of some kind.

438
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:13,264
Which device?

439
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,450
Who was the CEO?

440
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:18,797
- Uh, okay, you lost me.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

441
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:22,039
I'll do it myself.

442
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,491
The charge nurse needs
me to speak to a patient,

443
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:27,077
so you get one more
chance to get this right.

444
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,647
I need to talk to the CEO
Gordon did business with.

445
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,050
It's not just about the where,
it's also about the whom.

446
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,579
- Totally makes sense.
- Do...

447
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,420
- Really?
- Yeah, I get it.

448
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,899
- I will-I will do that.
- Okay.

449
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,440
Okay. Good talk.

450
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:46,580
Hey. You paged?

451
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,048
I did.

452
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,260
I saw something that
made me nervous.

453
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,869
I want to see if it
makes you nervous.

454
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,847
In here.

455
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:58,670
Hey, Sam.

456
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:00,694
Mm, Dr. Pravesh, you're back.

457
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,340
- Good to see you, man.
- How we feeling, Sam?

458
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,365
Well, pretty lousy, actually.

459
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,618
When'd you get that rash?

460
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,421
Uh, I don't know.

461
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,412
Definitely nervous.

462
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,714
We need help
with a patient move.

463
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:23,934
Hundley, we need to limit
exposure to other patients

464
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,914
- and all hospital staff.
- Masks. I'm on it.

465
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,538
Angelique.

466
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,210
Masks, people.
Keep it moving, folks.

467
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,696
- Here you go, sweetheart. Put that on.
- Why do we need masks?

468
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:39,833
- Does he have Ebola?
- It's just procedure.

469
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:48,325
Hundley, get a mask on.

470
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,265
Mask, please.

471
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:59,803
Sam, I'm gonna put
this mask on you, okay?

472
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,138
Ready?

473
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:03,307
- Yep.
- Let's go.

474
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:06,326
What's going on? Where...
where are you moving me?

475
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,878
Isolation.

476
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,295
So I thought you said
you had this under control.

477
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,414
Now there are two more
patients with worsening symptoms.

478
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:18,455
Spiking fevers, hemorrhaging.
And people are afraid

479
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,174
- they're caught in an outbreak.
- Nobody thinks that.

480
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,494
Trending hashtag...
"the outbreak hospital"...

481
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:24,912
Says otherwise.

482
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,592
This is not an outbreak.

483
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,982
I did a bronchoscopy to
check for cryptococcus.

484
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:31,034
We have confirmed
it is not fungal.

485
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,864
So you know what it's
not, but you still have

486
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,422
no idea what it is.
Marburg, Lassa.

487
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,436
All viral hemorrhagic
fevers are still on the table.

488
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,688
That's why we have
PAPR suits just in case.

489
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,012
And we've already
contacted the CDC.

490
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,264
Whatever it is, we are
prepared to handle it.

491
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,850
Emory will handle it. The
only thing you need to prepare

492
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:49,503
- is your transfer summary.
- Hold on.

493
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:51,900
- You are not transferring
these patients.
- I am.

494
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,869
Because a two-patient
problem risks being

495
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:55,392
a Chastain nightmare.

496
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,804
If these infections
keep getting worse,

497
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,196
a helicopter ride could
be a death sentence.

498
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,665
Emory is a top-tier
infectious disease hospital.

499
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,234
The federal government literally

500
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:06,131
pays them to take
charge of this scenario.

501
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:07,332
Emory is tasked with
taking care of patients

502
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:09,317
other hospitals are
incapable of managing.

503
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,569
But we are all over this thing.

504
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,325
I beg to differ.

505
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,473
Gonna take me a couple
hours to arrange the chopper

506
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:16,358
and the transfers.
That's how long you have.

507
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,310
If you can diagnose
and treat before it lands,

508
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:20,800
then... great.

509
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:22,853
Job well done.

510
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:32,813
If you see blood, it's your own.

511
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:35,432
The room is cold,
the scalpel is sharp.

512
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,768
I can assure you and
your weak stomach

513
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,786
he will not bleed.

514
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,775
I'm sorry. He,
uh, s-still looks...

515
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,843
Looks alive.

516
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,329
He's not.

517
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:50,714
The first time you
step into the OR

518
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,398
your patient will look dead,

519
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,117
but he won't be.

520
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,370
It's a tricky thing to
wrap your head around.

521
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,538
In the OR

522
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,958
you must only
follow your instinct.

523
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,893
Everything else,
you check at the door.

524
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,445
Watch.

525
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:13,103
This damn valve is too big.

526
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,955
No, I think you're
holding it upside down.

527
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,225
Which is, I believe, what Julian

528
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,894
<i>was trying to tell you.</i>

529
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,382
Uh, what's in the box?

530
00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:32,422
Seven QuoVadis heart valves.

531
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,575
And why are they here?

532
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,822
I want you to put them
through the pulse duplicator.

533
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,496
And why are you here?

534
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,132
I'm helping someone get
back to where they belong

535
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,636
and you have reached the ceiling
on your consecutive questions,

536
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,171
so run the tests.

537
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,836
Okay, pump it harder.

538
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,271
And this time,

539
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,490
mimic the flow of
blood of an agile patient.

540
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:15,949
A-A little more.

541
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:34,768
We are gonna be
in so much trouble.

542
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:37,337
The valves aren't strong
enough for a younger,

543
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:39,473
active patient.

544
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,041
Like Bradley.

545
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,070
He can't breathe.
What should I do?

546
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,088
I'll be right in.

547
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:58,409
What's going on?

548
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,460
Sam's oxygen sats are dropping.

549
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:02,496
I'm on it.

550
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:07,785
Meg, don't get out of bed.

551
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,839
Hey, good to go.

552
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:21,748
He's not protecting his
airway. I need to intubate.

553
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:26,186
She's seizing!

554
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:28,188
Meg, hold on.

555
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:35,979
I can't get an airway.

556
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:42,169
She's gonna aspirate.

557
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:51,907
Nic, what are you doing?
It's not safe without the suit.

558
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:54,130
There's no time for a suit.

559
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,468
She was gonna aspirate
into her lungs and die.

560
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,154
You would have
done the same thing.

561
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,790
- I told you I had it.
- I heard what you said.

562
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,308
I made the call.

563
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:42,513
Let's just get back to work.

564
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,652
Nic...

565
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,039
you've been exposed.

566
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,058
I know.

567
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,729
I'll stay in isolation.

568
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,772
Masks on. Doors closed.

569
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,434
Nothing to see but
definitely something to catch

570
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,876
if you don't cover your
faces and clear the way.

571
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,713
Milosh.<i> Golden Girls</i> is on now.

572
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,014
<i>Golden Girls?</i>

573
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,584
Yeah. Get back in your room.

574
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,720
Nice assist.

575
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,923
Nice block.

576
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:41,466
No brain bleed.

577
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,857
So her seizure was
caused by the infection.

578
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:46,827
Lymph nodes
are filled with fluid.

579
00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:49,713
Immunoglobulins just came back.

580
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:52,149
Abnormally low.

581
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,528
Compromised immune
system explains

582
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,637
the rapid progression
of the symptoms.

583
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:58,921
Not much time
before we lose her.

584
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,852
I'll identify the infection
once I get a fluid sample

585
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,042
from a needle aspiration.

586
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:04,645
Two needle aspirations: Meg

587
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,696
<i>and Sam.</i>

588
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:14,655
Feel fine.

589
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,324
Keeping the suit on just
in case I'm not infected.

590
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,775
Was my concern that obvious?

591
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,038
Hopefully we have
a diagnosis soon.

592
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:21,745
We can get you both out of here.

593
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,280
Well, apart from the potential

594
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,866
of having a
life-threatening infection,

595
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:29,452
living in isolation
hasn't been so bad.

596
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,399
Conrad, things got
crazy around here today,

597
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,184
otherwise I would have
found you to talk to.

598
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,626
Eh, don't worry.
House is off the table.

599
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:38,378
- I let it go.
- You did what?

600
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,181
Eh, it just didn't feel right.

601
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:44,017
But we can keep looking.

602
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:47,604
If you even want to.

603
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,226
Alec needs that sample ASAP,

604
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:55,662
so we better get
that transfer ready.

605
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,909
Where are my disciples?

606
00:32:08,944 --> 00:32:12,428
Sharing a six-foot
sub, paid for by me.

607
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:16,049
You bought them a man sandwich?

608
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:17,934
Yes.

609
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,232
All to get you alone so I
could admit to your face

610
00:32:21,256 --> 00:32:23,540
that you are a god.

611
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,428
I'm listening eagerly,
but I'm very hungry.

612
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:30,263
Did you order<i> me</i> anything?

613
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:32,326
Oh, God. You are arrogant
and your ego could fill this room,

614
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,302
but you're gonna shut your
ass up and listen, August.

615
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,625
I ran seven QuoVadis valves
through a pulse simulator.

616
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,260
I think I proved that
Bradley's death was caused

617
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,628
by a device error,

618
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,047
not an operator error.

619
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:53,186
Desperation is not a
good look on you, Mina.

620
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,255
Manipulation is even worse.

621
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,268
Are you calling me a liar?

622
00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:59,793
I'm saying when I was
a young, spongey pup,

623
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:03,714
I would have done anything to
get my mentor Abe Benedict back

624
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,194
- if he were circling
down the drain.
- Oh, that's not what I'm doing.

625
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:09,436
The same Abe Benedict who
vouched for QuoVadis valves.

626
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:12,672
Who showed me that my
ego was what most likely

627
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,307
caused Bradley his death.

628
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:16,542
So, no, Mina, it's not
that I don't trust you.

629
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,779
I just trust him a
hell of a lot more.

630
00:33:18,814 --> 00:33:20,880
Well, he's wrong,
and you're stubborn.

631
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,466
If the point of this
whole penance

632
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,635
is to get yourself to listen,

633
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,904
then I suggest
you start listening.

634
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,125
Bradley...

635
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,161
was not your fault.

636
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:45,672
<i>Yersinia pestis.</i>

637
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:48,892
Black Death itself.

638
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,243
It's not just any plague.

639
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,096
Multi-drug resistant.

640
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,599
It's the most unusual
presentation I've ever heard of.

641
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:56,745
And this strain is resistant

642
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,496
to every antibiotic
but colistin.

643
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,960
We need to get the patients
the right treatment immediately.

644
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,541
We need to get
Nic on prophylaxis.

645
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,393
Stat.

646
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:10,847
And Sam's bacterial load
is much higher than Meg's.

647
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,582
He's had this for longer.

648
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:14,567
So Sam infected Meg.

649
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:17,003
We need to find out
where Sam's been.

650
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,466
Whoever got him
infected is out there

651
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,707
spreading it all over Atlanta.

652
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:24,126
Sam's intubated, but I
know who can help us.

653
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,047
Black Plague.

654
00:34:27,082 --> 00:34:30,050
That's quite a
zebra. Ever seen it?

655
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:31,696
Ten cases a year
in the United States,

656
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,269
mostly on the West Coast.

657
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:36,273
Sam brought it here, but
someone gave it to him.

658
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,741
What did he tell you in the ER?

659
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,142
You mean what didn't he tell me.

660
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,593
Okay, replay it all.

661
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:42,323
We need to know where
he went, who he saw.

662
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,314
Okay.

663
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,799
He picked flowers
in Piedmont Park.

664
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,919
Um, he basically spent
the entire day primping

665
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:53,073
for a first date with
his future wife, Sue.

666
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:55,574
Wait.

667
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,076
She hikes.

668
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,390
- She just hiked.
- Hiked where?

669
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:01,297
Yosemite.

670
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,284
Yosemite is a hotbed
for plague carried by fleas.

671
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:06,269
She could be our patient zero.

672
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,638
What did dispatch say?

673
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,985
Busted down Sue's front door.
Found her minimally responsive,

674
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,158
thready pulse.

675
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:32,178
Get her isolated. Let's go.

676
00:35:37,452 --> 00:35:39,092
Okay, ready?

677
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:42,555
One, two, three.

678
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:50,775
- Buboes.
- We need more access. Septic shock.

679
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:53,717
All right, I'll put in the
central line. Give me the kit.

680
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,719
Fluids and antibiotics.

681
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,815
Remember, this is a
multi-drug resistant strain.

682
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,067
Already talked to the pharmacy.

683
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:01,107
Colistin being
mixed as we speak.

684
00:36:01,143 --> 00:36:04,160
Let's just hope
we're not too late.

685
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,705
Is Sue okay? Tell me she's okay.

686
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:17,908
It was close, but
she's gonna make it.

687
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:20,076
- You all are.
- Yes.

688
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,164
Dr. Pravesh, awesome
work from you and...

689
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:28,585
the doctors and everyone. Wow.

690
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,220
Sue gave me the plague.

691
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:34,057
And I know-I
know it's nuts, but...

692
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,642
I find it kind of romantic.

693
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:37,488
Imagine what happens to this kid

694
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:40,013
had Sue bought the farm?

695
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:43,933
Make fun all you want, Meg.
I'm fine with it. You know why?

696
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,102
And maybe it's corny.

697
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:49,389
It was love at first
sight with me and Sue.

698
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,679
Please tell me you didn't
steal those two ultrasounds.

699
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,349
Didn't have to. A little
bartering with Master Bell.

700
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,752
I scratched him, he
scratched me. Everyone wins.

701
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,572
- Mostly the patients.
- Well, yeah.

702
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:09,092
They are all that matters,
so whatever it takes.

703
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,931
Hey, Nic, is everything okay?

704
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,216
Yeah. Yeah, no,
I'm good. I just...

705
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:20,586
I wanted to come and say
thank you for your help today.

706
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:22,605
I learned a few things.

707
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,425
Yeah, me, too. Now
you deserve some rest.

708
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,922
Why don't you go home and have
a couple cold ones with Conrad?

709
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:29,929
Enjoy yourself.

710
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:32,048
Yeah.

711
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,933
Yeah, I need to do that.

712
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:35,985
Have a good night, Alec.

713
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,757
What are we doing here?

714
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,059
Ah, well, there's our table.

715
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,277
People are at that table.

716
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,648
Dr. Benedict. My man and mentor.

717
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,318
This is Dr. Mina Okafor,
the yin to my yang.

718
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,265
Oh, nice to meet you. You both

719
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:56,934
- just happen to be here?
- Or we knew you'd
happen to be here.

720
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:59,503
It's Tuesday night foie
gras, baby, all right?

721
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,322
Oh, what can I do for
you, then, Dr. Austin?

722
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,625
Well, actually, Doc,
you've done enough.

723
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,931
You've been a great
mentor these last six years.

724
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,079
Oh, you sound like
somebody who's gonna quit.

725
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:10,853
Does it?: Oh, no.
On the contrary.

726
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,806
Yeah, I'm here because I
wanted you to explain to me

727
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:17,327
and my partner exactly
why you vouch for QuoVadis.

728
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:26,302
I told you, the
penicillin on the...

729
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,087
Dollars for Docs.

730
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:29,884
Ever heard of
that? Probably not.

731
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,308
It's a ProPublica
site on the interwebs

732
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,928
that releases details
on corporate payouts.

733
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:37,529
So, we're here, specifically,

734
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,516
to find out more
about that 1.5-mil ticket

735
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,703
that Mr. Gordon Page
deposited into your bank account.

736
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:48,224
Honey, will you
give us a minute?

737
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:55,148
I'd prefer to have this
conversation in my office...

738
00:38:55,183 --> 00:38:57,984
I'm not going anywhere.

739
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:01,071
See, when Dr. Okafor
believes in something...

740
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:03,322
Or in this case, someone...

741
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:06,359
She will swim through a
lake of fire and brimstone

742
00:39:06,394 --> 00:39:08,211
to reach her objective.

743
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,714
Whereas you...

744
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,898
you led me to believe

745
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,919
that my arrogance
killed my patient.

746
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,487
When, in fact, it was a company

747
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:22,258
that makes defective
valves and owns you.

748
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,412
Disappointing.

749
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:34,654
Anything you'd like to add?

750
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:36,689
Not at the moment.

751
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,382
See you around, Abe.

752
00:40:04,753 --> 00:40:07,353
You want the good,
the bad or the ugly?

753
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:09,472
In that order.

754
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,241
Good: I found the CEO
and head of neurosurgery

755
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:15,127
at Jacksonville
General, Dr. Ryan Kehoe.

756
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,629
Also went to Cabo
with Gordon Page.

757
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,042
Uh, pioneered his
new back device,

758
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:20,633
opinion leader for QuoVadis.

759
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,603
Sounding familiar?

760
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:25,621
Bad: that scotch is from my mom.

761
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,919
She and my dad crossed paths
at my Aunt Denise's wedding,

762
00:40:27,943 --> 00:40:31,544
and the DJ's choice of mid-'70s
soft rock reignited their spark

763
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,547
in a sloppy way that
makes me cringe.

764
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,583
- But they had...
- What's the ugly?

765
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,921
You can't meet with
Dr. Kehoe because he's dead.

766
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,737
Ten months ago, at the height
of his partnership with QuoVadis,

767
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:49,595
he jumped off the
Dames Point Bridge.

768
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,528
- Look, you didn't...
- Are you...?

769
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:17,423
Look, Conrad, I
like what we have.

770
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,308
Where we are.

771
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:21,760
I don't want things to change.

772
00:41:21,796 --> 00:41:23,179
Not right now, anyway.

773
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,314
I just... I spend so
much of my time

774
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,394
trying to figure it out
what to tell patients,

775
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,636
trying to alleviate their fears
before and after the diagnosis,

776
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:33,273
to protect them, but sometimes

777
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:36,175
a hard truth is just the
best thing for everyone.

778
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:38,444
So...

779
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,491
how about you and I stop
dancing around the issue

780
00:41:40,515 --> 00:41:43,015
and we just get real
honest with each other?

781
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,784
What do you want me to say?

782
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:48,538
Well, that we find ourselves
in different places? Once again.

783
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:51,674
Yes, but that doesn't
mean that I don't want

784
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:55,378
to move in with you
or get married, all of it,

785
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,062
just not this second.

786
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,483
- Isn't that okay?
- And I respect that.

787
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,435
If it's the truth.

788
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,843
Okay, Conrad, you seem to have
all the answers to what's wrong,

789
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:13,011
and probably a way to fix it.

790
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:15,548
Go ahead.

791
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:19,101
It's already fixed.

792
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:22,154
Look at me.

793
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:24,351
Willing to sit down, talk things
through. That's progress, right?

794
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,757
And that's thanks to you.

795
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,711
But that's the
problem right there.

796
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,846
There's nothing
left for you to fix.

797
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,582
- That's not fair.
- Well...

798
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:35,751
it's not about being fair.

799
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:38,387
Nic, it's about being honest.

800
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:40,450
I was a project for you,
and now it's finished.

801
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,136
That's my fear.
That's my diagnosis.

802
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,611
Is it true?

803
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,574
All right, I shouldn't
have come here today.

804
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,109
Well, tell me I'm
wrong, tell me I'm right.

805
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,717
Either way, just open up
like you asked me to do.

806
00:42:51,752 --> 00:42:55,805
And I will, when I'm ready,
when I figure some things out.

807
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,538
Would it help if I went back
to the old version of me?

808
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,598
I'm not sure I like either
version of you right now.

809
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:08,284
At least now
you're being honest.

810
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,623
Good night, Conrad.

811
