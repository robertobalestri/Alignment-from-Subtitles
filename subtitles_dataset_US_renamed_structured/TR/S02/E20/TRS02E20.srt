00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:09,525
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- Dr. Shaw says that some people

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,970
have to do this
three days a week,

3
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:12,689
- four hours a session?
- We're doing a workup

4
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,591
to see if your kidney
failure's reversible.

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,143
<i>And my kidneys will get better.</i>

6
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:17,167
Right?

7
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,585
No reason not to be optimistic.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,220
It's not about being fair.
It's about being honest.

9
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,933
I was a project for you,
and now it's finished.

10
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,101
<i>The same issues</i>

11
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,487
keep coming up
over and over again.

12
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,372
Still a lot we
need to talk about.

13
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,430
Tomorrow? My place?

14
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,432
I'll swing by before work.

15
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,630
Hey.

16
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,683
Looks like we're
finally doing this.

17
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:10,052
Looks like it.

18
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,554
You first?

19
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:15,257
Oh. Okay.

20
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,047
Have you ever woke up
in the middle of the night

21
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,651
and finally realized something
you've never understood before?

22
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:29,788
Uh... I guess.

23
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,990
I mean, not often, but yeah.

24
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:36,628
I'm built to keep
moving forward.

25
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,557
If there's a
mountain, I'll climb it.

26
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,315
If there's a race, I'll run it.

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,969
But what I don't do is
stay in the same place.

28
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,517
And that's what you
think we're doing.

29
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,458
I think...

30
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:52,644
I think I want something
you don't want.

31
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,664
Movement towards our future.

32
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,269
I'd marry you, Nic.

33
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,854
But I don't ask

34
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,933
because you don't even
want to live together.

35
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,228
Why are you putting all
this pressure on me now?

36
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,315
Why is making more of a
commitment to me a burden?

37
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,636
I am here to help.
That should be a relief.

38
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,683
I have been taking care
of everybody around me

39
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,189
since I was 13 years old.

40
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,425
I just... I learned to
take care of myself.

41
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,877
You know what I think?

42
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:28,096
Holding up the world
has become your cross.

43
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,132
Okay. If this is gonna become

44
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,652
a litany of what you
think are my faults,

45
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,287
- I just... I can't.
- No. That's not what's going on.

46
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,223
I'm putting down boundaries.

47
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,869
Can't go forward
if we don't have

48
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,973
the same level of
commitment, and we don't.

49
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,316
You know what this feels like?

50
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,335
Emotional blackmail.

51
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,688
I don't move in with
you, so you just leave me.

52
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:54,701
Telling you what I want
is emotional blackmail?

53
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,152
Yeah, that's what
this feels like.

54
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,221
Okay, well, then we see
this completely differently.

55
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,228
Yeah, I think we do.

56
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:10,600
If you're not interested
in going forward,

57
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,924
for me, it's time to
take a step back.

58
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,100
- If that's what you want.
- It's not what I want.

59
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,997
When I go home
at night, no matter

60
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:25,598
what's going on in my
life, I want you there.

61
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,932
You don't feel the
same. That's the problem.

There's no blood flow

Get two units of

All right, time to figure
out why Danny has no pain.

158
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:35,539

00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,545
Defect in the left atrium.

174
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,261
Pressure's holding.

175
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:37,919
Good. Let's get
her to the OR, stat.

176
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:40,705
Mina, do not move your
finger till we get upstairs.

177
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:41,840
I know that.

178
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,309
I'm sorry transport hasn't come.

179
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,172
It's been a little
crazy down here.

180
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:49,714
Let's check in on the baby.
How you feeling, Mrs. Davies?

181
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,198
Oh, the pain is really bad.

182
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,011
You know, I was
gonna go natural,

183
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:56,320
but an epidural's starting
to look really golden.

184
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,606
That can be arranged
when we get you upstairs.

185
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,616
What is it?

186
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:10,972
Baby's heart rate isn't
quite where we'd like it to be.

187
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,018
- Uh, what does that mean?
- It means we're
going up right now.

188
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,557
Get your bag.

189
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,959
Hundley, call Dr. Stewart.

190
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:20,589
She may need an
emergency C-section.

191
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,730
- Okay.
- It's all right, honey.

192
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,327
- Don't you worry
about this, okay?
- All right.

193
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,919
Everything is gonna
be fine. Don't worry.

194
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,926
You know, once the science
fair is over, I say we hit up

195
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,677
the Natural History Museum.

196
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,680
Oh, I'd rather
visit the aquarium.

197
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:40,593
If I lose, I don't
want to do anything

198
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,250
but sit in the hotel
room, eat pizza and sulk.

199
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,053
We can beat this traffic if
we go straight and turn later.

200
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,717
Being late is not an option.

201
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,557
Trust me, guys. I got this.

202
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:51,432
Okay.

203
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,664
See? Cruising now.

204
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,050
What is this lady doing?

205
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:09,510
If I had just stayed in traffic.

206
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:12,246
If I... if I'd just
waited for the turn.

207
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:15,249
- This isn't your fault.
- Well, whose fault is it?

208
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,186
Who shot us?

209
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:22,039
The cops think the shooter
was targeting someone else,

210
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,792
so it was just the wrong
place at the wrong time.

211
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,795
I feel so helpless, you know?

212
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,663
Look at me.

213
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:32,250
I'm-I'm sitting here,

214
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,452
there's barely a
scratch on me, and my...

215
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,658
My wife and my son
might not survive.

216
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,294
They are with our very best,

217
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,990
most experienced
surgeons right now.

218
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,482
I promise, we will do
everything that we can.

219
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,906
Let's get her on the table.

220
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,241
Okafor, keep your finger
on the hole in her heart.

221
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:03,843
Drape the patient.
Betadine prep.

222
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:07,184
One, two, three.

223
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
♪ ♪

224
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:25,714
Have you ever seen

225
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,717
a purse string suture
performed before, Okafor?

226
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,151
Of course. Do it fast.

227
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,187
I can only keep pressure
for so much longer.

228
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:35,608
It's one of medicine's
most rudimentary,

229
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:36,964
yet lifesaving procedures.

230
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,528
Less narration, more action.

231
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:39,962
Suction.

232
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,222
All right.

233
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,475
Now, you take a deep breath.

234
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,443
And hold it...

235
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,162
and don't you move a muscle.

236
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,398
Okay, three is the
magic number, Okafor.

237
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,150
You hear me?

238
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:59,437
One, two, three.

239
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,726
Bravo.<i> Muy, muy</i> bravo -

240
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,472
if I say so myself.

241
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,730
All right, let's check.

242
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,884
Is there any other
obvious damage?

243
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,730
No. Looks like the
bullet made a clean exit

244
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,098
without damaging
the other organs.

245
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,489
- Good.
- Yeah. That's probably

246
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,736
the only lucky thing to
happen to this woman today.

247
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,271
All right, well, you close up,

248
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,545
take her to CT, make sure
we didn't miss anything.

249
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:27,431
Dr. Pravesh is
going to assist me.

250
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,883
He asked to scrub in. We're
shorthanded today, so...

251
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,780
I hope that's okay
with you both.

252
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,256
Of course. It is a good thing
you came in when you did.

253
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,109
All right. Dr. Pravesh, have
you delivered a baby before?

254
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:42,113
Um, nope. This'll be my first.

255
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,214
Then you are in for a treat.

256
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,284
I've delivered thousands,
and, uh, every one

257
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,554
is as special as the first.

258
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,538
All right, seconds away.

259
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:54,175
Ah. Um...

260
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,827
how long have you
been in the U.S.?

261
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:01,782
My entire life. I
was born in Jersey.

262
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,602
Oh. Well, good for you.

263
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,587
We ready?

264
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,422
All right. Here we go.

265
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,059
Ten blade.

266
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:13,861
Thank you.

267
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:19,617
All right, thank you.

268
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,420
Just relax, honey.

269
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,739
You're doing great, beautiful.

270
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:33,681
Hey, give me fundal pressure.

271
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:38,419
Little more.

272
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:43,808
Head.

273
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,270
- Okay.
- The doctors are
doing a great job.

274
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:46,777
Just relax.

275
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,257
Get under here.

276
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,659
There we go.

277
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,599
There we go.

278
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,246
Okay.

279
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:04,662
- She's okay?
- Yeah.

280
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,880
Congratulations. She's perfect.

281
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,120
Oh. Oh, sweet baby.

282
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:17,124
Aw.

283
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:21,212
Lea, honey, we got lucky.

284
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,963
She looks just like you.

285
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,719
Oh, welcome to the
world, sweet Fiona.

286
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,822
Yeah.

287
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,047
You have a minute?

288
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,182
Uh, yeah.

289
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,335
Any results from Danny's CT?

290
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,888
It's happening now.

291
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,323
How's his dad?

292
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:51,041
I mean...

293
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,746
second-guessing every
moment that happened before,

294
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,014
everything...

295
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,167
that he could have done
differently to avoid it.

296
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,203
Yeah, imagine.

297
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,106
Could've been me.

298
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:08,675
Nic?

299
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,480
What do you mean?

300
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:15,099
I was upset after this morning,

301
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,984
so I pulled over.

302
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,036
They passed in front of me...

303
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,093
and then it happened.

304
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,177
Should've been me.

305
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,947
Wow.

306
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,416
I'm so glad you're okay.

307
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,369
- It's awful.
- Anyway, um...

308
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,621
you had something to tell me?

309
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,958
I wish it could wait, but...

310
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,960
Jessie.

311
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,614
Her kidneys aren't
getting any better, Nic.

312
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,466
So...

313
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,885
we keep her on
dialysis for a while.

314
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,454
They will never recover.

315
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,976
She's been off dialysis for
two days. She's still anuric.

316
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:02,396
Her B.U.N. and creatinine
levels are climbing,

317
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:04,431
as well as her potassium.

318
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,455
Have you told her?

319
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:14,925
No. I knew you'd
want to be there.

320
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,280
Well, let's tell her together.

321
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,514
Nic told me they're
visiting from Tennessee.

322
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,889
They were on their way
to Danny's science fair.

323
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:30,107
I hope the scan shows
us something we can fix.

324
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,893
The bullet entered the
spinal canal at L2-L3.

325
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:35,263
Explains his loss of
feeling at the waist.

326
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,518
Now it's here, at L5-S1.

327
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,270
The bullet is migrating.

328
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:46,190
Could cause permanent
damage if we don't take it out.

329
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,672
There's a traumatic liver
laceration from the accident.

330
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,630
<i>That</i> I can fix.

331
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,298
Good.

332
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,782
The question is...

333
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:58,352
will this poor boy
ever walk again?

334
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,643
So...

335
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,428
so my kidneys will
never work again?

336
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:10,264
Are you sure?

337
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,101
The drug trial did
irreversible damage.

338
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:16,637
You have to stay on dialysis.

339
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,055
Okay.

340
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,925
Okay. For how long?

341
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,319
The rest of your life, Jess.

342
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,790
No. What? That's...

343
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,637
that's not possible.

344
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:42,808
H-How will I-how
will I ever get a job

345
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:45,499
or go back to school?
There's no way.

346
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,418
That's no life at all.

347
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,903
Come on, there's got
to be another option.

348
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,857
There is one.

349
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,408
A kidney transplant.

350
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,727
But for now,

351
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,897
you're not eligible to be
listed through Chastain.

352
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,165
They're not gonna put
you on the transplant list

353
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,151
directly from rehab.

354
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:06,987
You just have to be sober
for at least six months.

355
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:09,540
And once those six months
are up, we can start the process.

356
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,992
Just go, please. Just go.

357
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:14,245
Jess.

358
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,946
Just leave me alone, okay?

359
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,899
Jess.

360
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,201
I'm so sorry.

361
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,139
We're gonna figure it out.

362
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,274
You know, in six months,

363
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,744
if she gets on a
transplant list...

364
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:51,665
there's still a
three-to five-year wait.

365
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,402
Not if I'm a match.

366
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:04,294
You'd donate a kidney?

367
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:07,281
Of course I would.
She's my sister.

368
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:09,082
Okay. Just keep in mind,

369
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:12,002
if she relapses...

370
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,988
the drugs could
damage her new kidney.

371
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,843
Well, I choose to believe
that this is a wake-up call,

372
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,278
and she won't
relapse ever again.

373
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:24,565
Something to keep in mind:

374
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,267
why are you first
in the donor line?

375
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:29,854
Sacrificed so much for Jessie.

376
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:32,769
Maybe your dad
steps up this time.

377
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,493
We can't even count on
Kyle for a birthday card.

378
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,477
A kidney transplant?

379
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:39,513
Not a chance.

380
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,183
Nic, I know we have
new boundaries...

381
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,302
but I am here for you.

382
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,654
Thank you.

383
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,164
You nervous?

384
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,548
I am, actually.

385
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,139
It's rare for me.

386
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:06,557
But one slip of the hand,

387
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,042
and that poor boy
will never walk again.

388
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,528
I like his chances
in your hands.

389
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,211
How many bullets have you
cut out of healthy young men?

390
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,495
Too many to count.

391
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,487
- You?
- Same.

392
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:23,374
My daughter Amelia
did a science fair.

393
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,992
Some silliness with
plants and chlorophyll.

394
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:28,078
Placed dead last.

395
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,796
I was still a proud mum.

396
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:32,516
Fond memories, because
we were lucky enough

397
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,051
to make it to the fair.

398
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,153
A bullet from a random shooting,

399
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,899
nothing to do with
us, out of nowhere,

400
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,102
didn't rip through our
bodies and send us to an OR.

401
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:42,604
They were in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

402
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,244
Very unlucky.

403
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,298
Luckily, he's with us now.

404
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:54,838
♪ ♪

405
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,274
Beautiful, huh?

406
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,893
Nothing better in the world.

407
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:08,051
Thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

408
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:09,836
For everything.

409
00:23:09,872 --> 00:23:11,571
My pleasure.

410
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:16,059
Just checking in on you guys.

411
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,129
Hey. Dr. Stewart?

412
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,521
Dr. Stewart, hey.
Glad I caught you.

413
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,039
I was just in the Davies' room,

414
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,242
and I noticed some
blood in Lea's catheter.

415
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,910
Yeah. She just had
major abdominal surgery.

416
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,096
Some bleeding's normal.

417
00:23:36,131 --> 00:23:38,532
Yeah, I-I get that.

418
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:41,318
But would you mind checking
on her, just to be sure?

419
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,204
I appreciate your
concern, Dr. Pravesh.

420
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:46,000
I have delivered
thousands of babies,

421
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,808
and I have seen every
postpartum problem there is.

422
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,028
So leave my patients to me. Hmm?

423
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:08,073
Okay, almost done.

424
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:10,864
Now for the really scary part
of the surgery. Are you ready?

425
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,684
As I'll ever be.

426
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:19,156
And...

427
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,407
and done.

428
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:21,608
Spine's all yours.

429
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:22,838
Okay.

430
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,162
Help me get access for

431
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,514
an anterior
approach to the spine.

432
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,357
Another first.

433
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,709
- It's psychosomatic.
- No way.

434
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,174
You're putting yourself in the
place of the patient's mother.

435
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:43,863
It's very human of you, but,

436
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,284
Kit, in here, you're a doctor,
and a damn good one.

437
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,970
So just channel your normal
bravado, pull yourself together,

438
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:52,306
and fix this kid's spine
so he can walk again.

439
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:55,241
Right. Sorry.

440
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,917
There you go.

441
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:08,967
<i>She's so cute.</i>

442
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:11,491
<i>How long until she speaks?</i>

443
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:13,176
Hey.

444
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,728
She got to learn how
to hold her head up first.

445
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,365
<i>- Where's Mommy?</i>
- Right here.

446
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,468
Say hi to your amazing mama.

447
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:23,721
Hey, darling.

448
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,483
<i>When are you gonna
come home, Mommy?</i>

449
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:27,474
Soon. Soon.

450
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,559
You go ahead and
be a good little girl

451
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,595
for your grandma, okay?

452
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,733
You okay?

453
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,168
Something hurt?

454
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:42,005
- Yeah, my stomach.
- Okay.

455
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,225
Hey, Rachel, Daddy's gonna
call you back, okay, sweetie?

456
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:46,878
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Love you.

457
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,898
Here.

458
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,370
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.

459
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:57,421
Careful.

460
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,916
- Let me take her.
- Okay.

461
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,740
- Here, I'll take her.
- Okay.

462
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,711
- You got her?
- I got her.

463
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,144
Okay.

464
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,365
What's the matter?

465
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,651
I don't know.

466
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,746
Lea, you okay?

467
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:28,936
Lea.

468
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,050
Liam still hasn't
opened his eyes.

469
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:33,902
- Excuse me, my wife needs...
- I think something is wrong.

470
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,771
I-It's very common.
Just try and relax.

471
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:38,173
- Excuse me. Can someone come, just...
- I'll be there in a minute.

472
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,624
Oh, alarm in 4210.

473
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,731
Mrs. Hobbes' IV bag
is probably empty.

474
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,717
Uh, Mrs. Henderson in 4233.

475
00:26:43,753 --> 00:26:46,603
I'm guessing the O2 monitor
just slipped off her finger again.

476
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:47,966
Hey, my wife in 4238...

477
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,489
Oh, one sec. Maternity.

478
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:53,009
No, you need pediatrics
for that. I'll transfer you.

479
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,828
Sorry, what room?

480
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,781
4238. Lea Davies. Can a
doctor come check on her?

481
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,634
She's really weak, and
now her belly is hurting.

482
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:01,846
Well, she had the
baby a few hours ago.

483
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,020
It sounds about right.

484
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,983
No, no, no, no, no.
It's more than that.

485
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:06,935
Now, she wasn't like
this with our first child.

486
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,637
- Was your first a C-section?
- No, but...

487
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:11,144
It's normal. Trust me.
She just needs some sleep.

488
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:13,346
I'm telling you,
something's wrong.

489
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,510
Now, if you can't come,
can someone else?

490
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:18,485
Maternity. Give me five minutes.

491
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,270
What's the patient's last name?

492
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,456
<i>Nurse Fallon to NICU.</i>

493
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:24,491
<i>Nurse Fallon to NICU.</i>

494
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,629
Chastain has been incredible.

495
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:32,482
Everyone swooped
in to help our family.

496
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:37,854
Nurse Nevin was there
when the accident happened.

497
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,956
Glad I could help.

498
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,942
Your operation went perfectly.

499
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:44,711
Not a hitch in the giddyup.

500
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:47,313
Not many people survive
a bullet to the heart.

501
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:52,385
- But where's Danny?
- He just got out of surgery.

502
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,516
We were able to
repair his liver laceration

503
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,639
and remove the bullet
from his spinal cord.

504
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,824
His spinal cord?

505
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,129
Is he okay?

506
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:03,997
We'll know more tomorrow.

507
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,887
Dr. Pravesh, how can I help you?

508
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:14,073
Hey, just checking in on
Lea Davies in room 4238.

509
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,104
I just got an anxious
call from her husband.

510
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:18,645
Right, uh...

511
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,443
- Right. Crap.
- When was the last time
you checked on her?

512
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,211
I don't know. I'm sorry.
We're short-staffed.

513
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,735
Seems like everyone
is having their baby.

514
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:30,707
Well, it doesn't seem
that busy anymore.

515
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,110
Why is it so difficult to
look in on Ms. Davies?

516
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,190
I need to make sure
that she gets proper care.

517
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,698
She's getting the same
attention as everyone else.

518
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:40,117
Respectfully, it seems
to me that she is not.

519
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,942
- Hey.
- Thank God, Dr. Pravesh.

520
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,443
So glad you're here.

521
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,796
Lea keeps saying
her stomach hurts.

522
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:57,901
How are you
feeling, Mrs. Davies?

523
00:28:57,937 --> 00:29:00,470
Her pressure's a little low,

524
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,906
but in the range of normal,
especially after a C-section.

525
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:06,810
We'll be right back.

526
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,634
That much blood in the
catheter is not normal.

527
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,504
Dr. Stewart, we have
Dr. Pravesh on the line.

528
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,145
- He says it's urgent.
- Talk fast, please.

529
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,049
I have a planned C-section
starting two hours late.

530
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:31,801
You recall I
mentioned seeing blood

531
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,398
in Lea Davies' Foley catheter.

532
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:35,734
<i>It is worse. Significantly.</i>

533
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:38,157
- What's her BP like?
<i>- 92/55.</i>

534
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,088
She seems altered,
barely conscious,

535
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,256
even when being spoken to.

536
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,846
She is in a lot of pain.

537
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,148
All right, fine.

538
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,117
Go ahead and send off a CMP,

539
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,336
<i>- CBC and coags.</i>
- No.

540
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,405
Lea needs a CT.

541
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:54,574
<i>Nurse Fallon to NICU.</i>

542
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,642

543
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,864
What are you implying?

544
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,678
<i>That you haven't listened
to me or to her husband,</i>

545
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:06,130
and you are not taking this
case as seriously as you should.

546
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:08,372
<i>I treat all of my
patients the same.</i>

547
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,757
I believe what I
see. And in the ER,

548
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:13,543
I have seen you do way
more based on less information

549
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,161
for patients that look like you.

550
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:17,447
That is an offensive...

551
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,483
That is a ridiculous accusation.

552
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:23,829
Fine, all right. If it'll make
you feel better, go ahead.

553
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:26,623
<i>Get a CT. I'll check in as
soon as I get out of surgery,</i>

554
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:27,702
<i>if that's all right,</i>

555
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:28,726
Dr. Pravesh.

556
00:30:31,814 --> 00:30:35,281
He ordered the CT and labs.
I need you to put a rush on it.

557
00:30:35,316 --> 00:30:37,650
A rush. Do you understand?

558
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,369
Yes.

559
00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:48,712
Hey, where are Lea's CT results?

560
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:51,164
It hasn't been done
yet. I've been trying.

561
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:53,094
I swear. They keep
saying they're backed up,

562
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,912
and I don't have the
authority to override...

563
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,754
Unbelievable. Well, why
didn't you just call me?

564
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,340
The ER has a clear set
of protocols. Don't you?

565
00:31:00,376 --> 00:31:02,926

566
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,413

00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,029

00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:21,895
We need Dr. Stewart in 4238.

572
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,924
- What's going on?!
- I'm trying to find out.

573
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:25,698
Blood pressure's 78/43.

574
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:27,778
- Get the ultrasound.
- Her labs just came back.

575
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,786
Hematocrit is down to 18.

576
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,554
She's gonna be okay, right?

577
00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:34,955
- Right?
- Hang two units of blood.

578
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,663
Doctor, help her.

579
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,916
What is going on?

580
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,989
- Free fluid everywhere.
- She's bleeding internally.

581
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,469
And she's hypotensive.

582
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,943

her to the OR stat.

603
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,966

- Laps. Suction.

604
00:33:40,002 --> 00:33:42,346
And get the cell saver. I
want to keep her pressures up.

605
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,983
A big vessel must have cut
loose to cause this much bleeding.

606
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:47,769
How long ago was the
C-section? Six hours.

Tear in her bladder.

Right angle and a stitch to me.

612
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:47,633
Ask yourself...

613
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,117

This happens far too often

to happen to black women.

00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:13,264
I'm listening.

702
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:16,155
After yesterday's tragic event,

703
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,674
we are gonna create a
review board to examine

704
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,439
every maternal death or
near death in this hospital

705
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:23,262
over the past few years.

706
00:41:23,298 --> 00:41:25,326
We're gonna pinpoint the
problems, and we're gonna

707
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,612
implement a new standard
of care immediately.

708
00:41:27,636 --> 00:41:29,980
And these protocols will
include comprehensive checklists,

709
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:32,655
maternal crash carts,
simulated training drills.

710
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:35,491
We need communication
and teamwork

711
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,228
to prevent all forms of
bias, racial or otherwise.

712
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:41,314
We need to ensure that
every person is heard.

713
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:43,533
The United States is the
most dangerous country

714
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,579
in the developed
world to give birth in.

715
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,686
There's no excuse for that.
