00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,195
You want to be in the loop?

174
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,382
Chastain has received
over $95 million

175
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,368
in donations per year
over the last decade.

176
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,554
In the last eight
months, that's down 40%.

177
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,456
Yikes. Why is that?

178
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,710
Lane Hunter plus
QuoVadis equals disaster.

179
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,679
And where are we with the
new wealth-screening software?

180
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,793
Locked and loaded,
Chief. Already identifying

181
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:23,184
rich patients at Chastain
who could be potential donors.

182
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,419
Check it out. Spit out
three names this morning.

183
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,376
Oh, Grayson, one
of these patients died,

184
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,512
and the others are not...
they're not rich enough.

185
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,497
These are minnows.

186
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,550
We need a whale.

187
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,100
Hello?

188
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,819
Mina...

189
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:00,282
you will never
guess what landed.

190
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,690
Dextrocardia
with situs inversus.

191
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:06,161
<i>This man's heart is literally
on the right side of his chest,</i>

192
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:08,446
which, obviously,
is not the right side.

193
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,734
Okafor, are you there?

194
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,737
I think so.

195
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,533
<i>Well, day off be damned.
Get your butt in here</i>

196
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,923
<i>and scrub in for this CABG.</i>

197
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,937
We may never see
another one like it.

198
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:24,746
This was my fault.

199
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:30,651
Are you okay?

200
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,288
I swerved too late.

201
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,691
Left or right, couldn't decide.

202
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,026
My bad.

203
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:39,861
Oh, God.

204
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:43,631
Think you might be
bleeding internally.

205
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,450
<i>- I'm what?</i>
- Who?

206
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,119
I have no idea.

207
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,372
I'm sending you my location.

208
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:52,123
Get an ambulance, now.

209
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,430
- What do we got?
- 34-year-old male

210
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,832
with crush injuries, deep
leg laceration, BP 85/60,

211
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,452
- heart rate 130.
- Okay. Trauma bay nine.

212
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,949
I need the ultrasound.

213
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,121
Is this the end?

214
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,124
It is likely not the end.

215
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,426
One, two, three.

216
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:14,073
Sh-Should I call my mom?

217
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:16,409
Is it the right time or too
soon? I don't want her to worry,

218
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,661
- but I think she
deserves to know. Okay,

219
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,080
- diffuse abdominal tenderness.
- Decreased breath sounds
on his left side.

220
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,148
Maybe one of you
should call. Is-is that uh,

221
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:25,240
better or worse,
hearing from a doctor?

222
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,637
- Uh, better or worse? Okay.
Taylor, you need to calm down.

223
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,644
Looking for internal injuries.

224
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,593
- Whose suit is that? I
was playing a night round.

225
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:36,083
- Yeah.
- I should've stuck to the day.

226
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,801
It's just a bad call by me.

227
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,182
It's just, I was so
busy, that I... you know,

228
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,655
and I-I can't think.

229
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,652
I'm so sorry, I-I didn't
mean to... I hit you, I...

230
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:43,992
How do you even play at night?

231
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,772
Oh, glow-in-the-dark balls.

232
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:46,972
- It's pretty awesome. Yeah.
- Oh, cool.

233
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:48,212
Why were you there?

234
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,348
His intestines are in his chest.

235
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:51,694
Diaphragm rupture.

236
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,968
I'll prep the OR.

237
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,358
You're bleeding. You could
have a significant head injury.

238
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,193
I need to check you out.

239
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,495
What on earth
happened last night?

240
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,381
I don't remember.

241
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:13,284
Okay, here we go.
Follow my finger.

242
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:16,691
Nice.

243
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,728
All right, clench
your jaw and hold still.

244
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,810
Puff out your cheeks.

245
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,169
Cranial nerves intact.

246
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,621
I'm gonna take a look
at that head wound.

247
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:34,742
Okay. What's the last
thing you remember?

248
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,177
Drinking with the Raptor.

249
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,074
I ordered another
round of drinks,

250
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,697
and he had to go leave

251
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,828
to be with his brilliant
one-night stand.

252
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:44,269
Ah, so you drank that
last round by yourself?

253
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,681
No. Someone else joined me.

254
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,373
I just... don't remember who.

255
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,702
Maybe the guy
from the golf course?

256
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:52,243
- Definitely not him.
- So, we have heavy drinking

257
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,611
with a mystery person

258
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,607
and a late-night
stroll on a golf course.

259
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,115
None of that sounds like you.

260
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,282
I don't lose control.

261
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,934
I have never behaved this way.

262
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,964
Well, while you figure out
why you went off the rails,

263
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,016
I will figure out why
you have mild amnesia.

264
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,573
I need to rule out a bleed.

265
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,102
I got to keep you
for observation.

266
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,793
And that means no
reading, no watching

267
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,212
and no thinking.

268
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,941
Are you putting
me on brain rest?

269
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,243
Yes.

270
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,717
He knows of which he speaks.

271
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,354
I don't say this often, but
do what Pravesh tells you.

272
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:21,433
Okay, there is no
way I am sitting here

273
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:23,435
while you go operate on
a man who has his heart

274
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,311
on the wrong side of his chest.
I'm fine, and I'm scrubbing in.

275
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,897
You cuff her to
the bed if need be.

276
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,117
You approach this
bed with restraints...

277
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,214
I will end you.

278
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:37,271
Just relax.

279
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,757
Hold still.

280
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,563
Are you ready for your
smile to match mine?

281
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,166
Wealth screening software
flagged a bona fide Moby-Dick.

282
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,585
Born in Boise.

283
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,737
Paralegal. Rents a
place in Grant Park.

284
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,288
Sagittarius.

285
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,558
Are you pitching me a
whale or your replacement?

286
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:58,593
I'm pitching you
someone who won big.

287
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:00,844
- Won what big?
- The lottery, baby.

288
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,114
His name's Taylor Emeye.

289
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,804
Dr. Nolan.

290
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,473
Just... hang on one second.

291
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,629
Mr. Emeye, I'm
Dr. Randolph Bell,

292
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,928
Chief of Surgery and CEO
here at Chastain Park Memorial.

293
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:24,485
Hi, Dr. Bell. Is-is
something wrong?

294
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,754
No, no, not at all. I just
wanted to let you know

295
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:29,290
that I will be scrubbing in with
one of our very top surgeons

296
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,826
on your operation today,
and you'll be recovering

297
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,211
in our VIP wing.

298
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,681
Would you prefer a suite
that favors sunrise or sunset?

299
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,784
Sunrise or sunset?

300
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,970
Sunrise or sunset, sunrise
or sunset, sunrise or sunset,

301
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:44,833
sunrise or sunset, sunrise or...

302
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,119
You don't have to decide now.

303
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:49,143
Okay? W-We will see you after.

304
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,728
Okay.

305
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,379
Dr. Bell.

306
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,148
For you to advertise me

307
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,877
as one of the elite
surgeons at this hospital is...

308
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,269
No, I wasn't talking about you.

309
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,393
You got something on your mind?

310
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,141
As a locum tenens,
these eyes have seen a lot

311
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:11,181
of CEOs of a lot of hospitals

312
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,035
do a lot of things in the
name of financial solvency.

313
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,853
This going somewhere?

314
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,400
Well, let's start
with staff cuts.

315
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:20,040
You fired Jana Cervantes...
My favorite scrub nurse...

316
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:22,560
And replaced her with a
less-expensive imposter.

317
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,845
Said nurse is in the room.

318
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,767
And she shouldn't be.

319
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,352
Exactly my point.

320
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,771
But the bright red
flag on the field is:

321
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,274
why am I in here with you
when we both know Nolan

322
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,542
could easily handle
this cut and run?

323
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,245
Now, I smell wealth screenings.

324
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,858
And if you would
stoop to software

325
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,382
to spy on your patients,
then I have to ask:

326
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,035
how much is your
boy Taylor worth,

327
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,955
and how deep of a
hole is Chastain in?

328
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,341
- Barking in the dark.
- Well, I know what I see.

329
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:57,679
- Well, let me educate you.
- And what I see is confusing.

330
00:14:57,714 --> 00:15:00,648
Is it me, or does your golden
goose have abnormal lungs?

331
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,063
Brain rest not going well?

332
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,098
How could someone not think?

333
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:21,547
Even thinking about not
thinking constitutes as thinking.

334
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,315
Hear there was an incident
with a hospital gown.

335
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,474
God. Itchy, tortuous fabric
that will never touch this skin.

336
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,460
Brought you these.

337
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,615
You are a godsend.

338
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,250
Wait, did you see this?

339
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:37,835
No. What is it?

340
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,587
A dry cleaning tag.

341
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,769
I think you're
wearing Bell's suit.

342
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:46,560
God. I should have put
on the hospital gown.

343
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,930
Okay, so you end
up in Bell's suit

344
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:50,998
at the end of a wild night.

345
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,467
Clearly, you have some
things to get off your chest.

346
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,498
No, you're wrong. I'm fine.

347
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,511
The dialysis center's paging
me. Something's wrong.

348
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,692
Go. If you need anything,
I'm here for you, too.

349
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,236
Thanks.

350
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:15,790
What the hell?

351
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:18,810
What's going on?

352
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,439
I feel like I'm drowning.

353
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:22,040
Why are you doing
an echocardiogram?

354
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,132
She got a unit of blood

355
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,112
- with dialysis.
- That shouldn't be enough
to tip her

356
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:27,830
- into pulmonary edema.
- It shouldn't be,

357
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,005
but I'm afraid she has, uh,
a reduced ejection fraction.

358
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,109
Okay, you're freaking me
out with all the medical speak.

359
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:37,844
Can you just... can
you explain it in English?

360
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,147
Your heart isn't
pumping strongly enough,

361
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,566
so your lungs filled with fluid.

362
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,878
That's what's making
it hard to breathe.

363
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,662
Why isn't my heart working?

364
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:49,073
I'm sorry, Jessie, but
you're in heart failure.

365
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:52,827
First kidney failure.

366
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:54,912
Now heart failure.

367
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,925
- What's happening?
- We don't know yet.

368
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,228
But Dr. Williams will do a
full workup. keep us updated,

369
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,887
and I promise I will translate
everything into English for you.

370
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,388
It's too much, Nic.

371
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:08,476
We're gonna figure
things out, okay?

372
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:09,927
Just try to stay calm.

373
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,907
<i>My sister needs
a kidney transplant</i>

374
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,848
as soon as possible.

375
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,894
We're looking for a match,
but even if we find one,

376
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,913
Jessie's not eligible unless
she's on the recipient list.

377
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,855
If I recall, she isn't listed
because she's an opioid addict.

378
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,939
<i>Was.</i> Was.

379
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,602
She has been two
months clean and sober.

380
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,026
Six months of sobriety's
the hard and fast rule.

381
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:27,506
Right, that is
Chastain's policy,

382
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,508
but other hospitals
have different criteria.

383
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:32,511
You could decrease the
amount of time required.

384
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:35,787
- I...
- Or just... make an exception. Dr. Bell,

385
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,916
- please.
- If I make an exception
for Jessie,

386
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,401
I'd have to make an
exception for others.

387
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,842
It's a slippery slope.

388
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:44,345
We both know that
addiction is a disease.

389
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,524
She shouldn't be
punished for that.

390
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:47,030
Well, it isn't a punishment.

391
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,967
Chastain has a
responsibility to honor

392
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,386
the donors' sacrifice by
ensuring that each organ

393
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,972
has the greatest
chance for success.

394
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,061
You remember the drug
trial that you approved?

395
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:02,079
That<i> you</i> approved, for money?

396
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,752
That's what caused
Jessie's kidney failure.

397
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:12,289
She trusted Chastain.

398
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,442
And now she will die

399
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,510
if we don't help her.

400
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,632
Please.

401
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:24,969
I-I wish I could.

402
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,783
<i>Dr. Bell and I were able
to repair your diaphragm</i>

403
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:45,940
<i>without incident.</i>

404
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:47,408
But during the procedure,

405
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:49,092
we noticed your lungs have

406
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,094
- an irregular appearance.
- Irregular?

407
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,025
- What's wrong with me?
- It's most likely

408
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,582
you have an infection.

409
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,211
But there's a possibility
that you may have

410
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,380
an inflammatory process,
which would then need to be

411
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,519
treated aggressively.

412
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,373
Have you had a cough
or shortness of breath?

413
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,842
Yeah.

414
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,827
Okay, well, have a choice.

415
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,613
We can give you
antibiotics and...

416
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,727
if it's an infection,
it should get better.

417
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,685
Or we can perform a bronchoscopy
to get a definitive diagnosis,

418
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,154
so that we can treat you
more specifically sooner.

419
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,440
Which, in this case, would
be my recommendation.

420
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:21,155
A bronchoscopy.

421
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,144
- That-that sounds serious.
- It's a minor procedure

422
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,125
where we reach deep
into your lungs and take

423
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:27,676
- a little piece of tissue.
- Before committing,
I need statistics

424
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,516
on most common complications.

425
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,413
Uh, uh, am I put
under or sedated?

426
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,131
You'll be under
conscious sedation,

427
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:35,656
which means you'll be awake,
but you won't feel anything.

428
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,869
We take a thin tube, we
pass it through your nostrils

429
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:39,238
or your mouth,
down to your lungs.

430
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,141
Pros and cons on nasal
versus oral would go a long way

431
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:44,393
in helping me decide. Could I
have a day to think about this?

432
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,144
No, no. This is serious, dawg.

433
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:48,208
We need to treat
this, like, yesterday.

434
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:51,138
A hasty decision is
a careless decision.

435
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:52,818
I wish we had more time,

436
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:55,008
but that would
be putting your life

437
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,744
at great risk, and I am
not willing to do that.

438
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,797
I don't think you
want that, either.

439
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,232
Yeah, I-I'm just not comfortable

440
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,079
making this call
right now. I'm not.

441
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,103
- I can't...
- And you don't have to.

442
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,667
We will start you
on the antibiotics,

443
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:10,858
and then graduate
you to the bronchoscopy

444
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,027
just... if necessary.

445
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:14,594
Sound good?

446
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:26,790
Grayson wasn't at his
desk, so I let myself in.

447
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,844
I see that.

448
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,229
How was your night?

449
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,917
What do you care?

450
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:41,033
First time at The Depot?

451
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:43,223
The... what?

452
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,810
You're a member at the, uh,

453
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,812
Crystal Springs Golf Club.

454
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,113
Spit it out, Mina.

455
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,425
Tell me where
you were last night.

456
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,794
Well, not that it's
any of your business,

457
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,645
I had a date. Did
not go as planned,

458
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,651
I went home early.

459
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,987
So where the hell were you?

460
00:20:58,307 --> 00:20:59,423
We're done here.

461
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,564
- You're on brain rest.
- Don't make us call your mother.

462
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,251
- Too soon.
- Fair enough.

463
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:12,436
We're worried about you.

464
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,254
Mina...

465
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:15,822
don't run off again.

466
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,357
We're not playing.

467
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:36,293
Irving.

468
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,196
I want to see Taylor. Now.

469
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,681
No.

470
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,901
I'm not playing.

471
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,088
Hey.

472
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:50,307
Well, your oxygen levels
and BP have improved.

473
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,309
And it looks like...

474
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,105
they got off two
liters with dialysis,

475
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:56,813
so, all good signs.

476
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:00,667
Good signs I'm
not dying right now.

477
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:03,938
Look, one day at a time.

478
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:07,057
But how many-how
many days do I have left?

479
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,843
I mean, come on. We both
know I'm running out of time.

480
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:12,124
If a kidney walked
in the door right now

481
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:14,715
it wouldn't matter, 'cause
I'm not on the list, okay?

482
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,251
So just stop pretending like
everything's gonna work out.

483
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,894
I'm sorry.

484
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:32,699
I'm sorry. I know you're doing
everything you can for me.

485
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:38,171
I'm just scared.

486
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:42,409
I'm scared, too.

487
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,748
I just keep thinking that

488
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,718
Mom would be so
disappointed in me.

489
00:22:50,753 --> 00:22:53,186
Jessie, no.

490
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,940
No, Mom would
be so proud of you.

491
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,941
For what?

492
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,311
For not giving up.

493
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:06,267
And I'm not giving up either.

494
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,285
Okay?

495
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,871
Okay.

496
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,061
Hey. Right this way.

497
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,363
It took some convincing

498
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,143
to get him to see us
again, so if you're not

499
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,633
- absolutely sure about this...
- I am.

500
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,533
Um, either of you want a coffee?

501
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:29,306
Uh, no. Thank you.

502
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,143
I didn't expect
to see you again.

503
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,728
I hope it wasn't the price

504
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,581
that gave you cold feet,
because that's the same.

505
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,045
$100,000.

506
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:42,869
- Ten percent down.
- I have it,

507
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:44,733
and, I, uh, I want
to move forward,

508
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,708
but... there's a problem.

509
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:50,377
My sister isn't on the
transplant list at Chastain.

510
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,912
- So unless...
- Doctors can be bought.

511
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:54,348
Just like kidneys.

512
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,418
I have arrangements
out of state.

513
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,921
So just be ready to travel.

514
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,092
Okay.

515
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:06,477
What's next?

516
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,765
Hmm.

517
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:14,684
My chaperone is getting anxious.

518
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,603
I am sorry I can't be more help.

519
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,855
No, it's all right. I
didn't expect you to.

520
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,603
- I'm just glad
you're doing better.
- Thanks.

521
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,877
Hey, um...

522
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:27,626
maybe we were out
there for the same reasons.

523
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,485
Figure stuff out, the things
that scare us the most.

524
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,320
Which is?

525
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:36,022
Well, for me, it's-it's what
to do with my lotto winnings.

526
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,642
Every dollar is another
decision to make,

527
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,638
and, uh, the money
is just such a...

528
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:44,559
an opportunity,
and I'm just terrified

529
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,300
that I'll do the wrong thing.

530
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:48,530
And why would you think that?

531
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:49,998
Well, because ever
since I was a kid,

532
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,356
I've been making the wrong call.

533
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:56,143
Prime example: when I
was nine, my folks split.

534
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:59,980
Dad was moving
to Dallas, and they...

535
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:02,616
made me pick who to live with.

536
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:05,297
They made you choose?

537
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:07,304
Yep.

538
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,389
And I picked Mom.

539
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,075
- Hmm.
- And my dad...

540
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:17,847
never forgave me.

541
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,250
Well, I'm pretty sure
that wasn't your fault.

542
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,469
That doesn't change my fear

543
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:24,483
of making a bad choice.

544
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:27,274
Especially one that
could change my life.

545
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,479
Hey, you're a doctor.

546
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:33,659
That means you
have to make all kinds

547
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:35,081
of life and death decisions.

548
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,712
What-wha... How-how?
How do you do it?

549
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,120
You're asking the wrong person.

550
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,091
A few weeks ago,

551
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,228
a wonderful man who
loved me proposed.

552
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,534
I took so long to decide
that he changed his mind.

553
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,766
Oh, so we're-we're
similar in that way.

554
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,005
No.

555
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,869
In every other
instance in my life,

556
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,743
the correct choice was obvious.

557
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:05,762
But in this instance...

558
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,799
I weighed my options
until it was too late.

559
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,204
So...

560
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,617
So I guess that
guy from last night

561
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,052
must have been a
rebound, then, huh?

562
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,927
What guy?

563
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:22,629
The guy-the guy,
from the country club.

564
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,566
The, um... I saw you two
inside when I was heading out

565
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:27,379
- to the course.
- What's his name?

566
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:30,470
I don't know. I'm-I'm, uh,
pretty sure his dad, like,

567
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,355
owned the club, though.

568
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,829
On behalf of my
people, would you please

569
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:41,265
put the yarmulke down?

570
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:45,252
We paged Grayson 20 minutes ago.

571
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,816
- I'll find him myself. Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.
- Uh-uh.

572
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,056
♪ <i>Let me go on</i> ♪

573
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:52,904
♪ <i>Like a blister in the sun...</i> ♪

574
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:54,968
What? Only a Green
Day fan after hours?

575
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,841
- Dude, no. Not Green Day.
- Regardless,

576
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,534
last night it was performed
by another American treasure.

577
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,964
Guess we left

578
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,799
- the party too early.
- Yeah, and you left

579
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,084
before I could get Bell
his suit back. I mean,

580
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:07,518
luckily, he hasn't asked
for his dry cleaning,

581
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,171
or else ya boy would be screwed.

582
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,688
Okay, why was I
wearing Bell's suit?

583
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,591
Wait, do you... You
don't remember?

584
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:15,014
Oh, man. Best night ever.

585
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,650
Karaoke duets,

586
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:18,952
taking shots off of random
strangers' midsections.

587
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,972
And the pièce de résistance?

588
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:24,975
Crashing Daniel
Leebshitz's bar mitzvah.

589
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,271
I mean, you were
underdressed, so I let you borrow

590
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:27,656
one of the boss man's
suits to gain entry.

591
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,363
Wait, wait, wait.
I have pictures.

592
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,984
That is Daniel and
squad, us included.

593
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,702
Oh, yeah.

594
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,638
- Oy vey.
- Oh, yeah. It was lit.

595
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:41,286
Yeah.

596
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,954
Wait, no, no, no, no.
Those are memories.

597
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:46,045
Grayson and Mina. First
Grayna adventure ever.

598
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,898
Last adventure ever.

599
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,827
Clearly, I came to my senses
and fled to the golf course

600
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,051
for some peace and quiet.

601
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,303
Well, not before
pouring your heart about

602
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,967
how much you love
surgery and dinosaurs.

603
00:27:55,991 --> 00:27:57,290
Dinosaurs?

604
00:27:57,326 --> 00:27:59,293
- That's crazy.
- Unexpected.

605
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:01,248
Yeah. Specifically,
velociraptors.

606
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,164
Raptors.

607
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,194
- You must've heard wrong.
- Uh, no.

608
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:09,019
I had a video on there before
you deleted it, but whatever.

609
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,253
Haters gonna hate.

610
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,644
Um, no. That's not
what that means.

611
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,323
Raptors...

612
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:21,831
Mm-mmm. Nope.

613
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,095
I got your page.
Everything okay?

614
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,736
Uh, yeah. There's just one
question I need help with.

615
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,616
What do I put for "Are
there any limitations

616
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,452
on the information
that can be released?"

617
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,543
These are to release
your medical records, Jess.

618
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,573
- You going somewhere?
- Nic didn't tell you?

619
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:37,576
She thinks I get
on the transplant list

620
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,083
someplace else, so...

621
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,230
Even if you're approved
and listed as a recipient

622
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,048
at another hospital,
the wait for the kidney

623
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:46,184
still takes years, no
matter where you are.

624
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,593
You'll be on the list here in a
few months. Why not stay here?

625
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:52,546
I... Hey, I just do what
the big sis tells me.

626
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:55,899
Nic seems really sure I
can get a kidney now, so...

627
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,151
that's good, right?

628
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,388
Right.

629
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:03,924
Well, maybe I'll swing by
later to talk to her about it.

630
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,575
Another '80s movie night?

631
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:07,851
Yeah, if she doesn't
bail like she did last night.

632
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,030
Why'd she bail last night?

633
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:13,566
She rushed off to the
clinic for some emergency.

634
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:17,382
<i>Hey, there.</i>

635
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:20,073
Hey.

636
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:21,925
You want to watch the sunset?

637
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:23,543
It's really nice.

638
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:26,229
Oh, I'd love to, but,
uh, unfortunately,

639
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,848
- I've come to say goodbye.
- Well, where are you going?

640
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,565
Well, the truth is that um...

641
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:37,307
Chastain's board is gathering
as we speak, and, uh,

642
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,176
I don't think I'm gonna
be around much longer.

643
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,263
- What? Why... why not?
- Because at the end of the day,

644
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,732
a hospital is a business.

645
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:48,418
And if a CEO can't find
a way to pay the bills,

646
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,097
then the board will
find one who can,

647
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,588
whether it impacts
patient care or not.

648
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,659
I am just so sorry
to hear that, Dr. Bell.

649
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:58,361
You've been so good to me.

650
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,114
Oh, thank you, Taylor.
I appreciate that.

651
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:05,185
'Cause I was
always a doctor first.

652
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,471
Never practiced
anywhere but Chastain.

653
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,707
I never-I never wanted to.

654
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,611
When you're a-a charity
that relies on donations,

655
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,813
and the...

656
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:20,884
and the donors aren't
feeling generous,

657
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,303
there's not much you
can do but face the music.

658
00:30:28,677 --> 00:30:30,676
Dr. Bell, I want to help.

659
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,715
What do you mean?

660
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,768
I think I can.

661
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,313
What's going on?

662
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:57,137
His SATs dropped into the 70s.

663
00:30:57,172 --> 00:31:00,673
- I was just here. He was fine.
- It's not an infection.

664
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,604
There's no fever, his white
blood cell count's normal,

665
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,605
yet he's worsening
at an alarming rate.

666
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,746
We should've done
the bronchoscopy.

667
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,662
You're damn right
we should have.

668
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,886
Where are we?

669
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:15,588
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.

670
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,901
Explains his
difficulty breathing.

671
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:19,725
Nothing a little
lung lavage can't fix.

672
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:25,899
Mm. All right, here we go.

673
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:28,301
Ready for some fun?

674
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,605
Gentle. Gentle. Don't hurt him.

675
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,635
Don't worry, I'll make sure
your golden goose lives

676
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,076
to lay another egg.

677
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,453
Ha, ha!

678
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,548
Hey. Have you seen Nic?

679
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,865
Is she in with a patient?

680
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,268
No. She's not here.
Is everything okay?

681
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,920
Eh, it's...

682
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:06,606
Suddenly, Nic's very confident

683
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:09,209
Jessie is gonna
find a kidney soon.

684
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:11,072
Transferring her
to another hospital.

685
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,496
I just... I don't know where
the kidney's coming from.

686
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,510
Well, your guess is as good
as mine. They must've found

687
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:17,801
a Good Samaritan donor
you don't know about.

688
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:20,787
Yeah. Nic was here last
night. Do you know why?

689
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,623
Sounds like you got some
trust issues to work out.

690
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:25,353
Yeah. Well, she would

691
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,777
do anything for her sister.

692
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:32,615
Whatever's going on,
I'm sure she's being smart

693
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,412
and protecting herself.

694
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:36,936
Yeah, I don't
know, man, I just...

695
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:39,473
can only think of one way

696
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:41,774
Nic could get a kidney
for Jessie right now,

697
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,993
and it's illegal.

698
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:44,978
And I don't think she would've

699
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:46,313
thought of it on her own.

700
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,734
Nic has a mind that's
very much her own.

701
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,154
And I'd say if she's found

702
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:56,017
a way to help her
sister, that's a good thing.

703
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,958
You think you're helping Nic,

704
00:32:57,993 --> 00:32:59,509
but you're not.

705
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,555
Have you given any
thought to what happens

706
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,429
if this goes wrong?

707
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:05,431
She could end up in jail.

708
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:07,233
Got to close up.

709
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,448
You know, if she wanted
you involved, she would've

710
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:12,689
- come to you. She didn't.
- No.

711
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,302
You went to her,
you put this in motion,

712
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,625
and now you're hanging back

713
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,388
while she closes
the deal all alone.

714
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,407
All the risk is with
her. W-What... you get

715
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,559
- some sort of finder's fee?
- This is a joke, right?

716
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,016
Oh, come on.

717
00:33:23,051 --> 00:33:25,384
Where is the organ broker?

718
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,121
This is none of your business.

719
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:31,457
- None of my business?
- Yeah.

720
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:33,493
I know you're
trying to help Nic.

721
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:36,663
But this line that she's
about to cross will destroy her.

722
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,715
Do you want that
on your conscience?

723
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,586
I just want to talk to her.

724
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,466
Nic?

725
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,891
- Conrad, what...
- Don't do this.

726
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,938
You didn't like jail when you
were there for a few nights,

727
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,045
do you really want
to go back for years?

728
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,599
That's not gonna happen.

729
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,034
You don't know that.

730
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,631
They'll take away
your license for life.

731
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,232
You'll never be a
nurse practitioner again.

732
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,724
I'm not a match, Conrad.

733
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,104
Kyle's avoiding my phone calls.
What do you want me to do?

734
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,628
- We'll find another way.
- How? Tell me how.

735
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,998
We treat her underlying
heart condition.

736
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:30,945
Now that heart
failure's involved,

737
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,889
you know she's
not gonna make it.

738
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,022
Are you telling me to give up?

739
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:38,358
No, I'm not telling
you to give up.

740
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:41,894
What I'm saying is what
you're thinking of doing is awful.

741
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,901
How many times have I watched
you cross a line for a patient?

742
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,237
A stranger to you?
This is my sister.

743
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:57,093
Be honest.

744
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:58,962
If it were me

745
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:00,713
and I needed a kidney...

746
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:03,500
It was the only option...

747
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,484
What'd you do?

748
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,973
Anything.

749
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,110
<i>Hey, this is Kyle.</i>

750
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,300
<i>You know what to do.</i>

751
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,097
Kyle, it's me again.

752
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:40,598
I still haven't heard
back from you. Listen,

753
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:41,838
Jessie is running out of time

754
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:43,834
and I'm about to
do something that...

755
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:46,710
Just please...

756
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,161

10,000. Good.

762
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,299
Down payment out of the way.

763
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,685
Now we talk details.

764
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,540
I want to meet the donor
before we move forward with this.

765
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,759
You already have.

766
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:25,932
Paige has been counting
tips here since high school.

767
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,152
The, um, the transplant staff...

768
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,264
They're trained to identify

769
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,422
if a donated organ was bought.

770
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:35,141
I shall coach donor
and recipient with a story

771
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:38,144
to explain how they
know each other.

772
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,179
Grade school
friends who lost touch

773
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:42,715
and reconnected on social media.

774
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:45,818
And Paige saw one of
Jessie's posts about her health

775
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:48,071
and wanted to help.

776
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:51,002
And they shouldn't
practice too much.

777
00:36:51,026 --> 00:36:53,743
Can't sound rehearsed.

778
00:36:55,397 --> 00:36:57,763
A... Uh, is she
prepared for this?

779
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:00,400
Don't worry about that.
She's made a choice.

780
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:02,268

Yeah, the check.

785
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,180
The check.

786
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:15,848
Just got to sign it.

787
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,786
Oh... you know what?

788
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,055
I think this pen is out of ink.

789
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,395
Oh, man.

790
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:31,630
This feels so good.

791
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,928
Honestly, I think-I think
this is the easiest decision

792
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,813
- I've ever made, I mean...
- Hmm.

793
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,648
Maybe I'm, um,
turning over a new leaf.

794
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,173
You know? Oh.

795
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:45,245
Thank you.

796
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,529
Really.

797
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,265
Thank you.

798
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:57,173
The... Um... this, uh...

799
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,392
That's just the
first installment.

800
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:01,071
-Oh, yeah, right, of
course. I mean, -Yeah.

801
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:03,279
Who keeps $36 million
in a checking account?

802
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,860
- No, I'd be happy
to arrange a wire transfer.
- Yeah.

803
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,768
No, I don't have $36 million.

804
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:10,781
I mean, when the-when
you win the lottery,

805
00:38:10,805 --> 00:38:13,134
they give you a choice: you
can either take the lump sum

806
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,791
or you can get weekly payments.

807
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,776
Which actually ends up
being way more in the end.

808
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,913
So, only idiots
choose the lump sum.

809
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:22,014
- That was an easy one.
- Uh, yeah. Smart.

810
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,682
I think so.

811
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,953
Dr. Bell, you can count on me

812
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:30,640
for 13 grand a week
for the next 30 years.

813
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,977
Yo, how is she?

814
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,374
She is in the room.

815
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,598
So do not speak of
her as though she is not.

816
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:40,199
Good news.

817
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,452
Your observation period is over.

818
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,504
And as your concussion
officer, I officially release you.

819
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,568
- Okay, I'm getting out of here.
- Or you can come watch

820
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,219
the bypass on this
inverses patient.

821
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,860
That surgery was this morning.

822
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,345
I had it rescheduled.

823
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,879
The patient needed stabilization

824
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,526
and I didn't want
you to miss it.

825
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,033
OR in ten.

826
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:01,588
Your reign of terror is over.

827
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:06,420
- You know I hate it
when you smile.
- I can't help it.

828
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,372
Because I finally figured out
something you're not good at.

829
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:10,379
Impossible.

830
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,081
Matters of the heart, Mina.

831
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,677
You might be a
genius at medicine,

832
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:16,052
but when it comes to love...

833
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:19,205
A proposal and now these
unexpected Raptor feelings...

834
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,840
Is too much.

835
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,392
So you purged
and you let it out...

836
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,661
and you did the right thing.

837
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,746
He's my mentor.

838
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,582
Nothing more.

839
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:32,552
Some lines can't be crossed.

840
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,889
Sometimes a velociraptor...

841
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:37,923
is just a velociraptor.

842
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:42,857
Look, I already told
Nurse Nevin I can't

843
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,625
- bend the rules for her sister.
- We both know

844
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,083
you're willing to bend the
rules when it benefits you.

845
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,952
How could it
possibly benefit me?

846
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,274
I offer you something
bigger in return.

847
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,627
Hey.

848
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,898
They'll put Jessie
on the transplant list.

849
00:40:18,934 --> 00:40:20,378
What?

850
00:40:20,402 --> 00:40:23,302
Now she can have
the surgery at Chastain.

851
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,987
All we need is a kidney.

852
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,755
How?

853
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,875
Doesn't matter how.

854
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,993
And we will do
everything to make sure

855
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,496
the transplant goes well as
soon as the donor gets here.

856
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,251
There is no donor.

857
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,655
What?

858
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,810
The 30-year-old woman who

859
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:50,480
was willing to
sell her kidney...

860
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,815
She was only gonna make
ten percent of the money.

861
00:40:54,269 --> 00:40:56,164
Elliot takes advantage
of these people.

862
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:58,471
It's disgusting.

863
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:01,324
Even if...

864
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,693
this transplant goes
well, Jessie will always

865
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,646
be an addict in recovery.

866
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:09,182
I need to be better for her,
someone that she can look up to.

867
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,216
If I'd gone through with this...

868
00:41:14,956 --> 00:41:16,836
Nic, you made
the right decision.

869
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,543
I hope so.

870
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,457
But I am not giving
up on a kidney.

871
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,215
There has got to be another way.

872
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:30,119
We will find one.

873
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,557
I know we will.

874
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:03,169
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

875
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:06,255
Just gonna pack
up and leave, huh?

876
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,728
Look, Nic...

877
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,863
I don't regret
anything I've done.

878
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:17,416
Not in the past and certainly
not in the last couple days.

879
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,519
I am who I am, and
that's not gonna change.

880
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:22,739
I know.

881
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:27,426
And I know you're
always gonna love him.

882
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,935
Thank you for everything.

883
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,222
Alec, honestly.

884
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:46,524
See you, Nic.

885
00:42:46,548 --> 00:42:47,741
- Good luck.
- Mm-hmm.

886
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,549
Thanks.

887
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:53,970
Hey, Nic.

888
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,933
You know you never
needed me here, right?

889
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:57,523
The clinic...

890
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,591
It's yours.

891
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,010
As it should be.
