00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,413
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- The device industry

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:05,904
needs people like you
to fix a broken system.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,550
If you see something
that's not right,

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,909
you will be there to
blow the whistle and fix it.

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,405
We manufacture
everything ourselves

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,045
<i>right here in Atlanta.</i>

7
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,638
I want a top-notch attorney.

8
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:24,701
Someone who wears a
fancier suit than you do.

9
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,669
And I get half a million
dollars to make bail

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,321
so I can get out
of this rat hole.

11
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:29,739
It's our first year of marriage.

12
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,264
Come with me to San Francisco.

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,565
I can't leave.

14
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,940
This is crazy,
meeting here today,

15
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,391
the day of your wedding.

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,890
I'm not going to San
Francisco with Priya.

17
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,948
- Y-You're not getting married?
- I don't know what I'm doing.

18
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:53,451
All I know is she took the
job, and I'm staying here.

19
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,621
No. Whatever happens
between you and Priya

20
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,105
has nothing to do with me.

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,885
I'm not breaking up a marriage.

22
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:01,960
And if you are staying here,
that changes nothing for us,

23
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,930
because I-I'm leaving Atlanta.

24
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:06,598
What do you mean?

25
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,133
I'm quitting my job.

26
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,684
Why?

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,898
Let's just say the medical
world turns out to be

28
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:13,555
not what I expected.

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,867
Hold on a second.
I don't understand.

30
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,203
- What happened?
- I can't talk about it.

31
00:01:16,227 --> 00:01:19,094
I have to meet Gordon
Page for a tour with investors.

32
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:22,063
Julian... it can't
end like this.

33
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,933
- Yes, it can.
- Wait, wait, don't go.

34
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:29,070
Everything's falling apart.

35
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:31,406
For me, too.

36
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,741
Good-bye, Devon.

37
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,015
Wow. You didn't
make that, did you?

38
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,808
If I'm going to be tortured,
I want to look damn good.

39
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,561
- Tortured?
- I hate weddings.

40
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:54,662
- I love them.
- They're all the same.

41
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,960
You know exactly what's going
to happen, and they're long.

42
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,745
So long.

43
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,453
Well, I'm sure
you will cheerfully

44
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,366
suffer your way through
Devon and Priya's.

45
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,702
We got to go. We're gonna
be late for our presentation.

46
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,759
- Wish us luck.
- You're gonna need it.

47
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,256
Bell spending money
to actually help patients,

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,196
that's not really his thing.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,166
This is premature.

50
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,821
Or optimistic.

51
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,158
We only spend one
percent of our revenue

52
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,198
on community services.

53
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,028
That's way below the
four percent required

54
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,136
to maintain our
nonprofit status.

55
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:37,139
In plain English,
Chastain gets 20.6 million

56
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:38,440
every year from Uncle Sam.

57
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:39,703
And in return, we do nothing

58
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,393
to justify our tax break.

59
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,012
So you're proposing the
board fund a free clinic

60
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,965
for the uninsured
and establish it here,

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,067
right across the
street from our ER.

62
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,381
The proximity to Chastain
could be a huge advantage.

63
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,323
We could defer patients who
can't pay their hospital bills

64
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:56,909
to the clinic, where we
can give them better care.

65
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,960
How much is the
rent on this space?

66
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,857
The city owns the
building, and has agreed

67
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,715
- to let us use it for free.
- You've been busy.

68
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,335
You okay?

69
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,316
Yeah, I'm fine.

70
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,318
Well, it's a lovely
idea, but so far,

71
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:12,858
it's all just pie in the sky.

72
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,993
When am I gonna see
some real numbers?

73
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,360
Who's gonna staff it?

74
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,696
Volunteers from Chastain,

75
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,158
medical students
and retired nurses.

76
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:21,194
Not everything's free.
We will have to hire

77
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:23,051
a top primary-care physician.

78
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,654
Sounds like a... a win-win.

79
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,505
Call 911. Let's just
get him to the ER.

80
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,224
Marshall, tell
me where it hurts.

81
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,101
♪ ♪

82
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,881
He's been getting steadily
weaker these past few months.

83
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,566
I'm old. It's normal.

84
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,734
65 isn't old. It's the new 40.

85
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,938
We know what's
wrong, but this...

86
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,190
this is what gave me
a tentative diagnosis.

87
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,643
Listen.

88
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,415
I still have a heartbeat.
That's reassuring.

89
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,701
Daddy, be serious.

90
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:14,369
You have a loud heart murmur.

91
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:16,232
An echocardiogram
confirmed that he has

92
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,489
severe aortic stenosis.

93
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,640
His aortic valve is
so tightly narrowed

94
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,226
that the blood has a hard
time leaving the heart,

95
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,124
robbing the rest of the
body of oxygen-rich blood.

96
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:26,559
Which is why I'm so darned
tired and out of breath.

97
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,150
I'm gonna bring in
our best surgeon,

98
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,969
Dr. AJ Austin,

99
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,448
and he's going to
explain the options

100
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,068
of valve-replacement surgery.

101
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:37,108
He's got a great beard, too.

102
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,938
Well, how long will this take?

103
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:41,829
- I got to get to Nicaragua.
- Nicaragua?

104
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,182
Another one of his Habitat
for Humanity projects.

105
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,168
I'm retired, returning to
my first love, carpentry.

106
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,466
Well, you can expect to stay
in the hospital for about a week.

107
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,368
Full recovery may take a
while, but you are young,

108
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,658
and you're in good health, okay?

109
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,995
So let's admit you,
get you fixed up.

110
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,998
Nicaragua's waiting.

111
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,254
Dr. Hawkins, can I have a word?

112
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,123
Of course. What's wrong?

113
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:11,175
Look, I lost my mom
when I was born.

114
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,107
It's always just
been the two of us.

115
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:16,025
And now my dad is
helping to raise my son,

116
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,349
who just adores him,
and... and, look, I get it.

117
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,780
All hospitals are dangerous
and surgeries have their risks...

118
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:22,687
I'll keep an eye out for him.

119
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,889
Thank you.

120
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,227
- All right.
- Yeah.

121
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,515
Hey.

122
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,550
Amazing man.

123
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,702
- Okay.
- So warm with his daughter.

124
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,237
I wish he were my father.

125
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,317
Well, right now your
real father needs you.

126
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,461
He's coming into the ER.

127
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,383
I want transport
to Atlanta General.

128
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,868
- My regular doctor is there.
- How's that gonna look?

129
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:55,598
Our chairman of the
board won't be treated

130
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,099
in his own hospital? Come on.

131
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,708
All right, BP's
105/80, pulse is 110.

132
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,326
Put him in bay ten.

133
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,681
I already have a team
of doctors working...

134
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,481
We need a diagnosis before
we transport you anywhere.

135
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:10,018
I know exactly what
this is. I have Crohn's.

136
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:12,887
I've had it for 20 years. I
know how to manage it.

137
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,256
Doesn't look that way.
Why didn't you tell me?

138
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,193
- Why would I bother my son?
- Uh, wild guess,

139
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:20,223
- because I'm a doctor.
- It's under control.

140
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,791
Every once in a
while, it flares up,

141
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,198
and this is one of those days.

142
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:24,282
One, two, three.

143
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,280
Crohn's can have
dangerous complications,

144
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,720
so let's get you
up to the VIP wing.

145
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,068
We'll get your records and
tag in your gastroenterologist.

146
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,436
- Excellent idea.
- Our VIP wing

147
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,054
is nicer and far better equipped

148
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:36,694
than Atlanta General's.

149
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,962
They're ganging up on me.

150
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,692
They're trying to
take care of you.

151
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:41,299
Feldman, keep me posted.

152
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,918
I'll make arrangements
to admit you.

153
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,740
- You didn't know?
- He doesn't tell me anything.

154
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,693
He's impossible.

155
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:53,940
Mm, flashing back to that
time you sprained your ankle

156
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:56,030
and wouldn't let
anyone help you.

157
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:58,566
I was nothing like that.

158
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:01,419
A father and son who
refuse to be treated.

159
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:05,957
I'd say the apple falls
directly under the tree.

160
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:10,045
Listen, Todd, you, me,
Paris, this New Year's.

161
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,413
It's gonna be insane.
We'll go clubbing.

162
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:14,894
We'll just have a
really good... I got to go.

163
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:17,636
Hey, uh, you had three
incoming calls, two from...

164
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,771
I can find it. I wrote it down.

165
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,234
It's somewhere right here.

166
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:22,307
God, help me.

167
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,342
Um, I know one was from Roberta,

168
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,461
uh, from that lab
place with the initials.

169
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:28,963
They all have initials.

170
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,965
Do you have a
learning disability?

171
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,695
Um, and your
lawyer, McMullins...

172
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,902
- McCrary.
- Mc-McCrary.

173
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:37,355
Uh, he is in your office.

174
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,441
- Hold my calls.
- Actually, wait, hold on.

175
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,860
He seems a tad sleazy to me.

176
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,339
Maybe you should
have my dad hook you up

177
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,996
with one of his lawyers.

178
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,182
This deposition you gave
Lane Hunter's lawyers,

179
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,684
you should have called me.

180
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,363
<i>Dr. Hunter is charged with</i>

181
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,970
<i>the death of Lily Kendall.</i>

182
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,206
<i>How long were you
and my client lovers?</i>

183
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,478
<i>Um, I was not in love with her.</i>

184
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,764
<i>She says you slept
with her many times.</i>

185
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:05,166
<i>Uh, a-a-a few times.</i>

186
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:07,468
<i>Not many.</i>

187
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:10,155
How many times is "many"?

188
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,141
What are you not telling me?

189
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,710
There's some kind of sex tape.

190
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,963
In the legal world,
there's a term for this.

191
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,682
It's called a disaster.

192
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,834
This woman is as
popular as Hitler,

193
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,580
and the fact that you were
with her between the sheets

194
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,738
is gonna make
people's skin crawl.

195
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,717
You'll be fired. Your
reputation will be...

196
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,908
Look, enough.

197
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,810
This is how I get out of it.

198
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,811
I'm all ears.

199
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,309
I've agreed to post her bail
and help her find a good lawyer.

200
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,145
- Seriously, you're just
digging a deeper hole.
- Hear me out.

201
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,868
She could get off.

202
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,921
There's a doctor in Texas
who raped his patients,

203
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,641
just got off with a slap
on the wrist, no jail time.

204
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:49,177
Kept his license.

205
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,098
They're gonna paint
her as aggressive,

206
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,715
not criminal.

207
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,996
Dr. Hunter saved
hundreds of lives.

208
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,655
And if she gets off,
then any lingering sense

209
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,990
that Chastain is to
blame goes away, too.

210
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:04,392
Everyone's exonerated.

211
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:07,111
Dr. Hunter's bail is set
at five million dollars.

212
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,447
Ten percent of which
they'll need in cash.

213
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,843
You don't get that back.

214
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,595
That's what the bail
bondsman charges.

215
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,502
Well, she'll pay me back.

216
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:17,133
- She has money
in offshore accounts.
- You believe that?

217
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,102
Look, it's the
least of my worries.

218
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,143
I'd pay half a million
dollars to make this go away.

219
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,617
Welcome to QuoVadis.

220
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,853
We are very excited
to give you the first

221
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,871
exclusive tour.

222
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,073
Now, a little housekeeping
before we proceed.

223
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,192
NDAs have to be signed.

224
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:40,256
We guard our trade
secrets with our lives.

225
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,307
I think you can trust
a four-star general.

226
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,899
Well, as Ronald Reagan
said, "Trust, but verify."

227
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:47,101
How's the VNS pilot
going at Chastain?

228
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:48,803
So far, so good.

229
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,622
We just cured
intractable seizures

230
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,403
in an eight-year-old boy.

231
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,476
It's the kind of
story we live for.

232
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,996
DARPA is very
interested in VNS devices

233
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,780
for brain stimulation and more.

234
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:01,249
Yeah, it's a great market.

235
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:03,228
I was an early investor
in two tech giants,

236
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:04,947
and even they
weren't this paranoid.

237
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,757
Well, trust me, our
technology is worth it.

238
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,855
You understand that,
for military contracts,

239
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,663
all products must, by law,
be made in the United States?

240
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,299
All QuoVadis devices are
manufactured at our facility

241
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:19,751
here in Georgia.

242
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,187
This is where we
design all our prototypes.

243
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,850
This is where we
do all our testing.

244
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,941
From start to finish,
made in the USA.

245
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:40,004
Our engineering is unrivaled,

246
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,040
and our patient
outcomes show it.

247
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,975
But if that doesn't
convince you,

248
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,005
then how does a
thousand percent return

249
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:48,195
on your investment sound?

250
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,648
By the end of this year,
we are projecting revenues

251
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,445
of 50 million.

252
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:55,970
Next year, after
we go nationwide:

253
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,555
500 million.

254
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,390
In three years...

255
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,743
five billion.

256
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,402
- How's he doing?
- Better.

257
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:14,004
He's on hydromorphone for pain.

258
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,841
Doesn't seem so intimidating
just lying there, does he?

259
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,660
I can hear you.

260
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,347
Well, keep me updated
on his condition.

261
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,144
I want his ins and outs.
Complete breakdown.

262
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:27,518
Urine, stool, the works.

263
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,889
No secrets between a
doctor and a patient, right?

264
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,675
You're not actually his
doctor. Dr. Simmons is.

265
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,271
Dad, this is the
chief of Chastain's

266
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,877
gastroenterology department.

267
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:39,380
She's a leading expert
in Crohn's disease.

268
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,649
- Dr. Bell.
- Irena.

269
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:43,379
- Thanks for joining.
- Mr. Winthrop,

270
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,887
I have spoken to your
team over at Atlanta General.

271
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,432
They sent over all of
your records, and I think

272
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,868
I have a pretty
good lay of the land.

273
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:50,703
So now I just want to
run some blood work,

274
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:52,327
check for inflammatory markers.

275
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:54,439
But, once you're
stable, if you do still want

276
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,058
to be transferred over
to Atlanta General,

277
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,215
- we can arrange that.
- Thanks.

278
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,651
Feel like a helicopter ride?

279
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,536
Your insurance will pay.

280
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,116
I think I'm good here,

281
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,518
- thank you.
- We've started you

282
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,203
on IV fluids, and we'll
need to put an NG tube in

283
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,222
- to help decompress
your abdomen.
- Yeah, that should

284
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:10,807
get you feeling better
so you can get some rest.

285
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:14,632
Thank you all. I'm
sorry to be a bother.

286
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,818
If we're done here, I
want to talk to Conrad.

287
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,005
Alone.

288
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,675
Of course.

289
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,794
Thank you.

290
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,616
Talk to him like you
talk to all of your patients.

291
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,298
- How's the pain?
- Mm, better.

292
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,734
I've been dealing
with this for 20 years.

293
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,921
It started shortly
after your mom left me.

294
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,639
Okay, wait.

295
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,259
Mom didn't leave
you. You left her.

296
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,746
Well, that's irrelevant
at the moment, isn't it?

297
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,251
Yes. It is.

298
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,452
Go ahead. What
were you gonna say?

299
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:12,840
Look, Conrad, thank
you for your help.

300
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,292
Now let Dr. Simmons take over.

301
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:19,430
I came back here to
get to know my son,

302
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,535
fully aware of the things
that stood between us.

303
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,970
And I think we've
made real progress

304
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,456
in leaving the past behind.

305
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:31,437
So let's not endanger that.

306
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:33,027
Okay, fine.

307
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,881
Whatever happens,
I can't be a burden.

308
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,334
It's not my style.

309
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:45,289
You do not have
to take care of me.

310
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,309
This is what I do, Dad.

311
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,311
You okay?

312
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,497
Yeah. I'm good.

313
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:13,846
Are these meant
to be form-fitting?

314
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,570
- I don't want to look fat.
- You wear scrubs.

315
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,706
Horrible green
scrubs, like, every day.

316
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,558
Exactly. Hello, Mrs. Pravesh.

317
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,627
Hello.

318
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,861
You look lovely today.

319
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:31,201
Thank you. Yes, I
do look smashing.

320
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,771
But all eyes will be

321
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:36,040
on the happy couple.

322
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,075
I'm so proud of you.

323
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,495
I'll try to keep it that way.

324
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:43,447
What does that mean?

325
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,883
Nothing.

326
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,736
- Hmm?
- Nothing, Ma.

327
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,573
Go. Go, go, go. Let us
finish getting dressed, okay?

328
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,027
See you in a bit.

329
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,245
Yes. Bye-bye. See you.

330
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,712
He's thinking about screaming
kids, mortgage payments,

331
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,420
the dad bod.

332
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:07,700
It's a wedding,
not a funeral, dude.

333
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:08,906
Dad bod is inevitable.

334
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,125
Thank you, guys.

335
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,477
Yes. Yes. Excellent.

336
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,030
Yes, we will.

337
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:18,616
Another two commitments,
each for 25 million.

338
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,035
I'm happy for you, Gordon.

339
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,265
The lab is incredibly
impressive.

340
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,721
You are a great salesman.

341
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,651
You should celebrate.
Take the afternoon off.

342
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,975
I wouldn't know what
to do with myself.

343
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,621
Personal trainer is
waiting in the gym

344
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,996
for my lunchtime workout.
I'll be back in an hour.

345
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,065
There are great things on the
horizon, Julian, for both of us.

346
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,218
You picked the
perfect VNS patient.

347
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:39,253
And I will reward you.

00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:11,168
Hi.

350
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,004
Julian Booth, sales. Mr. Page
left his phone in the lab.

351
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm just gonna go
in and get it for him.

352
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:27,718
Hey. I was just looking
for Gordon Page's phone.

353
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,688
Okay, no worries.
Um, if you find it,

354
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,040
just bring it to
the office, okay?

355
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:44,902
It's called a TAVR.

356
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,570
We snake a catheter

357
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,222
through an artery in your groin,

358
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,136
and we replace the
valve in your heart

359
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,154
without ever cutting
into your chest.

360
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,072
Is... is that as
simple as it sounds?

361
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,497
Well, I've only done a few
hundred TAVRs in my career,

362
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:59,750
and every single one of them
have gone off without a hitch.

363
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,252
Now, I have an opening,
and I can schedule it

364
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,383
this afternoon, once
your pre-op tests come in.

365
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:06,907
I could even fit in
nine holes of golf,

366
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,559
if I played golf, which I don't.

367
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,978
Wait, this-this afternoon?
That is so soon.

368
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,347
I mean, I have so many
questions. What are the risks?

369
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:15,194
How long will he have
to stay in the hospital?

370
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:16,745
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, slow your roll.

371
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,664
Every surgery has
its share of risks,

372
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:20,905
especially for an
older gentleman.

373
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,018
- Oh, watch yourself.
- However,

374
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,576
for a mature,
well-seasoned adult,

375
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,773
and in such good physical
condition as yourself,

376
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,080
the risks will be minimal.

377
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:36,253
Well, let's get this over with.

378
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,239
Nicaragua awaits.

379
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,035
Those houses won't
build themselves.

380
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,409
Very wise man there.

381
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,776
There.

382
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,966
Ah, it's a stricture

383
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,368
in the area of your
father's last anastomosis.

384
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,198
It's probably
been there a while.

385
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:55,467
If it gets any worse, he's
gonna be completely obstructed.

386
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,307
Yes, I'm gonna recommend

387
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:00,444
that we schedule surgery
sometime in the next few days.

388
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,879
Why so fast?

389
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,441
If it gets completely
obstructed,

390
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,460
it could compromise
blood flow to the intestine.

391
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,962
I would trust
Dr. Simmons and Conrad.

392
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,881
Once the blood
flow is compromised,

393
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:10,871
the intestine may perforate,

394
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:13,541
- and then you would be septic.
- That's life-threatening.

395
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:15,320
When would you do it?

396
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,395
How long is the rehab, and
what are the risks of the surgery?

397
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,648
Well, all surgeries have risks.
But this one we do routinely.

398
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,285
And I'd recommend you have
it done sooner rather than later.

399
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,470
Tomorrow. That would be best.

400
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,106
That way, we can do
some pre-op testing,

401
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,342
book an OR and
line up a top surgeon.

402
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,977
Anybody but Bell.

403
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,962
He'd be at the
bottom of my list.

404
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:36,441
See, isn't it great
having a doctor

405
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,643
in the family, Mr. Winthrop?

406
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,333
Looks like I'm in your hands,

407
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,820
- and I will do whatever you say.
- Tomorrow it is.

408
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,123
Okay. I'll book an OR and check
the general surgeon's schedule.

409
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,692
Now, there is one more
issue. I have all of my patients

410
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,312
fill out a health care proxy
and a medical directive.

411
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:54,998
This is not to say I expect
you will need it. I do not.

412
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,035
- But even I have one.
- It's standard of care, also.

413
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,537
If there's anything I've
learned at Chastain,

414
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,756
it's that there are
no guarantees.

415
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,643
If I'm incapacitated,

416
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,512
my son has my medical
power of attorney.

417
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:12,516
I trust him to make any
decisions that need to be made.

418
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,720
There must be someone
closer to him than me

419
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,215
to make those decisions.
We're making progress,

420
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,606
but there's a 20-year gap.

421
00:19:18,641 --> 00:19:20,507
He doesn't have anyone but you.

422
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,671
That's kind of a testimony
to how he's lived his life.

423
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,895
Here he is, sick.
No one's visiting.

424
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,897
I don't want this
responsibility.

425
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,199
Rose never leaves
her father's side.

426
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:31,155
They finish each
other's sentences.

427
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,371
I barely know my father.

428
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,624
Well, maybe you should fix that.

429
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,534
Gordon here. What's up?

430
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,847
<i>It's me, Randolph.</i>

431
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,971
I have a favor to ask.

432
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:52,890
<i>I love doing favors.</i>

433
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,845
I need money. A fair amount.

434
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,149
Huh. Well, I could
let you in on the IPO.

435
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:03,912
Those shares will
be worth millions.

436
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,769
That could take six months.

437
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:08,272
<i>You need it fast.</i>

438
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,508
How about a position
on the board of directors?

439
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,178
It's salaried, of course.
The figure is generous.

440
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,624
Well, how much
are we talking about?

441
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,048
<i>How much do you need?</i>

442
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,835
Half a million.

443
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,837
Ooh, that is steep.

444
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:27,925
But easily handled. I can
advance you the cash right away,

445
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:31,846
<i>and we'll find a
quid pro quo later.</i>

446
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:34,531
There are so many ways
for a high-profile doctor

447
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,834
to help QuoVadis.

448
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,403
I have one job today, and that's

449
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,100
to get you to the
church on time.

450
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:44,525
The venue is
downstairs in the hotel.

451
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,460
I think we'll make it.
And you have two jobs.

452
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,947
Hmm? Right. The rings.

453
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:56,920
Oh, my God. Oh, where are they?

454
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,917
I heard a ding when
I got out of my car.

455
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,819
I thought I dropped a
penny in the sewer, but...

456
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,910
Stop it.

457
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,146
You.

458
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,179
You know, the
funny thing is that

459
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,430
you actually thought
that was funny.

460
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:14,433
Is losing your sense
of humor part of

461
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,056
the marriage vows?

462
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:18,325
Look, man, are you okay?

463
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,727
Because you don't seem okay.

464
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:24,265
And I'm here to talk and
listen if you want to talk.

465
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,850
I also have a getaway car ready.

466
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:32,422
- Hello,<i> beta.</i> How are you?
- Hi, Mom.

467
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,808
May I have a word?

468
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,749
I'll be by the
elevators, pacing.

469
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,872
Big day, huh?

470
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,307
- Nervous?
- A little.

471
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,160
Thank you.

472
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,463
I remember my wedding day.

473
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:58,665
You know it was an
arranged marriage, right?

474
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,651
And yet it worked out.

475
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,686
Yes, it did.

476
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,555
Eventually.

477
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,307
It was not easy.

478
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:10,110
I was trapped in the beginning.

479
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:12,646
It was not love at first sight.

480
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:15,682
And, Devon...

481
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:20,187
there was somebody
else in my life.

482
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,139
But I was a good girl.

483
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,009
I did everything my
parents told me to do.

484
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,871
So I broke it off
with this young man

485
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:29,713
because I knew that
they didn't approve.

486
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:32,799
Mom, if there's something
that you want to tell me,

487
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:35,219
just say it.

488
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,688
It has taken me a long time

489
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,057
to accept my fate.

490
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,343
I would lie awake
in bed at night

491
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:44,845
thinking about that
other young boy.

492
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:49,383
What was he doing?
Does he miss me?

493
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:53,320
I even thought of contacting
him so many times.

494
00:22:53,356 --> 00:22:56,557
- You love Dad?
- Yes.

495
00:22:56,592 --> 00:23:00,427
I'm happy now, Devon.
I've come to love your father.

496
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,946
He's a good man.

497
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,882
But this is

498
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:06,833
and this will always be

499
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,336
your decision.

500
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:13,908
I want you to marry the
woman who has your heart.

501
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,878
Okay? Okay.

502
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:27,605
I hope it's Priya.

503
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,590
But, Devon, if it's not,

504
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,943
don't do this for
me or for your father

505
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,862
or for anyone else.

506
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:38,399
We just want you to be happy.

507
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,401
Okay?

I might have been a part of.

523
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:25,529
<i>- Are you in Atlanta right now?</i>
- I am.

524
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,114
I-I need details
to arrange all this.

525
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,812
We close soon,
but I could meet you

526
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:32,469
<i>outside of the office.
I live in Decatur.</i>

527
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,121
<i>Do you know Glenlake Park?</i>

528
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:37,007
- I can find it.
<i>- 4:30 in the north parking lot.</i>

529
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,292
<i>And from this moment on,</i>

530
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:39,704
<i>you must keep
everything confidential.</i>

531
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,812
<i>Don't talk to
anyone but the FDA.</i>

532
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,514
- I don't plan on it.
<i>- I'll see you shortly.</i>

533
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,468
McCRARY: <i>You realize</i>

534
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,670
these QuoVadis terms put you

535
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,305
in a very
uncomfortable position.

536
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,845
I realize it gets me the
money to make Lane's bail,

537
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:00,981
which makes the
sex tape go away.

538
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,011
You think she'll hold up
her end of the bargain?

539
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:05,569
What choice do I have?

540
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,872
The cash they're giving you
to be on the board of directors

541
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,625
is listed as an advance
against future stock earnings.

542
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,377
If the QuoVadis IPO goes south

543
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:16,630
or doesn't happen at all, you're
on the hook for a lot of money.

544
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,309
The QuoVadis
IPO is a no-brainer.

545
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,062
In five years, they'll be
the biggest device company

546
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:22,648
- in the country. Next.
- This agreement gives QuoVadis

547
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:25,639
unlimited rights to your image
or likeness across all forms

548
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:27,708
of marketing, in perpetuity.

549
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,976
TV ads, billboards, pamphlets.

550
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:31,423
You sure you want
your name linked

551
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,897
with QuoVadis until
the sun burns out?

552
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,494
Well, forget about
the sun burning out.

553
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:37,678
My image is gonna be in
the toilet by the weekend

554
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,036
if we don't do something.

555
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,571
Look, I just want to make sure

556
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,906
you did your due diligence
on this Gordon Page guy.

557
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,386
- How can you know...
- You know who else

558
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,394
is serving on the board
with me? Two senators,

559
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,674
the governor of North Carolina,
a former Secretary of Defense,

560
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:50,997
and an astronaut.

561
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:53,417
Guy went into space.

562
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:57,403
Do any of them know
jack about medical devices?

563
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,844
Dr. Okafor, your opinion

564
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:05,245
on the progress of the catheter?

565
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:07,130
Slow.

566
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,694
You know, impatience
radiates off you

567
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:11,268
like fog off a Maine coastline.

568
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:14,421
This is a simple procedure,
and we have a wedding to catch.

569
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:17,040
Oh. Well, the rumor
is you hate weddings.

570
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,608
I hate being late

571
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,644
more than I hate weddings.

572
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,510
I see a definite
family resemblance.

573
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,668
Yes.

574
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,454
Bart Jr. is very close
with his grandfather.

575
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:50,240
They spend a lot of time
together while I'm at work.

576
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:53,460
Mm. Well, Bart Jr., I just
got word from the OR,

577
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:56,563
and your grandfather's
surgery is going just fine.

578
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,460
He should be
out in half an hour,

579
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:01,246
so you can visit him then.
Does that sound good?

580
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,764
Thank you. Thank
you for updating us.

581
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,238
Of course. I'll let you
know when he's out.

582
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:07,234
- I love these suspenders.
- Thank you.

583
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,298
Guiding the wire into
appropriate implanting

584
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,617
position at the aortic annulus.

585
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:19,620
This allows the
delivery system to align

586
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:22,372
for maximum stability.

587
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,541
Notice how

588
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:29,195
oh so delicately I push...

589
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,797
Ah.

590
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,533
There.

591
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,652
You may deploy.

592
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,672
Now, slowly turn the deployment

593
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,453
- device counter...
- Done.

594
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,437
I'll close while
you put on a suit.

595
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,830
You do own a suit, right?

596
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:52,569
Wow, you look amazing.

597
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:55,689
So do you.

598
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:58,175
He looks good. We can head out.

599
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:02,079
Hey.

600
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,034
We don't have to
leave right away.

601
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:12,722
Fourth quarter.

602
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,758
Terrible game.

603
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,877
How you feeling?

604
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:20,347
Better, thank you.

605
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,200
Look, you mentioned before...

606
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:25,764
- About your mother.
- That she left you,

607
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,666
and that's not
how I remember it.

608
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,106
Do you want the truth?

609
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,260
Yes.

610
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,895
Okay.

611
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,998
You remember Jack Rogers?

612
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:41,601
Uh, our next-door
neighbor, yeah.

613
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,120
Your mother fell
in love with him.

614
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,262
- I don't believe it.
- Oh, you think I'd make it up?

615
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,693
I loved your mother.

616
00:28:54,717 --> 00:28:57,250
That was a low point for me.

617
00:28:57,285 --> 00:29:00,587
Rogers was married, as well.

618
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:02,255
So she left me,

619
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,085
sure that they
would be together,

620
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,872
but in the end, he
stayed with his wife.

621
00:29:06,896 --> 00:29:08,862
And that was the beginning

622
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:11,297
of a long, downward slide

623
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,800
for your mom.

624
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,618
For-for both of us.

625
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:18,388
Now, I am not blaming her,

626
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,053
'cause I was gone a lot,

627
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:25,428
and understandably,

628
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,932
she thought I didn't
appreciate her.

629
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:32,469
She was a good woman
and a great mother,

630
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:36,039
and I should have made
her my priority, and I didn't.

631
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:41,144
And you, as well.

632
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:48,501
I have to ask.

633
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,670
I have these nightmares.

634
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:54,841
I see her falling down
the stairs, you arguing,

635
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:57,443
and...

636
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,413
Did you hit her?

637
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:03,450
No. Absolutely not.

638
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:07,704
I mean, we fought
over your custody,

639
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,840
and it got ugly at times, but
as far as physical violence

640
00:30:10,876 --> 00:30:14,127
towards your mother
or any woman... never.

641
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:17,514
Conrad, I am flawed

642
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,434
in many ways,

643
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:22,985
but not like that.

644
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,422
I would sooner die.

645
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,185
I'm glad you came back.

646
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,723
You're my father,

647
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,860
and I love you.

648
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,906
Mark Truscott? FDA?

649
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,861
Gordon Page
would like to see you.

650
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:29,035
♪ ♪

651
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,322
Mark Truscott and I

652
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:57,147
went to college together.

653
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,060
He's not the only
person at the FDA

654
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:01,701
who has a stake in QuoVadis.

655
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:04,354
Take out your company phone.

656
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:10,043
Unlock it.

657
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,146
Now set it so it
won't lock again.

658
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,335
I trusted you.

659
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,890
What about the patients
who trusted QuoVadis?

660
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:26,792
- Our devices are safe.
- No, they're not.

661
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:30,147
I saw the data you gave
Chastain on the VNS.

662
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,565
It wasn't even tested.

663
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,417
You put it in a child.

664
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,985
A child whose mother

665
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:39,139
lost her other son to cancer.

666
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:40,973
Your lab is a sham.

667
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,627
Your factory, too, is
an empty warehouse.

668
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,945
You import
everything from China.

669
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,498
Top medical device companies

670
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,618
all use products from China.

671
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:53,820
And label it "made in the USA"?

672
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:55,255
Others did exactly that.

673
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,642
This is fraud. Outright fraud.

674
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,938
How in God's name did you
think you'd get away with this?

675
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:02,223
I'm not getting
away with anything.

676
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,347
They're safe,
safe as any others.

677
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,016
Your heart valve killed people.

678
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:09,185
You are not a team player.

679
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:17,343
I signed a
nondisclosure agreement.

680
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:21,565
I-I can't tell anyone
what I know.

681
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,701
If you just let me go, I...

682
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,569
I'll disappear.

683
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,389
I gave you the
golden opportunity

684
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,976
to get into the
future of health care.

685
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,445
To make a fortune.

686
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:41,268
Do you know what I hate
the most in this world?

687
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,256
Betrayal.

688
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,051
You made it.

689
00:33:59,554 --> 00:34:01,955
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

690
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:06,843
- I'm gonna say hi to Micah.
- Mm-hmm.

691
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:09,245
Where's your date?

692
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:13,065
Oh, well, I plan on meeting
the love of my life here.

693
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:14,962
It happens at
weddings, you know?

694
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,419
Mm-hmm.

695
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:20,968
Wow.

696
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,875
This looks awesome.

697
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:26,046
I am dying for these saris.
I want all of them now.

698
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:28,876
- It's all so romantic.
- Ugh, wake me
when the ceremony is over.

699
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,684
I take it you're eloping.

700
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,369
Why get married if you
don't want kids? And I don't.

701
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,866
At least, not for the
foreseeable future.

702
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,406
Yeah, me, neither.

703
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,375
You don't want kids?

704
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,955
- Since when?
- I already have a child.

705
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,929
My sister, Jessie.

706
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:48,701
Hey. You're not on
call. None of us are.

707
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:51,053
Guys, let's turn off our phones.

708
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,123
Ooh, that's a radical move.

709
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:56,710
One of life's greatest
events. Birth, death, marriage.

710
00:34:56,745 --> 00:34:58,585
And we should honor it.

711
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,433
Hey, guys. Any of
you seen Devon?

712
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:20,616
I need to speak to Priya.

713
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,986
Uh, you can't. It's bad luck.

714
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:26,289
Hey, Priya? Priya?

715
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,274
Devon?

716
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,460
What are you doing here?

717
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:35,681
Can we have a minute, please?

718
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:38,517
Mm.

719
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,194
You look great.

720
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,895
So do you.

721
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:56,102
The most beautiful I
have ever seen you.

722
00:35:56,138 --> 00:35:59,222
What's this about?

723
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:00,884
We've been together
for three years.

724
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,787
And four months.

725
00:36:02,811 --> 00:36:06,846
And I've loved
you all that time.

726
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:10,616
And, just as important,
I've respected you.

727
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:14,671
And that's why I have
to tell you the truth.

728
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,459
Recently, I've been
attracted to somebody else.

729
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:24,163
I didn't sleep with
her, but I did kiss her.

730
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:29,218
It's-it's over, and I'm
never gonna see her again.

731
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:36,009
I tried to put it behind me,

732
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:38,695
but I can't.

733
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,549
I can't marry you.

734
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:47,253
Not when I have feelings
for somebody else.

735
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,043
You deserve
somebody that loves you,

736
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,577
and only you.

737
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,332
It would be wrong,

738
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,618
for the both of us.

739
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:04,788
Your timing sucks.

740
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,174
I realize.

741
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,176
Everyone's here.

742
00:37:10,212 --> 00:37:12,878
Family came from India,
from Boston, from England.

743
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:16,198
I know, but do we go
through with it because of that?

744
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,602
Why did you wait
until now to tell me?

745
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:21,537
Because I thought
it was nothing.

746
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,373
Some last-minute panic attack.

747
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,642
But I realize now

748
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,811
that I have real
feelings for this person.

749
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,798
I'll do whatever
you tell me to do.

750
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,784
I'll talk to everyone. I'll talk
to both parents. It's on me.

751
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:40,573
You've humiliated me,

752
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:44,560
and you think this little
speech gets you off the hook?

753
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,313
No, no, I... no, I don't. I...

754
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:51,251
I'm-I'm ashamed of
myself for hurting you.

755
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:54,621
But lying or not telling
you would be worse.

756
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,293
Priya.

757
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:01,928
Please, I'm...

758
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:04,597
Who are you?

759
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,565
Not the man I loved.

760
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:09,652
Get out. I never
want to see you again.

761
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,470
Get out!

762
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:38,998
Hey, I told you
it would be fine.

763
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:41,134
I'm so relieved, Dad.

764
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:43,285
We just can't do it without you.

765
00:38:45,307 --> 00:38:48,941
Well, looks like you're gonna
be stuck with me for a while yet.

766
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:50,521
Hey, honey, you
want to kiss Grandpa?

767
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:52,544
We're gonna let him
rest, okay? Yeah?

768
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,313
Hey, amigo. Ho, ho!

769
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,151
It's gonna be a whole new
phase of life for you, Dad.

770
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:03,706
Thank you, darling,
for being here for me.

771
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,075
I feel so sorry
for all the people

772
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:10,897
who are in the
hospital all alone.

773
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,999
That'll never be you.

774
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,506
Good night.

775
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:40,343
Oh, my God. Mr. Winthrop!

776
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:55,352
He has a rigid abdomen
with tenderness,

777
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:57,961
guarding and rebound.

778
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,962
Stand back.

779
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,765
Free air. It's a
bowel perforation.

780
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,083
He needs emergency surgery.

781
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,596
Wh-Who's on call for
emergency gen surg?

782
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,736
Dr. Bell.

783
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:09,405
