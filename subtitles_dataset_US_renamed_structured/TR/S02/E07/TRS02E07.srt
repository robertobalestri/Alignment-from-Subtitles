00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:02,283
<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:03,963
Medical devices
gave me my life back.

3
00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:06,739
Total hip replacement. It
made me a true believer.

4
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:09,023
Have you arranged for
someone to teach you Bhangra?

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,553
<i>You studying up to
do a Bollywood dance?</i>

6
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,245
My fiancée insists,
but I've two left feet.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,641
<i>Well, maybe I can
help. I was a dancer.</i>

8
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:17,800
I've been thinking about
creating my own medical device.

9
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:19,479
Watching what you
do gave me the idea.

10
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:21,863
- What am I doing here?
- Oh, I'm assigning you to Ortho.

11
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,339
- Okafor belongs to me.
- I belong to no one.

12
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,208
My sister. She OD'd on Oxy.

13
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:27,225
I'm not just doing
this for me anymore,

14
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,210
I'm staying clean
for both of us.

15
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:29,990
I'm not worried.
Do I look worried?

16
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:32,094
Perhaps you should
let go of kitty's leash.

17
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,741
Camping for a bachelor
party weekend? Really?

18
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,705
What I want to know is
who sleeps in the middle?

19
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,095
Was this Devon's idea?

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,459
He was fine with a couple
beers at Waylon's. But Irving...

21
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,443
Is making up for getting
kicked out of Boy Scouts.

22
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,564
Hey, the nurses are
planning a girls' night tonight.

23
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:55,537
We're thinking bowling.

24
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:56,871
Oh, I do not like sports

25
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:58,184
where I have to wear
other people's shoes.

26
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,354
Okay, fine. Karaoke? Come on.

27
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:02,755
Jessica's in Savannah
for the weekend.

28
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:04,296
I have zero obligations.

29
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,076
This is the first
time I've been free

30
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,300
since she got out of rehab.

31
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,069
It's Conrad. Hey, what's up?

32
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:15,540
You're kidding me.

33
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,136
Okay, yeah. I'll be right there.

34
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,644
What's going on?

35
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,095
Jess is not in Savannah.

36
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:39,480
I'm burning up.
What's wrong with me?

37
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,951
Jess... You okay?

38
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:45,904
I'm fine. I told
Conrad not to call you,

39
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,500
but clearly, he can't
keep a promise.

40
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,991
I made no promise and,
Jess, she needed to know.

41
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,577
Since when does
Chastain do drug trials?

42
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,947
Since Bell discovered
they're a cash cow, I imagine.

43
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,127
- What kind of trial is this?
- It's for cancer.

44
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,117
Healthy people volunteered.

45
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,020
Half of us got a cancer
drug, half of us got a placebo.

46
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,295
Do we know who got the placebo?

47
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,656
No. It's a double-blind.

48
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,254
Jessie's fine right
now, but John isn't.

49
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:08,744
Fever and vomiting.

50
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:10,245
Why didn't you just tell me?

51
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:12,041
Because I knew
you would lecture me.

52
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,815
This is my fault.

53
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,845
I told Jess it'd be a good
way to make some money.

54
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,670
I've done them before. I've
never had a reaction like this.

55
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:24,376
Excuse me. Who authorized this?

56
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,655
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

57
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,963
What... what are you doing here?

58
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:31,599
I'm a doctor. She's an NP.

59
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:33,768
And John here is in
significant distress.

60
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:36,154
He's having a
normal reaction for

61
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,168
a Phase 1
first-in-human clinical trial.

62
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,869
Reactions are what
we're here to document.

63
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,621
Now, I'm gonna
have to ask you to go.

64
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,223
Oh, you don't have
to ask. Jess, come on.

65
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,991
Um. No, I'm not
gonna leave John.

66
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:46,343
Uh, you will lose
your fee if you quit.

67
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,983
I want to go.

68
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:49,735
I don't care about the money.

69
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,038
- What?
- Call rapid response!

70
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,040
We need to get
him to the ER now!

71
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,927
♪ ♪

72
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,475
John Losurdo. 30 years old.

73
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,438
Fever, vomiting, a
syncopal episode.

74
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,324
A suspected reaction to
an immunotherapy trial drug.

75
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:19,242
- We do drug trials now?
- Apparently so.

76
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,901
Uh, BP's 90/55. Hang
one liter of normal saline

77
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,580
and give him four Ondansetron
to help with the vomiting.

78
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,772
One, two, three.

79
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,241
- Is John gonna be okay?
- I hope so; we don't know enough

80
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,920
about the drug, or his
health when he took it.

81
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,178
- How do you know him, Jess?
- Rehab.

82
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,529
He's such a great guy.

83
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:35,624
Every time I wanted to bail,

84
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,999
he convinced me to stay.

85
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:40,185
I'm supposed to have a
consult with Mina right now,

86
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,348
but I want to stay
here with you.

87
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:42,420
No. It's fine. Go.

88
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,017
- Are you sure?
- We've got this.

89
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,557
Go. Steth.

90
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,620
Let's get a second line
and some blood work.

91
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,911
<i>Babe, when you check the time,</i>

92
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:54,132
this tiny little camera...
It scans your retina,

93
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,579
and it sends your
vitals to me like that.

94
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,685
That is so cool.

95
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,249
I can't believe
you designed that.

96
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,466
Yeah.

97
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,907
If my dad had been wearing this,

98
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,287
I could have caught his heart
attack before it happened.

99
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:08,480
Now, wait, there is just
one more thing that I need.

100
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,215
Priya Nair, would you
do me the honor of being

101
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,206
my first trial participant?

102
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,458
My beta tester?

103
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,810
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

104
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:29,301
Um. First, there is
actually something

105
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,119
I need to talk to you about.

106
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:33,499
All right. Listen, If this is
about who's sitting where,

107
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,567
honestly, whatever you want...

108
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:37,059
No, nothing about the wedding.

109
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:40,845
Um, Devon, I've
been offered a spot

110
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,482
on an investigative
journalism team.

111
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,735
W... That's amazing.
Babe, I'm so proud of you.

112
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,855
It's at the<i> San
Francisco Chronicle.</i>

113
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,909
-If I take it, I have
to move there. Soon.

114
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:55,939
When? Because we're
getting married in two weeks.

115
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,107
How would that even happen?

116
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,624
A lot of couples
live in different cities.

117
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,064
We could make it work.

118
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,669
Nothing is decided yet. Let's
talk more when you get back

119
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,522
from your bachelor
weekend, okay?

120
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,574
I'm late.

121
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,062
You need to stop the trial now.

122
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:32,041
Are all your nurses
this dramatic, Dr. Bell?

123
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,699
Oh, I hear that one
of your participants

124
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,985
is in our ER with
life-threatening symptoms.

125
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,803
One of our participants got sick

126
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,550
to his stomach and
a bit dehydrated.

127
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,568
- Nothing life-threatening
about it.
- Oh, please.

128
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,526
Two more are
deteriorating as we speak.

129
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,695
Cancer is a ferocious enemy.

130
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,415
We fight it with strong drugs.

131
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,417
Please get your
staff to back down,

132
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,568
or Chastain won't see a dime.

133
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,048
Oh, and what's a
lawsuit gonna cost

134
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:57,388
if one of these patients dies?

135
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,058
Your trial can continue,

136
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,821
but I expect you to
notify me right away

137
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,656
if any of your
participants have reactions

138
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,963
outside the range of normal.

139
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,386
One of them's my sister.

140
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,445
Perfect vacation:
mountain, desert or sea?

141
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,841
Uh, desert.

142
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:23,376
When you're done
with this charade,

143
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,583
I need to talk with you.

144
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,369
Okafor, you are my ex-resident.

145
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,371
I'm looking for
my next resident.

146
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,889
And as you can see, it's
an embarrassment of riches.

147
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,093
Or just embarrassing.

148
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,848
Next!

149
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,213
Here.

150
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,098
What are you doing here?

151
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,362
I need a consult from you
and Conrad on a patient.

152
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,136
His name is Ernest LeVasseur.

153
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,454
Ernie?

154
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,706
Oh, woman, you
should've led with that.

155
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,526
He owns the Grill and Gumbo
and makes the best ribs in Atlanta.

156
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:53,361
No, not anymore, he doesn't.

157
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,230
Why? What's wrong with him?

158
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:57,899
The better question
is "What isn't?"

159
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:03,088
Mr. and Mrs. LeVasseur?

160
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,490
This is the brilliant
Dr. Hawkins.

161
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,555
He's one of our top
diagnosticians here at Chastain.

162
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:10,945
Oh, and this is Dr. Austin.

163
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:17,418
Cardiothoracic. I'm just
a smidge above average.

164
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,820
Ernie, it is an honor
to meet you, brother.

165
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,375
I am a huge fan of your dry rub.

166
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,564
Oh, he's nearly blind, and
his hearing's almost gone.

167
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,467
The doctor loves
your dry rub, Ernie.

168
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:34,630
- I had an egg with some bacon.
- Honey, they don't care

169
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,455
what you had for breakfast.
He talks nonsense like this

170
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,318
all the time now. My
brother-in-law says

171
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:40,775
it's early onset dementia.

172
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:42,255
Neurology doesn't think so.

173
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,011
When did he lose his vision?

174
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,415
About six months ago,
and then hearing went next.

175
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,597
Like, every other day,
another part of him was gone.

176
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:52,287
Mind if I have a look?

177
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:53,688
Yeah, sure.

178
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,708
First he developed
hypothyroidism,

179
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,592
and then reflux esophagitis.

180
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:03,465
His echocardiogram shows
heart failure due to cardiomyopathy.

181
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,853
Some kind of rash
around his neck,

182
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,616
warm to the touch.

183
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,473
Let's get another
thyroid and renal panel,

184
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:15,443
and let's add on an RPR,
folate and B12. Medical history?

185
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:18,291
Left hip replacement in 2012.

186
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,627
Kidney stones last
year, but that's about it.

187
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:22,550
Any complaints of pain?

188
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,037
No, he doesn't complain
about anything. He never has.

189
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:30,592
Ernie's always been the
happiest, most optimistic...

190
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,230
You know, it's like
he's here, but he's not.

191
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,167
There's almost
nothing left of him.

192
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,504
We understand how
difficult this must be.

193
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,641
Oh, I doubt it. I get up
at 6:00 every morning

194
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:49,261
and I change his diaper and then

195
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,223
I shower him, and after
he's fed and dressed,

196
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:53,075
I do it all over
again with the kids.

197
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,433
And after they're fed
and they're dressed

198
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,202
and I send them off to school...

199
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,389
Oh, my God.

200
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,526
I can't do it anymore.

201
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,712
Janine?

202
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,530
Darling?

203
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:13,167
W-Where are you?

204
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:15,570
I'm right here!

205
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:19,190
At least he still
remembers my name.

206
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,176
Sometimes, I...

207
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,795
I really wish that he didn't.

208
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,310
No one takes care
of the caretaker.

209
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,230
We're going to take
care of him here.

210
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:32,887
You go home, rest.

211
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:35,173
I will call you as soon
as we know more.

212
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,251
She needs help.
She's close to breaking.

213
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:55,327
I've notified social services.
They're scheduling a home visit.

214
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,763
A year ago, Ernest
was the life of the party.

215
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,393
What do you think
is wrong with him?

216
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,434
I think he's being poisoned.

217
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,179
I... made...

218
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,614
T-shirts.

219
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,933
I'm not wearing that, bud.

220
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:20,780
Campsite's booked,
rafts are rented.

221
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:22,831
Firing up the minivan
at 6:00 p.m. sharp.

222
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,639
Snack situation's on point.

223
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:27,775
I got ten flavors of chips,
including Nacho Mamma's Nachos.

224
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,194
Don't be late. I already told
Conrad we have a hard out.

225
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,180
Hey, guys.

226
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,332
- How's the dance coming along?
- Oh, uh, we're crushing it.

227
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,613
You still want to practice
when you get back?

228
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,148
Ooh!

229
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,473
Please, never do that again.

230
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,458
Wait, is that
what I think it is?

231
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,461
Beta version 1.0.

232
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:49,947
How's the retina scan function?
That's what makes it so unique.

233
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,949
Yeah. So far, so good.

234
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,529
Sends the data
directly to the...

235
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,836
Smartphone app. I remember.

236
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,617
Yeah.

237
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,384
Some of my friends
in Silicon Valley

238
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,886
have been
troubleshooting it for weeks

239
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,710
and it seems to be working well.

240
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,862
Well, you can't
test it on yourself.

241
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,080
You need a beta.

242
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,485
I'll drop an obvious
hint one more time.

243
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,655
You need a beta.

244
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,624
You?

245
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:19,010
- Really?
- Yeah. Why not?

246
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,464
Okay, so, um...

247
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,849
It tests for

248
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,646
- your heart rhythm...
- Uh-huh.

249
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,306
Uh, blood pressure and, um,

250
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,085
your pulse.

251
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,154
Oh, and it's also gonna
tell me I'm late for surgery.

252
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:39,180
I got to go. Keep an
eye on me, Pravesh.

253
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,855
- How you feeling, John?
- Not great.

254
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,990
His back is killing him.

255
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,953
Well, it'll take time
to metabolize the drug

256
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,511
they gave you, but we
can up your pain meds,

257
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,530
manage the symptoms
in the meantime.

258
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,450
Is that your family?

259
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,179
Yeah.

260
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:03,905
Ingrid, light of my life.

261
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,107
My wife, Sarah.

262
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,971
She keeps giving me
chances, you know?

263
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,779
They live in South Carolina.

264
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,733
This last stint in rehab was
the first I did on my own...

265
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,019
'cause I want to get better,

266
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:21,038
for me and for them.

267
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,702
This drug trial was just a way

268
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:24,587
to come home with
some cash in my pocket.

269
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,726
Help pay the bills,

270
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,095
Ingrid's music lessons.

271
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,426
Love her to death, but
she cannot play her recorder

272
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,211
so well.

273
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,035
At all, really.

274
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,653
Jess, you okay?

275
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,456
Yeah, yeah, I think it's just a
stress headache or something.

276
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,836
Hey, where was that? Right here?

277
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,160
- Yeah.
- All right.

278
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,328
Jess?

279
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,144
Jessie?

280
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:51,731
Devon! Irving!

281
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:54,855
Jessie didn't get the placebo.
Come on, let's get her on a bed.

282
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,736
We're gonna take
care of you, Jess.

283
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,727
Nic, what's
happening? I'm scared.

284
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:02,947
- I know, but I'm here.
- Oxygen sats are dropping.

285
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,911
- John? Hey, John!
- He can't breathe.

286
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:08,269
We need to intubate him. Hurry.

287
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,822
Page Conrad to the east wing.

288
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,937
Tell him to check
the other trial patients.

289
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,746
Just like that.

290
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,619
Get them to the ICU.

291
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:27,589
Again? I-I told Dr. Bell...

292
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:29,868
Two of your trial patients are
in the ICU with complications.

293
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,760
It cannot be from of our drug.
This dose was scaled back

294
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,329
500 fold for what was
proven safe in monkeys.

295
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,765
Monkeys?

296
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:40,200
Really?

297
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,869
Hey. Hey, hold up.

298
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,655
What do you think you're doing?

299
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,401
Clearing the room. Get these two

300
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,453
to the ER for observation.

301
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:50,517
- I am beginning
to lose my patience.
- And mine's long gone.

302
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:54,782
Trust me, you don't want
to push me any further.

303
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:56,701
I'm calling Bell.

304
00:13:56,736 --> 00:14:00,071
I already did.

305
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,790
Give me an update.

306
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:05,410
Adele and Mauricio

307
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,795
have a fever, pain and vomiting.

308
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,592
Jessie is having
trouble breathing,

309
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,417
so we have her on oxygen,
and John is on a vent,

310
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,336
with multisystem organ failure.

311
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,642
I don't have to tell
you your trial is over,

312
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:22,209
and Chastain is not responsible

313
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:23,906
if anyone dies from
whatever the hell

314
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,441
- you gave them.
- I am telling you,

315
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,931
it is sepsis from an infection

316
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,482
they caught here.

317
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,663
The drug vials were
prepared by your company.

318
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:32,615
- If there's any
contamination...
- Hey, the blame game can wait.

319
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,555
We need information
on this drug.

320
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,452
Yeah, well, that's not happening
because it's not the drug.

321
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,887
Look, you don't know
that. I want every bit of data

322
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,662
you have in my hands
in the next ten minutes.

323
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:42,063
I'm not asking.

324
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,839
It's really deep in there.

325
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:53,185
Well, it's only a
quadruple bypass,

326
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:55,521
but I'm sure your inability

327
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:57,061
to get deep enough will be

328
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,080
just fine with the family

329
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,743
- after their loved one has...
- Wait, wait.

330
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,934
I think I got it.

331
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,196
Yup.

332
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,139
Sam's dead, and so are you.

333
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,391
Allow me to demonstrate.

334
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,776
Oh.

335
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,739
I'm starting to get the
feeling you miss me,

336
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:16,264
but your position's
almost filled.

337
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,044
Ernest's tests are in.

338
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:20,735
The levels of cobalt in his
blood are 200 times normal.

339
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:27,090
He has metallosis.

340
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,996
So you were right.

341
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,497
He is being poisoned.

342
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,950
But from what?

343
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:37,396
<i>Here's the culprit...</i>

344
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,314
His metal-on-metal
hip replacement.

345
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,422
When the metal ball and metal
cup slide against each other,

346
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,342
tiny particles can flake off
and enter the bloodstream,

347
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,662
sending cobalt and
chromium to every major organ.

348
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,298
And causing muscle
and tissue atrophy,

349
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,451
acetabular and
femoral osteolysis,

350
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,414
- and pseudotumors.
- I don't get it.

351
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:58,072
Why would anyone sell a hip
implant that could leak poison?

352
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,290
Imagine the lawsuits.

353
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,743
Oh, pennies to their profits.

354
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:03,839
The question is, how
does something this flawed

355
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,496
get FDA approval to begin with?

356
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,616
The 510 process. This
lets companies fast-track

357
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:12,420
a device, if a device is
similar to an existing device.

358
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:14,717
Which helps lifesaving
devices get on the market fast.

359
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:18,437
Even if that existing device
was recalled for defects.

360
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:19,705
Surely there are
protections in place

361
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,306
that stop people
from taking advantage.

362
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,359
Not when medical device
executives sit on the board

363
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,111
of the FDA.

364
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:26,895
The fox is guarding
the henhouse.

365
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,854
Well, let's focus
on what we can fix.

366
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,350
Mr. LeVasseur is going to need
a left ceramic on polyethylene

367
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,220
hip prosthesis to
get the metal poison

368
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,643
out of his system.

369
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,006
Does QuoVadis
carry one of those?

370
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,797
We do. I'll have it couriered.

371
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,577
Well, the good news is

372
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,179
when leaking metal
hips are replaced,

373
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,336
most patients
make a full recovery.

374
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,049
I don't think he'll ever
regain his eyesight.

375
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:50,742
No, but surgery will certainly
help all of his other problems.

376
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,409
If it doesn't kill him.

377
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,927
<i>Atlanta was never
Priya's first choice,</i>

378
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,467
but I'm finally feeling settled,

379
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:02,086
like my life is on track.

380
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,689
So move, or deal
with living apart.

381
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,351
You're not so great
at this, are you?

382
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,742
I'm exceptional at it, actually.

383
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,978
I made you face the
stark reality of your choice.

384
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,681
If you want hand-holding,
go elsewhere.

385
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:16,400
Well, Julian's got
a healthy pulse.

386
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,518
Her vitals are impressive.

387
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,522
You are taking stalking
to a whole new level.

388
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,419
I'm just testing
my device, Mina.

389
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:26,338
Hm. Keep telling yourself that.

390
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:28,123
- Is that our new hip?
- It is.

391
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,676
Safe and tested... Okay.

392
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,678
Is she always so...

393
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:35,936
Yeah, yeah. She's, uh,
she's very consistent.

394
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,906
So, how are my numbers?

395
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,175
Beautiful.

396
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,355
I mean, they're, you know...

397
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:44,473
They're-they're
good. They're great.

398
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,797
Your device is working.

399
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,567
So far, it is. But less coffee,

400
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:53,053
more water. You're
a little dehydrated.

401
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,089
So a fourth latte
is overdoing it?

402
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,285
Fourth?

403
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,725
Are you being serious?

404
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,778
Do not even judge. I saw
you in the residents' lounge,

405
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,731
chugging what I'm pretty
sure was a can of grape soda.

406
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,950
Okay, don't knock
it until you try it.

407
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,703
Oh, I tried it, when I was six.

408
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:13,457
All right, you know what?
The residents' lounge

409
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,176
is for residents,
not device reps, so...

410
00:18:17,413 --> 00:18:19,763
Oh, so that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

411
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,750
Yeah, it's gonna
be just like that.

412
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,702
Okay.

413
00:18:26,422 --> 00:18:30,007
I saw this really cute
apartment in Inman Park.

414
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,994
Landlord wanted a
cash deposit, so...

415
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,910
I'm too old to
live with my sister.

416
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:40,284
Way too old.

417
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:45,172
I shouldn't have lied to you
about Savannah. I'm sorry.

418
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,091
I just...

419
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,610
I wanted to show you I could
do something on my own.

420
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:52,179
I thought maybe
things could go back

421
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,781
to the way they were when...

422
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,200
- when we were close.
- Hey.

423
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,804
We're close now.

424
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,124
We're, like, too close.
You're like a barnacle.

425
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,309
Stop. It hurts.

426
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:11,164
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

427
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:14,101
What's going on?

428
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,686
We have information on the drug.

429
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,439
It's an agonist for
the CD28 receptor.

430
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:21,726
So the drug targets the
immune system to fight cancer.

431
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:25,780
Kisic claims the participants
all have a massive infection.

432
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:27,732
Septic shock fits the symptoms.

433
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,166
I don't think it's septic shock.

434
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,879
I think it's a systemic
inflammatory response

435
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,519
from a cytokine storm.

436
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,633
There's no way to know for
sure. There's no quick test

437
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:36,540
for a cytokine storm.

438
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,153
They both have the
same presentation,

439
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,356
but cytokine is caused
by an immunotherapy drug.

440
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,513
If there is any hope

441
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,193
of stopping this
attack on their organs,

442
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:47,200
we need to at least
start John and Jessie

443
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,136
on high dose steroids now.

444
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:52,590
But if it is a
massive infection,

445
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,436
high dose steroids
could kill them.

446
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,904
We can't wait, we
have to act now.

447
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,689
My mom died from
a bad judgment call.

448
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:58,896
We need to be certain.

449
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,432
You know that's not possible.

450
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:09,123
My gut tells me this is right.

451
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:17,998
Okay.

452
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,617
So let's start steroid treatment

453
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,920
on John and Jessie,

454
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,755
with your permission.

455
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,175
And the others, we wait
until we know for sure

456
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,495
that you've made the right
call, and hope like hell it is.

457
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,138
Ernest can't make this decision.

458
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,642
You are his medical proxy.

459
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,278
Without the surgery,
how long does he have?

460
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,247
Another year, maybe, but
he will continue to deteriorate.

461
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,544
But the surgery
could kill him today?

462
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:55,035
Yes, but if he survives, he
can finally be himself again.

463
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,590
Janine?

464
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,800
I'm Korean.

465
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,230
He learned to speak Korean

466
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:14,788
so we could speak it together.

467
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:18,642
Ernest has always
been so romantic.

468
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,237
Don't cry.

469
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:33,290
Don't.

470
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:35,542
It's okay.

471
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,534
I said I couldn't stand to
take care of him anymore,

472
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,988
and now I can't
bear to lose him.

473
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,126
Will you both be in the surgery?

474
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:54,128
Oh, Dr. Okafor

475
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:57,681
will be assisting Dr. Voss,
who is an exceptional...

476
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:00,037
But-but what if something
happens with his weak heart?

477
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,403
I'll sign the consent form...

478
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:08,192
if you'll both be in
the room with him.

479
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,348
- Nic, I'm drowning.
- Your...

480
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:16,378
your lungs aren't
getting enough oxygen.

481
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,246
We're bringing in a
ventilator to help you breathe.

482
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,230
- Okay?
- I'll take it from here, Nic.

483
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:23,023
The steroids aren't working.

484
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:25,325
- What if it is sepsis?
- Steroids take time.

485
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:28,295
But, Nic, you know
there are no guarantees.

486
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,080
God, why did she do this?

487
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,232
We can't think
about that right now.

488
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,533
Nic.

489
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:38,055
If you have something
you need to say to Jessie...

490
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,892
now would be a good time.

491
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,448
Jessie, I need you
to be strong, okay?

492
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,737
I need you to fight for me.

493
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,450
All right? I'm
gonna be right here

494
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,594
- the whole time.
- Ready to intubate.

495
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:01,745
I love you, okay?

496
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,332
I'm right here.

497
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,207
Patient Ernest LeVasseur

498
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,718
in for a left hip revision.

499
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:12,039
One ceramic-on-polyethylene
hip device.

500
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,457
Left. Correct.

501
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,459
Time-out complete.

502
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,427
Surgical field prepped.

503
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:18,762
It's showtime, party people.

504
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,614
And don't worry, Dr. Voss.

505
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,718
I'm just here monitoring
Monsieur LeVasseur's poor heart.

506
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:27,138
I promised your resident
that I would be quiet.

507
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,973
It will be hard for him.

508
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,274
Let's relish it, ladies.

509
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,575
10 blade.

510
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:41,368
Dr. Okafor, retract the
subcutaneous tissue.

511
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:43,404
Retractors.

512
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,663
Oh, crap.

513
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,649
The metal particles have
caused the soft tissue

514
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,585
around the joint to harden.

515
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:01,671
When I cut into
it, it liquefies.

516
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,485
The necrotic tissue's completely

517
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,142
encompassing the hip joint.

518
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,760
Gross.

519
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:08,445
I-I've never seen...

520
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,992
anything like it.

521
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:12,298
Suction.

522
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,080
If you're going to
hurl, best to not do it

523
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,704
in a sterile environment.

524
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:20,324
I'll be right back.

525
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:28,365
What were you chopping?

526
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,699
Carrots.

527
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,752
They kind of
looked like my pinky.

528
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,556
Irving!

529
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,937
Somebody dying over here?

530
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:40,105
I only cut my pinky.

531
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:41,273
Wait, am I dying?

532
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:42,529
Take over for me.

533
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,014
Julian's having a heart attack.

534
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,718
You're not dying.

535
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:52,823
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

536
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,974
I was just feeling faint.

537
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,444
The surgery... It
got kind of ugly.

538
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:59,730
Tachycardia.

539
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,831
Not a heart attack.

540
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,795
Safe to say

541
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:05,452
that my device overreacted.

542
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:07,182
Big-time.

543
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,622
It'll get there.

544
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,207
Thank you for checking on me.

545
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,159
Of course.

546
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,012
You should have
seen that hip implant.

547
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,299
That poor guy, his
whole life is ruined.

548
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:22,469
And who knows if it's
the same one that's in me?

549
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:25,105
You have to call your
ortho and find out.

550
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:28,792
I will.

551
00:25:31,514 --> 00:25:33,063
Thank you, Devon.

552
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,065
Jessie's stable on the
vent and vasopressors.

553
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:54,367
That's...

554
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:56,086
That's good news.

555
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,575
Go to the lounge. Lie down.

556
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:05,262
I'll come get you if
anything changes.

557
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:12,252
Thank you.

558
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,392
She's gonna get better.

559
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:21,540
And I'm a thousand
percent not going river rafting

560
00:26:21,564 --> 00:26:23,291
with Devon and Irving,
which means I'm here

561
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,475
and I'm here with you
and I'm here with Jessie.

562
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,465
I always thought, if we
ended up here, it would be

563
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:34,158
because of an
overdose, but a drug trial?

564
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:37,611
I can't even imagine how
difficult this must be for you.

565
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:44,001
He's in V tach.

566
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,469
Get a crash cart in here!

567
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,104
His pulse is thready.

568
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,606
I need one of epi
and an amp of bicarb.

569
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:50,891
Lost his pulse.

570
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:52,443
Starting compressions.

571
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:04,188
John got the steroids too late.

572
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,801
He was 30 years old.

573
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,207
His poor wife and little girl.

574
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:11,123
What if we didn't give
Jess the steroids on time?

575
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:13,428
She could be next.

576
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,820
Okay. I'll call you back.

577
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:16,983
This is unbelievable.

578
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,319
This is a disaster.

579
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,349
You can expect an
independent investigation.

580
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,134
- I am gonna have you...
- Of Chastain.

581
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:25,959
The wing you leased us
is clearly not up to code.

582
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,323
I would think hard before you
threaten us with malpractice.

583
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:31,276
A man is dead. A lawsuit is
the least of your problems.

584
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,383
You could be facing
manslaughter charges.

585
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:37,454
Me? He misdiagnosed
and didn't treat

586
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,340
for what they
actually have: sepsis.

587
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:41,858
We need to stop steroids

588
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,554
and start an aggressive
course of antibiotics.

589
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,040
Antibiotics alone
will kill them.

590
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,574
What we need to
do is up the steroids.

591
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,565
And when they
die, that's on you.

592
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,016
Just... give us a minute.

593
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:53,069
No, no, no. Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

594
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,683
I need to be privy to
any and all conversations.

595
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:57,324
Yeah. In your mind.

596
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,659
This is my hospital.

597
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:01,545
Back off.

598
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,355
So why, exactly, are you
so sure it's a cytokine storm?

599
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,689
Well, we've seen no improvements

600
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,269
in patients on
antibiotics alone.

601
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,260
We have seen some in Jessie

602
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,489
since we gave her the steroids.

603
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:18,745
And John was the first one

604
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,492
to get the drug, so
the cytokine storm

605
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:22,744
had already done
irreversible harm to his organs.

606
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,729
It wasn't that the steroids
were the wrong call.

607
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:27,337
It's that we were
too late for John.

608
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,684
- But maybe not for the others.
- And the longer we wait...

609
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,886
Yeah, the less likely
the steroids will work.

610
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,276
Hawkins, just try talking to me

611
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,788
like I've been
practicing medicine

612
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,273
for almost as long
as you've been alive.

613
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,347
It'll prove useful
in these situations.

614
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,249
All right.

615
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,051
Stay the course.

616
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,254
Up the steroids on Jessie.

617
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,823
Start steroids on the other two.

618
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,409
I'll handle Kisic.

619
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,686
- You okay?
- Yes.

620
00:28:59,722 --> 00:29:01,416
My apologies. That's
never happened before.

621
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,868
Hey, things are a little
shaky over here, people.

622
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:04,919
This is taking way
too long for his heart.

623
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,571
The structural
damage is extensive.

624
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:08,423
Removing the old
acetabular component

625
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:11,715
took out some of the bone
and created pelvic discontinuity.

626
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,795
I'm not sure we're gonna be
able to complete the surgery.

627
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,764
So you're just going
to close him up?

628
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,815
We'll put in a
temporary spacer, close,

629
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,450
then open him up
again once we get

630
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:20,714
the proper revision components.

631
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:24,556
I did some research
before the surgery,

632
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,163
and I brought a triflange
cup as backup, just in case.

633
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:30,500
Yeah, that works.

634
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,003
It's not something we
typically stock, but... good call.

635
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,918
Glad you made
it back to join us.

636
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,510
Oh! Bloody hell.
The deteriorated hip

637
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:42,679
caused me to hit the
exterior iliac artery.

638
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,592
- Pressure's dropping fast.
- We need to repair the artery.

639
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,765
Austin, scrub in.

640
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,579
Not enough time.
Okafor is sterile.

641
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:48,997
I need you, not a
third-year resident.

642
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,971
I've converted a right ventricle

643
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:54,525
to the center ventricle in a
heart the size of a walnut.

644
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,578
Performed an emergency
tracheotomy in 30 seconds flat.

645
00:29:57,613 --> 00:29:58,806
I'm not just any third-year.

646
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,830
What she said.

647
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,616
Suction.

648
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:04,345
Pressure's still dropping.

649
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,253
- We're losing him.
- Clamp.

650
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:08,922
There's too much damage.
It's too risky even to bypass it.

651
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:11,324
When I took over
and made the incision,

652
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,625
you put his life in my hands.

653
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,678
I can do it. I'll use the patch.

654
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,353
What she said.

655
00:30:19,969 --> 00:30:22,302
Adele and Mauricio are
improving on the steroids.

656
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:23,553
We were right.

657
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:27,107
The trial drug caused
the cytokine storm.

658
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:29,326
Yeah, but Jessie isn't
getting much better.

659
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,644
She's breathing on her own,

660
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:32,056
but her kidneys
are getting worse.

661
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:35,460
She's in acute kidney failure.

662
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:37,345
We're gonna have
to put her on dialysis

663
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,769
- until her kidneys recover.
- Yeah, that's if they recover.

664
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,746
Hey.

665
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:53,550
Hey. Oh, my God, I
was so worried about you.

666
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,920
How's everybody else?

667
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,792
Mauricio and Adele
are doing great.

668
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,879
And John?

669
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:09,766
I'm so sorry, Jess.

670
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:10,934
Oh, no.

671
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,053
John didn't make it.

672
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:15,104
No, don't tell me that.

673
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,168
- No.
- I'm sorry.

674
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:19,943
No, no.

675
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:35,508
Is, uh... is this a bad time?

676
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:36,727
No.

677
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,858
I talked to my
orthopedic surgeon.

678
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:42,132
My hip isn't metal-on-metal.

679
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,767
It's safe.

680
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:46,364
It's tested. All good.

681
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:48,065
Well, that must
be a huge relief.

682
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:50,590
Yeah, but I just looked
up how many people

683
00:31:50,643 --> 00:31:52,275
have metal-on-metal hips.

684
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,910
It's well over a million.

685
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,445
This is my industry.

686
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,259
How do I not know
this is going on?

687
00:31:57,283 --> 00:32:00,316
It's impossible to know
everything we should know.

688
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:03,069
All we can do is
the best we can.

689
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,632
About earlier...

690
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:17,901
There are no excuses
for what I did, so I...

691
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,921
I pulled you into a dark room
and I threw my arms around you.

692
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:24,390
I'd say that we share the blame.

693
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:27,411
As far as I'm concerned,

694
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,096
what happened never happened.

695
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,648
Okay?

696
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,013
Could have been worse.

697
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:51,368
Not for John.

698
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:54,203
Every medicine,
surgical procedure

699
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,601
or intervention ever
prescribed or performed

700
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:58,608
is because of a clinical trial.

701
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,472
Without them, medicine
cannot advance.

702
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:02,440
Without them...

703
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,097
we'd still have polio.

704
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:05,709
But does everyone
who volunteers...

705
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,301
Do they understand the risk?

706
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,987
- They signed the forms.
- Because they're desperate.

707
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,490
They needed the money.

708
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:17,177
A student trying to
pay for his tuition,

709
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:20,163
underpaid schoolteacher,

710
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,866
recovering addict...

711
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,040
dad trying to provide
for his little girl.

712
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,325
And now...

713
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:34,761
that child has no father.

714
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:47,357
Mrs. Losurdo.

715
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,092
- Can I see John now? Is he okay?
- Would you like to sit down?

716
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,228
No, I... I-I want to
see John. How is he?

717
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,647
Well, when we spoke
earlier, on the phone,

718
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:58,017
John was already
experiencing serious side effects.

719
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,999
And during the course
of the day, he worsened,

720
00:34:01,023 --> 00:34:04,491
and... although we
did everything we could,

721
00:34:04,526 --> 00:34:06,526
we were unable to save him.

722
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:10,175
And he died a little while ago.

723
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,675
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

724
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,517
He was fine. When you
called me, he was fine.

725
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,170
No, he was already in distress.

726
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:21,741
Please, have a
seat. Have a seat.

727
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:26,395
- I'm sorry.
- Mom, is Dad okay?

728
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,821
Mom?

729
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,222
You know, John
always reminded me

730
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,542
to be grateful for the people
that don't give up on us.

731
00:34:56,578 --> 00:34:59,212
Not every recovering addict

732
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:01,414
has that person, but I do.

733
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:05,351
And I am so grateful.

734
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,140
When the phone
rings at night, Jess,

735
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,510
my heart stops.

736
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,357
Is it gonna be
someone calling to say

737
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:17,814
that you're in trouble again

738
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:21,183
or that you're in jail?

739
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:23,853
Or dead?

740
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:27,490
So I hover.

741
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,442
And I worry.

742
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:32,979
And, yes, I do too much,
but here we are again.

743
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,683
You almost died today, Jess.

744
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,339
You got to start
making better choices.

745
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:45,691
I know.

746
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,160
You're right.

747
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,329
I promise I will
try to make sure

748
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:52,548
this is the last time that
you have to go through this.

749
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:56,168
So let's start now. Okay?

750
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:58,020
Get out of here.

751
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,390
Go sing and dance

752
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,209
and do whatever
the hell you want.

753
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,845
I'm safe.

754
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,065
And I'm gonna be okay.

755
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,543
- You're touching me.
- Mm-hmm.

756
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,538
- And you're smiling.
- Ah. Which is more offensive

757
00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:23,874
- to your delicate sensibilities?
- What the hell are you doing?

758
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:25,532
I am guiding you toward victory.

759
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:28,702
You put together
a team of doctors.

760
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:30,547
You expertly
stepped up in the OR

761
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:33,974
to repair an
exterior iliac artery.

762
00:36:34,009 --> 00:36:38,177
Mina, you saved Ernest's life.

763
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:41,013
Now, we do what we
do for moments like this.

764
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:45,001
So go ahead. Finish
the job, princess.

765
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,996
Don't call me princess.

766
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:57,113
Ernest should
make a full recovery.

767
00:36:57,149 --> 00:37:00,450
In a few months, he may even
get his vision and hearing back.

768
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,585
His mind will clear.

769
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,670
He will barbecue again.

770
00:37:04,706 --> 00:37:06,840
I'm sorry you both
had to go through this,

771
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:10,259
but it's over.

772
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,945
Thank you.

773
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,973
- Really, thank you.
- Oh, yes. Of course.

774
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:25,975
Thank you.

775
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,770
Hear us out: camping,
rafting isn't gonna happen

776
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:40,218
because we all realized
we don't really raft,

777
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:42,776
or do things outdoors that
involve water, animals or bugs.

778
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,410
I'm not even certain I can swim.

779
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,997
Well, I can swim, but
spending two hours in the car

780
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:51,384
with this guy, after this day,
is not my idea of a good time.

781
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,898
- So...
- Are you inviting yourselves
to girls' night?

782
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:55,666
Well, we're hoping
to get invited.

783
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,456
We'll be on our best behavior.

784

your best behavior?
