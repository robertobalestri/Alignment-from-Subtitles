You've been a locum tenens

00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,221

4
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:07,873
from hospital to hospital.

5
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:10,959
I'm Julian Booth, device rep
for QuoVadis. I was a dancer

6
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:13,912
until one day, I was hit by
a car. Total hip replacement

7
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,632
gave me my life back and
made me a true believer.

8
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,645
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

9
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:21,637
- How much does he make?
- A million five.

10
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:24,151
You're gonna have to
learn to work together.

11
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:26,592
- Nic, I'm trying.
- This was never our problem.

12
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,978
- Then what was?
- Not here, not now.

13
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:32,325
I got the cue ball curving
while chilling with Irving.

14
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:34,277
A few more drinks, and
he might start swerving.

15
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,496
Looking like that, I'm
surprised they let us in.

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,167

I don't need your bad medicine.

17

- Oh!
- That was... was not great.

Well, I don't have to
be good to love hip-hop,

00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:40,608
You stacked the deck.

174
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:42,277
Well played.

175
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,529
I'll be joining you
today at the conference

176
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,699
to meet the CEOs you hope
will be our future partners.

177
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,918
I insist we travel together.

178
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:52,253
In my jet.

179
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,305
Looking forward to it.

180
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,104
<i>I've been struck by lightning.</i>

181
00:07:58,128 --> 00:07:59,823
I don't see any
burns on the skin.

182
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,557
- Have you had any muscle pain?
- Nope.

183
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,997
Strong as an ox.

184
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,466
How about any
hearing or vision loss?

185
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,135
Is that a crack at my age, son?

186
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,553
No, sir.

187
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,038
- Any chest pain?
- Yup.

188
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,058
- Bad ticker.
- I see you had

189
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,476
a defibrillator and
a pacemaker put in.

190
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,230
Oh!

191
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,032
See? Struck by lightning.

192
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,984
Your defibrillator is going off.

193
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25,331
The pain that you're feeling
is from the electrical shock.

194
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:26,999
We'll run some
tests, and I'll call

195
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:28,367
the company that made the device

196
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:29,636
and have them bring
in some equipment

197
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,025
to run a diagnostic, okay?

198
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,140
- I got the card right here.
- Great.

199
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:36,314
Um, I see your
surgeon was Dr. Austin.

200
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,744
Didn't he explain how
defibrillators work?

201
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,217
He used big words.

202
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,837
When he started talking,
I stopped listening.

203
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,139
Okay. Be right back.

204
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:46,703
<i>Dr. Austin,</i>

205
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:51,045
your billing with the
Titian... Non-existent.

206
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,081
I am aware. Good talk.

207
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,662
The Titian's a two
million dollar machine.

208
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:58,085
Chastain needs to make
a return on its investment.

209
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,682
Well, the former
is not my fault,

210
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,156
the latter is not my concern.

211
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:02,935
Your contract
has a billing quota.

212
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,526
Which I exceed consistently.

213
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,378
Okafor, show him the numbers.

214
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,895
Why would I have those numbers?

215
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,725
Somewhere,
someone's got numbers.

216
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,366
Take a gander. Good talk.

217
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,402
The quota<i> includes</i>
robotic surgeries.

218
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:16,015
Every surgeon has learned

219
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,256
and started billing with
the Titian except you.

220
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,591
Well, I'll tell you what.
You find me a study

221
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,844
that shows that the
robotic approach is better

222
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,047
than the standard CT
surgery, and I will consider it.

223
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,927
Consider this:
everyone's replaceable

224
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,968
if they don't play
ball, even you.

225
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,439
Good talk.

226
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,232
I can't seem to catch my breath.

227
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,817
I feel like I ran a marathon.

228
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,652
Dr. Hawkins, do
you see anything?

229
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,122
Well, I don't see any overt
signs of organ rejection,

230
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,102
but we'll need to do a
more extensive scan,

231
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,054
some blood work,
maybe even a biopsy.

232
00:09:57,164 --> 00:10:00,648
BP 85/60, heart rate 130.

233
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,788
Tamponade.

234
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,290
Well, how bad is this? Tell me.

235
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,154
Fluid has built up
around the heart.

236
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,510
It's keeping the heart from

237
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,157
beating normally.
We need to drain it.

238
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,597
Let's get her upstairs.

239
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,424
It's gonna be okay. It's
just a bump in the road.

240
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,161
- Team Johnna can handle this.
- You know I prefer "BriaJohn."

241
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:33,164
I'm good with whatever you want.

242
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,811
I, uh... I still
don't understand

243
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,595
about the fluid
around her heart?

244
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,548
It's probably been there
for weeks and getting worse.

245
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,165
Is this related to
her transplant?

246
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:42,356
Not sure yet, but
certain medications

247
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,354
or inflammation can
cause fluid build-up.

248
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:47,607
We'll send out the fluid
for analysis to figure it out.

249
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:50,559
Uh, Dr. Hawkins, you're,
uh, you're a resident, right?

250
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,967
Shouldn't an attending be
supervising this procedure?

251
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,564
You strong-armed
Dr. Hawkins into

252
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,988
taking my case.

253
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,106
Now he's not qualified
to be my doctor?

254
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:01,976
Hey, don't worry. I've done
this procedure hundreds of times.

255
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,372
She's in good hands.

256
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,531
I should know. I was
there the first time he did it.

257
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,219
Sounds like a
pericardial tamponade.

258
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:23,080
You're right. I need an
18-gauge spinal needle

259
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,644
and a 60cc syringe
to drain the fluid.

260
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,361
Whoa, whoa. You're an
intern. You can't do procedures

261
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,347
- unsupervised.
- Well, while we wait for
the attending to come down,

262
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:31,339
the patient will die.
So, you help me,

263
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,724
or you get out of my way.

264
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,376
Careful, Hawkins.

265
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:37,331
You're gonna need
people like me.

266
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:42,133

you said were

- Yeah.
- It's a big deal.

285
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:27,037
- A lot at stake. Nervous?
- You know,

else's life in your hands

You know, we want the

In one instance, we

Did you not
understand me earlier?

297
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,976
I'll try using different
words. I operate with these.

- This thing is a
two million dollar rip-off.
- Hmm.

You pretend to have
high-minded motives

00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,558

I don't know who came
up with it, but I like it.

319
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,434
The raptor is a bird of prey,

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,507
and who's the student.

325
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:46,778
Lesson for today: never
underestimate The Raptor.

- So, what now?
- Well,

343
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:49,623
since John's experiencing
the same pulmonary issues

344
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,526

00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:55,963
Where did you honeymoon?

348
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:57,749
The Big Island, Hawaii.

349
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,001
Spent most of the
time in the hotel.

350
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,255
I feel so selfish...

351
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,208
not making him see a doctor.

352
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,593
I had no idea he was this sick.

353
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,179
John loves you.

354
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:14,231
I'm sure he was just
trying to show you that

355
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,367
by putting you first.

356
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,919
He feels guilty.

357
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,538
He cheated on me
when we were dating,

358
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,836
and I left him.

359
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,710
We weren't together anymore

360
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,546
when I was diagnosed
with liver disease.

361
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,599
And yet he still volunteered
to be your organ donor?

362
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:37,271
It was the worst
time in my life.

363
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,625
I don't know where I'd
be if he hadn't been there.

364
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,935
New Year's party started early.

365
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,024
- Sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.

366
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,027
You've been amazing.

367
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:03,414
Conrad, I have
everything I need. I'm okay.

368
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,749
You don't have to
stay here all night.

369
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,185
I'm not going anywhere.

370
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,459
Wish there was more I could do.

371
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:22,299
I felt off yesterday.

372
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,821
Conrad, I'm so sorry.

373
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,641
Please,

374
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,504
- don't.
- - I should have gone to see my doctor.

375
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,396
The miscarriage
is not your fault.

376
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,998
There is nothing
anyone could have done.

377
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,685
These things...
they just happen,

378
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,437
and no one knows why.

379
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,117
What would you
have wanted to do?

380
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,665
We will get through this.

381
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,378
<i>Mr. Yokum,</i>

382
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,881
this is Julian Booth,
device rep from QuoVadis,

383
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,649
the company that made

384
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,379
your dual pacemaker
and ICD device.

385
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,652
She's here to check it

386
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,632
and, if necessary,
help us fix it, okay?

387
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:35,134
- Yes, sir.
- All right, perfect.

388
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:36,524
Nice to meet you, Mr. Yokum.

389
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,125
Hi, sweetheart.

390
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,222
You're about to
unbreak my metal heart.

391
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,630
- You call me Hugh.
- Okay, Hugh.

392
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:46,233
- May I?
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you, thank you.

393
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,704
This will be quick and
painless, I promise.

394
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,706
I can wirelessly

395
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,458
pull information from the
defibrillator's hard drive.

396
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,766
The defibrillator is misfiring.

397
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:05,836
It'll need to be replaced. Was
this implanted at Chastain?

398
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,372
Dr. Austin put it in. Big guy.

399
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,690
Rude. Took my hat away.

400
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,737
Dude tried to wear a
cowboy hat in the OR.

401
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:15,040
- I'll get started
on pre-op labs.
- Well, good.

402
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:16,625
We will schedule surgery
as soon as they come back.

403
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,261
- Do you have a replacement
for the device?
- Ready to go.

404
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,130
All right. Alert me if there
are any complications.

405
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,770
I was with Hugh when
the defibrillator went off.

406
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,739
It seemed extreme to me.

407
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,285
Are there cases
when an ICD device

408
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,077
misfired so badly that the
shock killed the patient?

409
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:32,179
I've never heard
of that happening.

410
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:35,861
But it is possible, isn't it?

411
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:38,197
There's a phenomenon known
as "the cure is the cause."

412
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,898
When the treatment
results in more problems

413
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:41,867
than the disease itself. That's
not what's happening here.

414
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:44,308
I think you're overreacting.

415
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,243
All right.

416
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,036
I really don't understand
your problem with the Titian.

417
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:59,089
It's capable of steady
and precise movements.

418
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,159
Oh, yuck. Look who's
toeing the company line.

419
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,811
- Ooh!
- I don't want him to fire you.

420
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,675
Do what Bell wants.
Human hands, robotic hands,

421
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,966
cutting is cutting.

422
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,117
Pay attention, Okafor.

423
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,737
Robots literally
and figuratively

424
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,600
stand in between
me and the patient.

425
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:18,125
So, no, all cutting
is not the same.

426
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,743
Not to me.

427
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,297
And it shouldn't be
to you. And trust me,

428
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,960
Bell is not gonna fire
me. I am too valuable,

429
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,244
- and he knows it.
- Yeah.

430
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:29,453
His ego is as big, if
not bigger, than yours.

431
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,789
Firing you may not
be the smart thing,

432
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,284
but he'll do it just
to prove a point.

433
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:35,170
- And that point would be what?
- That he

434
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,039
is the most powerful
person in the room.

435
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,963
So if you don't sacrifice
your beliefs, the next stop

436
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,783
on your locum tenens journey
will be Who Cares, New Jersey.

437
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:48,756
So, what you got against Jersey?

438
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,125
We compared your
X-rays and other tests.

439
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,510
You both have significant
pulmonary damage.

440
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,190
We believe it's
because of an infection,

441
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,097
but we don't know
what caused it.

442
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,443
So we'll look at
your travel history,

443
00:21:58,467 --> 00:21:59,867
see if anything sticks out.

444
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,880
Even though Brianna has a
compromised immune system

445
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,982
due to the drugs she takes
to avoid organ rejection,

446
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,973
John's lungs are
in a worse shape.

447
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,985
Which may mean that
John got the infection first.

448
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,995
Something you want
to share with the class?

449
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,100
I have a crazy itch down there.

450
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,487
All right, let me see.

451
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:29,679
You have a rash.

452
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,025
Since we seem to
share all our symptoms,

453
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,199
why don't I have a rash?

454
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,201
Maybe John got his

455
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:35,981
doing something without you.

456
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:39,190
We were on our honeymoon,
we did everything together.

457
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,391
Didn't we?

458
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,477
You didn't sneak
out of our hotel room

459
00:22:43,513 --> 00:22:46,325
while I was asleep?
That's not an STD, is it?

460
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:47,993
Let's not jump to
any conclusions.

461
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:49,611
- Who is she?
- Keep your oxygen mask on.

462
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,663
What, the waitress
from our hotel?

463
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:53,020
The guide from our tour?

464
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:56,923
John. John?

465
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,420
We need to intubate.

466
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,327
70 of roc, 20 of etomidate.

467
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:03,113
John! What's going on?

468
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,610
He can't breathe. We
need to do it for him.

469
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,935
John.

470
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,071
I am thrilled you've
agreed, in principle,

471
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:14,057
to partner with Chastain.
We'll produce our own saline,

472
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:16,794
get out from under
monopoly, help our patients,

473
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,640
and make a few
dollars along the way.

474
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,730
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.

475
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,767
So sorry to intrude
on the celebration.

476
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,865
Everyone, this is
Marshall Winthrop.

477
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:28,951
He is the chairman of the
board at Chastain Park Memorial.

478
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:31,475
These three amazing CEOs...

479
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,310
Oh, I know who they are.

480
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,780
Apparently better
than you do, Randolph.

481
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,816
Dr. Curtis, does your board know

482
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:42,135
that you're being investigated
for massive tax evasion?

483
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,906
Mr. Price, you have
quite the résumé.

484
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,392
BA from Harvard.
MBA from Wharton.

485
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,996
Tell me, how is the
weather in Arizona,

486
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,949
where you actually
went to college?

487
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:58,636
And Kevin Finnerman, you
have driven your hospital

488
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,887
to the brink of bankruptcy

489
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:03,290
with administration overhead

490
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:06,405
that crushes what you
spend in patient care.

491
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,680
You don't have the coin
to partner with anyone.

492
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,933
Stick to what you know

493
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,419
and leave the
business of business

494
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,788
to the big boys.

495
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:29,299
John's getting a chest CT
and a little test for STDs.

496
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,035
Syphilis or chlamydia
could explain his symptoms.

497
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:33,949
Yeah. If he passed
something on to Brianna,

498
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,889
it'll explain hers, too.

499
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,104
You okay?

500
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:41,462
She was holding
on to a honeymoon,

501
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:43,692
when maybe there never
should've been a marriage.

502
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,332
John says he's changed.

503
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:47,162
Let's give him the
benefit of the doubt.

504
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,231
They went through so
much. Things changed.

505
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,237
I'm not sure that people can.

506
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,144
Are we still talking
about the patient?

507
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:03,466
We broke up because we
had issues, and then Lily died,

508
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,703
and your dad came
back, I got arrested.

509
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,871
If those things didn't happen,

510
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,852
do you think we'd
be back together?

511
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,125
Uh, yes.

512
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,127
Of course.

513
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:16,012
Don't you?

514
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,550
I don't know.

515
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,350
I'll let you know when
John's results come in.

516
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,148
Thank you so much. Thank you.

517
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:39,103
I'm honored to be here
among the tribe I value most:

518
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,083
doctors, health
care professionals,

519
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,423
dedicated to making
their patients' lives better.

520
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,393
We make decisions when
a life hangs in the balance.

521
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:49,429
We treat and cure, all while
risking unfounded blame

522
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,548
and lawsuits.

523
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,099
But I'm here today

524
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:56,069
not to list our
challenges and virtues

525
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:58,621
but to issue a clarion call

526
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,391
to this group that
I consider heroes.

527
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:04,061
It's time for us to suit up

528
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,229
and take on a new fight,

529
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,026
and we need to do it together.

530
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,851
Because bad things are
happening in our world,

531
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:14,738
and we can't fix them
because we've lost control.

532
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:17,925
We've surrendered our power
to the medical industrial complex,

533
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,211
and it is time to show those
who would stand in the way

534
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,131
of the common good that
we will no longer surrender.

535
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,800
It is up to us, not
ignorant businessmen,

536
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,485
to fight that good fight.

537
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,655
I suggest we can do it by
solving a simple problem.

538
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,658
Hospitals cannot get
ahold of one of the cheapest

539
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,928
and most effective treatments
on Earth: saline solution.

540
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,796
There's a handful of companies

541
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:42,215
that control the market.

542
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,818
They hold us all hostage.

543
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,587
We need to change that.

544
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:56,613
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.
I got your page.

545
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,732
The Raptor is here to help.

546
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,662
Let's just say I'm
embracing the nickname.

547
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,102
Our patient has acute

548
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,621
- respiratory failure.
- I'm aware.

549
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:08,092
Listen, as someone who has
gone toe-to-toe with Bell and won,

550
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,644
I need your advice on
how to handle a situation.

551
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,130
He wants me to start
billing with the Titian.

552
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:16,450
It's a machine I loathe
as if it were a real person.

553
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:18,418
I agree.

554
00:27:18,454 --> 00:27:20,614
But if I don't use it,
he says he'll fire me.

555
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,651
Well, then you got a choice
to make. You do what Bell says

556
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:25,025
and save your job, or
stand up for your principles

557
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,693
and risk getting fired.

558
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:29,329
Okay, that's not the
answer I was looking for.

559
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:30,748
That's all I got.

560
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:36,553
Whoa. Looks like your man
John needs a bronchoscopy, stat.

561
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,139
Look at those lungs.

562
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:40,824
Most of it looks chronic.

563
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,821
This means John's health was
impaired before his honeymoon.

564
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:44,311
Oh, long before, brother.

565
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:45,840
Based on this scan,
I'd say his lungs

566
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,642
have been taking
a beating for years.

567
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,528
But why did John and
Brianna's symptoms only develop

568
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:50,796
after they got back
from the honeymoon?

569
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,514
Well, I don't know,
but the Raptor

570
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,004
does not envy you right now.

571
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,051
John's organs are shutting down.

572
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,995
First his lungs,
now his kidneys.

573
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,362
Did you get Hugh's
pre-op labs back?

574
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:10,136
Um... any second.

575
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:13,423
I'm sorry if I was
a little short earlier.

576
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:14,857
I love my work.

577
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,210
- I get defensive.
- Understandable.

578
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:18,712
Admirable, too.

579
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:20,847
I hear you have a
wedding coming up.

580
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:22,544
You studying up to
do a Bollywood dance

581
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,917
- at the reception?
- Yeah.

582
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,404
My fiancée, Priya, insists.

583
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,039
I don't want to
disappoint her, but I...

584
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,670
I have two left feet.

585
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:34,344
Well, maybe I can help.

586
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,595
I was a dancer, remember?

587
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:38,965
Page Dr. Austin.

588
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,754
His heart rate's dropping.

589
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,424
Get the pacer pads.

590
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,543
His device has
completely failed.

591
00:28:49,578 --> 00:28:51,094
Start pacing at 80.

592
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,716
Can we sedate him?

593
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:58,101
His pressure's too low.

594
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:01,087
- It's not capturing.
- Pravesh, talk to me.

595
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:03,452
- His device isn't working.
- He needs a transvenous pacer.

596
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:05,203
Well, in my infinite wisdom,

597
00:29:05,227 --> 00:29:06,709
I ordered these on the way down.

598
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,244
Pravesh, suit up.

599
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,246
I'll talk you through it.

600
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,281
Come on, let's go.

601
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,573
Now, access the right internal

602
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,585
jugular vein with
the finder needle.

603
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:28,749
Good. Now advance the guidewire.

604
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,418
Okay,

605
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:36,105
and guide the
catheter over the wire.

606
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,476
Remove the wire.

607
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:41,678
Stay cool, Pravesh.
Don't look at the monitor.

608
00:29:41,714 --> 00:29:43,447
Listen to me.

609
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,602
Now insert the wire
and inflate the balloon.

610
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:53,440
Grab the pacer generator.
Set the heartbeat to 80,

611
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,508
and the output at ten milliamps.

612
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,981
Slowly advance, Pravesh.

613
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,282
Keep going.

614
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,953
Keep going...

615
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:07,265
There.

616
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,459
Blood pressure's back to normal.

617
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:15,195
Deflate the balloon.
Dial back on the output.

618
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,198
All right, let's get this guy up
to ICU and change his device.

619
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,052
But for now, you saved his life.

620
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,121
Well done.

621
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,023
You're a natural.

622
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:34,326
- I'm ready to leave the ICU?
- Yes, but we're still gonna keep

623
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,515
a close eye on you.

624
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,550
I feel bad for leaving him.

625
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,036
I should be doing something.

626
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,415
The best thing to
do is help figure out

627
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,850
what you've both
been exposed to.

628
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:43,467
John's lungs were
severely damaged

629
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:45,886
- long before your honeymoon.
- But your symptoms didn't start

630
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,061
until after you returned home.

631
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,807
- We're missing something.
- I told you everything

632
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:51,726
I can remember about
our medical history.

633
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,317
All right. Well, then,
let's trace backwards.

634
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,847
When was the last
time you were sick?

635
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:59,422
Uh, we both had a
cold around the holidays

636
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,419
and a bout of food
poisoning a month ago.

637
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,760
- From what?
- Undercooked chicken.

638
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,824
John took it off
the stove too soon

639
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:08,414
because it was
smoking out the kitchen.

640
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,411
I lived with him in that
house for two years,

641
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,830
and every time he
cooks something with oil,

642
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:13,615
the whole place
smells like smoke again,

643
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,282
which makes John's
cough even worse.

644
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,835
You've mentioned
his cough before.

645
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:18,107
Has he had it for a while?

646
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:19,526
Yes. It's been on and off

647
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:21,423
since he bought the
house three years ago.

648
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:23,830
We tested it for mold
but didn't find anything.

649
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,510
I have the same
cough, but we figured

650
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:28,451
it was just some
sort of allergy.

651
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,220
We don't normally
do house calls,

652
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,907
but do you mind if
we go have a look?

653
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,294
You're late.

654
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,299
I had a few last-minute
deals to shore up.

655
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:45,568
So, just for your information,

656
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,253
after my speech,

657
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,906
six new CEOs expressed
interest in starting

658
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,869
- our own saline factory.
- We won't need them.

659
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:54,778
I just bought a
manufacturing company

660
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:57,397
to produce our own
saline, and I'm working

661
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:00,967
on getting fast track
approval from the FDA.

662
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,255
So you bought a factory...

663
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,490
threw away a much
larger opportunity

664
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,910
just to keep me
from having a win.

665
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:13,764
I got into a business
with a proven track record.

666
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,898
It's not all about you, Bell.

667
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,919
That's something you seem to
have a hard time understanding.

668
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,491
Club soda.

669
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:32,482
No weird smells. No animals.

670
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,518
I don't see anything hazardous.

671
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,736
John's STD test came back.

672
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:38,287
Negative.

673
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:41,324
Brianna will be relieved.

674
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,088
Maybe he did change.

675
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:45,945
Testing negative does not
mean that he didn't cheat,

676
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:48,093
but we'll give him the
benefit of the doubt.

677
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:50,650
Still, it can't be easy
for her; she never forgot

678
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:53,470
how their relationship
ended the first time.

679
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:56,189
Kind of like you never forgot
what happened at the 404 Tavern.

680
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:00,260
Wish I could.

681
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:01,677
Seriously, none of them?

682
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,491
- None.
- Not even the first three.

683
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,498
- I don't like lightsabers.
- Ugh.

684
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,183
Okay, what about<i> Battlestar...</i>

685
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,435
The concept of girl Starbuck,

686
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:11,282
boy Starbuck... That
means nothing to you?

687
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:12,705
What?

688
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,775
Wow. How has this never come up?

689
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:17,177
I wish it hadn't.

690
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,996
Okay. Clear your
Saturday and your Sunday.

691
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,315
Movie marathon. Me
and you. It's happening.

692
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,680
- You and me.
- Uh, all right.

693
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,581
I'm gonna need
more beer for that.

you're doing the
same thing right now.

711
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:21,518
You know, Conrad, the way
that you handle things scares me.

712
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,688
- That's not fair.
- Whether it's Afghanistan,

I never know what you're

00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,472
Dragging some
guy into a bathroom

720
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:39,292
because some bomb goes off
in you, and I can't see it coming?

00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,644

00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:05,818
Do the work, get the help.

729
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,482
You make me want
to be a better person.

730
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,556
That's one of the
reasons why I love you.

731
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:12,642
I know you love me, and I know

732
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:16,179
that you believe
everything you just said.

733
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:21,284
But if this is gonna work,
you need to believe it, too.

734
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,689
Yeah.

735
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:32,161
Sorry, I just realized
there's pottery

736
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,013
all over the place.

737
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:41,654
And I think they
make it themselves.

738
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:44,602
Maybe somewhere in the house.

739
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:47,127
Only one place left to look.

740
00:36:02,144 --> 00:36:05,111
<i>You developed a condition</i>

741
00:36:05,147 --> 00:36:06,680
called chronic silicosis,

742
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:08,859
scarring of the lungs
caused by inhaling silica.

743
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:10,461
A mineral found in
clay used for pottery.

744
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:13,787
You and John have been
inhaling harmful levels for years

745
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:15,888
due to poor ventilation
in your workshop.

746
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,490
John moved into the house first,

747
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:19,692
so he was exposed
for a longer period.

748
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:22,712
And that's why he
got sicker faster?

749
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:25,214
But why didn't we get sick
until after our honeymoon?

750
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,583
Volcanic ash is a
trigger for acute silicosis,

751
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,531
which you inhaled
while you were in Hawaii.

752
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:32,588
It can take a few weeks
for symptoms to show up.

753
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,257
And the rash?

754
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,686
The bronch on his lungs revealed

755
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,910
an infection called nocardia.

756
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,324
You both got it in Bali,

757
00:36:39,348 --> 00:36:42,065
but it's more common for men
to develop a rash than women.

758
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,762
Silicosis and nocardia...
they're treatable.

759
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,537
But John's chest CT
revealed an empyema...

760
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,256
Pus and dead tissue in the lung.

761
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:53,159
He needs surgery.

762
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:57,113
You have my consent.

763
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,348
Go help my husband.

764
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:03,181
<i>I hear you're doing
Mr. Candelora's empyema.</i>

765
00:37:03,205 --> 00:37:05,121
We're heading to the OR now.

766
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,734
I assume you're
using the Titian.

767
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,752
Well, you know what they
say about assumptions.

768
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:12,578
Dr. Austin, I was crystal clear.

769
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:17,028
Yes. You were.

770
00:37:17,052 --> 00:37:20,236
And I made a medical decision
based on personal principles.

771
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,856
I will forever do
the best job I can

772
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:25,975
using the finest
tools available.

773
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,211
Now, I assume that
a surgeon like you

774
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,147
would understand
that. But, if not...

775
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,732
fire me.

776
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:34,687
I keep my bags
packed at all times.

777
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:38,587
I think that's wise.

778
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:48,464
This might be our
last dance, Okafor.

779
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,384
If Bell was going to fire you,

780
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:53,103
it would've just happened.

781
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:56,155
So, not our last dance.

782
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:01,010
How was the conference?

783
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:03,462
Oh, inspiring. Educational.

784
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:06,165
Your father's approach
to just about everything

785
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,134
is an acquired taste.

786
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,187
I'm gonna guess
he insinuated himself

787
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,756
into whatever your plans
were for the saline shortage.

788
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,825
Oh, Marshall, on his own,

789
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,361
wrote a check, bought a
company... just like that...

790
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:21,147
To manufacture clean,
safe saline for Chastain.

791
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:22,932
We'll never be short again.

792
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,502
And now he'll sell the
surplus and make a killing.

793
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,988
You know, you
better open your eyes.

794
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:30,852
He's certainly here
to scorch the earth,

795
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:32,486
but trust me, he'll
be sticking around

796
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,511
to make a mint off
the carbon he creates.

797
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:49,559
Long day?

798
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:53,379
Yeah, it's not over.

799
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,665
Got a couple more phone
calls to make, a few e-mails.

800
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,419
- You can do it tomorrow.
- Not my style.

801
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,373
Chastain isn't like other
companies you've taken over.

802
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:09,078
I think I can handle anything
this hospital throws my way.

803
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,297
Like a saline shortage?

804
00:39:11,332 --> 00:39:14,867
You might not believe
this, but I have no ill intent

805
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,702

where it came from.

Are you ready to
go down in defeat?

873
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:54,770
People may change,

874
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,273
but I'm not sure your
pool game can be saved.

875
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,819
Those are fighting words.

876
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:02,111
I'll let my 12-game
lead do the talking.

877
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,230
All right. Watch this.

878
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:08,534
- 12 ball, corner pocket.
- Difficult shot.

879
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,021
I seem to remember
you missing that one a lot.

880
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:15,024
Not this time.
