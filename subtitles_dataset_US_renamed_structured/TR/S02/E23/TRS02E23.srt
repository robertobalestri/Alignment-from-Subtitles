<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
<i>- A few weeks ago,</i>

2
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:06,488
a wonderful man who
loved me proposed.

3
00:00:06,523 --> 00:00:09,408
<i>I took so long to decide
that he changed his mind.</i>

4
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,504
- Wait, is this for us?
- Yes, of course it's for us.

5
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:14,880
- We can get a hot tub. Raise chickens.
- What?

6
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:17,383
I don't move in with
you, so you just leave me.

7
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,029
If you're not interested
in going forward, for me,

8
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,552
it's time to take a step back.

9
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:21,648
So my kidneys will
never work again?

10
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,188
You have to stay on dialysis

11
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,369
- for the rest of
your life, Jess.
- Come on.

12
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,820
There's got to
be another option.

13
00:00:26,844 --> 00:00:29,005
It's not that you can't
give Jessie your kidney,

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,195
it's that you won't!

15
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,547
Why can't you
for once, for once,

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,480

I've been thinking

And I realized something,
so just hear me out.

46
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,907
Of course.

47
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,194
Life is hard.

48
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,514
And the problems keep coming.

49
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:49,117
And I keep... trying to
solve them all by myself.

50
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:51,653
Jessie, my dad, our patients.

51
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,289
I seem...

52
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:58,193
completely incapable
of asking for help.

53
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:00,294
I don't know why I do that.

54
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,298
Well, you lost your mom

55
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,710
- as a kid.
- No, no, I don't...

56
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:05,845
I don't want to do that.

57
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:06,852
I don't want to make excuses.

58
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,653
I want to see the pattern,

59
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,706
take responsibility, and change.

60
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,428
Okay, I'm listening.

61
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,076
You said you want
to move forward

62
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,566
in our relationship.

63
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,552
I want that, too.

64
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,823
I just need you to
meet me halfway.

65
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:30,492
- What do you mean?
- It means...

66
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:33,228
I want to start talking
about moving in,

67
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:36,582
marriage, a family, all of it.

68
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,566
But you can't push me.

69
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,252
You can't rush me.

70
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:43,738
Let me do this at my own pace.

71
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,609
Okay. Yeah.

72
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,494
I can do that.

73
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,866
This is a big deal.

74
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:59,804
Yeah.

75
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,311
I'm in.

76
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:15,386
I just...

77
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,789
I just only have one request.

78
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,791
What?

79
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,944
I really want those chickens.

80
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:27,231
No chickens.

81
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,257
Your company, Red
Rock Mountain Medical,

82
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,927
is the top health care
conglomerate in the Southeast.

83
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:41,063
Your motto: "We're like family."

84
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:45,017
But your family is
missing a crucial piece.

85
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,953
We now own every major hospital
within a hundred-mile radius.

86
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,023
We don't need Chastain.

87
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,290
But you do.

88
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,275
To control pricing.

89
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:56,272
You need to eliminate
the competition.

90
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,257
Chastain is in no position
to undercut our pricing.

91
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,031
You're $100 million in the red.

92
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,466
We have an amazing staff.

93
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,451
Talented doctors and nurses.

94
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:06,254
We're a top facility.
We're unmatched.

95
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:08,857
But our research shows the
words most closely associated

96
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,709
with Chastain are "Dr. Lane
Hunter" and "QuoVadis."

97
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,945
That's behind us. It's old news.

98
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,347
And, in fact,

99
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,332
I view it as a success story.

100
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,951
We were instrumental
in exposing corruption.

101
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,688
We helped bring down QuoVadis.

102
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,505
We will be stronger together.

103
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,140
Guaranteed.

104
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,978
Well...

105
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:33,464
we will discuss internally
and get back to you.

106
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,784
In the meantime, Dr. Bell,

107
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,053
do avoid any
further PR disasters.

108
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,575
A bit of news for you.

109
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,362
I'm putting a pacemaker
in Micah today.

110
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:49,214
Alert the media.

111
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,832
I know.

112
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,684
It's minor.

113
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,346
So, don't worry. You
don't need to be there.

114
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,870
Why wouldn't I assist?

115
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,901
Because you're emotionally
involved with the patient.

116
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:58,907
No, I'm not.

117
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,592
Our engagement ended weeks ago.

118
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,093
Weeks?

119
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,563
Well, that's hardly enough
time to get over heartbreak.

120
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,681
Take it from the
heartbreaker in chief.

121
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:07,983
Oh, please.

122
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,268
Shira, we're closed here.

123
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,070
We have another surgery.

124
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,473

patient and take him to ICU.

You're aware that's pathetic.

Adult male. Age unknown.

minor scrapes and bruises. Okay.

149
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,560
Let's start another large
bore IV and hang another liter

150
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:27,157
- of normal saline. One, two, three.
- One, two...

151
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:29,797
Okay.

152
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,451
Can you tell us your

153
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:41,643
ID?

154
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:42,644
Mm.

155
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,447
No wallet. No phone.

156
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,165
Okay.

157
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,150
Torn clothes.

158
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:51,086
Dirt under his fingernails.

159
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:52,170
He could be homeless.

160
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:57,491
Sir, your name, please.

161
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,677
Okay, let's add
LFTs, coags, UTox,

162
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,275
aspirin/acetaminophen
levels, and a blood alcohol level.

163
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:03,676
Page social work.

164
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,016
See if they recognize him.

165
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,863
If not, have them
call local shelters,

166
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,781
see if anyone's missing or
fits the description, while we try

167
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:11,016
- to get his pain under control.
- I'll order an X-ray

168
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,775
and get Dr. Voss to
take a look at that arm.

169
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,229
Must be very rewarding to
be a transplant coordinator.

170
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,662
It is, but it's frustrating.

171
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,648
We need more donors to step up.

172
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,884
Too many people die
waiting for an organ.

173
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,403
That's my biggest
fear with my sister.

174
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,388
How is she doing on dialysis?

175
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,991
Not well.

176
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:31,992
Um, she's in
early heart failure.

177
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,078
It's causing a lot of problems.

178
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,247
A new organ could
help her heart.

179
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:40,434
Yeah. But we can't
wait years to get one.

180
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,589
Excuse me.

181
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,474
Hi. Welcome to Chastain.

182
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,886
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, maybe.

183
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,310
I'm looking for a doctor.

184
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:51,062
Her name is Shira Smook.

185
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,265
Shira... Smook.

186
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,435
Okay. Anesthesiology.

187
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,853
Would you like me to page her?

188
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:01,355
Nah. Anesthesiology.

189
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:02,574
I'll call her myself,

190
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,041
tell her I'm here.

191
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,266
They had to abort dialysis
because her pressure dropped.

192
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,038
Your sats are a little low.

193
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,925
Please-please make it stop, Nic.

194
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,020
Gonna do our best.
This should help.

195
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,860
First order of business

196
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,641
is to switch up your
heart medication

197
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,280
so you can tolerate dialysis.

198
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,905
All right, Nic and I need
to discuss our options.

199
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,240
Then I'll be right back.

200
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,561
It's gonna be okay.

201
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,313
Just give me a sec.

202
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,052
Elevated JVP.

203
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,939
And I saw signs of
hepatojugular reflux.

204
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:53,591
Her heart failure
is getting worse,

205
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,075
more rapidly than we expected.

206
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,661
This is a disaster.

207
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:01,282
Treatment of dual organ
failure is challenging,

208
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,217
not impossible.

209
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:05,953
Heart failure alone
could kill Jessie.

210
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:07,955
She needs a new kidney.

211
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:09,940
Soon.

212
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,677
There are cases where that
alone improves heart function.

213
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,613
She might not need a
new heart for ten years.

214
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,610
Your father's still the
most logical donor.

215
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:19,351
He's here. He's a match.

216
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:22,019
Kyle refused to donate.

217
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,033
And now I can't find
him. He's disappeared.

218
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,302
- I-I've called him over
and over again.
- Which is why

219
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,703
I asked my dad to try
and track him down.

220
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,205
He put his private
investigator on him,

221
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,612
and now I have an address.

222
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,064
You want it?

223
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,276
Trying,

224
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,611
um,

225
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,930
i-ingman...

226
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,016
Dad bum.

227
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:55,002
He has expressive aphasia.

228
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:58,673
He knows what we're
saying, but he can't speak.

229
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,810
Maybe when he fell and broke
his arm, he-he hit his head.

230
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,646
Still no kin we can find,
no proxy to tell us who he is.

231
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:07,215
Squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.

232
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,582
All right. There you go.

233
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,653
We're up to the letter "S" now?

234
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,322
We're calling him Sunflower One.

235
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,324
Nothing personal, my friend.

236
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:19,411
When we can't identify patients,
we name them after flowers.

237
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,474
Yeah.

238
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:23,230
He needs a CT.

239
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,666
Bell's been tightening
the screws down here.

240
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,135
He told me, and I quote,

241
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,647
"Platinum care is
reserved for those

242
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:29,921
with platinum credit cards."

243
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,984
Since when do we do anything

244
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:34,203
but try to work around Bell?

245
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,143
Her...

246
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:38,579
herb.

247
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,000
Herb.

248
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,763
Given his age and
how he was found,

249
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,739
he might have dementia.
In which case, this...

250
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,741
is his baseline.

251
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,360
We need to take
care of this man.

252
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:54,245
Whether or not he's homeless,

253
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,548
- or whether or not he's insured.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,594
If there is an
underlying diagnosis,

255
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,501
like a brain bleed or a tumor,

256
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,849
delay could cause irreparable
damage, even death.

257
00:12:02,873 --> 00:12:06,340
At the bare minimum,
a CT is standard of care.

258
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:08,259
Good.

259
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,189
Let us know when
we have the results.

260
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:11,963
Take it from there.

261
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:20,905
So it's definitely a type 2
second-degree heart block.

262
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,123
Which explains my dizziness.

263
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,692
Electrical impulses

264
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,155
aren't getting
through to your heart.

265
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,480
How serious is the surgery to...

266
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,409
- implant a pacemaker?
- Oh, it's no big deal, bruh.

267
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:33,701
Quick procedure. In an
hour, you'll be a new man.

268
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,287
Good. Thank you.

269
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,706
So, otherwise...
everything okay?

270
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,208
You seem to be in good spirits.

271
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:42,105
Yeah, and I have
never been better.

272
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,056
Seriously, on top of the world.

273
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,558
- Nice.
- Yeah.

274
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:47,715
Sorry I'm late.

275
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,228
- Traffic was terrible.
- Yeah, yeah.

276
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:50,835
Come in, come in.

277
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,632
This is Dr. Austin. He's
going to be putting in

278
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:54,055
my pacemaker this afternoon.

279
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,559
- Jolene Landis.
- Hi.

280
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,810
Thank you for taking such
good care of my Micah.

281
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,237
- Hey, I've been looking for you.
- What are you doing here?

282
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:10,555
You promised me.

283
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,994
Leave or I'll call security.

284
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,266
I'll meet you in the
parking lot in an hour.

285
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,086
My ex. He's a stalker.

286
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,338
Terrible choice in
men, working on that.

287
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,420
Hey.

288
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:02,923
I've been trying to reach you.

289
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,410
I didn't want to be reached.

290
00:14:07,864 --> 00:14:10,081
Look, I know things

291
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,917
ended badly and I'm
sorry if... you've been upset.

292
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,553
But you're not sorry
for what you said.

293
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:19,235
Look, can we just...
can we go inside?

294
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,736
- Can we talk?
- No, I just...

295
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,394
moved in, it's, um...

296
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,729
it's a mess.

297
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,149
Sit.

298
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:29,583
Nice, huh?

299
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,819
I'm the caretaker.

300
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:33,571
Free rent. Good job.

301
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,905
Want a beer?

302
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,941
It's a little early for me.

303
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,677
I've got a... a long
drive back, so...

304
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,913
So... what's this about?

305
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,266
You know what
this is about, Kyle.

306
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,934
Jessie.

307
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,170
She relapsed again?

308
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:50,537
No.

309
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,907
No, she's... she's sober,

310
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,793
and she's determined
to stay that way.

311
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,811
But her situation has changed.

312
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,616
It's not just her
kidneys anymore.

313
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,303
Her, um...

314
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,639
her heart's failing.

315
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,569
Wait, what... what
does that mean,

316
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:12,454
- her heart is failing?
- We're trying to stabilize it

317
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,040
so she's still
eligible for a kidney,

318
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:16,046
but the truth is,
she has a very...

319
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,616
narrow window right now, so...

320
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:21,880
If you would
reconsider donating,

321
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,437
she might have a chance.

322
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:25,773
I know you wanted her
to be sober six months

323
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,136
to make sure she
doesn't relapse,

324
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,627
but she doesn't have six months.

325
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,396
How long do we have?

326
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,597
Days.

327
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,227
Weeks. I don't know.

328
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,950
But what I do know is that...

329
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,721
right now you're the only
person who could save her.

330
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:41,121
I'm 63.

331
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:42,557
I smoked.

332
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:45,159
I still drink more
than I should.

333
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,978
I can't believe that my
kidney is her best option.

334
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,698
It's her only option.

335
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:02,026
Strange I ended up by a lake.

336
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,129
Never learned how to swim.

337
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,317
I hate dark water.

338
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,791
You're scared.

339
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,684
Yeah.

340
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,837
Is it so wrong of me?

341
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,158
I mean, the risk is...

342
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,176
is pretty low... for the donor.

343
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:38,229
But it exists.

344
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,831
There is a risk.

345
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:52,343
I'm sorry.

346
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,507
Next time I see you will
be at Jessie's funeral.

347
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,459
And it'll be the last
time that I see you.

348
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,179
He does have a
ruptured aneurysm.

349
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,698
But it's small, right there
in your Broca's area.

350
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,750
Which could explain
why he can't speak.

351
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,052
Or all his symptoms
are caused by dementia,

352
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,621
so we'll ask for
a neuro consult.

353
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,174
What if they say
he needs surgery?

354
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:43,026
He's uninsured.

355
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,696
He's been classified
as "unbefriended."

356
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,132
No living relative, no proxy.

357
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,717
Which means the hospital
decides all his care,

358
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:53,354
and Bell is the hospital.

359
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:54,889
Right.

360
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,652
Let's be conservative
a little while longer.

361
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,809
Take him to the
ER for observation.

362
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,873
If Sunflower gets worse,

363
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:03,531
then we have a stronger
case to make to Bell,

364
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:06,951
one that will be
harder for him to refuse.

365
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,602
Hmm.

366
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:16,828
Hey.

367
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,812
Where you been?

368
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,115
Nowhere good.

369
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,269
But now I'm here with you.

370
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,372
What's this?

371
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,877
It's my advance directive.

372
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,575
You're my proxy.

373
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,683
All my wishes are spelled out.

374
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,135
The hospital has a copy, too.

375
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,253
Nic?

376
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:49,526
Let's be brave

377
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,628
and honest, okay?

378
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,678
That's what I want.

379
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,281
The truth.

380
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:56,016
We're in a bad spot, aren't we?

381
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,104
Yeah.

382
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,673
No one's giving up.

383
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,509
If I die...

384
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,514
I know you'll find a
way to blame yourself.

385
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,533
This is not your fault.

386
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,164
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,822
You went to see Dad, didn't you?

388
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,559
Conrad found him, and, uh...

389
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:26,763
I went to let him
know where we stand.

390
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:30,284
I was hoping he'd step up.

391
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,653
I don't understand. He can't.

392
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:35,339
He's not a match.

393
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,009
He's a match.

394
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,212
He's, um...

395
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,197
he's scared of the surgery.

396
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:49,420
How is this not
infuriating to you?

397
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,457
I'm disappointed.

398
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,677
But I understand.

399
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,215
I'm a lot like him.

400
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:05,702
You are not.

401
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,871
You're like Mom.

402
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,091
He's not a bad person.

403
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,693
He's just...

404
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,997
weak.

405
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:18,248
We have to keep fighting...

406
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,533
together.

407
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,551
Okay? You promise me?

408
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,705
We will.

409
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:27,925
But if we lose the battle...

410
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:34,231
there's just one more
thing I'll ask, okay?

411
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:38,235
Try to forgive Dad...

412
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,438
if you can.

413
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:46,160
And let him know
that I forgive him, too.

414
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,174
Okay.

415
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,955
4:30, OR Two.

416
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,918
Is that the surgery
you and Dr. Austin

417
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,242
were talking about earlier?

418
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:02,609
With your ex-fiancé?

419
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,879
You're doing it with us?

420
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:07,297
Yep. See you in there.

421
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,142
- I have a request.
- Same here.

422
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,261
I wish this corned
beef was more tender.

423
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,579
Shira is the anesthesiologist
on Micah's surgery.

424
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,932
I need you to take
her off the case.

425
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,401
- Why?
- Gut instinct.

426
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:29,331
I... Something's up with
that girl. I do not trust her.

427
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:32,673
And you want
what's best for Micah.

428
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,108
Okay. Deal. I'll
get Paul Chu on it.

429
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:36,610
Hey.

430
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,623
You still planning
on scrubbing in?

431
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:39,730
Yes.

432
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,325
Micah has a new girlfriend.

433
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,046
She's here at the hospital.

434
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,630
She's very pretty.

435
00:21:56,665 --> 00:22:00,718
And he says he is happier
than he has ever been.

436
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:05,689
I'm sorry, Mina.

437
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:09,342
I did not enjoy delivering
that ten-blade to your heart.

438
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:12,229
But I had to see if you still
had feelings for your ex-fiancé,

439
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,831
and by your reaction, you do.

440
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,483
So no, you will
not be scrubbing in.

441
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:22,305
And for what it's worth...

442
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,091
you deserve better.

443
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,228
Anybody who'd
replace you so quickly

444
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,881
doesn't deserve you.

445
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,044
All right. Thank you so much.

446
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:49,183
Jessie just gave me
her advance directive.

447
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,353
I can't bring myself to read it.

448
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,614
Yo.

449
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,399
Nicodemus.

450
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:07,367
Nickelmeister.

451
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:09,536
Anybody need a
kidney around here?

452
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:21,008
Thank you, Dad.

453
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,634
I've got some good news.
Thanks to Dr. Hawkins,

454
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,891
your heart failure
has improved for now.

455
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:34,628
We can move ahead with
the transplant if we move fast.

456
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,646
So what's next?

457
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,326
First, we'll bring
you to the OR.

458
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,794
Uh, as we're
removing your kidney,

459
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,585
a second transplant team

460
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:43,331
will prep your daughter
in a separate OR.

461
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,250
When she's ready, we'll
implant your kidney into Jessie.

462
00:23:45,274 --> 00:23:46,907
Six to eight hours from now,

463
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:49,559
you should both wake up,
ready to make a full recovery.

464
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,440
Six to eight hours
from<i> right</i> now?

465
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,130
Right now.

466
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,883
Well, you guys, um... you
don't fool around, do you?

467
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:57,751
It can't wait.

468
00:23:57,786 --> 00:23:59,837
See you on the table.

469
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:24,361
Dr. Voss, I need your help.

470
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:33,003
Dr. Bell, meet Sunflower.

471
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:36,624
Sunflower?

472
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,210
- We don't know his real name.
- It's...

473
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,810
It...

474
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,275
I...

475
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:46,217
can't... even...

476
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:50,504
Unbefriended and uninsured.

477
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,390
- Yes.
- But you understand

478
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,120
I have a patient like Sunflower

479
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:57,528
on every floor of this hospital.

480
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,497
This is exactly the kind of
case that's bankrupting Chastain.

481
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,684
Sunflower has a brain bleed, and
his symptoms are getting worse.

482
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,380
Well, it could be sundowning,
nighttime confusion.

483
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,836
It's common with dementia.

484
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:09,907
It's possible. But I
don't think it's dementia.

485
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:12,509
Well, I... You can't be
sure. This bleed is small.

486
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,995
Well, it could be the
cause of all his symptoms.

487
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:18,165
It could be curable, Dr. Bell.

488
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:23,420
We had a neuro consult,
and he recommended surgery.

489
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,589
Are you going to deny it?

490
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,574
Look at this man.

491
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,728
He was found in Piedmont
Park, wearing sweats.

492
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:34,564
If he was jogging, had a fall,

493
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,883
that could explain why
he had no wallet or ID.

494
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,897
There is no police report,
no missing persons file.

495
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,716
Yeah, he could
be from out of town.

496
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,890
Even if he's homeless...
what does it matter?

497
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:46,277
Pravesh, a hand!

498
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,261
What about the
health of this hospital?

499
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:54,418
We can't keep doing this.

500
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,537
Chastain is on the
brink of a disaster.

501
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:59,290
I need to save it, too.

502
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,968
Just stay with him
for five minutes.

503
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,126
That's all I'm asking.

504
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:06,797
See the human being and
not the numbers this time.

505
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:20,894
Want to...

506
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,598
beg... beg...

507
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,600
What are you trying to say?

508
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:29,653
This... awful.

509
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,322
I...

510
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:34,241
I-I-I can't even...

511
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,326
You can't... what?

512
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,532
Help.

513
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,634
Wait. What's that...
What is that for?

514
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:25,358
That's to start an IV, Dad.

515
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,662
My-my-my... my mouth is so dry.

516
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:31,982
Can you give us a second?

517
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,336
We have an excellent
transplant team.

518
00:27:36,371 --> 00:27:38,639
Great doctors, great staff.

519
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:43,009
Brave is not my resting state.

520
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:48,065
You're gonna come
out of this just fine.

521
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,717
And for the rest of your life,
you are going to be happy

522
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,672
that you did this,
I promise you.

523
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,441
For Jessie.

524
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,907
I was leaving for the day and
I saw this guy breaking into

525
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,332
a car. Says he's a
friend of a doctor here,

526
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:07,418
but nobody has
this amount of drugs

527
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:10,003
unless they're dealing
or using or both.

528
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:12,038
Who is this registered to?

529
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:17,844
Shira Smook?

530
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,564
Hey, man, come on.

531
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,722
I forgot my phone.

532
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,541
Shira, you all right?

533
00:28:47,576 --> 00:28:49,559
Yeah.

534
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,512
Just tired.

535
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:53,796
I'll get a coffee.

536
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,682
I've been working long hours.

537
00:28:55,717 --> 00:28:57,734
All good.

538
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,205
Hey.

539
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,672
Dad.

540
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:23,726
D-Dad, thank you.

541
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,546
Thank you.

542
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:27,563
Nothing I'd rather do,

543
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,582
no place I'd rather be.

544
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,669
You're my baby girl.

545
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:39,893
I'll s... I'll see you in
a few hours, okay?

546
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:43,196
Yeah. Yeah.

547
00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:49,915
Nic? Nic, there's something
that I really need to tell you,

548
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:52,166
s-something I should have
told you a long time ago.

549
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,851
You can tell me
on the other side.

550
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,804
- No, no, sweetheart,
this is important.
- Dad.

551
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:58,162
It's gonna be okay.

552
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,280
Hello there, Mr. Nevin.

553
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:01,865
I'm Dr. Shira Smook.

554
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,940
I will be your
anesthesiologist tonight.

555
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,635
They're about to ligate

556
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,687
the vessels and
remove the kidney.

557
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,451
- Dr. Bell?
- Yeah?

558
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:40,487
We have a problem.

559
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,359
<i>I've been working long hours.</i>

560
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:48,579
<i>You promised me.</i>

561
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:51,614
<i>I'll meet you in the
parking lot in an hour.</i>

562
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:55,652
OR One.

563
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,753
Mm-hmm.

564
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:01,642
The recipient is open and
ready to receive the donor kidney.

565
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:03,693
Ten-blade to me.

566
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,513
Time to give this kidney...

567
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:09,432
a new home.

568
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,407
What the hell?

569
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,742
Lap pads. Suction.

570
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:21,245
We lost his airway. IV's out.

571
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,480
Oh, my God, he cut an artery.

572
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,685
She's not breathing!

573
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,631
Call a code! Start
bagging Shira!

574
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,973
Get another anesthesiologist!

575
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:39,062
He's crashing! Jump
in. My hands are full.

576
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,642
Tubes and lines are all pulled.

577
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,077
I'll re-intubate.

578
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,061
His airway's full
of blood. Suction!

579
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:53,026
He can't go much
longer without oxygen.

580
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:54,822
It's too swollen. I
can't get the tube in.

581
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,364
Sats are 60 and
dropping. He's gonna code.

582
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:58,826
We need to do a
cric. It's the only way.

583
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,235
Betadine. Give me that.

584
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:06,172
- Ten-blade.
- Okay.

585
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,947
- Trach tube?
- Got it.

586
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,116
In.

587
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,018
Ah, got it.

588
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:23,924
Thank you.

589
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,309
- Done.
- All right, we're in.

590
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:28,962
All right.

591
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:31,848
Come on, Dad.

592
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,850
Come on, come on, come on.

593
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:40,607
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

594
00:32:40,642 --> 00:32:42,993
Oxygen levels
are still really low.

595
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,981
Bilateral breath
sounds. Tube is in place.

596
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:53,620
His sats are climbing.

597
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:56,990
- What happened?
- Shira collapsed.

598
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,437
Let's load her on a gurney
and we'll take her to the ER.

599
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,000
What the hell is that?

600
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,519
An IV port.

601
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,304
She's an addict.

602
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:15,809
That's her... Dr. Smook.
What-what the hell happened?

603
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:17,477
She OD'd in the OR.

604
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:20,346
Tell the ER we're
gonna need Narcan!

605
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:26,153
Can we proceed with
harvesting the kidney?

606
00:33:26,188 --> 00:33:28,633
The risk is higher, but the
bleed is stopped. Are you sure?

607
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:31,001
Because he's been through
a lot. If we get him to the ICU,

608
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:32,570
he could fully recover
before we move on.

609
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,712
But Kyle is currently
stable. Airway is secure.

610
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,525
- BP is holding.
- Jessie's window
for a kidney is closing.

611
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:40,950
Her best shot is
now. I say we go on.

612
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,923
Okay.

613
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:50,710
Administering Narcan.

614
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,898
Come on, come on, come on.

615
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,321
Wh-Where the hell am I?

616
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:02,606
You can't do this.

617
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,775
I'm a doctor.

618
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:09,846
- What... You OD'd in the OR
in the middle of surgery and you

619
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:13,150
- almost killed a patient.
Let me go, get away from me!

620
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,338
Thank you for covering for me

621
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:20,468
while I was stuck in
the other OR, Dr. Austin.

622
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:23,710
Looks good. Stand by
to reperfuse the kidney.

623
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:25,407
How's it going?

624
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,881
So far, so good.

625
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:30,617
They're about to see if
Jessie's new kidney works.

626
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,531
Unclamping.

627
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:39,320
- She's in V-tach.
- Get the defibrillator.

628
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:41,445
- Give 300 of amio.
- BP is dropping.

629
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,400
Okay, reclamp
until she stabilizes.

630
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:47,850
Charge to 120.

631
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:52,355
Clear.

632
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,278
Charge at 200.

633
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,248
- Clear.
- Her heart is too weak.

634
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,718
V-fib. We need to get that
rhythm under control now.

635
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:06,063
We're at max
joules. Charge again.

636
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:07,203
Clear.

637
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:16,073
- Okay. Sinus tach.
- All right, that's what
I like to see.

638
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:19,850
Let's unclamp these
vessels and, uh, try this again.

639
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:23,603
Unclamping again.

640
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,123
Rhythm's holding steady.

641
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:35,065
All right, it's showtime, baby.

642
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,538
Ah.<i> That</i> is a beautiful thing.

643
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,891
It's urine.

644
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,162
The new kidney is
working like a champ.

645
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,445
Her heart took a beating,
so she's still not in the clear.

646
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:56,619
But...

647
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,371
this is good.

648
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,855
Hey.

649
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,201
Hey.

650
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:20,794
Devon told me you
okayed the surgery

651
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:23,246
on our unbefriended patient.

652
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:25,581
And good on you.

653
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:28,534
Yeah, well, it's gonna go in
the red column for Chastain.

654
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,570
That column is
already very long.

655
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,389
Why did you do it?

656
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:42,348
I saw myself in him.

657
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:54,210
I should probably let you know

658
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,279
I'm... I'm back with
my ex-husband.

659
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,583
Oh, um...

660
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,402
Okay.

661
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:06,039
But I care about you
and I believe in you.

662
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:09,375
Nurture the man
I see right here.

663
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,845
Well, I will...

664
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,897
if I can.

665
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:39,956
Any change?

666
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,590
The same.

667
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:48,164
I still can't believe
all this happened.

668
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,902
Nic.

669
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,553
Take a break, get some air.

670
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:56,305
I'll keep watch.

671
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:59,993
I promise I'll page you
if anything changes.

672
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,329
Thanks.

673
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,525
I discharged Micah.

674
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,605
He's in fine health.

675
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:35,744
Great.

676
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:38,965
Good news.

677
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:45,154
What have we got next?

678
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,823
Lung biopsy.

679
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,993
Cool.

680
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,641
Hi.

681
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,176
I'm Dr. Pravesh.

682
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,694
You just had surgery.

683
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,129
It went very well.

684
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:11,530
Do you know where you are?

685
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:20,423
You're at Chastain
Park Memorial Hospital.

686
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,692
And we've been
taking care of you.

687
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,444
Can you tell us your name?

688
00:39:32,354 --> 00:39:33,903
George.

689
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:39,075
Wilson.

690
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,060
George Wilson.

691
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:43,357
Well, it's nice to meet you.

692
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,932
Is there someone we can
call for you, Mr. Wilson?

693
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,252
To let them know where you are?

694
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:00,229
M...

695
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:07,619
My wife.

696
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,363
For the record,

697
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:19,148
Dr. Smook was not our fault.

698
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,994
I've learned the medical
board of Pennsylvania pulled

699
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,930
her license for drug
abuse, so she moved here.

700
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,303
Doctor's records don't travel.

701
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,472
They can lose their
license in one state

702
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,890
and just move to another.

703
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,392
I know.

704
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,821
You are fortunate
that your original pitch

705
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,478
was so well received.

706
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,060
Red Rock Mountain is still
willing to move forward...

707
00:40:36,084 --> 00:40:39,134
with some conditions.

708
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:47,409
Well, I remain as CEO,
that's nonnegotiable.

709
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,096
Agreed. But your
authority would be curtailed.

710
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:53,132
All administrative decisions

711
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,862
about the running of
the hospital would shift

712
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,403
to Red Rock Mountain Medical.

713
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:59,138
Your signature, please.

714
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:13,286
I have to read this, I have
to consider it carefully.

715
00:41:13,321 --> 00:41:17,073
No, you don't. There's
nothing left to consider, Dr. Bell.
