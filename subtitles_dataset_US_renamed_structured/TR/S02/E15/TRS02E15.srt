1
00:00:01,285 --> 00:00:03,669
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- I am not interested

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,788
in being in your line

3
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:07,583
of giants. I am the first

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,824
of my own line. An ancestor.

5
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:11,993
Not your descendant.

6
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:14,580
His seizures are
getting harder to control.

7
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,309
- So what do I do now?
<i>- The VNS</i>

8
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,967
is the best option
available to your son.

9
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:22,337
It was my responsibility
to look after my sisters.

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,240
One night I decided
to take a quick nap,

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,488
and when I woke up, the
whole house was on fire.

12
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:30,695
Dr. Mina Okafor,
will you marry me?

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,080
I know this is a
scary diagnosis.

14
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,921
Triple-negative breast
cancer is aggressive

15
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,773
and difficult to treat.

16
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,109
It's also more common
in Nigerian women,

17
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:47,195
and far more often, it's fatal.

18
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,948
Particularly in
those who, like you,

19
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:52,934
carry the BRCA gene mutation.

20
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,938
But, Adaku, in this
case, we found it early.

21
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,260
After what happened to my
mother and my grandmother,

22
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,112
I knew this might happen to me.

23
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,765
But...

24
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:10,218
A cure is possible with
aggressive treatment.

25
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:13,722
At minimum, you'll need a
lumpectomy, chemo and radiation.

26
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:16,274
But given your family history,

27
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,793
I strongly recommend
a double mastectomy.

28
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,630
Mm. I don't want to do that.

29
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,548
It's the only safe option.

30
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,417
- I won't be maimed.
- We have

31
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,229
great reconstructive
surgery these days.

32
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,071
I'll do surgery to remove
the tumor, chemo,

33
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:32,157
radiation, whatever
you recommend,

34
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,072
but you're not
taking my breasts.

35
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:40,132
I'll let you talk it
over with Mina.

36
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:44,263
You will get through this.

37
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:47,339
<i>We</i> will get through this.

38
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,158
I'm 28. I might die even younger

39
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,921
than my mother
and my grandmother.

40
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,111
They lived in Nigeria,

41
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,507
had limited access
to health care.

42
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,830
You are an American

43
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,100
and will benefit from
American medicine.

44
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,462
You have a real
chance of beating this

45
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,530
if you are aggressive.

46
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,631
I don't want to talk about that.

47
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,155
- But, Adaku...
- It's my decision, Mina.

48
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:13,798
I'm going to get you

49
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,252
the best breast
cancer surgeon I know.

50
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:20,122
A fellow Nigerian
who is experienced

51
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:22,207
with this form of
aggressive cancer.

52
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,961
Do you mean who
I think you mean?

53
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,169
Thank you.

54
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,171
Of course.

55
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,225
It's okay.

56
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:46,481
♪ ♪

57
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,659
Come on. Was there a ring?

58
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,589
Did he get on one knee?
Were there witnesses?

59
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,195
Yes, a ring. Yes, one knee.

60
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:04,315
Smattering of applause
from sentimental onlookers.

61
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,718
But you're not wearing a ring.

62
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,720
I haven't made my decision yet.

63
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,421
You love Micah.

64
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,973
You love Conrad.

65
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,176
- You're not getting married.
- True.

66
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:17,328
He asked me to move in
with him, and I freaked out.

67
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,880
Hmm. More later.

68
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:20,910
I have to meet my
friend Adaku's surgeon.

69
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,228
She's arriving any
minute from Nigeria.

70
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:23,368
All right, see you.

71
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,010
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,946
Dr. Josephine Okeke
is coming to Chastain.

73
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,415
Who told you that?

74
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,950
Well, Dr. Bell organized
a welcoming committee,

75
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,869
so I jumped at the chance

76
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:42,954
to meet such a
legendary surgeon.

77
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,757
I mean, come on, this woman
single-handedly transformed

78
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,520
the health care
landscape in rural Nigeria.

79
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:51,379
Dr. Okafor, how do you
say, "Welcome to Chastain"

80
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,931
- in Yoruba?
- Dr. Okeke is Ibo.

81
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,200
It's a different language.

82
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,535
And don't do that.

83
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,686
You'll only humiliate yourself.

84
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:00,288
Thank you.

85
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,223
You know her?

86
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,776
Mina asked her here
to operate on a friend,

87
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,374
- a young breast cancer patient.
- She's here because of you?

88
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:09,391
Oh, well then you
have to join us for lunch.

89
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,394
I got us a table at
The Providence Grill.

90
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,235
I think that's her.

91
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,445
That is definitely her.

92
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,965
Dr. Okeke, Randolph Bell.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,400
Oh. Lovely to
meet you, Dr. Bell.

94
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,802
CEO here at Chastain.

95
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,957
- I'm so happy to have the ch...
- One moment.

96
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,824
Embrace me!

97
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,578
Lovely to see you, Mina, dear.

98
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,097
Aw...

99
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,567
Hello...

100
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:46,968
Mother.

101
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:54,693
What happened to your hair?

102
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,279
Oh...

103
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,697
Good morning.

104
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,117
I'm Dr. Pravesh.
Milo Trainor, right?

105
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:05,636
- How are you feeling?
- Not good, lot to pain.

106
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,522
- Let me take a look.
- Okay.

107
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,023
When did it start?

108
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,109
Yesterday, while I was working.

109
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,172
But it didn't get bad
until this morning.

110
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:14,774
- What line of work are you in?
- Ethics.

111
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:17,165
- I'm an ethicist.
- An ethicist?

112
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,185
Sounds like you found a job that
pays worse than my residency.

113
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,054
Well, technically,
I'm unemployed

114
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,068
while I finish my dissertation
on moral relativism.

115
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,342
Looks like you've been
on top of your health.

116
00:05:27,377 --> 00:05:30,445
Only one surgery,
appendectomy five years ago.

117
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,396
Any vomiting?

118
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,577
- Earlier this morning.
- Uh, lift up your shirt for me.

119
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,584
- Yeah.
- Hundley?

120
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:40,988
Mild hydro in the right kidney.

121
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:43,024
I'm thinking you
have kidney stones,

122
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,744
- my philosophizing friend.
- Is that bad?

123
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,696
Not typically. Just painful.

124
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,491
We'll get you on IV
fluids and medication

125
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,249
for the pain and nausea,

126
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,035
and let's hope we can get
these stones to pass soon, okay?

127
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,091
Josephine Okeke is your mother?

128
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,737
Yes, and please
keep that to yourself.

129
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,356
I've got to get her
in and out of here

130
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,812
as fast as humanly possible.

131
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:07,832
Why? The woman is world-famous.

132
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,018
You call her in to
operate on your friend,

133
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:13,254
and you don't want anybody
to know you're related?

134
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,689
Your flight was good?

135
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:19,277
Oh, it was fine, until
Dr. Michaels from the CDC

136
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,697
bribed the flight attendant
to switch seats so he could be

137
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,260
right next to me.

138
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,295
Oh, he wouldn't stop talking.

139
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,105
He wanted to know all about the
hospital I'm building in Gombe...

140
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,890
200 beds...

141
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,624
The biggest in Eastern Nigeria.

142
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,627
Well, I hope you
get a chance to tour

143
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,362
our state-of-the-art cancer
wing while you're here.

144
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,134
Wherever the great Dr. Randolph
Bell leads, I will follow.

145
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,753
Please.

146
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,561
So, the great truth-teller lied.

147
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,374
You said you were an ancestor.

148
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:58,432
But, Mina, you are a
descendent of medical royalty.

149
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,869
My mother is my
mother, and yet she is not.

150
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:02,920
Excuse me.

151
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,903
So, this is Henry,
only eight years old,

152
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,944
and Henry's epilepsy
interrupted his schoolwork,

153
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,893
his baseball games,
his time with friends.

154
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:17,218
He suffered from
violent seizures daily,

155
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:20,922
until we implanted the
QuoVadis vagus nerve stimulator.

156
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:25,059
And now, Henry's seizures
are nearly nonexistent.

157
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:27,106
He's back to school,
he's playing baseball,

158
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,680
he's with his friends.

159
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,911
And what was once a
pipe dream is now a reality.

160
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:34,519
- A cure for epilepsy?
- Can you imagine?

161
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,605
I mean, the potential of this
QuoVadis device is unlimited.

162
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,371
All right, hold still
for just a second.

163
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,490
So, how's baseball going?

164
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:45,675
I got a triple last week.

165
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,917
Oh, nice.

166
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:51,519
So tell me, what's going on?

167
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,988
Nothing.

168
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:56,708
Mom's being the worst.

169
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,522
- The worst, huh?
- She thinks I'm having
seizures again,

170
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,507
- but I'm not.
- Hey, how'd you get that bruise?

171
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:05,111
- Slide into third?
- I fell.

172
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:06,801
At school.

173
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,506
Okay, bud. Let us talk
to your mom for a minute.

174
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,541
Be right back.

175
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,292
What's going on?

176
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,294
I thought the VNS would
get rid of his seizures.

177
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:23,462
The best-case scenario
was always a reduction

178
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,236
in the number and severity.

179
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,635
So far, no VNS
device is a cure-all.

180
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:30,470
And considering
how things started

181
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:32,843
for Henry, it's
worked really well.

182
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,046
I'll bring in Henry's
pediatric neurologist,

183
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,875
Dr. Eckart, and
we'll run some tests.

184
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,218
Uh, this sounds like it
might take a bit to figure out.

185
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,014
I-I've got to go to
work. I'll check in later.

186
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,689
- Go. Thank you.
- Yeah.

187
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,577
We just started dating.

188
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,047
Henry's condition
is a lot to take in.

189
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,600
Look, Zoey... I'm sorry,
but we have to ask.

190
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,603
There's a... there's a
nasty bruise on Henry's arm.

191
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,166
There's no way that
Doug would ever...

192
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,523
No. Absolutely not.

193
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:05,727
Okay. Well, let's see how
things go with the EEG.

194
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,762
We'll figure this out.

195
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,789
So this is where you
chose to do your residency?

196
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,458
I was just at Oxford,
and it's like suites

197
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:25,380
at the Hotel Cardova in Positano
in comparison to this dump.

198
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,299
Thank you for coming
on short notice, Mother.

199
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,718
Oh.

200
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,920
After four years
of cutting me dead,

201
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,690
I'm still shocked you called me.

202
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:38,959
I want the best for
Adaku. That is you.

203
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,279
Well, I'm touched you admit it.

204
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,514
I never denied it.

205
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:49,782
A decent-sized mass.

206
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:52,457
- Any sign of distant spread?
- No.

207
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,743
But Adaku has multifocal
DCIS in the other breast

208
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,378
and the BRCA1 gene mutation.

209
00:09:57,414 --> 00:10:00,648
This took her mother at 39
and her grandmother at 38.

210
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,784
Did you set up a
gyn-onc consult?

211
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,002
Yes, but one step at a time.

212
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,221
We have to deal
with the breasts first.

213
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:09,323
Considering all the factors,

214
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,576
she will need a
double mastectomy.

215
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,180
I agree, and so
does her oncologist,

216
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:18,316
but so far, she's refusing.

217
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,929
Well, have you
talked to her about it?

218
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,319
Of course.

219
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,954
Ah, that's the problem.

220
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,526
Let me guess... You
gave her every statistic,

221
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,344
but without diplomacy,

222
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,397
tact and compassion.

223
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,868
Patients need warmth, Mina.

224
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:40,120
But it's all right.

225
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,007
I'm here.

226
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:52,449
BP 88/45.

227
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,862
- Heart rate, 120.
- How's the pain?

228
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,114
Worse. Lots worse.

229
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:56,615
You said kidney stones.
What did his UA show?

230
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,140
Only a few RBCs
but otherwise clean.

231
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,328
Okay, okay.

232
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,463
Abdominal pain is new.

233
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,793
He only had flank pain before.

234
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,711
He's septic. Five dollars
says it's an appendicitis.

235
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,963
Pay up. He had an
appendectomy five years ago.

236
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:13,805
- He needs a CT, now.
- He's already critical.

237
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,490
I'll give them a call, get
him to the front of the line.

238
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,580
VNS is functional.

239
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,850
And...

240
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,980
Henry's EEG looks good.

241
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:29,481
No seizures since
he's been here.

242
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:30,722
Oh, thank God.

243
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,652
But how do you
explain the falls?

244
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:34,526
I trip, that's all.

245
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,344
They weren't seizures, I swear.

246
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,340
Let's keep him here for
the day for observation,

247
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,764
just to be safe.

248
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:48,372
Everything okay?

249
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:50,842
My boss.

250
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,560
Big presentation today.
Promised I'd be there.

251
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,664
I am pretty sure he'll fire
me if I miss another day,

252
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,332
but I can't leave Henry.

253
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:01,069
The hospital can provide a
sitter until you come back.

254
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,905
Yeah, and Conrad and I can
check on him as much as possible.

255
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,439
I'll be fine, Mom.

256
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,341
Go, Zoey.

257
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,076
We got this.

258
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,998
Okay.

259
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:30,965
What the...?

260
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,762
Hope you haven't
spent that fiver,

261
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,120
because that would be
an appendix right there.

262
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:36,720
That's impossible.

263
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,717
Dr. Kays did an appendectomy
on Milo five years ago.

264
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,291
Well, someone screwed up.

265
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,077
Because that's an
inflamed appendix.

266
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:45,725
We need to get
him to surgery now

267
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:48,098
- before it ruptures.
- Good idea.

268
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,497
Thank you so much
for coming to see me.

269
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,071
Oh, I was so happy to
get my daughter's call.

270
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,724
It's the first time she's
ever asked for my help,

271
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,344
which means you
must be very special.

272
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,961
Now, as you know,

273
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:04,782
Mina is, um, a
woman of few words.

274
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,817
And I'm sure
you love her for it,

275
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,120
but I am just the opposite.

276
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,472
I love to have a good chat.

277
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:15,159
And unlike most surgeons,
I talk to my patients.

278
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:20,448
I want to know

279
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:23,317
what is uppermost in your mind.

280
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,837
I'm terrified.

281
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,421
Of course you are.

282
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:29,090
It's only natural.

283
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,959
I watched this happen to my mom.

284
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:35,096
I saw how she suffered
and I saw how she died.

285
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:38,349
A tragedy, for her and for you.

286
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,386
Every daughter needs her mother,

287
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:45,506
and you were robbed of
her love and her support.

288
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,392
A crushing loss.

289
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:52,062
Daughters need their
mother, don't they, Mina?

290
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,300
I want to have a child soon.

291
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,852
And I want to nurse my baby.

292
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,038
And then, if necessary, I'll
have the double mastectomy.

293
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,041
And I wish your mother were here

294
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,794
to see this baby
of yours, don't you?

295
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:08,445
Yes.

296
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,233
I miss her so much.

297
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,920
The last time I saw her
was right after her surgery.

298
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,973
And the scars were awful
and she died a week later.

299
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,020
The doctor maimed
her and it did no good.

300
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:22,677
Because it was too late, Adaku.

301
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:24,345
But I'm younger. I have time.

302
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,066
And what good would
it do your future baby

303
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:31,151
for you to leave her early

304
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:33,437
the way your mom left you?

305
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,056
Hmm?

306
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:43,175
You saw a part of your
mother's womanhood destroyed

307
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,200
and still she lost her life.

308
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:49,119
But that doesn't
have to be your story.

309
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:52,740
Adaku.

310
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:57,428
We have to act immediately,

311
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:01,849
and you have to
trust me to give you

312
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,417
the best chance to live,

313
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:06,888
for you and your future family.

314
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,659
Hmm?

315
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:17,915
Schedule the surgery, Mina.

316
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,904
I have a lot to teach
you if you'd ever listen.

317
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:26,640
- I listened, and...
- You're welcome.

318
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,468
Hey, buddy.

319
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,115
Taking a break
from all those tests?

320
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,590
Dr. Eckart said I
could for a little while.

321
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,820
- I'm sick of being
in the hospital.
- I know.

322
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,789
I can sit with Henry
for a little while.

323
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,179
Thanks.

324
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,501
Purple, that's my favorite.

325
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,253
- Mine too.
- Yeah?

326
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,489
Well, you look like
you're feeling a bit better.

327
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,660
How are things at home, Henry?

328
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:08,833
Are you and Conrad
gonna get married?

329
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:12,470
Uh...

330
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,755
That's a good question.

331
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,039
- I don't know.
- Don't you love him?

332
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,860
Yeah. Yeah, I do. Very much.

333
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,046
- But...
- I thought maybe...

334
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:25,365
he'd marry my mom.

335
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,202
But... now she has Doug.

336
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,904
I wish Conrad was my dad.

337
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,646
Buddy, that's another
bruise since this morning.

338
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,448
How did you get that?

339
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:42,883
I don't know.

340
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,202
It's okay. Don't worry.

341
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,071
We'll figure it out.

342
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,531
<i>I heard there was an issue</i>

343
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,416
with our VNS poster
child, Henry Barnett.

344
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,190
Has he been admitted?

345
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,586
<i>Yeah. Uh...</i>

346
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,538
he was brought in
with a possible seizure,

347
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,829
a minor seizure.

348
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,542
<i>We are getting ready
to take our stock public.</i>

349
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,766
- I'm well aware.
<i>- The VNS is being</i>

350
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,001
featured at the Innovation
Summit tomorrow.

351
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,117
If any issue comes
up, I want it handled.

352
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,272
<i>Quietly.</i>

353
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,608
Obviously, our first concern

354
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,844
is the child's welfare.

355
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,716
B-But we will be as
discrete as possible.

356
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,662
You paged me?

357
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,014
My patient is still hypotensive.

358
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,582
Are you sure that you got out

359
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,045
all the infection
during surgery?

360
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,302
Yeah, well, he perforated,

361
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,115
so it took me an extra
20 minutes to lavage

362
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,950
his abdominal
cavity, all because

363
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,307
you caught this so late.

364
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,025
A ruptured appendix, Pravesh.

365
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,538
It's kindergarten stuff, the
janitor could've caught it.

366
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:01,123
- Yeah, but his record said...
- Do not

367
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,681
give me your excuses.

368
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,684
The patient could've died.

369
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,921
<i>In Nigeria, it is not uncommon</i>

370
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,973
that the first time a
woman is seen in a clinic,

371
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:21,115
she already has
stage IV breast cancer.

372
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,500
I have seen tumors
the size of tangerines.

373
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,503
And the reason they come so late

374
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,972
is because of social
pressures? Lack of education?

375
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,402
Oh, no, no. No access to
health care or screenings.

376
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:32,776
Not until I started my clinic.

377
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,895
I mean, it was a battle
from the beginning,

378
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:36,797
but change is never easy.

379
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,684
You push, you nudge
and if necessary, you fight.

380
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,248
You're such an inspiration.

381
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:44,738
We need more doctors
like you here at Chastain.

382
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:47,174
Oh, no, my dear.
I have no interest.

383
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,626
I'll stay in Nigeria, my home.

384
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,612
We have too few doctors there

385
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:54,999
and that is why it's such a
shame that Mina came here.

386
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,012
Well, we're awfully
glad that she did.

387
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,530
Indeed we are.

388
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,965
Dr. Okafor, have you
ever thought about

389
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:02,000
going back to Nigeria to help
your mother with her work?

390
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:05,759
- No.
- You see...

391
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:08,195
having a successful
parent is difficult for children.

392
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,098
They have to chart
their own course.

393
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:14,218
That is not the issue.

394
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:17,638
I believe I know what
Mina is referring to.

395
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,808
You see, my daughter
was a med student in Lagos

396
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,294
and she was a good student.

397
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,630
She showed promise.

398
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,114
And then something happened

399
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,827
that caused her
to leave her family,

400
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:30,384
her home, her country,

401
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,131
and never come back.

402
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:35,889
It was a family matter
seldom spoken about

403
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,091
that caused us all
the greatest pain.

404
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,863
So... the clinics in Gombe...

405
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:44,916
- How many...
- I take it you have not

406
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,000
discussed this with
your colleagues.

407
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,485
Mother.

408
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,088
This lunch is about you, not me.

409
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,391
I think you'll be kind
enough to respect my privacy.

410
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,678
Excuse me.

411
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,415
This has been lovely
but I have to get back.

412
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,351
- No, Mina.
- No.

413
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,493
Thank you so much, Dr. Bell.

414
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,446
Few things are as rewarding

415
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,892
as spending time
with colleagues.

416
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,499
My pleasure, Dr. Okeke.

417
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,450
Oh, please call me Josephine.

418
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,287
Thank you again.

419
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:42,123
I thought you had to get back.

420
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,808
Obviously, we need
to talk in private.

421
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:52,232
- How dare you.
- How dare I?

422
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:55,535
You walk out of a luncheon
to honor me and embarrass me

423
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,971
in front of your colleagues,

424
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,802
but you embarrassed
yourself more

425
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,492
because they respect me.

426
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,445
You are worthy of
respect, as a doctor.

427
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,831
Oh, but I'm not worthy
of respect as a mother?

428
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,650
Oh, I know what's
behind this attitude.

429
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,970
I know it all too well.

430
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,606
You blame me.

431
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:19,226
You blame me for the fire.

432
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:22,146
I blame myself, and our
problems long predate that tragedy.

433
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,614
Oh, I know.

434
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,283
I work too long.
I work too late.

435
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,019
I should've been home.
I am a bad mother.

436
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:32,339
That is why your sisters
died. That is what you think.

437
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,808
Do not presume to know my mind.

438
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:41,949
We can find common
ground in the OR.

439
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:44,502
There is no reason to bring
our personal lives and the past

440
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,121
- into my workplace.
- Oh, please.

441
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:48,755
If there is any chance of this

442
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,008
coming up again,
our relationship,

443
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,445
both professional
and personal, is over.

444
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,696
Is that clear?

445
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,406
Your sisters adored me.

446
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:12,363
They adored me. We
were inseparable, but you...

447
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,215
you never liked me.

448
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,585
Never.

449
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,170
He's still hypotensive.

450
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:38,973
IVC looks good.

451
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:40,474
Increase his norepinephrine.

452
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,759
Let's hope he responds.

453
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:48,382
I need his full history to
figure out what's going on,

454
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:50,017
and I don't trust that chart.

455
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:51,780
Should we call his
emergency contact?

456
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,021
See what his... brother

457
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:57,407
- could tell us?
- Please.

458
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,363
Brent Trainor.
There's the number.

459
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:16,977
Hello?

460
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:20,776
We called the
patient's cell phone?

461
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,018
Or he has his brother's phone.

462
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:26,220
Who does that?

463
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:27,783
Wait, you said his
name was Brent, right?

464
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,239
Yeah.

465
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:32,125
Hold on, here.

466
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,220
Mina and I have never
been in the OR together.

467
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:01,271
Strange, isn't it?

468
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,175
Residents beg to scrub
in with me on a daily basis.

469
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,426
Well, then this must
be a great moment

470
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,112
for both of you then, right?

471
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,846
I am praying for the
best outcome for Adaku,

472
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,938
our patient.

473
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,608
We'll be using electrocautery.

474
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:23,526
Set up the Bovie, please.

475
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,591
I prefer to use radio
frequency instruments

476
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:27,864
for maximum precision.

477
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,820
Cautery is what I used
for a crowned princess.

478
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:32,203
Good enough for royalty,

479
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,354
good enough for your friend.

480
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,007
Bovie.

481
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:09,706
You have incredible
hand dexterity, Dr. Okeke.

482
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,575
The field is
practically bloodless.

483
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,412
Well, I've been working on
my technique for decades.

484
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,165
It minimizes
post-op complication

485
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,001
and reduces patient
recovery time.

486
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,557
Here we go. What do you got?

487
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:29,910
No! No!

488
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,729
- Let's play again.
- Yeah.

489
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,030
All right.

490
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,028
I can tell you're
scared of something,

491
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:38,280
but I don't know exactly what.

492
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,553
Will you help me understand?

493
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,573
I'm fine.

494
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:47,244
I think you might've had another
episode since you've been here.

495
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,496
If that's it,

496
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:51,665
you don't have to
be afraid to tell me.

497
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
I'm on your side no matter what.

498
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:55,953
Don't tell my mom, okay?

499
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:03,009
She wants what's best for you.

500
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:05,212
She's on your side,
too, you know that.

501
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:06,880
Yeah.

502
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,283
It's not that.

503
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:16,089
My dad left when I
got sick the first time.

504
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:19,276
- Mm-hmm.
- My mom really likes Doug,

505
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,062
but if I get sick again,

506
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:24,398
I think he'll
probably leave, too.

507
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:27,952
She's lonely. She needs him.

508
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:31,538
Doug and your
mom... they're new.

509
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:34,291
Still figuring things out.

510
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:38,996
It's not your
fault your dad left.

511
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,665
You know that?

512
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,417
I miss him.

513
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:47,220
But I also know he misses
you and he loves you, too.

514
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:49,689
Sometimes people just
have a hard time showing it.

515
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,628
Especially dads.

516
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,817
So...

517
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:04,788
you're falling down,
okay? What happens next?

518
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,190
I don't know.

519
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:09,576
It just happens all of a sudden,
then I wake up on the floor.

520
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:10,777
Mm-hmm.

521
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,979
It's not like my other seizures.

522
00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:14,865
Okay, when did it start?

523
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,285
- Last week.
- How many times?

524
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,337
Four, maybe.

525
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:25,376
Yes!

526
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,044
Finally get a win over you.

527
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,963
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on.

528
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:32,349
No!

529
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,756
Hmm.

530
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,229
How is Dr. Okeke doing?

531
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:50,033
Fine surgeon. Truly gifted.

532
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,152
Problematic human.

533
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,166
I don't know what
you're talking about.

534
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,335
- I found her utterly charming.
- That's because

535
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,959
she flattered you.

536
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:01,495
Common technique
amongst charming people.

537
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,547
I hate charming people.

538
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,083
Their main goal is to
make you like them.

539
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,079
They're narcissists, and
once you see through them,

540
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,703
the charm disappears,

541
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:12,873
they cut you and then they
move on to the next conquest.

542
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:16,092
That was a mouthful.

543
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,572
Is this about what
happened at lunch?

544
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:21,648
- Partly.
- Retract.

545
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:23,767
Suction.

546
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,520
Not like that!

547
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:29,722
Good God, what have
they taught you in America?

548
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:32,838
What is it? What?

549
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:36,029
- You'll need the scalpel to...
- When I ask!

550
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,455
I did not expect that.

551
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:51,945
So I called Milo's
emergency contact

552
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,197
and I finally got his
medical information.

553
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,466
He has rheumatoid arthritis.

554
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,296
That doesn't explain
any of the complications.

555
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,264
Well, we inadvertently
stopped his steroids,

556
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,317
which left his body without
the stress response it needed

557
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,757
to fight the infection.

558
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:07,043
Why wasn't rheumatoid arthritis
noted in his medical records?

559
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,079
Well, let's ask Milo.

560
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,413
Okay.

561
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,534
Milo Trainor?

562
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:17,037
- Dr. Devon Pravesh.
- Nice to meet you.

563
00:29:17,072 --> 00:29:18,666
Thank you so much
for coming down.

564
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,207
We're so glad that we found you.

565
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:22,162
Dr. Feldman,
this is our patient's

566
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:25,913
identical twin
brother, the real Milo.

567
00:29:25,948 --> 00:29:29,098
We've been looking at his
records all day because Brent

568
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:32,752
told us that he was him.

569
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:41,678
Brent?

570
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,565
Hey, Brent. You okay?

571
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,485
You stole my insurance
card, man. Not cool.

572
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,320
I always wanted a twin.

573
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,574
Oof, two Irvings?
Terrifying idea.

574
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:56,493
My mom would be happy.

575
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,579
I'm sorry. Brent has so much

576
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:01,080
student debt and
no health insurance.

577
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:03,367
I'm sure it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

578
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:06,420
You almost died, my
philosophical friend.

579
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:08,539
Rule number one if
you want to stay alive:

580
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,723
don't lie to your doctor.

581
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,635
Hey, girl.

582
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,969
Hey.

583
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,473
The surgery went well.

584
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:28,809
The reconstructive
surgeon and then

585
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,164
Dr. Osder will be in tomorrow
to talk about next steps.

586
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,600
Oh...

587
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,023
I feel like less of a woman.

588
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,359
You're a warrior, Adaku.

589
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,680
And from now on,

590
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,182
you have the scars of a warrior.

591
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,838
Thank you.

592
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,701
And thank you for
bringing your mother here.

593
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:02,025
She was wonderful.

594
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,210
She did an excellent job.

595
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,830
I can attest to that.

596
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,266
Her skills will make
your recovery far easier

597
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,734
and the outcome better.

598
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:13,953
You're awake.

599
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:17,074
Oh, Mina,

600
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:21,161
why didn't you page me?

601
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:24,448
I am so grateful that you
came all this way to help me.

602
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,283
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

603
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,272
Oh... don't mention it.

604
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:37,527
It was my pleasure,

605
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,397
and you did great.

606
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:46,036
You realize what Brent
did is insurance fraud.

607
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,798
If you don't report it, you
could lose your license.

608
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,784
- What'll happen to Brent?
- Worst case,

609
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:51,219
the insurance company
presses charges.

610
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,321
He pays the fines
and a whopper of a bill.

611
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,239
I don't think
he'll get jail time.

612
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:58,899
But he'll be ruined. In
debt for years to come.

613
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,711
- Yep.
- Dr. Pravesh.

614
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:03,236
You said there was a billing
error with, uh, Milo Trainor?

615
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:06,155
You called me up
here from billing.

616
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:09,276
It's your lucky day. I'm here.

617
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:13,880
Nadine, do you ever
believe sometimes,

618
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:15,326
especially when
someone is starting out,

619
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,752
they shouldn't be saddled
with enormous debt?

620
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:20,921
Hmm. Above my pay grade.

621
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:22,951
But everyone deserves
a break sometimes, right?

622
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,836
- Can we agree to that?
- If I believed that,

623
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,844
I'd be sipping a caramel latte
outside on a bench right now.

624
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:31,231
Well, then, here
is five dollars.

625
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:33,850
Go get yourself
that caramel latte.

626
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,486
Well, what about
the billing error?

627
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:41,024
It turns out it
was a false alarm.

628
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,587
A glitch in the
medical record system.

629
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:44,161
I can fix it myself.

630
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,279
Sorry you came all the way here.

631
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:47,897
Enjoy that coffee.

632
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,652
We are so grateful
for your visit.

633
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,926
I wish I had more
time to get to know you.

634
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:02,762
I-I also... I want you to
know how much we admire

635
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:05,110
and treasure your daughter.

636
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:07,167
She inherited all your skill.

637
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:11,054
She's a rising star who
will one day outshine us all.

638
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,424
Speak for yourself, Dr. Bell.

639
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,996
Hiding out?

640
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:40,183
From whom?

641
00:33:41,903 --> 00:33:43,603
Everybody.

642
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:47,189
I told you I was adopted, right?

643
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,760
I never met my birth parents.

644
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:52,996
And if I did,

645
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,799
it probably wouldn't be pretty.

646
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,904
Every time I see her...

647
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:05,558
I think it's gonna be different.

648
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:10,830
My dad died years ago, so...

649
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:14,000
when I lost my sisters...

650
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:17,453
I lost the only
family I had left.

651
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,961
My mother...

652
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,914
is not my mother.

653
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,135
Not really.

654
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:40,510
So you came here, you built
your own family at Chastain.

655
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:46,115
Look, we will always
appreciate you.

656
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,502
Always.

657
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:09,984
- You have an update for me?
- The good news is I haven't
been able to detect

658
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:11,769
- any seizure activity.
- So the VNS is working.

659
00:35:11,793 --> 00:35:13,455
-It seems so. The
bad news is -Good.

660
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:14,755
We still don't know
what's causing

661
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,012
these reported drop attacks.

662
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,691
Even though the tests haven't
revealed any abnormal activity,

663
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,476
I'd still like to keep
him here overnight.

664
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,495
- We need answers.
- Well, if he's not
having seizures,

665
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,147
there's no medical reason
to keep him in the hospital.

666
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:24,999
- Thank you.
- Dr. Bell, just a second...

667
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,001
No, I share your concerns, so
stay in touch with the mother,

668
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,919
and we'll bring him
back if we need to.

669
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:31,539
- Dr. Bell...
- Just set a follow-up
appointment for later,

670
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,546
but discharge him.

671
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:38,535
Call me if anything comes up,

672
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,530
even if it's the
middle of the night.

673
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:44,023
- Even if it seems like nothing.
- I will, I promise.

674
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,458
Look at him.

675
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:48,478
He's so happy to be going home.

676
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:52,365
Conrad, you keep
helping us over and over,

677
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,768
and I think maybe
I've been overreacting

678
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:57,453
to every little thing.

679
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,609
But you always
take me seriously.

680
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,241
What happened?

681
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,743
Excuse me.

682
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,568
Henry? Henry?

683
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,970
Lost his pulse.

684
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,149
Call the code team, I'm
starting compressions.

685
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,740
Oh, my God!

686
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:19,475
Oh, my God, baby.

687
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,660
Baby.

688
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,080
Baby...

689
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:35,675
He's back. He's back.

690
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,939
- What happened?
- Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of you.

691
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,907
Hold on, buddy. I'm gonna
put you on the gurney.

692
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,659
What happened? There was a code?

693
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:43,566
His heart stopped.

694
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:46,001
But it started again.

695
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,137
I'm not sure what's going on.

696
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:56,863
Okay, here we go.

697
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:58,898
- Get him in.
- Let's hang some fluids.

698
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:02,635
Cardiac arrest...
It makes no sense.

699
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:06,256
This one is gonna help us
keep track of your breathing.

700
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,711
And these guys are
gonna monitor your heart.

701
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,091
Ah. You all right?

702
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:16,065
- Yeah.
- All right.

703
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,884
Two more, ready?

704
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,780
Smoke over fire.
One, two, three.

705
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,115
- Good?
- Uh, yeah.

706
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,389
All right.

707
00:37:22,424 --> 00:37:24,808
I heard. What's going on?

708
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,537
His heart stopped.
Is it the seizures?

709
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:28,322
We don't think so.
We're still learning things.

710
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,863
I paged cardio and neuro.

711
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:31,781
- Okay.
- It's okay.

712
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,633
Okay, he's safe now.

713
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,215
- Henry!
- Zoey, Zoey... Okay.

714
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,371
Just stay back with us.

715
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:41,006
- Henry! Zoey...
- He's down again.

716
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,387
He's going directly
into asystole.

717
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:45,171
His heart stopped.

718
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,583
Come on. Come on.

719
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,136
Come on.

720
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,406
Ow.

721
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:10,520
What in God's name is happening?

722
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,473
It's the VNS.

723
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:16,159
That controls his seizures.
It has nothing to do with this.

724
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:17,777
His heart is stopping.

725
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:19,507
The vagus nerve
also slows heart rate.

726
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,142
The VNS must be
overstimulating it.

727
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,794
The VNS is set to
send impulses every...

728
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:24,378
Three minutes.

729
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,670
Every three minutes, it
sends a 30-second pulse.

730
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:30,323
The VNS is stopping his
heart every time it fires.

731
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,221
So his heart is
gonna stop again?

732
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:35,778
Yes, if we don't
turn off the VNS.

733
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,325
We can't stop it without the
programming wand or the magnet.

734
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,343
- Do you have it, Zoey?
- Uh, not here.

735
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,101
I-It's at home.

736
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:42,863
There's a wand in
the ER. Go, now.

737
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,637
Keep up with the compressions,

738
00:38:44,672 --> 00:38:46,552
and Ambu when
he goes down again.

739
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:52,645
Devon. The programming
wand for the VNS... where is it?

740
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,697
Supply cabinet.

741
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:06,409
- It's not here.
- Damn it.

742
00:39:10,232 --> 00:39:12,214
Eckart has one.

743
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,418
He left for the day. Call
him and get him back here.

744
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,670
It would be in his
office across the street.

745
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:19,339
Tell him I'll meet him there!

746
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:26,396
Hey!

747
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,176
Mom...

748
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,827
I don't want to die.

749
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:44,831
No. No, you're not
gonna die, baby.

750
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:46,427
No, it's gonna be okay.

751
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,334
Just like the last time.

752
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,753
We've got ten seconds.

753
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,589
- Prepare the Ambu bag.
- You're doing great,

754
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,960
my brave, brave boy.

755
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:57,995
We have you.

756
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,283
He's down again.

757
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,441
Starting compressions.

758
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,121
Save him, please.

759
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,127
You have to save him!

760
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,458
<i>- I'm here.</i>
- Eckart is six minutes out.

761
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,494
Too long.

762
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:44,006
Please, God. Please. Please.

763
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,229
We should switch.

764
00:40:50,265 --> 00:40:53,316
- I got it.
- We may be at this a while.

765
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,271
Why isn't Conrad back?

766
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:00,389
I'm sure he'll be
back any second.

767
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,856
Not Henry, no.

768
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,291
Keep going.

769
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,850
Come on.

770
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,219
Hurry.

771
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,542
I got it, I got it.

772
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,445
Baby...

773
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,679
At least we did it.

774
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:39,389
You saw what just happened.

775
00:42:40,408 --> 00:42:43,826
Yeah, a QuoVadis
device failed in this child.

776
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,680
It stopped his heart.

777
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:50,716
- It nearly killed him.
- I was there.

778
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:54,887
Chastain cannot continue

779
00:42:54,923 --> 00:42:57,456
to be in business
with this company.
