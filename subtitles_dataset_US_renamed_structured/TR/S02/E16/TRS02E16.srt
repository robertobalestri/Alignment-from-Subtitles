1
00:00:01,385 --> 00:00:03,380
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
<i>- You led me to believe</i>

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:05,904
that my arrogance
killed my patient.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,123
It was a company that
makes defective valves

4
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:09,908
<i>and owns you.</i>

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,054
<i>You've already lost a son,</i>

6
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:12,806
<i>and I want to do
everything possible</i>

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,307
<i>to ensure that
doesn't happen again.</i>

8
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:16,226
<i>With our VNS poster child,</i>

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,383
Henry Barnett. Has
he been admitted?

10
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,763
Brought in with a
possible seizure.

11
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,185
The VNS is being featured

12
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,882
at the Innovation
Summit tomorrow.

13
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:24,901
If any issue comes
up, I want it handled.

14
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,174
<i>Quietly.</i>

15
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:39,738
The QuoVadis
device malfunctioned.

16
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,008
<i>Every three minutes</i>

17
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:50,949
<i>it fired and stopped
Henry Barnett's heart.</i>

18
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:54,848
<i>And each time, we
managed to bring him back,</i>

19
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:57,205
<i>but it got harder and
harder every time.</i>

20
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:04,078
<i>Until Dr. Hawkins managed to
locate the programming wand...</i>

21
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,851
<i>that deactivates the VNS.</i>

22
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:16,458
<i>And the only reason
that Henry's alive...</i>

23
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,776
<i>is because</i>

24
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,978
it malfunctioned
in the hospital.

25
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,648
It's not the first time a
QuoVadis device has failed.

26
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,829
A former resident died
from a defective heart valve.

27
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:28,215
Which is why we're here.

28
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,289
I've halted the use of all
QuoVadis devices at Chastain.

29
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,165
We believe it's best

30
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:36,594
to sever ties with Gordon Page
and his company immediately.

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,996
As bad as this is,

32
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,509
we're talking about
isolated incidents.

33
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,578
All medical devices
come with risk.

34
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,586
QuoVadis insisted
the VNS was safe.

35
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,067
So far, our partnership
with Gordon Page has been

36
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:49,624
a resounding success. Volume,
revenue... they're both up.

37
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,637
And let's not forget we
stand to make a killing

38
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,846
from stock options when
QuoVadis goes public.

39
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,581
When the truth comes out
that these devices kill people,

40
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,650
there will be no IPO.

41
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:01,069
There will, however, be lawsuits

42
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,639
that could bankrupt
this hospital.

43
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,302
QuoVadis is hosting an
innovation summit today

44
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:06,703
with investors
coming from all over.

45
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,177
Let's not rush to
any conclusions.

46
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,147
Randolph, you
brought Gordon to us.

47
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,669
Yeah, I did.

48
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,794
And a child nearly died.

49
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,464
And I cannot live knowing
we'd allow that to happen again.

50
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,720
Can you?

51
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,893
You're telling me the hospital
won't break with QuoVadis?

52
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,646
Few things are harder than
making a large corporation

53
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,949
renounce a profitable
revenue stream.

54
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:49,233
Bell didn't even try
to convince the board?

55
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,853
Believe it or not,
Randolph did the right thing.

56
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:55,140
Well, he'll turn on a dime
whenever it suits him.

57
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,141
We can't count on
him for anything.

58
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,644
The court of public
opinion is our best shot now.

59
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,363
Well, that's good.

60
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,148
Zoey's furious.

61
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,244
She's dying to talk to
the press about QuoVadis.

62
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,085
Well, a statement to the press

63
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,055
from a mother who almost
lost her child will go a long way.

64
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,957
Keep me posted.

65
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,832
Sergeant Jones served two tours.

66
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,234
Fought bravely beside
our men and women

67
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,122
in the Kandahar Province and
is the recipient of a Purple Heart.

68
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:31,076
But like so many of
our brave soldiers,

69
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,839
he has debilitating nightmares.

70
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:35,847
The QuoVadis VNS
has been approved

71
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:40,184
to treat a range of conditions,
from epilepsy to depression.

72
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,871
And now... PTSD.

73
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:47,408
And it is going to end Sergeant
Jones' suffering for good.

74
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,957
And he's not the
only one we'll help.

75
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,197
Later today, 20 more veterans

76
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,552
like Sergeant Jones will receive
their very own QuoVadis VNS.

77
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:59,570
And to show how simple

78
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:03,024
and safe a cure can be,

79
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:06,294
we will be streaming
these surgeries live

80
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,931
from VA hospitals
across the country.

81
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,188
♪ ♪

82
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:28,800

Hey, buddy, how you feeling?

90
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,402
Okay.

91
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:48,920
He drew this.

92
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,906
What?!

93
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:53,658
Wow. Who is this?

94
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,078
That's Nic. See the cape?

95
00:04:56,113 --> 00:04:59,414
Yeah, I see the resemblance.

96
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,649
How you feeling?

97
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,952
You need to get some rest.

98
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,954
I'll be fine.

99
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:07,533
You're gonna get to
make that statement

100
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,658
about the VNS to the press.

101
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:12,093
Hopefully today.

102
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:14,162
I know you're
concerned about Henry...

103
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:16,314
I'll make time.

104
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,300
I think I can get the
reporters to interview you here.

105
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:22,270
All you have to do is tell the
truth about what happened.

106
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:23,772
Of course.

107
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,273
Is Henry gonna be all right?

108
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:26,953
For now, yes.

109
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,127
Eckart thinks we should
consider moving Henry

110
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,679
to Duke University Hospital.

111
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,848
And... I agree.

112
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:40,489
Duke has a comprehensive
program for pediatric epilepsy

113
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,469
with new surgical options.

114
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:44,892
They're experimental,
but they're our best hope

115
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,527
to get Henry off the meds.

116
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,396
The issue is,

117
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:52,500
most health insurance won't
cover experimental procedures.

118
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,252
But don't worry.

119
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,688
We will figure this out.

120
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,738
You got to see this.

121
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,406
Gordon Page is putting the VNS

122
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,064
in 20 soldiers today
to cure their PTSD.

123
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,100
And 100 more will be implanted
over the next few weeks.

124
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,197
There is no proof that
it's gonna do anything

125
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:12,999
for PTSD. It might
even kill them.

126
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:14,667
The same way it
almost killed Henry.

127
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,158
Well, we have to stop this.

128
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:18,121
Is the hospital coming
out against QuoVadis?

129
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,578
No. But Zoey Barnett is.

130
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,581
In an hour, she'll be on all
three local news channels.

131
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,345
She's telling them the
VNS nearly killed her son.

132
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,352
The optics here are a disaster,

133
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,081
and the timing
couldn't be worse.

134
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:30,538
Where is she now?

135
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,090
At Chastain with the child.

136
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,636
Have the boy's
seizures returned?

137
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,243
Is he on multiple drugs again?

138
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,574
Dr. Bell isn't returning
our calls. We're in the dark.

139
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:42,061
Get me everything there is
to know about her and the kid.

140
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,565
Okay.

141
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,374
Incision to close in two hours.

142
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:56,897
- Nice work, Dr. Bell.
- Thanks, Paul.

143
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,016
I'll check on
Mr. Flynn in the ICU.

144
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,961
You leave any
blood in the patient?

145
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,841
What'd you do, saw him in half?

146
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,727
A liver resection. You know
how the liver bleeds, Simon.

147
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,817
Yeah, so I noticed.

148
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,120
You in for scratchers this week?

149
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,822
Whoa, yeah, I got a
feeling today's the day.

150
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,326
You've had that feeling before,
and how much have we lost

151
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,989
- on the lotto already?
- The only reason

152
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,846
why we haven't won the
jackpot yet is you're bad luck.

153
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,233
Then why do you play with me?

154
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:34,080
Oh, I got a soft spot
for the ugly ones.

155
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,726
You all right?

156
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,080
Yeah. Getting old... it sucks.

157
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:46,593
Guess it's better
than the alternative.

158
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:48,033
Let me see that.

159
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:53,088
Your feet swollen, too?

160
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:54,818
Ah, been eating
too much salt lately.

161
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,208
You've eaten too much
salt all your life. This is new.

162
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,288
- I'd like to run a couple tests.
- And I'd like to have a date

163
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,840
with a Rockette, but that
ain't gonna happen, either.

164
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,997
Come on. You're
already in a hospital.

165
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,584
I'm gonna come and find you.

166
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,839
Pain in the ass.

167
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,608
<i>Oh!</i>

168
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:15,154
Excuse us. Sorry. Where is he?

169
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,510
Okay. Come on. Excuse me.

170
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,012
Sorry. Excuse us.

171
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,697
Excuse us.

172
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,143
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hey, welcome.

173
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,500
Can I get your, uh, name?

174
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,329
Uh, Marilyn Spoelstra. I just...

175
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:26,003
Oh! Okay.

176
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,984
Here, let me get you a chair.

177
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,858
Three hours in a hatchback.

178
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:31,520
Wouldn't even let
us stop and stretch.

179
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,139
I raised a drill sergeant.

180
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:34,840
Well, it wasn't
some joyride, Ma.

181
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:37,131
I was doing 75
to save your life.

182
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,533
What brings you in today?

183
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,697
Oh, just a little bit of stomach
pain. Comes and goes.

184
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,982
Any past medical issues?

185
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,834
Marilyn has diabetes,
high cholesterol,

186
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,641
high blood pressure.

187
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:50,094
She also has perfect pitch and
two majestic German shepherds.

188
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,831
- Oh, just one. Phineas passed.
- No, not Mr. Phin.

189
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,244
Wait. How do you
guys know each other?

190
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,701
Uh, we're from Cecil, Alabama.

191
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,715
Dr. Shaw used to come
with his mobile clinic.

192
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,667
Parked outside our
church once a month.

193
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:02,935
And Kay always made sure
that they were first in line.

194
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,353
When you didn't show
two months in a row,

195
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,894
I looked online, saw you
on Chastain's website.

196
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,596
Her pain's never been this bad.

197
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,126
Where exactly is the pain?

198
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,716
It's over here.

199
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,946
That's right upper quadrant.
Could be gallstones.

200
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,020
Oh, God! And there it is again.

201
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,901
We should probably
get you to the ER.

202
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,085
- Ooh!
- Uh, we have
an ultrasound machine.

203
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,522
Let's try to figure out
what's wrong here first.

204
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,099
Is all this really necessary?

205
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,812
Nothing's too
good for Chastain's

206
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,902
longest-serving employee.

207
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,389
Well, can I get a
'65 Mustang instead?

208
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:36,402
You can buy it yourself.
You're winning that lottery.

209
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:37,937
This is gonna be cold.

210
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:39,727
O... kay.

211
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,428
How have you been sleeping?

212
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:45,784
Fine, when I'm in my recliner.

213
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,715
But when I lie flat, I
feel like I'm drowning.

214
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:50,989
And then, I've been
getting these chills.

215
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,591
Chills? Since when?

216
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:57,545
Mm... last Tuesday, I think.

217
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,559
I hear you're Chastain's
unofficial historian.

218
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,649
Keeper of secrets.

219
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,768
Oh, I've seen a few things.

220
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,831
I was here when
Randolph was a resident.

221
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,566
Keep in mind
before you continue,

222
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,807
that as CEO, I can fire you.

223
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,577
I did not know you did
your residency here.

224
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,645
Oh, he was as green
as new-mown grass.

225
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,815
His first week,

226
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,968
I'm putting supplies
away, and who do I find

227
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,436
in a custodial closet?

228
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,355
Young Randolph Bell.

229
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,773
- Oh!
- Yeah. He tried to play it off

230
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:29,243
that he was lost, but he
wasn't the first resident

231
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:31,198
I found hiding
from his attending.

232
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,464
You're fired.

233
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,973
All right, spit it out, boys.

234
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:53,217
That's not supposed
to be on my heart, is it?

235
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,947
No.

236
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:56,337
It's called a myxoma.

237
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,673
It's probably been
growing there for months.

238
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,991
Thing got so big
it started to block

239
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,738
- the blood flow to your heart.
- Which explains

240
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,457
the fluid buildup
and pitting edema.

241
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:06,231
It's all signs of heart failure.

242
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,116
Look, the good news is

243
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:11,018
we caught it early
while it's still operable.

244
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,032
When Bell brought
you in for testing...

245
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:14,705
he probably saved your life.

246
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,960
Well... I guess
being friends with you

247
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:20,995
finally did me some good.

248
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:27,401
I'm not sure the myxoma
explains all of Simon's symptoms.

249
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,348
- It was confirmed on the echo.
- Yeah, but there could be

250
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:31,500
a coexisting condition, and
that would complicate surgery,

251
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,352
so I'd just like to
run a few more tests.

252
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:36,060
Delaying his tumor resection is
just gonna worsen his prognosis.

253
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,229
But if there<i> is</i>
something else going on,

254
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,098
it would increase his risk for
perioperative complications.

255
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,762
Yeah, okay. Yeah,
fine. Run your tests.

256
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,997
But I'm not gonna postpone
the surgery much longer.

257
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,405
Well, barring any issues,
we'll still get it done today.

258
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,839
Okay.

259
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,742
How's Henry?

260
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,526
Uh, well, his...

261
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,174
heart's not stopping anymore.

262
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:57,548
But he has a long road ahead.

263
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,401
It happened
because you told Zoey

264
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,336
the VNS was safe when it wasn't.

265
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:04,517
You put profits
over patients, again.

266
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,108
I pulled all QuoVadis
devices as soon as I learned

267
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,855
the VNS was flawed.

268
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,728
Good for you. But Gordon Page

269
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,280
is still putting patients at
risk, now more than ever,

270
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,916
actually.

271
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:18,052
I've done everything
I can to stop him,

272
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:20,921
and you have no idea
what I've sacrificed

273
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,701
to protect patients
from this man.

274
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,074
He's coming for me next.

275
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,312
So you save your
morality lesson.

276
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:41,626
I'll let you take that.

277
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,809
Feeling a bit better?

278
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,050
Yeah, thanks to your drugs.

279
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,718
Are you single, honey?

280
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:52,887
Kay's got a boyfriend,
but it isn't serious.

281
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:54,939
- Ma,<i> quit.</i>
- Oh, you can fuss

282
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,393
over me, but I don't get
to be involved in your life?

283
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:00,311
I see gallstones.

284
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,790
But there's no
gallbladder wall thickening.

285
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,649
You're right, no sign
of acute cholecystitis.

286
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,116
That's a good thing?

287
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,751
Yes and no.

288
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,749
We've controlled
your flare-up today,

289
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:12,323
but I think you'll need surgery
soon to remove your gallbladder.

290
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,286
Well, let's do it
now, get it over with.

291
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,938
I can't take this
pain much longer.

292
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,929
That won't actually
be possible here.

293
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,832
You don't have insurance, and
Chastain is a private hospital.

294
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,311
They're not gonna
do that surgery

295
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,763
unless your situation
is life-threatening.

296
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:26,353
So I got to be dying
to get some help?

297
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,989
Well, who the hell
made these rules?

298
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,103
Well, we could refer you to
County to get it scheduled.

299
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,793
They take uninsured patients.

300
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,857
Typically, their wait
list is months long.

301
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,265
Well, we can't wait here. Uh-uh.

302
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,100
We got no place to stay.

303
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:41,436
- We're gonna have to go home.
- You'd make her go home

304
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:43,605
and suffer like this,
for months, maybe?

305
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,016
And what if she
suddenly gets worse?

306
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,785
You know what? I
have a friend at County.

307
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,343
Let me reach out, see if
they can get her in right now.

308
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:52,196
- All right, then.
- Thank you.

309
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:56,796
<i>You know, Bell
told me about you.</i>

310
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,386
He said you are one
real pain in the ass.

311
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,789
I'll take it. Pain-in-the-ass
people get things done.

312
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,793
You know...

313
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:08,813
when Randolph was
young, he was a lot like you.

314
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,317
I remember his second
year as a resident.

315
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,501
He got into a real
shouting match

316
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,638
with his chief of surgery.

317
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:19,690
He wanted to stop doctors
from smoking in the hospitals.

318
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,677
Said it was no good
for anyone's health,

319
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:24,495
patients<i> or</i> doctors.

320
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,197
Everyone, they just
thought he was no fun.

321
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,600
But... he was right.

322
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,537
And eventually,
they banned smoking.

323
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,156
And the very next year...

324
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:37,391
- he helped me quit.
- Oh, Bell,

325
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,326
a reformer?

326
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:41,362
That's hard to believe.

327
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:44,249
This place has a way
of changing people.

328
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,166
Just wait.

329
00:14:46,202 --> 00:14:48,285
Change you, too.

330
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,250
Hey.

331
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,269
- Hey.
- You need anything?

332
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,271
- No.
- You ready?

333
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,089
Yes. I want to do this.

334
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:11,108
Yeah, you're gonna be great.

335
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,212
We'll be all set for you in
about ten minutes, Ms. Barnett.

336
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,446
Thanks.

337
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,094
I'll be with Henry
until they need me.

338
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,736
Yeah. Go.

339
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:23,665
<i>W-What's your
favorite kind of game?</i>

340
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,551
<i>On the story mode games,</i>

341
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:27,436
there's a bad guy
that you have to stop

342
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,055
with missions that connect

343
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:30,606
- to each other.
- Oh.

344
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,940
And it's really cool.

345
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,559
Ooh. So you're hunting bad guys.

346
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,983
- What are you doing here?
- Ms. Barnett.

347
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,286
I came here to check
in on you and Henry.

348
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,007
Mom, he gave it to me.

349
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,287
Look, I understand
that you're upset.

350
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,011
I am, too. That's
why I'm here... to help.

351
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,113
Hey.

352
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,949
I was just coming to check in.

353
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,601
What's going on?

354
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,037
Mr. Page was just leaving.

355
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,413
You all right?

356
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:07,681
Yes.

357
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:10,918
Well, they're ready for you.

358
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:13,003
I'll stay with Henry.

359
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,371
Thanks, Nic.

360
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,816
Hear me out. Henry had
a very rare adverse event.

361
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,946
Is that what you call it?

362
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,887
Every new lifesaving device
has glitches in the first few years,

363
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,451
and then we adjust and we learn.

364
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:34,692
He's going to Duke.
They'll help him.

365
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,377
Now, please leave us alone.

366
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,390
And who's paying for
his treatment at Duke?

367
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,281
If the surgery is experimental,
insurance won't cover it.

368
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:42,894
Will you be able
to keep your job

369
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,513
while you're with your
son in North Carolina?

370
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,777
Without a job, will you
even have health insurance?

371
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:50,369
- What do you want?
- Henry's condition
is likely permanent.

372
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:52,559
I'm here to tell you
that QuoVadis is willing

373
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,211
to cover all his
medical bills...

374
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,041
Not for a month,
not for a year...

375
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:58,265
For his whole life.

376
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,920
I don't believe you.

377
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,556
I'll put it in writing.

378
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,559
It's the least we can do.

379
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,832
And in return, I'm guessing...

380
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,034
you don't want me
to go talk to the press.

381
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,238
Don't make me your enemy.

382
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,158
Take the offer.

383
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:27,394
And if you go public with a
grievance against QuoVadis,

384
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:29,997
now or ever...

385
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,199
this deal goes away.

386
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:36,437
We're ready for you
now, Ms. Barnett.

387
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:52,319
How much?

388
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,055
How much was Page's offer?

389
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:57,036
I heard he was here.

390
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,727
There were more zeroes than
I've ever seen in one number.

391
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:01,195
You can't take it.

392
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:02,863
We'll find another way

393
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:04,927
to pay for Henry's
treatment, I promise you.

394
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,034
- You can't promise that.
- Yes, I can.

395
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,470
I<i> do</i> promise that. Zoey,
you need to speak out,

396
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,322
or people will die if you don't.

397
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,274
I get it, I get it... that kind
of money, it is tempting.

398
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,221
Even all that money,
it can't be enough

399
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:18,245
to stop me from
waking up every night

400
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,058
and running into Henry's
room to make sure

401
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:23,100
he didn't stop
breathing. It won't...

402
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:29,156
It won't bring his brother back.

403
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:35,429
I signed already.

404
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,265
QuoVadis wired the money.

405
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,052
It's done.

406
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,055
I am not a horrible person.

407
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,310
I will help arrange...

408
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:52,113
for Henry's transfer to Duke.

409
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,784
We need to get him
there as quickly as we can.

410
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,153
Thank you, Conrad.

411
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:01,471
For everything.

412
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,359
Good luck, Zoey.

413
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,452
What about cancellations?

414
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,806
There's got to be
some way to get her in.

415
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:20,191
Okay, thanks, man.

416
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,693
Nope. I understand.

417
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,673
They wanted to
schedule Marilyn's surgery

418
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,679
seven weeks out.

419
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:27,147
I talked them down to three.

420
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,684
- This isn't your fault.
- No, in a way, it is.

421
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,904
The mobile clinic helped me
stop crises before they happened.

422
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,382
I am sure that you
encouraged Marilyn

423
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,884
to live a healthier
lifestyle many times.

424
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,137
I mean, there's only
so much we can do.

425
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:40,878
This is the situation, so
we have to deal with it.

426
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,097
Okay, how?

427
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,417
Where's your RV?

428
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,315
- It's down the street.
- Pull it around.

429
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:51,259
We're gonna have
a working lunch.

430
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,561
Welcome to Le Château Shaw.

431
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,379
- Château what?
- Come on.

432
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,160
You're mere steps from
the best medical care

433
00:20:01,184 --> 00:20:03,162
Atlanta has to offer.

434
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:05,369
What on earth...?

435
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,723
- Oh, my.
- We provide our guests

436
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:12,225
with the utmost privacy.

437
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,429
Unfortunately, the pool's
closed for renovation indefinitely.

438
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,510
- Are you sure this is okay? It should
be fine until your mom has the surgery.

439
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:21,046
- And there's a supermarket within
walking distance. Yeah. And there's

440
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,298
a kitchen in the clinic...
Use it anytime you need.

441
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,571
But...

442
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:26,456
no more fatty foods.

443
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,053
They'll only worsen
your gallbladder attacks.

444
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:30,610
Listen to Dr. Shaw on
this. It's very important.

445
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,107
No more peanut butter.

446
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,193
No fried chicken.

447
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,566
No chocolate, no dairy.

448
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,552
And... definitely no more bacon.

449
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,583
- Well, then what's left?
- Fruits,

450
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,567
veggies, whole
grains, lean protein.

451
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,228
No bacon? Harsh.

452
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,261
Mina said you're
storming the castle.

453
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,101
We're going.

454
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:56,453
Bradley's dead.
Julian is still missing.

455
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,066
I'm not gonna just sit
around while Gordon

456
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,485
- keeps hurting patients.
- His Innovation Summit

457
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,629
is open to the public...
We can walk right in.

458
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,110
We need to get the truth

459
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:04,640
about the VNS to the
military leaders there

460
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,058
who can actually
stop this thing.

461
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:08,616
Wow. Leaking what
the VNS did to Henry...

462
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:11,218
Now, that would be
a violation of HIPAA.

463
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:13,304
Which is why we're removing

464
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,579
anything that would
reveal the patient's identity.

465
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,644
Go get 'em.

466
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,523
One of my investigators
was able to locate

467
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,458
a former QuoVadis employee

468
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,494
who witnessed
fraud at the company.

469
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,841
- Will they come forward?
- No, they're afraid of Gordon.

470
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,825
So we'll have to
find proof ourselves.

471
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,833
What proof?

472
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,318
Zoey's out.

473
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:46,198
The VNS surgeries
are in a few hours.

474
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,205
- We're running out of time.
- I know.

475
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,185
I figured you'd be halfway
to QuoVadis by now.

476
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:53,209
I can't leave. I got
critical patients.

477
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:56,496
There's one now.

478
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:57,998
I got to go.

479
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:01,529
He's not responding
to fluid boluses.

480
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,619
Still hypotensive.

481
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,021
You thinking cardiogenic shock?

482
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,272
He's vasodilated.

483
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:06,940
His fever just spiked to 103.

484
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,308
This is septic shock.

485
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:10,424
Draw a lactate, set
up for a central line.

486
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,280
We've already
got blood cultures.

487
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:15,460
Let's get him started on
vancomycin and cefepime.

488
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,529
Hang norepinephrine
and titrate to a MAP of 65.

489
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:18,619
Stay with us, buddy.

490
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,606
I'm seeing Osler's nodes.

491
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,326
Those splinter hemorrhages
weren't there two minutes ago.

492
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,883
Cardiac mass must be infected.

493
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:34,318
It's not just a myxoma.

494
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,253
He's got endocarditis as well.

495
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,817
I've only seen two patients
with both in my entire career.

496
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:40,891
And did they survive?

497
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,025
One did.

498
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,344
Well, at least his pressures
are starting to come back up.

499
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,418
Obviously, under
normal circumstances,

500
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,081
we would recommend
holding off on surgery

501
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,688
with such a recent infection.

502
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:57,369
But with Simon's
valve deteriorating -

503
00:22:57,393 --> 00:23:00,343
and his heart failure
worsening, he needs it soon.

504
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,513
His surgery just got
a whole lot riskier.

505
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,348
Let's broaden his antibiotics to
cover any possible resistance.

506
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,068
Do we still go forward?

507
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,537
If he does nothing, he'll live

508
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:12,434
for a couple more
months. Operating under

509
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,426
these circumstances might
mean he never wakes up.

510
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,748
I'll talk to him.

511
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:23,384
It's his decision.

512
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,474
This was all they had left.

513
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,227
Apparently, the word is out.

514
00:23:33,262 --> 00:23:34,912
You know, if I got sick,

515
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,531
half this hospital would
pop a bottle of champagne.

516
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:40,967
Why? The other half don't drink?

517
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,152
Okay.

518
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:44,454
So, how bad is it?

519
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,459
Surgery's risky.

520
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:51,879
Even in Austin's hands, uh...

521
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:54,798
the odds of
survival aren't great.

522
00:23:56,586 --> 00:23:59,903
What happens if AJ doesn't
cut this thing out of me?

523
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,154
What then?

524
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:06,960
Then the tumor will
completely obstruct your heart,

525
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,962
and...

526
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,780
you'll have a month,

527
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:13,183
maybe two.

528
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:16,436
Get your affairs in order.

529
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:20,191
So my choices are
risking dying on the table

530
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:21,292
or...

531
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,544
start saying goodbye.

532
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,181
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

533
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:34,555
Want to take a day
and-and think about it?

534
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:37,541
I'm a betting man.

535
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,959
I've beaten long odds before.

536
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:42,362
Nah...

537
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,531
let's do it.

538
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,851
All right.

539
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:51,304
All right.

540
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,509
You know,

541
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,144
I love my job.

542
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,613
Pay's not great.

543
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,016
But every day, I...

544
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:05,552
get to help you save lives.

545
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:08,455
And I sleep like a baby.

546
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:11,541
Oh, it's been a while since
I slept through the night.

547
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:15,545
You love this place
as much as I do.

548
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,998
I know you'll do
whatever you have to

549
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,334
to make things right.

550
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,438
Hey.

551
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:30,394
You better get ready.

552
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:36,483
The VNS stopped

553
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:38,096
the patient's heart
every three minutes.

554
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,436
It's a miracle he survived.

555
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,088
It nearly killed him.

556
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,606
If you move forward with this,

557
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,542
you are putting a ticking time
bomb in every one of these vets.

558
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,955
I'm sorry, wh-who are you again?

559
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,446
We're doctors who
work at Chastain.

560
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:51,615
The device is FDA-approved.

561
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,728
But the FDA doesn't
do independent testing.

562
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,714
And they're notorious
for grandfathering devices

563
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:58,154
based on previous ones
that don't even work.

564
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:02,759
We're satisfied
with the trial data

565
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:05,446
Gordon Page provided us.

566
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,203
Look.

567
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,188
That's Raptor's mentor...

568
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:18,708
The one that recommended
the heart valve that killed Bradley.

569
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,611
I don't suppose punching him
would do us any good, would it?

570
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,313
Come on.

571
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,793
<i>May I have your
attention, please.</i>

572
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:30,070
<i>Our presentation will begin
shortly in the main lobby.</i>

573
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,773
Dr. Benedict, I'm Dr. Okafor.

574
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,875
I met you with Dr. Austin.

575
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,960
Yeah, who could forget?

576
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:39,730
We're here because Gordon's
VNS is as deadly as his heart valve.

577
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,393
And it's about to
endanger dozens of lives

578
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,300
if we don't stop it.

579
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,088
Give AJ my best.

580
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,476
Dr. Benedict, you still
have a reputation to protect.

581
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,351
If you know anything... No, no.

582
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,680
The greatest
betrayal of Austin's life

583
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,693
was when his birth
parents abandoned him,

584
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,268
throwing him away like trash.

585
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,437
You were a close second.

586
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:05,672
That's how much your
friendship meant to him.

587
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,774
That's how much he trusted you.

588
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:10,461
The man you used to be

589
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,130
and the one you can be again.

590
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:15,132
When Mina said
the VNS will fail,

591
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,967
you weren't surprised. Why?

592
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,304
I didn't have a choice.

593
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,706
We had to get the
device to market.

594
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,790
You and Gordon?

595
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,959
I swear...

596
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:28,662
- I didn't know at first.
- Know what?

597
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,042
Let's take a walk.

598
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,124
Your pre-op numbers look
quite reassuring, my brother.

599
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,692
Once that tumor's removed,

600
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:01,523
we'll see about finding
you that Rockette.

601
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:06,649
Ah, I thought I'd seen
this room from every angle.

602
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,554
But I've never
seen it like this.

603
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,924
Okay, transfer on three.

604
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,376
One, two, three.

605
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:22,966
Starting the propofol.

606
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,351
Randolph.

607
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:26,764
Yeah?

608
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,122
Try not to make a mess.

609
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,021
She's on the floor.

610
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,957
It looks real bad.

611
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:52,012
- The pain usually goes away.
- And it's gotten worse.

612
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,683
We need to get her to Chastain.

613
00:28:56,718 --> 00:29:00,103
Marilyn, one of your gallstones
is now causing an infection.

614
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,899
It's a good thing you didn't
head back to Alabama.

615
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:03,752
This could've happened on
the road, with nowhere to go.

616
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,703
Ultrasound shows
pericholecystic fluid.

617
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:08,095
And her white count
is at 20,000. No fever.

618
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,530
I'm Dr. Nolan. I'll be removing
your gallbladder today.

619
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:12,043
Oh, hallelujah.

620
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:13,366
Don't usually get that reaction.

621
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:14,701
You can take it out now?

622
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:15,902
Now it's an emergency.

623
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:17,132
Get her prepped for surgery.

624
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,588
I'll see you in the OR, okay?

625
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,878
I can't thank you enough.

626
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:26,729
Whatever you've done,

627
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,510
it is not too late
to make it right.

628
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:29,594
- Talk to us.
- What do you know?

629
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:30,767
What has QuoVadis done?

630
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,085
How can we stop this?

631
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:40,594
Oh...

632
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,083
I want to talk to AJ.

633
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,735
He deserves the truth.

634
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,971
Just him, not you.

635
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:54,691
All right.

636
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:18,665
<i>Here we have the QuoVadis
vagus nerve stimulator.</i>

637
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,284
<i>All cities are online.</i>

638
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,950
<i>The surgeries
are about to begin.</i>

639
00:30:24,974 --> 00:30:28,307
<i>Dr. Stevenson presiding.</i>

640
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:36,483
The patient is David Jones.

641
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:39,069
Date of birth 8/6/1989.

642
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,721
<i>Procedure to be performed
is surgical implantation</i>

643
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,490
<i>of a vagus nerve stimulator.</i>

644
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,910
Let's begin. 10 blade.

645
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,733
<i>I can't reach Austin.</i>

646
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,101
I've called three times.

647
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,555
He's in surgery.

648
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,756
What is going on?

649
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:00,757
Abe doesn't trust us.

650
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,920
He'll only talk to Austin.

651
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:04,044
He knows something
that can help.

652
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,513
I'm on it.

653
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:18,241
All right, let's start
rewarming Simon

654
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,160
and get his heart pumping again.

655
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:21,456
Defib paddles to me.

656
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,274
Charge to ten joules.

657
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:26,599
Clear.

658
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:35,854
He's in V-fib.

659
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:37,911
Give 300 of amio and try again.

660
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,909
I'm here. I'm here.

661
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,323
And clear.

662
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:04,570
He won't stay out of V-fib.

663
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,573
His electrolytes are normal.

664
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,436
I've given him more magnesium,
but it's not doing anything.

665
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,793
Get the intracardiac epi ready.

666
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,939
Just worried his heart
sustained too much damage

667
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,079
during the procedure.

668
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,950
Injecting one milligram

669
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:19,898
of epi.

670
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,637
I can't get to him.

671
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:40,740
You have to.

672
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:43,125
I can't. His patient could die.

673
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Let's get him on a balloon pump.

674
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:51,617
Charge to 20.

675
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:53,253
Clear.

676
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:01,940
Come on, Dr. Benedict,

677
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:03,884
please, tell us
whatever you know.

678
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,924
Where's the balloon pump?!

679
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,062
General?

680
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,847
My name is Marshall Winthrop.

681
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:23,816
I'm chairman of the board
at Chastain Park Memorial.

682
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,853
We'll be cutting
ties with QuoVadis

683
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:28,387
because of some information

684
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,463
I thought you'd be
interested in seeing.

685
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:33,933
Don't you understand
that lives are at stake here?

686
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:37,080
Please.

687
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,898
- Come on.
- Let's go.

688
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,686
Come on.

689
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,614
Mr. Page wants
to speak with you.

690
00:33:56,602 --> 00:33:58,518
QuoVadis is engaged

691
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,520
in wide-ranging fraud.

692
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:04,002
All of their devices,
including the VNS,

693
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:06,159
are being shipped in from China

694
00:34:06,195 --> 00:34:09,695
and then relabeled
as made in the USA.

695
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:11,380
By law, the military cannot use

696
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,183
any medical device
not American-made.

697
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,097
And those are shipping records

698
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,038
over the last few months.

699
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:20,657
You have more proof
there than you'll ever need.

700
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,398
What happened?

701
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:47,901
What happened is the
U.S. military partnered

702
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,619
with a liar and a fraud.

703
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:53,606
Our contract is
now null and void.

704
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:56,826
All surgeries are canceled.

705
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:40,053
Austin said Simon's
