<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- I loved my sister very much.

2
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,623
One night, I decided to take a
quick nap, and when I woke up,

3
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:09,408
the whole house was on fire.

4
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,794
- How's Jessie?
- Her kidneys are failing.

5
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:13,306
I was a project for you,
and now it's finished.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,591
Tell me I'm wrong.
Tell me I'm right.

7
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,248
Either way, just open up

8
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,717
- like you asked me to do.
- And I will.

00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,969
When I'm ready, when
I figure some things out.

I mean, my feelings

Conrad and I have fought long

We've been through it.

13

Yeah, apparently kidney failure

46
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,964
comes with more
visitors than rehab.

Dr. Shaw says that some people

have to do this
three days a week,

- four hours a session?
- Now, there's no need

54
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,938
to get ahead of ourselves.
We're doing a workup

55
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:53,857
to see if your kidney
failure's reversible.

56
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,492
We'll have a better
idea real soon.

I didn't know you added
another doctor to your dance card.

00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,362
Well, yeah, the clinic's
closed because of the storm.

59
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:00,947
I came by to help out
and figure I'd drop in

60
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:03,416
- and meet Nic's sister, too.
- Can I steal you?

61

- Donna's asking for us.
- Oh, this is important.

62
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,337
It's a patient we've
had a long time.

63
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,771
- You'll be back soon?
- Yes.

64
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,257
Okay.

65
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:12,259
<i>Alec is into you.</i>

66
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:15,667
- I noticed.
- So I'm right.

67
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,337
He mentioned something,
but I shut it down.

68
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,466
Must be complicated
to have to work with him.

69
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,684
I'm fine.

70
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,858
I'm sure you are.

71
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,293
Can I punch him?

72
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,829
Kidding.

73
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,392
This is the new
Conrad, remember?

74
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:32,484
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

75
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,114
Look, I'm handling it.

76
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:35,782
- Trust me.
- Of course I trust you.

77
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:37,650
I don't have to be friends
with the guy, though.

78
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:39,107
No, you don't.

79
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:40,475
Hey, Donna.

80
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,945
- How you feeling?
- Not bad.

81
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,747
Ready to talk about
how I'm gonna die?

82
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:50,836
There. You'll be fine.

83
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,248
You probably
shouldn't try to get home

84
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,833

come through.

85
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:55,897
Nurse Hundley will

87
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,713
Hmm? Oh, Bell's
making an announcement.

88
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,499
So, as you know, the blizzard
is getting worse by the hour.

89
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,646
We're already working
with a skeleton staff,

90
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,199
and because conditions
are so hazardous,

91
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,584
we expect the next shift is
gonna have trouble getting here,

92
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,242
so no matter what
your specialty,

93
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,261
just help where you're needed.

94
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,408
I mean, so far we've
been lucky, it's been quiet,

95
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:21,950
but we can expect
storm-related...

96
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,587
complications all night.

97
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,951
- Where does it hurt?
- Right here.

98
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,440
Are you guys okay?

99
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,288
Look, we're fine, but
my dad, he needs help.

100
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,606
He's in the back. He's frozen.

101
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,929

So much for a quiet night.

- We need access to the airway.
- I'll intubate.

115
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:40,240
- I'll get access.
- His body temperature
is 72 degrees.

116
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:42,308
None of this matters if
we can't get him warm.

117
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:44,372
We need heated
blankets and warm saline.

118
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,699
I'm having trouble
getting the tube in.

119
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,418
I can't get a view.
Let's try succinylcholine.

120
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,659
Maybe that'll help
me get the tube in.

Excuse me, but if possible,

122
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,524
could I maybe pronounce him
dead when compressions stop?

123
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,033
See, Dr. Pravesh said it's
good for us to practice our skills,

124
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,016
and I've never had
the opportunity...

125
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,452
Shut your mouth.

Your father's heart has stopped.

- Because he's cold?
- Yes.

131
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,064
His body temperature
is dangerously low.

132
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,888
We're hoping, if we warm him up,

133
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,289
his heart will start again.

134
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,940
I know you'll save him.

135
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,508
Promise?

136
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,278
We'll do everything we can.

137
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:32,064
I expect updates.

138
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,204
Call Dr. Austin. We need him.

00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,798
Hundley, I'm four miles away.

140
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,799

141
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:53,818
Kays is on vacation in Florida.

142
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,873
Mina has a patient with severe
hypothermia in cardiac arrest.

Just short of slamming my
feet through the floor of this car

<i>I'm not sure what
I can do about it.</i>

146
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,466
Dr. Okafor told me to
tell you she needs you.

147
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:14,489
Then neither snow nor rain
nor heat nor gloom of night

148
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:17,575
shall stay this doctor
from the swift completion

149
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,611
of his appointed rounds.

150
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,456
Scale of one to
ten, how's your pain?

151
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,295
It's a little worse.

152
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,414
But I don't want
any more drugs yet,

153
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,717
because I have a
visitor coming tomorrow

154
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:44,735
and I want to have a clear head.

155
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,556
Well, with all the years you
spent working in hospice,

156
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:50,859
I'm sure you know
exactly what you want.

157
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:52,611
25 years.

158
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,896
If there's one thing I
understand, it's dying.

159
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:57,699
Uh, when the chemo
stopped working,

160
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:00,068
I signed a "do not
resuscitate" order,

161
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:04,239
so if my heart stops,
no one will give me CPR.

162
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:06,219
Well, I know you were
planning to get to hospice tonight,

163
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:08,555
but it looks like
you're stuck with us.

164
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:11,963
What can we do to help?
Your wish is our command.

165
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,102
Oh, just keep me comfortable.

166
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,487
No needle sticks.

167
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,923
Leave me be.

168
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,591
I really admire you.

169
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:24,987
- Oh...
- I've seen too many people

170
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,729
over-treated and
harmed in their last days.

171
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:30,265
Yeah, well, I'm hoping
for a few more weeks.

172
00:07:31,602 --> 00:07:35,453
Do you know, many
people live longer in hospice.

173
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,240
I did know that.

174
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,774
Nic's got your back.

175
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,840
In hospice, it's going
to be so much nicer.

176
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,427
- Hmm.
- Scented candles.

177
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:49,434
"Northern Fir" is my favorite.

178
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,264
I just love the
smell of Christmas.

179
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:53,087
Me, too.

180
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:55,373
Friends surrounding me,

181
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,368
all of us drinking
Tennessee whiskey

182
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,761
and listening to gospel hymns.

183
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,346
Mm.

184
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,266
Okay, enough schmaltz.

185
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:08,136
I have a juicy audiobook
that's going to put me to sleep.

186
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:11,623
Oh, and I'll be
dreaming of that last item

187
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,275
that I'm gonna be
checking off my bucket list.

188
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,912
What is that last item you're
checking off your bucket list?

189
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,149
Bob.

190
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:25,453
Bob's the man, the
visitor that I mentioned.

191
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:28,373
He was my chance at true love.

192
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,626
After Bob, there was no one.

193
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:34,329
But you're gonna see him?

194
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:37,477
Yes, I am.

195
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:40,702
I saw online that he's divorced,

196
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:45,556
and, um, I wrote him.

197
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:49,527
And wonder of all wonders,
he's going to come see me.

198
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:53,381
He would have been here today,
but he was delayed by the storm.

199
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,483
That is amazing, Donna.

200
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,702
Yeah, I haven't
seen him for 30 years.

201
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,488
Oh...

202
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:05,110
Oh, words that were never
said will finally be spoken.

203
00:09:06,196 --> 00:09:09,297
And I will die without regrets.

204
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,564
<i>Look, I know I said</i>

205
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,416
all hands on deck,
but it's been a while

206
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,549
since my pediatric rotation.

207
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,206
Did you get a hold of Dr. Jonas?

208
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,375
He's busy.

209
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,527
Feldman?

210
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,828
In with the injured paramedics.

211
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:40,729
So, you kids dug your dad out
of the snow all by yourselves.

212
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:42,625
How'd you get him
in the car, honey?

213
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,712
Well, we put him on the
sled, and we pushed him.

214
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:48,403
It was dark, and everyone
was gone, so we dragged him

215
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:50,872
into the car, and I
drove straight here.

216
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:53,374
By yourself? Incredible.

217
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,161
She's very brave.
Isn't she, Eli?

218
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:58,891
He doesn't talk much,

219
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:01,166
ever since my mom left.

220
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,162
Do you know how to get
in touch with your mom?

221
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:07,005
Uh, the judge says we
can't talk to her anymore.

222
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,023
Not for a while, at least.

223
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:17,081
So, just a few bumps
and scrapes on Eli.

224
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,361
So, your turn.

225
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,918
How about I have
a look at that wrist?

226
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,904
Okay...

227
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,757
He's not warming up
fast enough from fluids.

228
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:32,424
The quickest way is
to circulate warm blood.

229
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:34,768
- He needs to go on bypass.
- Let's get him into the OR.

230
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,871
Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.
Is my dad's heart beating now?

231
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,857
Uh, not yet. Uh,
we're working on it.

232
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,864
I know you'll save his life.

233
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:18,643
You do realize I'm doing
my damnedest to get there

234
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,306
even though I'm
freezing to death.

235
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,047
I'm about to scrub in, and
there's no attending here.

236
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,645
You have operated
without an attending before.

237
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,719
I'm two miles out.

238
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:34,476
I am in the initial
stages of frostbite.

239
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:37,061
I'd prefer not to
lose my fingertips.

240
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,858
What's the procedure?

241
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:40,258
I'm setting up
femoral cannulation

242
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,100
for bypass to help him rewarm.

243
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,668
<i>Are you serious right now?</i>

244
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,187
<i>You can put a patient
on bypass in your sleep.</i>

245
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,373
Start without me.
Finish without me.

246
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,886
<i>But what if there's
complications?</i>

247
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,276
Dissection. Pseudoaneurysm.
Limb ischemia.

248
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,711
<i>Mina,</i>

249
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,613
are you afraid to fly solo?

250
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,932
I am not afraid.

251
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,368
Well, you should be.

252
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,703
Fear makes us careful.

253
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,622
It's a good thing.

254
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,741
But never let it paralyze you.

255
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,344
It's a dad.

256
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,012
He's frozen. He's
in cardiac arrest.

257
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:14,132
He has two little kids.

258
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,551
The little girl is very brave.

259
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:20,271
She reminds me of my sisters.

260
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,892
All right.

261
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:27,528
As soon as my
extremities warm up,

262
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:29,797
I will head back out.

263
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,983
But you got this, Okafor.

264
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,419
Hey.

265
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:53,771
What are you doing here?

266
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:57,008
Look, I-I know I messed up
in the ER, and I'm so sorry.

267
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,804
But the kids aren't
down here anymore,

268
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:01,229
and I'd still like to
practice the death exam.

269
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:04,582
You realize we aren't talking
about an item on a checklist.

270
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,067
It's a person.

271
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:07,235
A father. A young man.

272
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,736
No, I-I understand that.

273
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:10,788
But I'm just a
first-year med student.

274
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,668
I don't get that much
time in a hospital.

275
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,336
And I haven't seen
that many dead people;

276
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,994
only my cadaver in
anatomy lab. Ernest.

277
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,580
I named him Ernest to
remind me of his humanity

278
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:23,334
and also to say, "We were
working in dead earnest."

279
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,715
<i>Triage nurse to the ER.</i>

280
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,790
<i>- Triage nurse to the ER.</i>
- Come here.

281
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,070
Quit hanging around here
like the angel of death, Erik.

282
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,465
I might have something you
can help me with later tonight.

283
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,512
Careful.

284
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:52,780
That's got to hurt.

285
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:54,666
Yeah. I think it's broken.

286
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,233
I think you're right.

287
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,214
We're gonna take a
picture. Don't move.

288
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,988
Okay.

289
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,007
See you've made a friend.

290
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,903
Yeah, it's not clear
what he sees in me.

291
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,911
But they're great kids.

292
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,047
It's kind of hard to resist 'em.
Not one word of complaint.

293
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,083
All they do is ask
about their father.

294
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,097
You want to take
'em for a while?

295
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,520
I'd love to.

296
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,017
But as soon as
I set Eva's wrist,

297
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,340
I have to go to the ER.

298
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,593
Our paramedic
has a dislocated hip.

299
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,811
It's all on you, Dr. Bell.

300
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:31,163
Okay, you ready?

301
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:33,070
So ready.

302
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,406
This guy is flying high.

303
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,825
You are gonna feel
this nonetheless.

304
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:39,744
But I'm not gonna care.

305
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,162
Do it.

306
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:43,831
Okay. In three.

307
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,833
One... two...

308
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,441
I think we overshot
on those meds.

309
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,855
Do we have any left?

310
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,546
You didn't say three!

311
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,466
All right.

312
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,053
I came in and
found her like this.

313
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:08,606
She's delirious, maybe
septic, and she's in pain.

314
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,957
Donna?

315
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,989
Could be a perforation.

316
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,124
What do you want to
do? Up the morphine?

317
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,876
Let's give her two milligrams
and get her up to CT.

318
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,232
She's DNR.

319
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,084
DNR doesn't mean "do not treat."

320
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,497
A scan could show
if there's something

321
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,401
we could do to
buy her some time.

322
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,911
What happened?

323
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:33,831
Donna was in pain and altered.

324
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,167
She almost fell off the bed
when I touched her belly.

325
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,174
Looks like a
strangulated hernia.

326
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,976
Which we could fix in surgery.

327
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,228
Did Donna say she
wanted surgery?

328
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:49,630
I mean, she's in and
out of consciousness.

329
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,009
She can't make
decisions for herself.

330
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,234
But I do know...

331
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,003
she wants to stay alive for Bob.

332
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,022
Who's Bob?

333
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,818
Remember the visitor
Donna was talking about?

334
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,304
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, after you left,

335
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,926
she told me his name was Bob.

336
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,662
He was the love of her life.

337
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,363
She hasn't seen him in decades,

338
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,750
and he's finally on his way.

339
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:12,486
Okay, but we have
her wishes in writing.

340
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:13,938
Her advanced directives says

341
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,517
she wants no
major interventions.

342
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,626
And I get that, but you
didn't hear what I heard.

343
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:20,038
And if she doesn't
have this surgery,

344
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,306
she might not make
it through the night.

345
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,142
Surgery could
have complications.

346
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,666
She could end up stuck in the
hospital tethered to machines.

347
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:28,318
Donna's health care proxy needs
to be making these decisions.

348
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,015
- Have you reached her?
- I've tried.

349
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,557
Several times. The phones
must be down from the storm.

350
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,073
So, if there's no
proxy, I have to decide.

351
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,597
She goes back to her
room on pain meds.

352
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:45,552
And I think we
should try to fix this,

353
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,655
so we disagree.

354
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,959
I'm her doctor.
This is my decision.

355
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:53,527
You're pulling rank?

356
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,863
I'm saying the burden is on me.

357
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:59,016
And Donna explicitly
decided to be DNR.

358
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:01,652
- I have to uphold that.
- And I believe we should

359
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,088
uphold the wishes that
she made clear to me.

360
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,473
I hear you.

361
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:08,092
And as painful as
this is for both of us,

362
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:11,211
I believe that we have to
uphold the written directive.

363
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,849
She's going back to her room.

364
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,020
♪ ♪

365
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,849
Flawless procedure, Dr. O.

366
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:39,373
Well done.

367
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,425
Body temp is up to 80 degrees.

368
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,255
Still no heart rhythm.

369
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,279
How long do we wait?

370
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,965
I'll let you know...
once I've figure that out.

371
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,821
I heard Eva's
quite the little boss.

372
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,058
I really like that kid.

373
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,711
Wh... Seriously, Dr. Okafor?

374
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,814
I really like kids.

375
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,448
Especially that one.

376
00:18:06,469 --> 00:18:08,769
His temperature is up to 83.

377
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:12,490
84...

378
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,326
We have a rhythm.

379
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,879
Eva was right.

380
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:19,297
Her father is not dead.

381
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:27,821
All right.

382
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:30,925
This is Atlanta.

383
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,510
It's not Chicago.

384
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,845
Let's go, baby.

385
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,278
<i>Go!</i>

386
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,297
<i>Ah. I'm doing it!</i>

387
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,366
<i>Dad, Dad, I'm doing it!</i>

388
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,285
You know,

389
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,921
he couldn't ride that bike
until Dad put the cape on him.

390
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,125
Dad proved you're a
superhero, didn't he?

391
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,093
<i>I did it. Yeah!</i>

392
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,806
Come on. Doctors...

393
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,530
they can be superheroes, too.

394
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,183
Doctor Strange,
he's a neurosurgeon.

395
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:16,203
The Hulk... is a doctor.

396
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,056
Yeah, I like the Hulk.

397
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,620
I always did. I...

398
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:23,895
When I was your age...

399
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,580
I wanted to be the Hulk.

400
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,901
- Really?
- Yeah.

401
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,634
- Yeah?
- Dr. Bell, do you have a second?

402
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:37,090
Okay.

403
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,299
You have a fever.

404
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:47,251
You may have an infection.

405
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,853
- From what?
- The dialysis line

406
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,905
can be an entry
point for bacteria.

407
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,807
It's a common complication.

408
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:57,061
All right, let's have a look.

409
00:19:58,514 --> 00:20:00,147
Yeah.

410
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:01,843
There is a little
erythema there.

411
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,867
We'll get a set
of blood cultures

412
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,823
before we start
you on antibiotics.

413
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,207
I didn't ask
Dr. Shaw to treat me.

414
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,162
He's a good doctor.

415
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,014
Maybe.

416
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,951
I prefer you.

417
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,953
So does Nic.

418
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,537
I know that.

419
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,427
So how are you doing? Really?

420
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,881
I'm just tired.

421
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,634
This is all like a bad dream.

422
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,786
It'll be over, and...

423
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,006
I'm gonna stay sober this time.

424
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,276
My dad's back.

425
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,979
My family's together again.

426
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,814
We can start over.

427
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,118
And my kidneys
will get better... right?

428
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,820
Well...

429
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,039
there's no reason
not to be optimistic.

430
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:00,408
Whatever's ahead...

431
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:03,077
we'll deal with it.

432
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:05,129
Okay.

433
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,938
Get some rest.

434
00:21:18,928 --> 00:21:20,756
Nolan said that he can
do it laproscopically,

435
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,357
but because Donna can't
make decisions for herself,

436
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,426
we just need a second
physician to sign off...

437
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,177
Surgery is not gonna
cure her colon cancer.

438
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,163
She's got a DNR, and
she's going to hospice.

439
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,982
And normally I
would agree, 100%,

440
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:32,034
but, based off a conversation
that I had with Donna,

441
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,418
I really believe she wants
to make it through the night.

442
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:36,494
Why?

443
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,832
She's waiting on a
very important visitor

444
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,795
who's just been
held up by the storm.

445
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,353
Look, I have been with
Donna through years of chemo.

446
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,422
I know her, and I really think

447
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:49,885
that she would
want to go through

448
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,291
with this surgery if she could.

449
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,495
Is she insured?

450
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:58,049
Are you asking if the
surgery's covered?

451
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,866
Yeah. Sorry, that's my job.

452
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,435
CEO, fiscal responsibility.

453
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,014
Medicare and supplementals,

454
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:05,639
so yes, fully covered.

455
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,141
I'll sign off.

456
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,879
You know, better yet,
this is gonna be simple.

457
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,976
It's gonna be in and
out in under an hour.

458
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,199
I'll do the surgery myself.

459
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:20,487
Okay.

460
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:21,602
We're going somewhere.

461
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,331
What in the name
of God is going on?

462
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,428
They're playing med
student bowling, Dr. Bell.

463
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,967
You're not kindergarteners.

464
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:35,981
How many children
are there in this hospital?

465
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,588
Give them some scut to do.

466
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:39,974
Kit.

467
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:41,892
- Hi.
- Just who I'm looking for.

468
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,655
I have a surgery.
Are you free now

469
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,491
- to take care of these kids?
- Sure.

470
00:22:45,515 --> 00:22:48,382
- No. No.
- I... you know, I'm...

471
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:49,850
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

472
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:53,104
Dr. Voss has superpowers

473
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,905
even stronger than mine.

474
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:57,942
I do.

475
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,077
I...

476
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,913
break bones and put
them back together.

477
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,166
So, if you go with her

478
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:08,452
for a little while,
she can show you.

479
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,923
Come on, kids, let's go.

480
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:18,895
Okay. Thank you.

481
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,608
Let's get something
to eat, shall we?

482
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,099
You must be starving.

483
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,384
It's been a long day.

484
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,620
I'm just putting it back.

485
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,193
He looks like my dad.

486
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:33,760
You said you wanted to do this.

487
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:35,256
We have to confirm
that he's dead.

488
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,480
Start the death exam, please.

489
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,819
He's warm. I
thought he'd be cold.

490
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,882
He looks kind of alive.
This is freaking me out.

491
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,066
What happened to this guy?

492
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,626
Cardiac amyloidosis.

493
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,811
Restrictive cardiomyopathy.
Heart failure.

494
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,481
Impressive you know that.

495
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,566
I want to be a cardiologist.

496
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,413
My grandpa died
young of a heart attack.

497
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,398
My dad had a heart
attack last year, but...

498
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:03,174
he's okay now.

499
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,272
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You all right?

500
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:09,646
Okay. Sit.

501
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,148
Head between your knees.

502
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:17,271
Been an idiot.

503
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:20,741
Can't declare a guy dead.

504
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:23,277
Can you do it?

505
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:26,997
I can.

506
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,034
But you'll have to watch
so you can learn, okay?

507
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,323
No heart sounds.

508
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,416
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

509
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,486
Go on.

510
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,408
Time of death:

511
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,660
2:41 a.m.

512
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,394
<i>We're sending you</i>

513
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:20,900
a 42-year-old man,

514
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,481
presented in full
arrest, now rewarmed

515
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:25,672
with normal sinus rhythm
and stable blood pressure.

516
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,191
So we're done here?

517
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,310
Uh, since his temp
is back to normal...

518
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:30,939
My feet are killing me.

519
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,262
And triceps are hurting

520
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,431
from doing all
those compressions.

521
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,515
Don't be a whiner.

522
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:41,572
Let's get him
ready for transport.

523
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,491
His pressure's dropping.

524
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:46,860
- I'll do a quick exam.
- I'm gonna give him

525
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:48,673
a liter wide open and
start him on pressors.

526
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,030
His heart sounds muffled.

527
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:51,948
And distended neck veins.

528
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,418
Bai, pass me an echo probe.

529
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,170
Where's the Raptor?

530
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:57,821
Is he here yet?

531
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,554
- How's it going?
- Not gonna be so simple.

532
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,924
There are a lot of adhesions
from prior surgeries.

533
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,999
Gonna take a while
to work through them.

534
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,167
Oh, wait. That's dead bowel.

535
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,896
I'm gonna have to
do a bowel resection.

536
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,080
There's no way I can
do this laparoscopically.

537
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,808
Look, if this could end
with her unable to control

538
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:55,128
the end of her life, then
you need to stop now.

539
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:57,765
You asked me to bring her here.

540
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,694
Now I'm gonna
do everything I can

541
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,852
to make sure she
gets off this table alive.

542
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,505
I'm not gonna have
her die in my OR.

543
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,707
Convert to open. 10 blade.

544
00:27:17,453 --> 00:27:19,173
Raptor isn't here.

545
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,032
I can't even get
him on the phone.

546
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,506
Cell service is down.

547
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,425
So, what do we do?

548
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,643
I am making a pericardial window

549
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,657
to drain the blood
from around the heart.

550
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:32,099
The sledding accident must
have caused some traumatic injury.

551
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:34,696
Which started to bleed as
we rewarmed him on bypass.

552
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,771
The pericardium is
completely filled with blood.

553
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:39,056
15 blade.

554
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,975
Draining the pericardium.

555
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:50,161
He's bleeding too
much. I need to

556
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,819
open up his chest to control it.

557
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:53,153
Sternal saw.

558
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,540
What's going on?

559
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,002
Shouldn't we
wait for Dr. Austin?

560
00:27:58,026 --> 00:27:59,554
This man could die
if we don't proceed.

561
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:00,827
Give me the saw!

562
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,507
Activate massive
transfusion protocol.

563
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,376
Take it easy, man. Thank you.

564
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,775
No injuries to the
atria or ventricles.

565
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:33,776
We're losing him.

566
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,692
I can't find the
source of bleed.

567
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,974
Okay. Tear in the
proximal P.A. Clamp.

568
00:28:54,383 --> 00:28:55,782
Suture.

569
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:10,097
The Raptor has
arrived! Where are we?

570
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:12,399
Bit late. We've
already started closing.

571
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,384
He was in cardiac tamponade.

572
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,147
Mina had to perform
a pericardial window.

573
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,821
Then she had to open him up

574
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,156
and repair a
potentially fatal bleed.

575
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,625
It was awesome.

576
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,467
So...

577
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,888
you're telling me that
you didn't need me?

578
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:37,508
Sorry.

579
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,433
I love that.

580
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:50,237
I... I love that.

581
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:52,322
See? I told you.

582
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,575
Yes.

583
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,275
Fist bump to Okafor.

584
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:12,303
You got Bell to take
Donna to the OR?

585
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:13,693
I asked Nolan. Bell took over.

586
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,473
It was supposed to
be a simple procedure

587
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:17,776
to help with her pain and
get her back to hospice.

588
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,310
She didn't even
want a blood draw!

589
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:21,351
She was in pain,
and it was fixable.

590
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,636
I made the call.

591
00:30:26,174 --> 00:30:27,785
She's about to go
into cardiac arrest.

592
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,527
- Are we coding her?
- Yes, we are.

593
00:30:32,147 --> 00:30:35,281
No. No, she's DNR.
You got to let her go.

594
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:36,567
This isn't what she asked for.

595
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,440
- She's in cardiac arrest.
- Damn it!

596
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:54,167
A death in his OR
will go on Bell's stats.

597
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:56,185
He'll do anything to avoid that.

598
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,170
Get the defibrillator.

599
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:59,022
Dr. Bell, stop.

600
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,757
You have to stop.

601
00:31:10,185 --> 00:31:12,686
<i>Abductor pollicis,</i>

602
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:14,988
flexor pollicis brevis...

603
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:16,573
Big exam?

604
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,994
Um, these hand muscles
are impossible to remember.

605
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,080
"All for one and one for all."

606
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,532
It's a mnemonic.

607
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:27,651
It helps.

608
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,922
Are you all right?

609
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:39,796
I always thought of
myself as a... a hero.

610
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,466
Saving lives.

611
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,217
I didn't even think about death.

612
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:47,721
Death is terrifying.

613
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,140
But here's the thing, Erik:

614
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,726
You're gonna see a lot of it.

615
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:56,062
Our job is to hold it
off as long as possible

616
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,826
while never losing
sight of the fact

617
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,233
that it is a
natural part of life.

618
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:24,725
His temperature's 105.

619
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,970
He's tachycardic
and hypertensive.

620
00:32:25,994 --> 00:32:27,511
End tidal CO2 is high.

621
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,691
The urine in his Foley,
it's the color of cola.

622
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:30,797
Hey, what's going on?

623
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:32,176
His fever shot up.

624
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,549
His heart rate is sky high.

625
00:32:34,803 --> 00:32:36,302
His limbs are rigid.

626
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:37,782
Sounds like a drug reaction.

627
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:39,667
- What have we given him?
- I'm checking right now.

628
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,469
Epinephrine, heparin,
succinylcholine...

629
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,588
Stop. That's it. He was
given succs in the ER.

630
00:32:43,612 --> 00:32:45,090
His temp was so
low it probably caused

631
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:46,257
his metabolism to
dramatically slow.

632
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,980
So, once he warmed up in the OR,

633
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,927
he started to
metabolize the drug,

634
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:51,535
causing this rare reaction.

635
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,119
Malignant hyperthermia.

636
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:54,932
He's literally gone from
dying by being too cold

637
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:56,206
to dying by being too hot.

638
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:57,819
Well, let's treat
him with dantrolene.

639
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:58,953
That helps, but the problem is,

640
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,617
we need to get his
temperature down quick.

641
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,800
More snow.

642
00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:09,386
Looks like you did
come to the rescue.

643
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:10,954
Got it?

644
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,683
His temperature is 105.

645
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,141
Hurry it up, people.

646
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:16,096
Pack the snow all
around his body.

647
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,978
Hey, how can we help?

648
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,564
Hey, more troops.

649
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,880
We're building a snow
angel. Why don't you pitch in.

650
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,120
Let's hope this works.

651
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:42,252
- You guys good?
- Yeah.

652
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,478
Her blood cultures came
back. Her catheter was infected.

653
00:33:51,513 --> 00:33:53,597
Conrad was right.

654
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:56,032
I need a new one placed,
but for now, I'll finish

655
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,167
the course of
antibiotics you started.

656
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,586
That'll take care of it.

657
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,388
Well, thanks for checking in.

658
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:15,919
Okay, are you gonna say it,

659
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:18,266
- or are you gonna
make me say it?
- Say what?

660
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:23,794
Nic, the man with
the hair and the eyes...

661
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,244
he wants you.

662
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,075
Maybe you should
worry about your kidneys.

663
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,910
I am, but my
kidneys are so boring

664
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,183
compared to your love life.

665
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:31,796
Come on, tell me.

666
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,897
Spill. What's going on?

667
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:35,872
Look, I... I need Alec.

668
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:39,476
The clinic needs Alec.
The patients need Alec.

669
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:41,460
You're using him.

670
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,375
I'm being pragmatic.

671
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,150
Totally. I'm impressed.

672
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,435
Hey, if you're into
the hair and the eyes,

673
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,132
I can totally send
him your direction.

674
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,623
Oh, yeah. Nothing turns a guy on

675
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,409
like getting to second
base with a girl's catheter.

676
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,433
She's off the vent.

677
00:35:09,457 --> 00:35:12,509
Off pressors.
Breathing on her own.

678
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,195
Vitals are stable.

679
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:23,686
Donna.

680
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:27,907
Hey.

681
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:31,695
- I am so happy you're awake.
- Ah.

682
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,883
Look who's doing great.

683
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,381
What happened?

684
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,200
You had a strangulated
hernia, and surgery

685
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:46,426
was the only way to keep
you from dying in the hospital.

686
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:48,011
We took a chance.

687
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,382
Been so worried we
did the wrong thing.

688
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,185
Well, you kind of did.

689
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,890
It might have been easier
if I just never woke up.

690
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:04,160
But I know you
were only trying to do

691
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,730
what you thought
was right for me.

692
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,598
I do respect that.

693
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:14,070
Besides, now I get
to go to hospice,

694
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,289
see Bob again.

695
00:36:16,325 --> 00:36:18,219
You just saying that

696
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:19,303
to make me feel better?

697
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:21,328
Mm, maybe.

698
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:27,083
Well... maybe not.

699
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,573
Ah, sun's rising,
the storm's over, so...

700
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,475
we can get you to hospice now.

701
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:41,898
Not yet.

702
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,017
Donna has a visitor.

703
00:36:45,187 --> 00:36:46,619
Oh.

704
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:58,231
How is he?

705
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:02,118
Still unconscious, but
his vitals are stable.

706
