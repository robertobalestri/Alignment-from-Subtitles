I want a top-notch attorney,

179
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,557
someone who wears a
fancier suit than you do,

180
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,642
and I get half a million dollars

181
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,011
to make bail so I can
get out of this rat hole.

182
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:18,346
Don't worry, sweetheart,

183
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:20,698
I can pay you
back when I get out.

184
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:24,152
I have a couple of
loaded offshore accounts.

185
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,015
I just can't access
them while I'm in prison.

186
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,622
What do I get in return?

187
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:30,574
I make sure to keep
you and Chastain

188
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,695
out of this entire case.

189
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,430
♪ ♪

190
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,502
Ah, good.

191
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,371
I have some very big
news to share with you.

192
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,490
QuoVadis is going public.

193
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,310
- That's terrific.
- Yes. But before the IPO,

194
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:52,763
we need a successful launch
of the vagus nerve stimulator.

195
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,884
The profit potential
of that device is...

196
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,402
enormous.

197
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,670
It'll be like a
pacemaker for the brain,

198
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,573
treating everything from
depression to epilepsy.

199
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,709
Damn thing even cures hiccups.

200
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:08,446
I will do whatever it takes
to make the VNS a success.

201
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,565
But, Gordon, can I ask you

202
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,683
- a few questions?
- Of course.

203
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,402
I just assisted on a case

204
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:18,590
with a man whose metal-on-metal
hip implant poisoned him.

205
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,609
It made him blind, almost deaf,

206
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,078
and demented.

207
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,729
Geez. That's horrific.

208
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,449
Uh, the model must
have been defective.

209
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,936
It was. I researched the
company that made the hip.

210
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,789
And they imported all
their devices from China

211
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,809
and pretended it
was made in the U.S.

212
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:40,394
I discovered...

213
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,630
you worked for that company.

214
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,486
If I understand what
you're saying, uh... it's true.

215
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:51,022
But I was very young.
I was barely an intern.

216
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:55,709
Look, I founded QuoVadis

217
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:59,480
to create the change
that I want to see.

218
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,816
That's why we manufacture
everything ourselves

219
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,551
right here in Atlanta.

220
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:05,837
We import nothing from
China, so that I can ensure

221
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:09,023
that we are making products
that patients can trust.

222
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:12,443
You know, this...

223
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,778
isn't a job to me.

224
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,516
This is my calling.

225
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,487
That's what I needed to hear.

226
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:27,102
- Thank you. <i>I'm
calling from Chastain.</i>

227
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,976
Chastain Park Memorial!

228
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:30,840
Hey, Atlanta General
ER is on diversion.

229
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,104
This is the start of a day
from hell. Move faster.

230
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,666
Look, I've already been
on hold for over an hour.

231
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,018
Patient records at Atlanta
General, poison control.

232
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,183
Yeah, patient in 8 has been
waiting an hour. Figure it out.

233
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,617
Irving!

234
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,186
Pravesh!

235
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,709
- What happened?
- Henry had a grand mal seizure

236
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,640
on the field... It's lasted
over 20 minutes now.

237
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:49,192
He has a history
of seizures, right?

238
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,944
Yes. Absence seizures,
but stable on medications.

239
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:53,267
He's never had a seizure

240
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:54,847
- like this before.
- On my count.

241
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,937
One, two, three.

242
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,539
Thank you.

243
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,143
Hey. Go.

244
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:03,494
We got this.

245
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,813
Let go. All right.

246
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,017
- Thanks for coming in.
- Well, it's rare you call

247
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:11,497
for a peds
neurologist to the ER,

248
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,761
so I figured it was important.

249
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,541
Well, he's already on
valproic acid at home.

250
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,343
We need to add a third
agent, phenobarbital.

251
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,812
Another medication?

252
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,564
Zoey, I know this is a lot,

253
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,285
but we have to be aggressive
to control these seizures.

254
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,508
This is Julian Booth.

255
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:57,727
Hello, I'm calling from
Medicine Tracking Dynamics.

256
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,835
QuoVadis pays us to
monitor prescription drugs

257
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:02,920
and alert them of
prospective patients.

258
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,223
<i>There's one at
Chastain Park Memorial</i>

259
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,942
<i>that's now receiving
three anti-seizure meds:</i>

260
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,878
fosphenytoin, valproic
acid and phenobarbital.

261
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:13,247
Which makes him a VNS candidate.

262
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,133
<i>QuoVadis flagged this as
high priority on your account.</i>

263
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,469
<i>I don't have a patient name,</i>

264
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,906
but the order came
from Chastain ER.

265
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,897
Hey.

266
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:32,100
You look busy.

267
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,819
Always.

268
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,391
Devon, this doesn't
have to be weird.

269
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,311
We are completely
capable of still being friends.

270
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,049
Agreed.

271
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:50,062
So, friend,

272
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,585
what can I do for you?

273
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:53,604
I got a call about a patient

274
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,624
in the ER who was just put
on several anti-seizure meds.

275
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,909
Henry Barnett.
Status epilepticus.

276
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,845
He's looking rough.

277
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,913
Poor kid.

278
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,683
His brother died
here a month ago.

279
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,802
I didn't know it was a child.

280
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,487
What's this about?

281
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,840
Um... nothing.

282
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,427
Are you telling
me he has cancer?

283
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,313
- No, that's not...
- Five hours in the ER

284
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,936
only to get in here

285
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,289
to have you look at
us like he's going to die.

286
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:29,852
- Ms. Waverly,
I know that you're concer...
- Are you a nurse?

287
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:30,992
What are you?

288
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:34,178
A med student? This
man is my whole life,

289
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,142
and you're the one
that's going to save him?

290
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,033
No. I want somebody
that doesn't have that look

291
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,935
on their face.

292
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,171
I'm ordering a CT...

293
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:48,309
a CT to see what is going on

294
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:49,688
so I can hopefully
rule out cancer.

295
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:52,313
See you in five hours.

296
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:55,900
It's okay, baby. Don't worry.

297
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,518
It's okay.

298
00:13:57,553 --> 00:14:00,371
I am enjoying our stroll,

299
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,218
but don't you two
have other things to do?

300
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,536
Are you kidding? I always
have time for my favorite patient.

301
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,228
- We know what today is.
- And we have

302
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,642
no intention of letting
you face it alone, Wallace.

303
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,367
My wife, Anna,
would've been 36 today.

304
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:14,185
Remember her last birthday

305
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,171
- in ICU? We
threw quite a party.

306
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:19,590
It's hard to believe

307
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,760
my wife spent the last
year of her life at Chastain.

308
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,390
I don't think there's
a doctor or nurse

309
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:25,496
who didn't know her.

310
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,198
A great lady.

311
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,434
Think, uh, both of you...

312
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,102
And the whole staff...

313
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,620
Did all you could to save her.

314
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,042
Now I'm the patient.

315
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,778
Another year has gone by,

316
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,775
and now it's my turn
to spend my days here,

317
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,266
waiting for a new heart.

318
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:49,003
And until we find one,
you're stuck with us, Wallace.

319
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,756
Oh, she means
you're stuck with<i> her.</i>

320
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,875
I'm delightful.

321
00:14:54,911 --> 00:14:57,778
Hey.

322
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,081
I heard about Henry.

323
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,865
How's he doing?

324
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,312
Finally broke his seizures.

325
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,114
Now he's reacting
negatively to the medications.

326
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,839
Well, I'm sure Dr. Eckart
has it under control.

327
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:12,776
He's Henry's doctor now.

328
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,769
I can't step back.

329
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:24,772
Not after everything I've
seen this family go through.

330
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,824
I know.

331
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,876
But this is why we try

332
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:31,245
to keep a safe distance
from our patients.

333
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,087
- I should get in there.
- Yeah.

334
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,509
Hey, buddy.

335
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,095
- You hanging in there?
- Yeah.

336
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:50,398
Is this gonna hurt?

337
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:53,767
Nah. You'll feel a little pinch.

338
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:55,531
That's just the
numbing medication.

339
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,715
After that all you'll feel
is a little bit of pressure.

340
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,044
You're really brave, baby.

341
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,799
Got a question for you.

342
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,111
Who's your favorite
baseball player?

343
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,968
Bryce Harper.

344
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,714
Washington Nationals.

345
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,421
That is a solid choice.

346
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:16,757
Tell Dr. Hawkins why
you like Bryce Harper.

347
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:19,810
His cleats are awesome.

348
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,475
Your decision's
based on footwear?

349
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:24,932
He's supercool.

350
00:16:24,968 --> 00:16:29,219
Henry, you are one tough kid.

351
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,982
And I bet your
buddy Bryce Harper

352
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:33,658
would think you're
supercool, too.

353
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,647
<i>This boy</i>

354
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:41,799
is perfect for the VNS.

355
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,746
I mean, we're never gonna
get a more sympathetic patient.

356
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,003
Spectacular optics.

357
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,339
So, the VNS is approved
for use in pediatric patients?

358
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,869
I'm sure Gordon
has crossed his T's

359
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,660
and dotted the I's on this one.

360
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,023
Indeed, I have. We're approved.

361
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,864
But as a 510 device?

362
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,367
I know. She's worried
because with 510 FDA approval,

363
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:01,702
there's often no testing

364
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:04,639
before a device gets
implanted in patients,

365
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:06,955
which is exactly why
QuoVadis does its own research.

366
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,228
Now, we haven't published yet.

367
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,817
But everything is here,
and it's all that any doctor

368
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,536
could possibly ask for.

369
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,499
If you meet with any
resistance, just don't hesitate

370
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:23,043
to let me know. I want to make
sure we're all on the same page.

371
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:37,338
So, are you done?

372
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:40,390
Should we be concerned
about Micah's heart rate?

373
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,576
Your boy's gonna be fine.

374
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:43,728
We just need to adjust

375
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,574
his beta-blockers and
order a sleep study.

376
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,448
You can go ahead and button up.

377
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,668
Mina, can I talk to you outside
about a separate matter?

378
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,795
Listen, don't let your
all-consuming worry

379
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,198
for lover boy make
you lose your focus.

380
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,928
Nothing gets in
the way of my work,

381
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,952
and stop calling him lover boy.

382
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,487
It's becoming annoying.

383
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,574
We got a heart.

384
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,837
Dr. Austin, you're
on Wallace Troke's

385
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,288
transplant team
this week, right?

386
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,228
- Just say yes.
- Yes.

387
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,764
Isn't this the dude with
takotsubo cardiomyopathy?

388
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,761
- Broken heart syndrome.
- The first case I've seen

389
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:24,814
where grief literally
broke someone's heart.

390
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:25,819
His wife, Anna,

391
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,472
died here after a long illness.

392
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:31,275
Every day for a year he walked
three miles just to be with her

393
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,977
and then three miles back home.

394
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,428
Were there no buses running?

395
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:35,930
He liked to walk.

396
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,159
Said it made him
feel the importance

397
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,415
of his daily commitment

398
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,102
- to be with her.
- Oh, adorable, if nutty.

399
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,804
His only chance of
surviving is this transplant.

400
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,867
The good news is we found
an organ that's a match.

401
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,259
But we need you to harvest
it at Methodist Memorial.

402
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,677
Have you ever
assisted in the harvest

403
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,091
- of a heart?
- No.

404
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:54,097
Is that an invitation

405
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,510
- to accompany you?
- Do you need it

406
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,202
- embossed on stationery?
- I do not.

407
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,157
Then let's get
this ball rolling.

408
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,342
Dividing the pulmonary veins

409
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,032
and main P.A.

410
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,518
It is a perfect
organ for Wallace.

411
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,204
And what are we
looking for, Dr. Okafor?

412
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:26,230
Defects and
vegetations on the valves.

413
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,959
And an adequate
rim of atrial tissue

414
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,650
next to the coronary sinus.

415
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,353
I was getting to that.

416
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,504
I know.

417
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,353
Charge.

418
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:59,513
Clear.

419
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,886
Ah.

420
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,222
Now, back to Chastain,

421
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:10,577
where the transplant team
will put this beautiful organ

422
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,375
in our man Wallace.

423
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:16,842
Henry's LP ruled
out an infection,

424
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:18,677
and his MRI didn't show
anything concerning.

425
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,784
And that's good news.

426
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,435
Yes, but it still means

427
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,932
we don't know what's
causing his seizures.

428
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,456
Truth is, sometimes
we never know.

429
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,926
Henry's EEG still shows
runs of nonconvulsive seizures.

430
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,045
With their length and frequency,
if this goes on much longer,

431
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,231
he can sustain
permanent brain damage.

432
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,450
Brain damage?

433
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,642
What do you suggest we do now?

434
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,094
If the seizures continue,

435
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:48,791
we're gonna have to
put Henry into a coma

436
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,281
so that his brain can rest.

437
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,782
Are there any other options?

438
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,818
Actually, there is.

439
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,272
Julian, this is Henry's
mom, Zoey Barnett.

440
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:01,975
Julian Booth works
with a cutting-edge

441
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,721
new medical device
company, QuoVadis.

442
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:07,164
I am so sorry Henry's
going though this.

443
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,233
But we may have a solution.

444
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,601
We have a new VNS
device designed for cases

445
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,003
exactly like your son's.

446
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,439
VNS devices are a last resort.

447
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,057
And they've all had

448
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:19,659
significant side effects,
including sudden death.

449
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:23,564
This newest version is
thoroughly tested and safe.

450
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,849
This is for Dr. Eckart.

451
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,985
He is the doctor
who makes this call,

452
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,169
along with Henry's mom.

453
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,255
There are trials that show

454
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,185
it can be used much
earlier in epilepsy,

455
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,176
sometimes removing the
need of medications altogether.

456
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,612
If you have access
to an improved VNS

457
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,108
that can be used
sooner in epilepsy,

458
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,681
it's a game-changer.

459
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,968
Henry could lead a
life free of seizures.

460
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:48,039
If the alternative is
putting Henry in a coma

461
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,936
or keeping him on toxic
meds, isn't this worth the risk?

462
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,326
We don't know that yet.

463
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:56,108
This is not a decision
I would rush into.

464
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:58,315
If it were me,

465
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,295
I would have Dr. Eckart
go over all the data,

466
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,599
and then you take it from there.

467
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,689
- Dr. Eckart, would you mind?
- Not at all.

468
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,474
I'll get back to you.

469
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,843
Right.

470
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:15,616
They'll take you up to
pre-op and get you ready

471
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:18,202
for when your new
heart gets here.

472
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,722
Thank you.

473
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:32,833
You worried about the surgery?

474
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:36,420
If I die...

475
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,472
when I'm under...

476
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:40,708
I'm ready.

477
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:42,576
I'll get to be with Anna.

478
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,362
Wallace, this is a
chance at a whole new life.

479
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,347
I'm starting to think

480
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:50,400
that heart might be better
served in somebody else.

481
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:54,421
Not sure I want
a whole new life.

482
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,090
Not if it still feels
like this one.

483
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,611
Grief is horrible.

484
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,347
Breaks you into a
million pieces, I know.

485
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,583
But I promise you,

486
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,269
it will get easier.

487
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,423
How?

488
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:16,059
By keeping Anna's memory alive.

489
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,345
If you die, all that
goes with you.

490
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,915
Who's gonna be here to talk
about how special Anna was?

491
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,785
How amazing you were together?

492
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,457
I'll see you in recovery.

493
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,609
Yeah.

494
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,128
And... and thank you.

495
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,483
Thank you for coming
down to consult.

496
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,302
No problem.

497
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,422
Did you lose a little weight
since the last time I saw you?

498
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,824
The day hasn't
started off so great.

499
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,609
Hi.

500
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,478
Finally, a specialist.

501
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,213
We've been waiting two hours,

502
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:56,666
and this Indian doctor is
the only one who's seen us.

503
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,463
- What's the story?
- 75-year-old male

504
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:02,005
with two days abdominal
cramping and vomiting.

505
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,791
CT shows a partial SBO.

506
00:24:03,826 --> 00:24:06,176
Mm-hmm. Okay. Can
I talk to you for a sec?

507
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:12,732
What is this?

508
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:14,596
- He has a bowel obstruction.
- Partial.

509
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,248
- With a soft abdomen.
- But he has significant

510
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:18,255
pain and is still vomiting.

511
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,623
He needs to be admitted.

512
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,119
To medicine.
This is not surgical.

513
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:22,370
Next time, check
with your resident

514
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,634
before you call for a consult.

515
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,112
Do not waste my time again.

516
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,731
Find a pair of
scrubs that fit you.

517
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:43,096
Could you imagine
loving someone so much

518
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:45,165
it could literally
break your heart?

519
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:49,686
No.

520
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,274
What about Micah?

521
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,326
Can he break your heart?

522
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,696
No man can break it.

523
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:04,534
What have you been through
that makes you so invincible?

524
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,909
It was 2014, and I was finishing
up medical school in Nigeria.

525
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:17,047
My mother is a surgeon,
working non-stop and

526
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,183
gone for all hours,

527
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:23,270
so it was my responsibility
to look after my sisters.

528
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,153
One night, after
dinner, I put them to bed

529
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:31,378
and... and decided
to take a quick nap.

530
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,548
A quick nap turned
into a deep sleep.

531
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,017
And when I woke up,

532
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,069
the whole house was on fire.

533
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,673
Immediately, I knew...

534
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,692
I had left the stove on.

535
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,263
I tried to save Kadara
and Ngozi, but...

536
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,299
I couldn't.

537
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,204
They were 12 and 11.

538
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:06,296
Wow. I'm... sorry.

539
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,816
I loved my sisters very much.

540
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:13,787
The grief and...

541
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,056
guilt consumed me.

542
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:23,847
Emotions can enrich our lives,
but they can also destroy us.

543
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,801
Now, I never want to
talk about it ever again.

544
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:55,595
It's been an hour. I
think it's time you called it.

545
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:09,576
Time of death, 12:03.

546
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,446
I'll speak to the family.

547
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:15,515
Take a break.

548
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:30,980
My husband is
still in severe pain!

549
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:32,894
Where are we at
with his treatment?

550
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,736
Can you just do the right
thing and come check on him?!

551
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:41,157
Hello.

552
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,476
Okay. Okay.

553
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,512
All right.

554
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,961
We'll up his pain meds and...

555
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:51,662
If you just, um,
give me a minute.

556
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:54,020
Excuse me?

557
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:56,539
I have a 75-year-old man
with a small bowel obstruction,

558
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,792
ER Bay Three. We
need to admit him.

559
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,711
Absolutely not. Call surgery.

560
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,880
I did. They won't admit.

561
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,676
Neither will I. I'm
not taking an SBO.

562
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,717
If he gets better, he goes home.
If he gets worse, they operate.

563
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,647
I'm not going to admit
him just to baby-sit.

564
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,708
We need a doctor over here!

565
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:17,194
Paramedics found
him on the freeway

566
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,478
with a meth pipe in hand.

567
00:28:18,514 --> 00:28:19,991
Let's get him ten
of IM haloperidol

568
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:21,381
and check his blood sugar.

569
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:27,905
Eye station, now!

570
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,169
What happened to your break?!

571
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:33,954
- All right,
let's get him to Bay Nine.
- Okay.

572
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:46,557
Is he all right?

573
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:49,409
His seizures are
getting harder to control.

574
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:51,744
And the medications
we're giving him are starting

575
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,680
to affect his liver function.

576
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:56,099
So what do I do now?

577
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,236
I know you're scared, Zoey,

578
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,555
but, just-just give this
a little bit more time.

579
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:02,889
That's not an option.

580
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:05,224
Zoey needs to make her decision.

581
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,243
Soon.

582
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,231
Dr. Randolph Bell, chief
of surgery and the CEO

583
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:15,046
of Chastain has heard
about Henry's case, would like

584
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,255
to talk to you about
the VNS device.

585
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,926
As we've discussed, the VNS

586
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:25,311
is the best option
available to your son.

587
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,265
Well, I've looked
carefully at the data, and

588
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,284
- the results aren't clear.
- Doctors aren't trained

589
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:33,514
to consistently evaluate
this type of dense research.

590
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,755
The man can read.

591
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,225
And what he read said
the sample size is dismal.

592
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,828
But the device has
been approved, right?

593
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,447
It has... by the FDA.

594
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,415
So then why is
everyone so nervous?

595
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,284
- Everyone isn't.
- I am.

596
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,985
A high percentage of devices

597
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,782
are recalled after they've
been put in patients

598
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:53,807
- and have caused
permanent damage.
- That has happened

599
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:57,027
with other companies,
but not QuoVadis.

600
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,590
I wish there were more options

601
00:29:58,614 --> 00:30:00,454
with less risk. There are not.

602
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:05,430
You've already lost a son,

603
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:07,704
and I want to do everything
possible to ensure

604
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,689
that doesn't happen again.

605
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,474
I strongly recommend you do not

606
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,044
go down this path with the VNS.

607
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,346
Ultimately, this is your call.

608
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:20,100
But I will tell you, if
this... were my child,

609
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:23,653
I would move forward
and implant the VNS.

610
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:34,314
Dr. Chao has done
several of these surgeries.

611
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,483
He's highly-experienced
with the VNS.

612
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:38,835
Has he implanted it in a child?

613
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,720
I want this to go perfectly.

614
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,969
I-I feel responsible.

615
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:46,577
And if the data
isn't really there...

616
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,823
You really think Gordon Page
would manufacture products

617
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,114
that aren't safe?

618
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,990
Hmm. Well done, Dr. Bell.

619
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,376
This is an historic day.

620
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,678
The first of many, I'm sure.

621
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,180
Whoa. Hold up.

622
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:31,571
The front of the
heart stopped moving.

623
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:34,774
It's acute hypokinesis
of the anterior wall.

624
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,510
There's a block in
the middle of the LAD.

625
00:31:37,546 --> 00:31:39,407
The heart is having
a heart attack.

626
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,415
Yo, let's go!

627
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:49,055
Is Wallace ready for surgery?

628
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,573
Yes, in OR Two

629
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,320
- under general anesthesia.
- Good.

630
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,456
He'll die if we put him
back on the waiting list.

631
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,913
This heart may not be
perfect, but once we fix it,

632
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,210
it'll be his best shot. I need
to get his saphenous vein.

633
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:00,867
Should we use his LIMA?

634
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:02,830
It'll take 20 minutes
to open his chest.

635
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,799
You can get a
saphenous vein in five.

636
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,551
Time is heart.

637
00:32:06,575 --> 00:32:09,325
Get me a vein retrieval kit

638
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,878
and start prepping
the left lower leg for

639
00:32:11,914 --> 00:32:13,914
saphenous vein harvest.

640
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:22,172
Octopus clamp.

641
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:25,275
I thought you'd be quicker.

642
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,255
Please. That was a world record.

643
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,742
I've never done bypass on
a beating heart. Can I assist?

644
00:32:30,766 --> 00:32:32,744
Oh, now was that
ever a question?

645
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,350
Hand Dr. Okafor the pickups.

646
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,298
Spatulate the end of
the saphenous vein,

647
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:39,106
and I will do the
arteriotomy. #11 blade to me.

648
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:53,486
7-0 Prolene.

649
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:00,655
Be careful with your bites...

650
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,062
Keep them evenly spaced out.

651
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:13,373
A little quicker.

652
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,657
I am suturing the aorta.

653
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,992
This is delicate work.

654
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:16,977
The heart is losing oxygen.

655
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,211
It could not care less.

656
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:21,732
Done.

657
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,166
Mm. Ah.

658
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:24,151
There's a small leak.

659
00:33:24,186 --> 00:33:27,003
Mm. I see it.

660
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,705
Adding another stitch.

661
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,660
There.

662
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,181
You fixed it.

663
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,350
We fixed it.

664
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:51,595

the gift of a new life?

both for Chastain and QuoVadis.

689
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,047

Yeah.

695
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:27,991
Great learning
opportunity for Dr. Okafor.

696
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,026
It's not often you
get to operate

697
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,261
on a heart in a box.

698
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,214
Hmm.

699
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,046
Does she know
you're in love with her?

700
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,837
I beg your pardon?

701
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:45,842
I'm her teacher, her mentor.

702
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,312
To be anything else would cross
a line that I would never cross.

703
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:52,248
That must be hard on you.

704
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,534
I deal.

705
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,137
And life is long.

706
00:35:57,172 --> 00:35:59,822
Eventually, one day, I
will not be her mentor,

707
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,858
and she'll be my equal.

708
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,039
For a guy who doesn't
wear his heart on his sleeve,

709
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,396
that was an impressive share.

710
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:10,016
Let's just keep this between us,

711
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,462
all right?

712
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,406
♪ ♪

713
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:31,171
Hey.

714
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,690
You're on in 20.

715
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:39,095
Ships passing.

716
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,081
Henry's in recovery,

717
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,366
if you want to check in on him.

718
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,605
Thank you for the update, but...

719
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:56,529
I think it's best if I just
let his mom be with him.

720
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,726
Rough day?

721
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:13,063
Not really.

722
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:16,132
A touch of racism
from a paranoid wife.

723
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:18,551
Got physically attacked
by a psychotic meth head.

724
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:20,953
And what am I forgetting? Um...

725
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,891
Right. Priya told me we have
to move to San Francisco.

726
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:34,501
Your turn.

727
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:40,623
I have always been
sure about my field.

728
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,809
But now...

729
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,995
I wonder if I'm
making a difference

730
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:48,547
or if I'm adding

731
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:51,167
to a very big problem.

732
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:54,804
You are smart, Julian.

733
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,989
And passionate.

734
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,841
And honest.

735
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,729
The device industry needs people
like you to fix a broken system.

736
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:04,291
If you see something
that's not right,

737
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:08,134
you will be there to
blow the whistle and fix it.

738
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,171
Could the same
be said about you?

739
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,035
There aren't many
people like you, Devon.

740
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,242
Hardly any, in fact.

741
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:19,129
You were meant to be a doctor.

742
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:40,027
- Randolph Bell.
<i>- You have a collect call</i>

743

Yes.

747
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,558
So, have you got
an answer for me?

748
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:52,111
If it's not the one I want
to hear, that video of us

749
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:54,531

750
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,783
I've, um,

<i>narrowed the list of

752

<i>Yes.</i>

754
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:05,474

<i>- Now, I suggest we</i>

759
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:21,040
play on the same team from
now on, or at least pretend to.

760
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:24,193
When do I get to
breathe fresh air again?

761
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,263
Soon.

762
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,915
Very soon.

763
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:52,104
Hi, I'm one of the
sales reps for QuoVadis.

764
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,517
I know we don't
normally come down

765
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,052
to where we actually
build the devices,

766
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:57,209
but I need to
double-check on an order

767
00:39:57,245 --> 00:39:58,861
for, uh, Chastain Park.

768
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,279
Could you help me?

769
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,714
I will be so quick.

770
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,115
I promise.

771
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:08,787
You've got five minutes.

772
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,663
Thank you. That's all I need.

773
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,118
We manufacture
everything ourselves,

774
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,742
right here, in Atlanta.

775
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,762
<i>We import nothing from China.</i>

776
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,584
<i>This isn't a job to me.</i>

777
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,470
This is my calling.

778
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,234
Oh, my God.

779
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,363
What happened to you?

780
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:28,251
The question should be
what didn't happen to me.

781
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:31,370
I have had

782
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,723
some pretty terrible days

783
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,508
as a doctor, but today

784
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:38,828
just might take the prize.

785
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:42,631
That looks really swollen.

786
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,583
Are you sure you're okay?

787
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:51,157
Today, I got kicked around.

788
00:41:51,192 --> 00:41:53,192
Abused.

789
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:55,110
Unappreciated.

790
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,966
At times, I just felt
completely useless.

791
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:04,420
Then come with
me to San Francisco.

792
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:12,645
It's not easy.

793
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,325
If it were,

794
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:16,332
everyone would be a doctor,

795
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,103
because it is the
best job in the world.

796
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,338
Despite everything.

797
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,225
Because of everything.

798
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,162
I wouldn't trade my worst
day at Chastain for my best

799
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:33,449
making medical
devices in Silicon Valley.

800
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,727
I can't leave.

801
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,147
I'm sorry.

802
00:42:53,922 --> 00:42:57,523
But, hey, hey...

803
00:42:57,558 --> 00:42:59,258
this doesn't mean

804
00:42:59,293 --> 00:43:02,061
that I don't want to figure
out how to make this work.

805
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:07,233
But is it really what you want?
