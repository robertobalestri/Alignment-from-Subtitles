<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- Why the QuoVadis valve?

2
00:00:03,654 --> 00:00:05,904
It would have to take a
great product to get me

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,791
- to change my ways.
<i>- The VNS went perfectly.</i>

4
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:10,053
- His seizures have already
stopped. <i>Bradley's coming in</i>

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,211
<i>- for a heart valve.</i>
- Cheers.

6
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,473
The website said
QuoVadis is the new protocol

7
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:14,746
<i>here at Chastain.</i>

8
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,342
You don't get to make surprise

9
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,511
unilateral decisions
that affect our patients.

10
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:19,712
When you grab the
valve, it helps to...

11
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,431
This damn valve is too big.

12
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,149
You're holding it upside down,

13
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:25,707
which is what Julian
was trying to tell you.

14
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:28,660
I'll help you get your line down
if you give me some pointers

15
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,507
<i>on how to run our
clinic. Dr. Shaw,</i>

16
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,764
- you start tomorrow.
- I start now.

17
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,599
Coming.

18
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:44,537
This'll get you
through tomorrow.

19
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:46,122
It's a good thing Chastain's
right across the street.

20
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,957
I can't believe our
shipment was delayed.

21
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,866
- I can. How's your dad?
- Crabby.

22
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:53,702
Which I am embracing, because
it means he's feeling better,

23
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:55,587
so... look at this place.

24
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,956
I barely recognize
it. Very impressive.

25
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,375
Sheer force of will.

26
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,010
Are we forgetting anything?

27
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:04,096
Actually, we are.
Where did I put the...

28
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,164
Oh, there it is.

29
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:12,921
Ah, yes, the
ribbon-cutting ceremony.

30
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:15,235
<i>We're here live at
the grand opening</i>

31

<i>where low-income or
uninsured residents can get</i>

33
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:23,298
<i>- the medical care</i>
<i>they greatly need.</i>
- Guess we're open.

34
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,662
- Yeah! <i>This grand opening
marks a new beginning</i>

35
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:29,121
<i>for those in need
in Atlanta, Georgia.</i>

36
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,635
<i>Lane Hunter was allegedly
giving chemotherapy</i>

37
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,892
<i>to people who
didn't have cancer.</i>

38
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,139
<i>In a dramatic turn of events,
Hunter was found dead</i>

39
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:39,414
<i>inside her Atlanta hotel room,

40

<i>as Roger Stanley, the

43
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,519
Thank you so much for
coming to the rescue, man,

44
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,087
I promise I am not one of
those guys that only calls

45
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,012
- when he needs something. Yeah.
- This is your big presentation,

46
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,648
okay? You land QuoVadis
as a client for your firm

47
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,794
and you will be the hottest
medical marketing consultant

48
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,652
- in Atlanta.
- You are right.

49
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,198
I have worked super hard
to get this meeting ever since

50
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,950
my surgery and I
can't blow it now.

51
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:07,108
Even though the idea of pitching
to Bell gives me the sweats.

52
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:10,963
Listen, just be yourself, okay?

53
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,748
You are a natural salesman.

54
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:14,427
But I got to have my props,
man. So please tell me

55
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:17,669
you can fix this, okay?
No slideshow, no<i> bueno.</i>

56
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,988
It's just a bad cable.

57
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:22,352
- You got a spare?
- Why would anyone
have two of those?

58
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,426
As it happens, I do.

59
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,127
- Hold on.
- Seriously?

60
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,213
Oh, you rock. I suck.

61
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,666
All right, so, tonight,
we hang, okay?

62
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:34,336
Get some pizza, couple of brews,
we'll play some<i> Call of Honor.</i>

63
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:36,199
I let you win
because we all know

64
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,867
that's where I
rock and you suck.

65
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,425
Hey. Not taking no
for an answer, man.

66
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,394
No pineapple on the pizza, ever.

67
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,463
- That's a deal-breaker.
- Selfish, okay?

68
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,744
But I agree to your terms
because I value this friendship.

69
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,451
But, for now, yeah, I got to go.

70
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:51,787
So you just come over
whenever. Uh, I should be back

71
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,717
around 5:00 and I'll
see you then, man.

72
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:54,917
- Thank you.
- Bradley.

73
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,609
Yeah. Oh.

74
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,383
I want that suit.

75
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,819
Five grand and my London
tailor will make it happen.

76
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,171
I'm in.

77
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:13,324
Oh. Back-to-back
marketing contenders.

78
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,227
This should be interesting.

79
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,223
By the end of the day we'll
have a winning campaign

80
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,431
to make QuoVadis
a household name.

81
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,306
- All we need now is...
- An offshore bank account
to hide all our money.

82
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:27,989
The new QuoVadis
website isn't just advertising,

83
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:30,158
it's an interactive
world built to engage

84
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:32,327
those people who
need medical devices.

85
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,663
Providing a hybrid of
technical information

86
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:38,850
and moving testimonials
from real QuoVadis patients,

87
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,886
one visit to the
company website,

88
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,915
and future clients
will be able to ask

89
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:45,540
for a QuoVadis device by name.

90
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:48,793
Using search engine marketing,

91
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:52,196
our ads and educational
materials will dominate...

92
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,267
with a big push in social media.

93
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,103
My only question: how fast

94
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,605
can we get it up and running?

95
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,391
I'm sorry. I, uh...

96
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:04,810
I, uh, I don't feel so well.

97
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,180
Call 911.

98
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:12,733
No pulse.

99
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,113
Uh, yes, we have an emergency.

100
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:16,071
Come on.

101
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:19,157
The QuoVadis building.

102
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:33,127
- Dr. Bell, what are you
doing here?
- It's Bradley.

103
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,227
- Go.
- 32-year-old male.

104
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:40,812
Witnessed cardiac arrest.

105
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,258
Recent mitral valve
replacement with a history

106
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,932
of ventricular hypertrophy.

107
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,078
ROSC achieved en
route, lost the pulse again.

108
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:46,162
Last epi two minutes ago.

109
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,520
Okay. Another large bore IV.

110
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,776
Okay. One, two, three.

111
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,104
Come on.

112
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,833
Still in asystole.

113
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:09,385
20 minutes since
he's had a pulse.

114
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,792
More bicarb.

115
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,882
Come on.

116
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,350
Pulse and rhythm check.

117
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,027
Another amp of bicarb.

118
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,345
It's Bradley!

119
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:33,098
Oh, my God.

120
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,134
Another round of epi.

121
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,437
Come on! Come on!

122
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:42,190
Hurry!

123
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:52,751
Come on.

124
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,055
Okay, okay.

125
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,007
Pulse and rhythm check.

126
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,432
Come on...

127
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,854
How long has he been down?

128
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:14,355
30 minutes.

129
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,276
I need a portable ultrasound.

130
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,528
Let's go!

131
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:25,083
Come on. Come on!

132
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,720
Hold compressions.

133
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:55,296
There is no cardiac activity.

Preliminary autopsy results.

138
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:07,695
I just need to fill out
the death certificate.

139
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,120
Um, don't do anything yet.

140
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:18,013
I just want to make sure
this conclusion's warranted.

141
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:19,698
Okay.

142
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,736
<i>The valves didn't fail.</i>

143
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,305
Not a chance.

144
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,917
It's been implanted
hundreds of times

145
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,536
over the last year
with zero complications.

146
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,255
You're telling me not
one single patient...

147
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,923
I'm telling you people with
bad hearts have issues.

148
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,131
None of them were
caused by the valve.

149
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,577
Yeah, look. This is...

150
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,168
I mean, just, it's
irrefutable proof.

151
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:44,005
The strut in the valve just...

152
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,091
it shattered.

153
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,426
You have to ask
yourself why it shattered.

154
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,422
You're just assuming that
it was a manufacturing error

155
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,431
when it was clearly
damaged during surgery

156
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,167
by Dr. Austin.

157
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,938
You're saying my surgeon
broke the valve in the OR?

158
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,741
Exactly.

159
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,509
The cause...

160
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,712
of Bradley Jenkins' death...

161
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,699
is operator error.

162
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:17,789
Doesn't feel real.

163
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:21,559
Just... Bradley seemed to be
doing so well after his surgery.

164
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,962
He was... happy.

165
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,359
Early mortality from
valve replacement

166
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:28,532
has many possible causes.

167
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,052
Embolism, congestive
heart failure.

168
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,971
A defective heart valve.

169
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,251
You think the valve
that the Raptor implanted

170
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,693
- could have killed Bradley?
- Maybe.

171
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:41,212
His autopsy is being
presented at this morning's M&M.

172
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,148
We will have answers after.

173
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,645
Mr. Greenspan's case

174
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,252
is an unfortunate example

175
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,773
of the importance of
transparent labeling.

176
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:55,054
Mr. Greenspan was
given 25 milligrams

177
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:57,445
- of Olanzapine instead of 2.5...
- How are you doing?

178
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,392
A little nervous.

179
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,893
You and everyone else.

180
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:02,645
Presented to prevent...

181
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,168
How's the clinic?

182
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,920
We've seen over 60 patients,

183
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:07,572
and it's only our third day.

184
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,558
We can end labeling errors.

185
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:12,576
Up next, we have...

186
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,562
the Jenkins case.

187
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:17,665
The Jenkins case

188
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,434
will not be presented today.

189
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,436
Apologies for the
misunderstanding.

190
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,355
Thank you.

191
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,107
He is up to something.

192
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,276
Clearly.

193
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,522
Okay, um...

194
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,797
moving right along.

195
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,839
Are you keeping tabs on me?

196
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,592
Nope. When my dad
was touch and go,

197
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:46,221
you gave me a
great case I could fix.

198
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,962
I'm returning the favor.

199
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:49,375
I'm fine. I don't
need anything...

200
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,416
You can thank me later.

201
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,943
Good morning,
Marisol. I'm Dr. Pravesh.

202
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:04,145
Glad someone's
having a good morning.

203
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,563
To tell you the truth,

204
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,615
this pain has ruined mine.

205
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:08,961
And my life.

206
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:11,385
Oh right, and my marriage.

207
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,122
Well, that's what I
would call bad pain.

208
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:16,207
Mm, you and me
both, Dr. Pravesh.

209
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,792
You and me both.

210
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:19,822
When did this
life-ruining pain start?

211
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,630
Oh, about six hours ago.

212
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:24,543
It took six whole hours
to ruin a marriage?

213
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,517
Amateur.

214
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,064
- I didn't even make it
down the aisle.
- Let's see...

215
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,589
Kicked my husband to
the curb about a year ago,

216
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,825
two years of trying to
make it work before that.

217
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,678
Um, I had an ectopic
pregnancy, so my right ovary is...

218
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:38,596
Dud.

219
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,881
When I eventually
did get pregnant again,

220
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,801
I had a crash C-section.

221
00:11:44,855 --> 00:11:47,021
They saved me,
but we lost our son.

222
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,109
I'm sorry for your loss.

223
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,412
The pain started
shortly after that.

224
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,448
And so did the marital problems.

225
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,899
Did you see a doctor about this?

226
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,216
Many.

227
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,719
And none of them
would listen to me.

228
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,656
I need a doctor
who will believe me.

229
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,760
I believe you.

230
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,875
And I'm gonna figure
out what's going on.

231
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,134
Floyd, how you doing?

232
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,137
Hey, the sun is shining,
it's a beautiful day.

233
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,423
I'm feeling fine.

234
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,611
That doesn't sound fine.

235
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,714
Dr. Shaw, meet Floyd Washington.

236
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,033
Retired mailman, Vietnam vet

237
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:35,119
- and awesome grandfather.
- How you doing, doc?

238
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,922
Nice to meet you, Floyd.
What's your name, kid?

239
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,160
Aw, don't mind Aubrey.
She hates attention.

240
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:45,246
Although the hair and the
piercings might say otherwise.

241
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:47,361
I'm gonna have you
breathe for me, Floyd.

242
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,184
Deep breath.

243
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:55,273
Yeah, if it's not anime

244
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,625
or tattoos or AP Biology,

245
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,711
this girl's quiet as a mouse.

246
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,629
- Floyd, do you have
any pain in your leg?
- No, no,

247
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,886
just-just the, uh, cough.

248
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,336
Why don't you change into
this for me, would you, Floyd?

249
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,660
I'm gonna perform a full exam.

250
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:19,246
Menthol, regular,
filtered, unfiltered?

251
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,248
None of the above.
Quit cold turkey

252
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:22,516
when Aubrey moved in with me.

253
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,318
Secondhand smoke kills.

254
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,003
Unlike firsthand smoke.

255
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:30,441
Nurse Nic, call<i>
The Atlanta Journal,</i>

256
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,110
my granddaughter speaks.

257
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,313
All right, but after
your chest X-ray.

258
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,698
We'll be back.

259
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,334
Thanks, Floyd.

260
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:46,724
Dr. Bell. Fred Harris, new
general counsel for Chastain.

261
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,893
Good to meet you.

262
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,623
The Jenkins family is
pursuing legal action

263
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:52,045
for the death of their son.

264
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,166
- I spoke to the pathologist...
- The official cause of death

265
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,041
- hasn't been determined.
- No.

266
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,904
Not official, but...
Y... She believes

267
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,641
- the heart valve shattered.
- There's a question as to why.

268
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,421
Mm. The board won't
like that narrative.

269
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:09,046
Puts our surgeon at fault,
makes Chastain vulnerable. No.

270
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,709
We have to avoid
surgical error at all costs,

271
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,534
and your job is to
make sure that happens.

272
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,902
Quickly.

273
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,270
Do whatever you have to do.

274
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,813
Of course.

275
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:27,409
What were the
results of the autopsy?

276
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,850
Bradley was our friend.

277
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:31,113
- We need to know what happened.
- I'm aware of the how important

278
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,249
Bradley was to you
and I'm doing my best...

279
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,084
- What was the cause of death?
- We're conducting

280
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,552
a closed investigation
to determine that.

281
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,020
I was there when he died.

282
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,589
I should be a part
of that investigation.

283
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,946
And I assisted Dr. Austin
on his heart valve surgery.

284
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,282
The investigation
should be transparent.

285
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,550
Done at an open M&M.

286
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:49,086
I'm trying to
protect Dr. Austin.

287
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,084
So, you're saying

288
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,552
that Bradley died
because Dr. Austin

289
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,392
made a mistake during surgery?

290
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,579
I'm saying that if you
don't want to ruin his career,

291
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:01,966
you'll stand down
and let me do my job.

292
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,323
I mean, is it possible
that The Raptor...

293
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,742
- No.
- No.

294
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:19,033
- Anyone can make a mistake.
- Not this.

295
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:21,313
We need to warn Austin
so he can prepare a defense.

296
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,487
- He won't be thrilled.
- All right,

297
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,801
I'll see you guys later. I
have a GI consult with Marisol.

298
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,053
I don't trust Bell.

299
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,553
Whatever he says,
he's protecting Chastain,

300
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,138
- not Austin.
- Yeah.

301
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,124
My guess, the problem
was the QuoVadis valve

302
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,347
and they're blaming him.

303
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,617
You're telling me...

304
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:39,971
Bell thinks these hands
killed Bradley Jenkins?

305
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:47,244
You know what I think?

306
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:01,992
That went exactly as I expected.

307
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,451
Dr. Bell.

308
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,820
Just the man I want to see.

309
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:14,383
I hear you're looking
for a scapegoat.

310
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,774
So I obtained the copy
of the autopsy report

311
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,476
which clearly states
that your valve...

312
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,829
The one Chastain
forced into my OR

313
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:24,715
due to your little
sweetheart deal... failed.

314
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,712
Because you made
an error inserting it.

315
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,003
Au contraire, Satan.

316
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,938
You must be Dr. Austin.

317
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:34,358
- Your arrogance proceeds you.
- This isn't about me, dawg.

318
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,488
This is about your defective
product, which does not

319
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,529
belong on Chastain's shelves.

320
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,626
Your mentor, Abe
Benedict, loves our valves

321
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,411
and all his patients
are alive and well.

322
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,069
Oh yeah? Well, prove
it. Show me your stats.

323
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,238
Right. I'm guessing no one

324
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,157
tracks long-term outcomes.

325
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:52,910
My devices... each one...
Are little works of art.

326
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,213
Perfectly designed to
make a failing body better.

327
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,964
But they must be understood.

328
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,828
They must be
treated with respect.

329
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,819
Did you respect my valve when
you implanted it, Dr. Austin?

330
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,650
I reviewed my surgical notes.

331
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:07,208
Bradley Jenkins' surgery
went without incident.

332
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,477
Uh, I think your surgical notes

333
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:11,929
are missing some
very important details.

334
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,882
Impossible. I'm an advocate
for transparency in everything,

335
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,601
especially my reports.

336
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,586
Our rep, Julian Booth,
was in that surgery

337
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,905
and she documented it.

338
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,409
Her notes tell a
very different story.

339
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,195
That you tried to implant
the device backwards.

340
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,949
I'm sorry, AJ,
that's what it says.

341
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,015
I picked it up wrong,

342
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,789
realized my mistake

343
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,268
and I picked it
up the right way.

344
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,404
- It was a nothingburger.
- Hey, stop talking.

345
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,343
So you're admitting error.

346
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:44,645
I am not.

347
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:53,254
This isn't over.

348
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,736
I've spoken to
some of the nurses.

349
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,193
Apparently, he's a terror.

350
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:01,078
This is gonna be easy.

351
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:04,031
AJ Austin is
practically a magician

352
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,933
in the OR. If I needed surgery,

353
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:10,104
he would be the doctor
that I ask for. So before

354
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,457
you go and smear a
man's name, have a look...

355
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,744
at the long list of people
whose lives he's saved.

356
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,842
Sounds like you're
rooting for the wrong team.

357
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,949
I am your partner.

358
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,151
I am also the
CEO of this hospital

359
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,621
and my board
doesn't want the finger

360
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:29,489
pointing at one of their
own any more than you do.

361
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,993
You have the power
to sway the board.

362
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,795
All you need is proof.

363
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,513
I want the truth.

364
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,635
And the word of one
of your employees...

365
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,083
is not gonna be enough.

366
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:47,524
Well, partner, Julian and Austin

367
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,519
weren't the only
people in that room.

368
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,530
Let's be thorough.

369
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:58,418
Hey, great. So,
good news, Floyd.

370
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:00,788
Your lungs are clear,
but now Nurse Nevin and I

371
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:02,101
are gonna take
a look at that leg.

372
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,386
Oh w-wait a minute. I just
came in here for my cough.

373
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,610
Don't pass up the chance
to show us some ankle.

374
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:08,912
Pop.

375
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,019
All right, let's see
what we have here.

376
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,376
What's wrong with Pops?

377
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,408
We're gonna have
to run some tests,

378
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,159
but I suspect after
years of smoking,

379
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:30,684
he has what's called
peripheral vascular disease.

380
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,987
What-what does...
what-does that mean?

381
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:36,657
It means you did the right
thing bringing him in here today.

382
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,924
What do you think's
up with Aubrey?

383
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,665
She's what... 17, 18?

384
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,033
She's probably stoned.

385
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:47,985
No, I don't think so.

386
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,165
Well, clearly you don't know
what a high teenager looks like.

387
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,173
Actually, I do.

388
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,588
I've been a solo
act for a while,

389
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,930
but I'm starting to like
this double-team thing.

390
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,263
Good.

391
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,093
Then I'll keep
teaching you new tricks.

392
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,069
Hopefully you're a fast learner.

393
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,756
<i>Conrad, he has
a surprise for you.</i>

394
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,613
So we thought we'd come
on by. Well, go on, Henry.

395
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,882
Dr. Conrad, I got to show you.

396
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,179
Show me what?

397
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:21,569
Oh...

398
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,842
MVP? Oh...

399
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:30,828
Oh!

400
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,298
That is a big trophy.

401
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,715
It's a big deal.

402
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:37,184
Mm-hmm. It's a keeper.

403
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,031
Coach gave it to
me after the game.

404
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:42,572
Called me to home
plate in front of everybody.

405
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,959
- Mm.
- I thought Daniel Pressley
was gonna get it.

406
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,146
Hey, Daniel is good, but
most valuable player...

407
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,659
That is all you.

408
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,416
Congrats, my man.

409
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:56,186
Hey. You okay, Bud?

410
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,206
Honey, look at me.

411
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,124
Why are you doing that?

412
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,426
Doing what?

413
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,128
What you just did

414
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,975
with your head... Why
are you doing that?

415
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,832
I don't know. But
it wasn't a seizure.

416
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,251
I never felt far away.

417
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:14,955
Hey.

418
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:17,324
You want to grab
some more napkins?

419
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,242
Have you ever seen
him do that before?

420
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:24,899
Once.

421
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:27,500
While we were camping
in Stone Mountain.

422
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,503
I thought he was
nervous, but-but...

423
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,272
Okay, well, you look worried.

424
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,971
Let's just take a
trip up to neurology,

425
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,155
make sure everything's okay.

426
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:40,281
Okay. Better safe than sorry.

427
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,961
How's Marisol doing?

428
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:56,881
This poor woman has been
ignored and dismissed by her doctors.

429
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,134
She's been trying to
advocate for herself.

430
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:02,853
All alone.

431
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,105
But now she's your patient

432
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,857
and you're helping her.

433
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,343
She's not alone anymore.

434
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,730
And you're not alone either.

435
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,555
There.

436
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,842
On her left
ovary... that a cyst?

437
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,638
No.

438
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:28,724
It's a thick-walled, fluid-dense
mass in her adnexa.

439
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:31,298
That's probably a
tubo-ovarian abscess.

440
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:33,195
I'll get her on IV antibiotics
and order an aspiration.

441
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,868
Yeah, minimally invasive

442
00:22:34,903 --> 00:22:36,765
and it'll tell us exactly
what we're dealing with.

443
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,149
I'd say let me know if you
need anything, but you won't.

444
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:50,000
No, all we want to
know is did Dr. Austin

445
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,852
insert the device upside down?

446
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:54,838
Dr. Bell put him in
an impossible position.

447
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,668
He had no experience
with the new heart valve

448
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:59,076
and yet he had to insert it.

449
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,945
And that's why

450
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,781
Ms. Booth was in the
OR... To give him guidance,

451
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,783
to prevent a mistake.

452
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,268
We need to understand

453
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,371
exactly what happened,

454
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:12,673
Dr. Okafor. No judgment.

455
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,593
The facts. I know it's hard,

456
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,548
because you work
closely together.

457
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:24,602
Dr. Austin almost inserted
the valve upside down.

458
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,637
He quickly course
corrected. It was a non-event.

459
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,523
I don't understand.

460
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:32,259
While Ms. Booth was there,
didn't she try to instruct him

461
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:34,956
- on how to properly
insert that valve?
- Yes.

462
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,380
- So he didn't listen.
- That is not unusual for him.

463
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,150
It is his way.

464
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,595
I'm sorry, uh, it's not unusual

465
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,637
for Dr. Austin to
ignore expert instruction

466
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,439
on a new device?

467
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,265
Surgical errors drop drastically

468
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,718
when staff is
encouraged to speak up

469
00:23:57,753 --> 00:24:01,455
- if they see a problem.
- I agree with that principle,

470
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,558
but Dr. Austin knows
what he's doing.

471
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:06,488
- He is a rare exception.
- So, over the course

472
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,562
of Bradley's surgery,

473
00:24:08,598 --> 00:24:12,283
Dr. Austin did every
little thing correctly?

474
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,104
- No.
- Mm.

475
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,256
Because he refused

476
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,975
to listen to instruction...

477
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:27,097
and he may have made a mistake

478
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,400
that cost Bradley
Jenkins his life.

479
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,804
Yes.

480
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,785
In a minute, sedation will
kick in. You'll feel sleepy.

481
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,700
- We'll aspirate the fluid
and go from there, okay?
- Okay.

482
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,841
That crash C-section
and losing our son

483
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:56,977
was the worst thing that
has ever happened to me,

484
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:58,278
and I stayed because

485
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:01,398
I desperately
wanted to try again,

486
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,634
to be a mother.

487
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,653
Please make sure they
don't take the good ovary.

488
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:10,023
Okay, it's the last
chance I have left.

489
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,803
I'm gonna be here
the whole time.

490
00:25:11,827 --> 00:25:14,394
I will make sure that
they listen to you, okay?

491
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,029
- Okay.
- Trust me.

492
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,232
- She's under. We're all set.
- Needle for aspiration.

493
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:26,256
Have a percutaneous
drain on standby.

494
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,595
More sedation!

495
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,742
I can't. Her blood
pressure's too low. It's 80/50.

496
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,076
All right, let's do
an ultrasound.

497
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,162
Go, come on.

498
00:25:37,186 --> 00:25:39,026
Hurry.

499
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,520
There's no blood
flow to the left ovary.

500
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,178
The ovary is twisted on itself.

501
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,291
If we don't get her to
surgery, she'll lose it.

502
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,599
Page GYN, tell them
to meet us up there now.

503
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,119
All right.

504
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,123
I've just drained the abscess.

505
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,524
And now, if you want, Aubrey,

506
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,411
I could teach
you how to pack it.

507
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:06,130
Uh, m-me?

508
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,747
Uh, no, that won't be necessary.

509
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:10,134
Just teach me, I can get by.

510
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,480
Yeah, Floyd's right. This is

511
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:13,687
a lot of responsibility
for a teenager.

512
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:16,456
I mean, it has to be done
right, but I have no doubt

513
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,253
- that Aubrey can do it.
- But it's a staph infection

514
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,721
and if we don't
properly treat it,

515
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,573
it can spread to the
bone, and if that happens,

516
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:23,208
he could lose the leg.

517
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:25,393
But if Aubrey can help
him manage the infection,

518
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,749
we can prevent that

519
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,952
and keep him
out of the hospital.

520
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,157
She'll need to be very thorough.

521
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:37,160
Do you want to try?

522
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:51,425
All right, come on. Let's
get you some gloves.

523
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,927
There you go.

524
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:57,242
You see, now, how when I pull
on the gauze, it doesn't move?

525
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:59,249
You try.

526
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,818
Maybe go from the other side.

527
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,820
- Nice and tight.
- Oh...

528
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,939
Oh.

529
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:08,158
You know what, um...

530
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,610
let's take a break.

531
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:12,478
Here, come on.

532
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,883
That was a good try.

533
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,030
Untouched pie.

534
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,800
That's not like you.

535
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:35,552
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice, Abe.

536
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,821
Hey, I'm always up
for the best pie in town.

537
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,556
Besides, it sounded urgent.

538
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:45,228
What do you know
about Gordon Page?

539
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:48,364
Ambitious, dynamic,

540
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,183
smart as hell.

541
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:52,619
Thank you.

542
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:54,750
That's a lot of high
praise coming from you.

543
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:57,207
What's this about?

544
00:27:57,243 --> 00:28:00,560
A young patient of
mine died not long after

545
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,178
putting the QuoVadis valve in...

546
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:05,332
- The one that you recommended.
- I'm sorry.

547
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:07,884
And now Gordon Page
is pointing a finger at me.

548
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,904
He says I damaged it
because I handled it incorrectly.

549
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,757
And, personally, I
think that's absurd.

550
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,687
But have you ever
experienced anything like that?

551
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:19,329
No, but I suppose I could have,

552
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,898
if I hadn't had a device
rep in the OR with me

553
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,778
to walk me through
the procedure.

554
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,419
As did I.

555
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,905
I just didn't listen to her.

556
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:35,161
I don't know what
to say, Austin. I...

557
00:28:35,197 --> 00:28:37,175
This was bound to
happen sooner or later.

558
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,182
You are great.

559
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,551
But you're not
invincible. No one is.

560
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:45,038
Your God complex has
always been your Achilles heel.

561
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,059
You want my advice?

562
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,460
Always.

563
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:53,847
Learn humility.

564
00:28:53,882 --> 00:28:56,916
If you make a mistake, own it.

565
00:28:56,952 --> 00:29:01,788
It'll make you a better doctor.

566
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,612
The blood flow's cut off.

567
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:11,064
In order to remove the
mass, we're going to have to

568
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:15,035
- take the ovary.
- You can't untangle the adnexa?

569
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,537
It's adherent to the posterior
cul-de-sac and side wall.

570
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,567
I'm trying to dissect it, but
there's something blocking

571
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,141
my visualization.

572
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,472
- Could you save it
if you converted to open?
- Maybe.

573
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:24,544
Maybe not.

574
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,724
There's still a chance.

575
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:27,580
We have to try.

576
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,011
I can't put her through major
abdominal surgery for no reason.

577
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,217
We have a reason.

578
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,236
She wants children.

579
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,266
As her doctors, we
have to honor that.

580
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,307
You can tell me with
absolute certainty

581
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,177
that she wants this at any cost?

582
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,096
Yes.

583
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:45,431
Convert to open.

584
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:09,155
There... the ovary's untangled.
Let's remove the mass.

585
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,389
Metz.

586
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,664
Wait. What is this?

587
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,699
It's... blue.

588
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,501
What kind of tumor is blue?

589
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:24,170
It's not a tumor.

590
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:25,784
Oh, my God.

591
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:27,824
It's a surgical sponge.

592
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,115
Aubrey, I think I kind of put
you on the spot back there.

593
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,866
I'm really sorry about that.

594
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:38,902
I just...

595
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,955
get the sense that this is
something that you could do.

596
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:45,041
And if I'm being honest,

597
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:48,161
if you can tend to
his wounds at home,

598
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:50,024
it would be better
for your grandfather

599
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,731
not to be in the hospital.

600
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,801
My mom was a nurse.

601
00:30:54,837 --> 00:30:56,319
No way.

602
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:01,491
She taught me some stuff bef...

603
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:04,211
She taught me some
stuff before she died.

604
00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:08,732
She made people better.

605
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,534
But what if I'm not like her?

606
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,587
What if I make Pops worse?

607
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:18,007
Aubrey...

608
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,727
I'm sure you're more like your
mother than you even know.

609
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,415
Sometimes I wonder

610
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,418
if I could be a
nurse like she was.

611
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:32,372
Maybe you could start
with your grandfather.

612
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:47,532
Uh, Our CABG surgery is in
an hour and we need to prep.

613
00:31:47,556 --> 00:31:49,873
Dr. Hoffstead is
filling in for me.

614
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,576
- You can scrub in with her.
- Are you ill?

615
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,844
No. I'm pondering.

616
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,763
Okay, so you can ponder

617
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,115
during our case.

618
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,771
Don't you want to operate?

619
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:09,275
Yeah.

620
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:11,278
I do.

621
00:32:11,313 --> 00:32:12,879
I need it.

622
00:32:12,915 --> 00:32:16,165
Like I need the sun...

623
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,151
or peanut butter chocolate cups.

624
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,903
But the sun hurts my eyes
and chocolate makes me bloat,

625
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,007
so I won't be doing
any of it, not for a while.

626
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:27,394
I'm benching myself from
surgery until further notice.

627
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:29,646
Okay, well, even for you,

628
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,816
that's dramatic.

629
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,652
You made a mistake. We all do.

630
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:38,722
And Bradley paid for
my mistake with his life.

631
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:45,162
You know, you
were right all along.

632
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,796
My ego...

633
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,099
Well, of course I was right.

634
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:52,302
And it seems like you
already learned your lesson.

635
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,938
So be better, come back,

636
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,957
take your place inside the OR.

637
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:01,861
The OR is a sacred
place and I blasphemed it.

638
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,347
I don't have a place
there. Not now.

639
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,361
And I will not put
another life at jeopardy

640
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,534
until I learn humility.

641
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:12,755
"Blessed are the meek."

642
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:22,799
It's been an hour.

643
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,795
When can I take
this stupid hat off?

644
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:27,537
Not until you do
the motion again,

645
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,323
so we can see if your
brainwaves are normal or abnormal

646
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:31,970
while you're doing the movement.

647
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:34,277
Okay.

648
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,315
What if he doesn't do it
while he's on the machine?

649
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,985
Eh, we'll just try again.
It's the only way to know

650
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,916
if it's a manifestation
of a seizure.

651
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,640
Do I look like a mad scientist?

652
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,578
Ah, exactly like
a mad scientist.

653
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:56,766
How's Nic? I haven't seen
her around the hospital.

654
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:59,685
Yeah, she started a free clinic
that opened a few days ago.

655
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,833
- She's doing great.
- You must be so proud.

656
00:34:01,857 --> 00:34:06,059
I am. Yeah, she's...
she's amazing.

657
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:08,361
Oh, oh, can I go see Nurse Nic?

658
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,246
I want to show her my trophy...

659
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:15,568
Okay. He's doing it again.

660
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:17,323
Please, God.

661
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,640
That's normal.

662
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:29,182
All right,

663
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:31,033
no abnormal brain activity.

664
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,035
If it's not a seizure,

665
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,816
then why is he
doing that motion?

666
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,624
Eh, it's a tic. Uh, very
common in kids Henry's age.

667
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,095
He just makes a movement,
usually a reaction to something,

668
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,948
and kind of gets
stuck in a loop.

669
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:46,566
But it's definitely not...

670
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:50,086
Definitely not a seizure.

671
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:54,074
Told you.

672
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,664
Hey. What are you doing?

673
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,934
Writing a Chastain
admission form for Floyd.

674
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,613
He needs heavy
observation and wound care.

675
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:08,254
There's too great a risk for
amputation to send him home.

676
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,906
PVD's chronic.

677
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,802
Even if we cure this
ulcer, there will be others.

678
00:35:11,826 --> 00:35:13,237
He needs ongoing care.
Hospitals can't do that,

679
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:15,995
- Aubrey can.
- Her hands shake.

680
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,659
She can't look
anyone in the eye.

681
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,360
She's a teenager who
may be a drug user

682
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,579
and you want to put her in
charge of Floyd's care... why?

683
00:35:21,603 --> 00:35:23,114
Look, you and I both
know that hospitals

684
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:24,966
can be dangerous
for people Floyd's age.

685
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,984
I mean, they get poked
and prodded all night long

686
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,109
and exposed to
hospital-based infections.

687
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:31,761
Sometimes home care
is just the better option.

688
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,357
Yeah, that's right.
And you're preaching

689
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,692
to the choir here,
but in this instance...

690
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,460
Okay, let me just
show you something.

691
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:38,784
All right? She can do this.

692
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:43,656
Not bad.

693
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:45,809
Not bad at all.

694
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,229
Mm.

695
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:53,883
Well, no need for a nurse.

696
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:57,319
You're a natural,
just like your mom.

697
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,534
Well, it looks like you're
headed home, Floyd.

698
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,691
Got yourself a great nurse here.

699
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,964
They left a sponge in me?

700
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,367
How... how could this happen?

701
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,703
I wish I could give
you a decent answer.

702
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,672
But the truth is the mistake
is inexcusable and it never

703
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,419
- should have happened.
- They must have
forgotten to remove it

704
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,421
during your C-section.
It's rare, but it happens.

705
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:23,229
It's been the cause
of all your pain

706
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,143
for all these years.

707
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:28,518
And you've suffered for so
long and it was avoidable.

708
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,704
That day I lost my baby

709
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:34,257
and they left me with...

710
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,592
the pain.

711
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:40,480
And then the guilt, as
if it were my own fault,

712
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:43,366
as if it were in my head.

713
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,535
And all of it...

714
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,272
it's gone.

715
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,991
The pain that ruined my life,

716
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:54,126
it's gone.

717
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:57,347
I still have an ovary

718
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,699
and I'm gonna have
a child someday.

719
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:03,086
You fixed everything,
Dr. Pravesh.

720
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,721
Thank you.

721
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:08,391
All in a day's
work for this guy.

722
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,213
Excuse me.

723
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,403
Is he okay?

724
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,072
He will be.

725
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,924
Just lost his best friend.

726
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:28,395
You are exactly what he needed.

727
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:45,261
Thanks, for everything.

728
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,894
Oh. Of course.

729
00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:51,328
- Thanks, Doc.
- Of course. Always.

730
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,730
- I'll see you soon, yeah?
- Thank you.

731
00:37:52,754 --> 00:37:54,937
- See you later.
- All right. Thank you.

732
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:03,463
We had a scared, shy teenager
and I thought "drug addiction."

733
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,243
Got that wrong.

734
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:07,333
Uh-huh.

735
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,185
So...

736
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,320
who is it?

737
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,983
Earlier, you got a little
snippy when I claimed

738
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:14,685
you didn't know what a
drug addict looked like.

739
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,109
Snippy?

740
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:18,027
Yeah, definitely snippy.

741
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,814
My sister.

742
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,499
I have recently come to terms

743
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:26,702
with the fact that I am
a classic codependent.

744
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,955
Well, as a former codependent,

745
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,150
I guess there are some
things I can teach you.

746
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,927
You want to get dinner?

747
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:38,809
- Hey.
- Hey. Good to see you.

748
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:40,499
Nurse Nic!

749
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,870
Hey, Henry, what's going
on? What are you doing here?

750
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,215
He wanted to show you something.

751
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,323
Oh, yeah? What do you got?

752
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,226
- A trophy.
- No way.

753
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:51,405
Are you serious?

754
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,713
That is so awesome. High five.

755
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,909
Looks like your son is
a star baseball player.

756
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,871
Oh, no. We're-we're not, um...

757
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:04,791
Conrad is... was... our doctor.

758
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:06,626
And now we're...

759
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:08,728
We're friends.

760
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:12,365
And they're together.

761
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,721
Uh, I guess that's my
cue to say good night, all.

762
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:21,391
Good night.

763
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,761
- I'll just be a second.
- Okay.

764
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,530
Ah...

765
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:30,316
Bye, Dr. Conrad.

766
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:31,696
- Bye.
- Ready?

767
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,119
- Bye.
- Bye.

768
00:39:49,204 --> 00:39:51,454
You have something to say?

769
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,756
You, of all people...

770
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,686
A surgeon who has
made many mistakes...

771
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,578
Did not protect Dr. Austin.

772
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:01,947
I will protect him. Even if
he's named in a lawsuit.

773
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,517
He won't lose his job and
he'll be back in the OR.

774
00:40:04,552 --> 00:40:06,564
No one can protect The
Raptor from The Raptor.

775
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:07,853
He's benched himself.

776
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:10,201
He won't operate.

777
00:40:10,225 --> 00:40:12,425
We are surgeons.

778
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,794
Gordon Page is not.

779
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,825
He doesn't know what it
takes to cut into the heart

780
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,283
of a living human being
and end up curing them,

781
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,234
not killing them.

782
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,854
But you're his lapdog. Why?

783
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,445
If you won't tell me, I
will find out another way.

784
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:37,450
You have my word.

785
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,581
Yeah, maybe we don't
send this one to his mom.

786
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,967
It's not really
memorial material.

787
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:59,772
What about this?

788
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:02,420
Dust Bunny.

789
00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:03,675
Now, that's Bradley.

790
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,844
Ah, our intern class photo.

791
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,448
Man, you hate that white coat.

792
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:11,462
- Yup.
- You could've
at least worn a tie.

793
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:14,003
Yeah, well I wore one last
week for Devon's wedding,

794
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,471
so there's that.

795
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,810

I didn't know Henry
had a checkup today.

806
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:46,669
He looked good.

807
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,540
So did Zoey.

808
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:55,828
Yeah, after Bradley, I just
wanted to lay eyes on him.

809
00:41:55,863 --> 00:41:58,748
- Hmm.
- How are things
at the clinic, with Alec?

810
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,567
He seems to really care
about what we're doing.

811
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,869
Mm. Well, that's good.

Yes.

814
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,601
Why is there
pineapple on this pizza?

815
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,803
It's a Hawaiian pie.

816
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,107
