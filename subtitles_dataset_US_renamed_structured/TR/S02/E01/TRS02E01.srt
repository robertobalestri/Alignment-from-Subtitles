Yes, they can.

10

something about Lane.

17

what it is. Together.

18

They're for you,

00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,151
I may have flirted
my way to a discount.

55
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,153
- Phoebe, huh?
- Yeah.

56
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,805
Half Asian girl with...

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,140
High-pitched voice,

I know Phoebe, and...

59
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:46,064
I admire her work, but
this was unnecessary.

60
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,984
Well, my perfectly
stitched heart begs to differ.

61
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,004
Can you stay?

62
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,296
I wish I could,
but I have a case.

63
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,081
Newborn,

64
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,851
<i>sick heart the size of a walnut.</i>

66
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,872
<i>She's extremely high risk.</i>

67
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,236
What are her odds?

68
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,250
Part of Mabel's heart
is underdeveloped.

69
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,325
The defect is more
severe than we thought.

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,727
Without surgery, two days tops.

71
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,047
With surgery,
she's got a real shot.

72
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,266
Yeah, a long shot.

73
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,052
Mr. Thoms, your wife
brought these beautiful twins

74
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,904
into this world together.

75
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:45,101
It is my mission to reunite
them in a few hours,

76
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,025
and I am not in a losing mood.

77
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,410
Rarely am I.

78
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:52,431
I feel dizzy.

79
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,948
Hey, stay calm.

80
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,585
Okay? Just stay calm. Stay cool.

81
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:01,456
Your pulse is ridiculously
high. Look at me.

82
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:04,142
We can't have you stroking
out before I bring Mabel back

83
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,111
to her brother
Matt, you hear me?

84
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,824
- Help is on the way.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,448
- Let's go.
- Okay.

86
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,748
<i>Today,</i>

87
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,139
a once-prominent
Atlanta oncologist,

88
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,126
Dr. Lane Hunter, was arraigned
on one charge of murder

89
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:25,058
and 12 charges of insurance
fraud and money laundering.

90
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:28,399
Dr. Hunter is accused
of fraud and murder.

91
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,154
She provided false medical
information to cancer patients

92
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,250
in order to charge them
thousands of dollars

93
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,675
in unnecessary chemotherapy.

94
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,943
Did you take a shower?

95
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,927
Don't worry about it.

96
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:41,512
Where did you take a shower?

97
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:45,801
Mr. Thoms,
Dr. Hawkins, this is Dr...

98
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:48,519
Pravesh. We met in the
ER when my wife came in.

99
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,149
- How's she doing?
- She's resting.

100
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:52,740
And I'm gonna head back down
shortly again and check on her.

101
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:54,804
We stopped by to make
sure you're feeling okay.

102
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,594
BP a little high?

103
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,962
Have a seat.

104
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:02,934
Any palpitations?

105
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,953
My baby girl's in the OR,

106
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:09,691
my baby boy won't stop crying,
labor almost killed my wife.

107
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,604
Now she's in the ICU.

108
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:13,545
Yes. Palpitations.

109
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,865
BP's 180/120.

110
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,695
Normal protocol would
be to send you down

111
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,186
to the ER for observation.

112
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,338
There's no way in
hell I'm leaving my son.

113
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:24,867
Oh, we get it,

114
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,286
but there's a rule

115
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,454
against dads having
heart attacks in the NICU.

116
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,646
Let us run some labs,
get an EKG, start you

117
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,509
on some blood pressure meds,
make sure that doesn't happen.

118
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,067
What do you say?

119
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,386
- Okay.
- Yeah?

120
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,016
- Okay.
- All right.

121
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,908
Um, I want to
check in on my wife.

122
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,066
Dr. Pravesh.

123
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,836
Melanie. Welcome back.

124
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,588
You gave us quite a scare.

125
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,823
You lost a lot of
blood during delivery.

126
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,191
How are you feeling?

127
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,010
How are my babies? Mabel?

128
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:06,747
As you know, Mabel has
hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

129
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,050
Prenatal imaging can
only tell us so much,

130
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,752
so we didn't know the
severity of her heart deformity

131
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,573
- until she was born.
- Is she okay?

132
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,375
I haven't even met her yet.

133
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,780
<i>Soon after birth, she
was taken into surgery,</i>

134
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,899
<i>but I assure you that she is
in the best possible hands.</i>

135
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,248
<i>Dr. Sharavino</i>

136
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:43,051
called and said you're having
another flare? What's going on?

137
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:45,971
Oh, fever, body
aches, yeah, the usual.

138
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,372
Our mom also had lupus,
which led to kidney failure,

139
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,141
and then she died,

140
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,694
so "the usual" can
be fatal in our family.

141
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,707
Well, we'll be extra careful.

142
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,714
Any, um, sore
throat, congestion?

143
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,299
Peeing a lot, a little pain.

144
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,163
Okay, well, we'll definitely
run your blood work,

145
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,552
but if it's anything like

146
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,998
your last three
admissions, it'll be a UTI,

147
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,941
so we'll get you started
on doxycycline to make sure

148
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:07,971
it doesn't turn into
a kidney infection.

149
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,977
Oh, she has a mild allergy to...

150
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,158
To doxycycline. An antihistamine
should help head off the hives

151
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,582
you got on your last visit.

152
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:15,667
Um, will a doctor
be in soon or...?

153
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,085
I'll be back shortly.

154
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,683
- Can you get off that thing for,
like, a second?
- I would,

155
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,988
but it's way more interesting
than you are right now.

156
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,010

00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:57,545
He could have died.
What is going on?

180
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,380
The power went out.

181
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:01,644
Likely due to the storm.
Backup power kicked on now.

182
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,646
It's limited, but we
got emergency lights

183
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,330
and necessary equipment,
so we're good to go.

184
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,406
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

185
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,141
All right.

186
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,775
Took too long for those
generators to come on.

187
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,516
Yeah, that wasn't cool at all.

188
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,580
I'm gonna go to the basement,
make sure everything's okay.

189
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:21,986
Until full power's restored,

190
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,000
revert back to
standard triage protocol.

191
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,591
Put the sickest together, get
ready to evacuate if needed.

192
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,504
Find me if he
has a heart attack.

193
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,989
<i>All right, gather around.</i>

194
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,957
We're operating on
backup power now,

195
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,165
so no computers,
no digital charts,

196
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,128
and the paper ones are
buried in the basement, so...

197
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:40,805
so, write pertinent
information on each patient.

198
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,959
Write clearly, write
concisely, follow me.

199
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:48,646
5920... monitor urine output.

200
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,097
We need him peeing like a champ.

201
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:53,634
5921... alcohol
withdrawal, taper diazepam.

202
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,304
5918... do not
ask about the cats.

203
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,055
It gives him PTSD.

204
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,008
5917... check vitals every 30
minutes. Come on, keep up.

205
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,062
Dr. Bell, should we deploy
emergency protocols A or B?

206
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,564
Dr. Bell. Dr. Bell, all
computer systems are down.

207
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,699
Dr. Bell, trauma is
completely jammed.

208
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,079
Is that why you're not
taking any patients in the ER?

209
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,036
Do you have a better solution?

210
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,083
Dr. Bell, we're almost
at capacity down there.

211
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,191
Dr. Bell, ortho has a dozen
scheduled cases. Keep or cancel?

212
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:19,655
- Is that why you're not taking any patients
at the moment? Computer systems are down.

213
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,730
Mr. Bell, why is this happening?

214
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,134
It's Dr. Bell.

215
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,930
I recommend thinking
before you speak.

216
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:30,154
If that's too much of a
challenge, don't speak.

217
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:33,491
There's a massive storm outside.

218
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,042
The power grid is down.

219
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:36,355
There's a team
working with the city

220
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,579
to get it restored
as soon as possible.

221
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,059
The fire department
is on their way to help

222
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,566
with emergency power, if needed.

223
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,168
Treat all current trauma
patients, then shut it down.

224
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,020
ER stays open to capacity.

225
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,499
Let me know the
second that happens.

226
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:49,991
Ortho hits pause. Don't
cancel a single surgery.

227
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,004
Slide 'em an hour.
When we're back up,

228
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:54,079
start cutting. All
hands on deck.

229
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,579
Focus. Communicate.

230
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,409
The hospital and our
patients will be fine.

231
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:58,950
Decisions go through me.

232
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,935
Get back out there.

233
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,757
Albert, why are you still here?

234
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,071
In regards to the trauma center,

235
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,772
I think we can
consider a better option.

236
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,130
Not unless you want a
one-way ticket to Caracas

237
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,099
as your last stop
on the surgical train.

238
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,601
Leave.

239
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,559
You know, policy dictates

240
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:26,360
that we abandon surgery

241
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,580
until full power is restored.

242
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,898
Closing now is a death sentence.

243
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,245
No doubt. But, legally,

244
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:35,102
baby Mabel was
simply a sad casualty

245
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,770
of unfortunate circumstances.

246
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,707
What to do, what to do?

247
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:42,109
Don't be dramatic. You
know what we're going to do.

248
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:45,446
Oh, look who put their
big girl pants on today.

249
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:46,998
Okafor...

250
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,150
if we continue

251
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,002
and Mabel doesn't survive...

252
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,754
Coin toss at this point...

253
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:55,006
Are you willing to lay
your head next to mine

254
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,390
as Bell lowers a steel blade

255
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:58,760
to the back of our
beautiful ebony necks?

256
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,728
Gladly.

257
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:04,231
Is there anyone here
who is more concerned

258
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:06,311
with their career than
saving Mabel's life?

259
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:07,468
Quick show of hands.

260
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:16,627
Nurse What's-Your-Name,
set the timer for 40 minutes.

261
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,746
Yes, Doctor.

262
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:22,099
Dr. AJ Austin's
Lonely Heart Club Band

263
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,151
plays on.

264
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,004
Backup power in the
ICU isn't working right.

265
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,006
- I'm going to the basement.
- I was there. It's not good.

266
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,614
Get back to the ICU. Start
triaging for evacuation.

267
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,633
- What's going on?
- Just go.

268
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,721
We're stuck between floors.

269
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,224
I'm claustrophobic.

270
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,359
And you got in an elevator?

271
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,345
Well, my bathmophobia is worse.

272
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,364
I don't know what that is.

273
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,666
It's the fear of stairs and...

274
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,952
and-and st-steep slopes.

275
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,720
Steep... steep slopes.

276
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,440
Oh, my God, it's hot in here.

277
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,162
Seems Mother
Nature has gifted us

278
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:10,031
with some mood lighting tonight.

279
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:12,061
- The storm
knocked out the power?
- Yes.

280
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,179
And unfortunately has
held up Dr. Sharavino.

281
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:15,402
But not to worry.

282
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,199
I will be with you
your entire stay.

283
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,907
Uh, is her lab
work back yet or...?

284
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,643
Not until the power's back,
but knowing Joplin's history,

285
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,373
we have a good
course of treatment.

286
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,831
No offense, but my sister needs
to see a doctor, not a nurse.

287
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,601
Your sister needs an antibiotic

288
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,065
to treat a UTI that is quickly
becoming a kidney infection.

289
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,489
I diagnosed it,
so I will treat it.

290
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,725
If I need to tag in an
attending, I will do that.

291
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,861
Badass. I like her.

292
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:41,936
You're also gonna
have to stay the night

293
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,865
for observation.

294
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,628
I sort of dropped out of
college and have no future plans,

295
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:46,918
so all good.

296
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,130
All right, well,
here's your antibiotic,

297
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,520
and I'll be back in a bit.

298
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,072
I didn't know

299
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,274
nurses do all that.

300
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,942
I'm a nurse practitioner.

301
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,379
We do most things doctors do,
just with better bedside manner.

302
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,550
Storm's still a'ragin'.

303
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:05,636
I like storms. It's
Earth's way of venting.

304
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,050
<i>Poltergeist.</i> They had some
big-ass storms in that movie.

305
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,908
Yeah, when that tree came
alive and snatched that kid

306
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,710
out of the bed, I was like,

307
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,395
"Yo, Spielberg knows what's up."

308
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,964
How much time do
the generators give us?

309
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,233
Could be four hours,
could be two. Hard to tell.

310
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:23,916
That's your estimate, isn't it?

311
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,138
For the backup generators?

312
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,991
Eh, give or take.

313
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,071
- Emphasis on "take."
- How do you know that?

314
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,477
I've never worked in a hospital

315
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,724
that's done proper
generator maintenance.

316
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:34,214
Now, maybe Chastain
will surprise me.

317
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,944
- Where's your money?
- 34 minutes.

318
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,118
That isn't enough time

319
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,631
for the first phase, and
then you have to close

320
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:40,954
after we place the graft.

321
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,440
Now<i> you're</i> being dramatic.

322
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:44,742
Trust.

323
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,412
If all goes well without
one single hiccup,

324
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,733
we will sail through this
painfully intricate surgery

325
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:53,818
by the skin of our teeth.

326
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:57,188
Suction.

327
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:04,661
Every moment we turn
away or transfer patients,

328
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,147
we hemorrhage money.

329
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:09,116
Atlanta General and
Emory still fully functioning.

330
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:12,086
The storm hasn't affected
them, so worst-case scenario...

331
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:13,588
Is happening now.

332
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:17,007
Dr. Hawkins, this
is a strategy session

333
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,595
- for department heads only.
- Half the generators are down.

334
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,113
And the ICUs...

335
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,959
They don't have
any backup power.

336
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,717
- How many patients
on life support?
- 36.

337
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,637
There are six empty beds
in Neuro with backup power.

338
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,972
The others... We don't start

339
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:33,869
relocating them to
a different hospital...

340
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,476
Yeah, I know. They'll die.

341
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,665
Time to start an evacuation.

342
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,040
Ah, look at that.

343
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,676
Perfect fit. I'll
hold it steady,

344
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,296
you start the
proximal anastomosis.

345
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,147
- Without video assist?
- Yep.

346
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,366
I-I can't get good
visualization.

347
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:02,069
If I'm a millimeter off, that's
a hiccup we can't afford.

348
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,555
That's why the
sutures must be spaced

349
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,474
closely together in the corners.

350
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:09,104
- This area here
is prone to bleeding.
- I think I got it.

351
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,168
Of course you got
it. Now keep stitching.

352
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,745
We need to know what's
happening out there. Right now.

353
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,737
Dr. Okafor, I need you to focus.

354
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,925
Nurse, grab the house phone.

355
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,526
Make a quick call.

356
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,895
An update on all
things Chastain.

357
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,948
Specifically ICU room 3124,

358
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,511
- Micah Stevens.
- That's not necessary.

359
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:34,029
We'll check on
playboy, then we'll

360
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,714
cross your worry for
him off your to-do list.

361
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,938
I do not have a to-do list.

362
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,118
Liar, liar, scrubs on fire.

363
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,970
You have a list,
you checked it twice,

364
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:42,688
and now it's scratching the
surface of your brain space.

365
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:45,796
- Stop it!
- Hell no!

366
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,448
Your inability to
quell your concern

367
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,095
for teacher man could
distract you enough

368
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,804
to make the
slightest of mistakes.

369
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,922
Not on my watch, princess.

370
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:01,428
- Are you waiting for the world
to change or what?
- Oh...

371
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,147
Make the call.

372
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,056
ICU.

373
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,003
Yeah, we're doing
okay down here.

374
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,944
Micah?

375
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:20,647
Yeah. Tell Mina he's
fine and he's staying. I will.

376
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,233
Mina's in the OR. She's fine.

377
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,181
- Good.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

378
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,682
- Ms. Thoms, no.
- Are you out of your mind?

379
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:27,800
- Ms. Thoms...
- No, take your marker there

380
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,117
and change this "go"
to a "no way in hell."

381
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,836
- Ms. Thoms...
- Melanie, calm down.

382
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,070
- Need a hand over there?
- No, I got it covered.

383
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:34,144
Ma'am, this is in
your best interest.

384
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,013
Her baby girl is in the OR.

385
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,743
I got to get 30
heads out of here.

386
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:39,011
She's one of them.
She's on oxygen.

387
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,017
I don't have a choice.

388
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,630
Pravesh, why don't
you just let me handle...

389
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,821
Put her on portable
oxygen. Take Mr. Sykes.

390
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,506
TBI after an MVC.
Barb coma for a week.

391
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,943
Bell will lose his mind.

392
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:50,244
That barb coma

393
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,423
has already
billed a quarter mil.

394
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:52,529
Wow, Bolton, really?

395
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,348
Bell freaks, it's on you.

396
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,966
Yeah, I'll take it.

397
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,268
Dr. Pravesh and Hawkins
are needed in the ER, 911.

398
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,537
I'll take care of Melanie. Go.

399
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,289
Thank you. Thank you.

400
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,341
- I need a tank.
- Right away.

401
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,128
Yes, sir. I understand.

402
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:10,431
Yes, I told him
already. Hold, please.

403
00:19:10,466 --> 00:19:12,544
Eastside General has
power and open beds.

404
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,352
There is no Eastside General.

405
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,053
There's Atlanta General

406
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,722
and Eastside
Medical. Which is it?

407
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,009
Just ask.

408
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:23,388
Oh, no, this is
an incoming call.

409
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,645
It's Marshall Winthrop.

410
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,230
Return.

411
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,026
But he's the
chairman of the board,

412
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,517
and he's called three times.

413
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,169
You can inform Conrad
Hawkins's dad I'm a little busy.

414
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,154
He can wait. Indefinitely.

415
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,400
It's not the storm.

416
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,858
Our problem has nothing
to do with the electric grid.

417
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:40,227
Chastain's under
attack from cyber pirates.

418
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,512
Pirates?

419
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,065
That... can't be a thing.

420
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,501
Classic move from an
organized foreign crime syndicate.

421
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,987
They paralyze an institution,

422
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,139
cause disruption,
ask for ransom.

423
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:54,736
- You don't have security
in place?
- Yes.

424
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,993
But it needs an upgrade,

425
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,494
which I mentioned multiple times

426
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,079
and the administration ignored.

427
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,315
The upgrade you proposed

428
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:02,817
took us off-line for days.

429
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:04,330
We can't afford that
kind of shutdown.

430
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:06,770
Well, now we're
shut down anyway.

431
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,473
Ye...

432
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,175
How much will it cost

433
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,927
and how long will it take

434
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,947
for you to fix this?

435
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,042
There's no way to tell.

436
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:20,334
The attack program that
hacked in keeps replicating.

437
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,603
So if you want to
get this done quickly,

438
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,671
your best bet is
to pay the ransom

439
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:25,827
when the demand comes in.

440
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,511
Your professional IT advice

441
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:33,130
is to wait<i> and</i> pay?

442
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,248
Yes.

443
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:35,967
Good-bye.

444
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,801
What?

445
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,120
- I'm sorry,
you can't come in.
- Hundley.

446
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,822
- Talk to me.
- No... We're at capacity.

447
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,740
Eight-year-old. Gunshot
wound to the abdomen.

448
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,647
Hypotensive and tachy.

449
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,399
I'm afraid, man. He's dying.

450
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,746
Dr. Bell made the call.

451
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,829
We're closed to trauma.

452
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,070
Make room for one more.

453
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,488
You don't understand

454
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,923
what's going on down here.

455
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,441
There are no working ORs,

456
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:01,792
and this boy needs surgery.

457
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,160
We have no way to help him.

458
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,923
I don't think he makes it
to another hospital alive.

459
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,342
Zero chance he makes it
to another hospital alive,

460
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,067
so we roll the dice here.
Audra! I need an airway.

461
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,170
Check his breathing, heart
rate and BP. Page Nolan.

462
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,555
Pagers aren't working.

463
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,818
- Conrad, we can't save him here.
- Just get me Nolan.

464
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,992
- Park him there.
- How'd you find him?

465
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,139
Returning my rig, and I saw
the kid laying on the sidewalk.

466
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:23,447
I was only a block away,
man. I didn't know you guys

467
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,276
were closed. It's my first
week. He's my first kid, man.

468
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,935
- Please, I can't lose him.
- You made the right call.

469
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,303
One, two, three.

470
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,539
I need a trauma surgeon now!

471
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,150
There's blood entering

472
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:44,168
his abdominal cavity.

473
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,137
No breath sounds
on the left side.

474
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,155
- Where's Nolan?
- We're getting him.

475
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,367
Thready pulse.
He's about to code.

476
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,243
Get me a sterile blade
and a thoracotomy kit.

477
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,716
Right now this isn't your
fault, but if you cut and he dies,

478
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,835
it's on you. Don't risk it.

479
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,640
#10 blade.

480
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,717
Are we really doing this?

481
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,833
His pulse is stronger.

482
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:34,234
Get Nolan down here now.

483
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,189
I need help stopping
this bleeding.

484
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:42,604
- Oh, what the hell have
you done? Kid was dying.

485
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,255
- I had to cut.
<i>- You</i> never have to cut.

486
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,679
You're not a surgeon.

487
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,815
<i>You</i> don't make
the decision to cut.

488
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,032
<i>I</i> decide that.

489
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,079
Let's say, as his doctor,
I decided to save his life

490
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,031
by any means necessary.
Feel free to help.

491
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:54,833
Begin the massive
transfusion protocol.

492
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:56,835
Hang four units O-neg now.

493
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,253
- We have to get him up to an OR.
- No.

494
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,088
The generators are
busted. The entire OR

495
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,373
is about to be pitch-black, so
there's no OR to send him to.

496
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:04,749
Well, he's not stable
enough to transport him

497
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,762
- to another hospital.
- Do the surgery here in the ER.

498
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:07,945
No, no, no. There's not
enough room. It's not sterile.

499
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,104
And, once again, it's
about to be pitch-black.

500
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,934
I'm sorry, what's this?
Wh-Where are you going?

501
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,520
Wh-What is this, cut and run?
Where you think you're going?

502
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:16,371
To build you an OR.
There's no viable ORs.

503
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,457
You can't do the surgery
here. I'll build you an OR.

504
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,809
Did it all the time in the
Helmand Province in Afghanistan.

505
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,833

535
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,987
Time to head out.

536
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:35,884
If word gets out this is
happening, it might not be good.

537
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:38,158
Head up to the ICU,
they need you up there.

538
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:41,428
Pressure's stable. 100/60.

539
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:43,358
- Good. We got a fighting chance.
- Depending on what we find

540
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,492
inside this kid's abdomen.

541
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,050
Scalpel, please.

542
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,895
Why are all these
patients moving?

543
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,447
Uh, with an extended
power outage,

544
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:51,015
we have to move
life support patients

545
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,834
- to different facilities.
- Oh.

546
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,453
- Joplin need something?
- No. I, um,

547
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:56,154
- I owe you an apology.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

548
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:58,162
No. Earlier, I
was rude. I just...

549
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:01,148
Ever since our mom died,
I feel such a responsibility

550
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:04,034
to help Joplin be the best
and the healthiest and...

551
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,703
and I am babbling, and
you are very busy. Um...

552
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,072
Just... You are beyond capable,

553
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,869
- and I'm really sorry.
- Hey, you were being protective

554
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:12,137
of your little sister. I get it.

555
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:14,244
And she's lucky to have you.

556
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,067
We're not gonna make it, are we?

557
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,869
You should take over stitching.

558
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:25,472
No. Yours are pretty perfect.

559
00:25:25,508 --> 00:25:27,925
I'm only half done with
the graft. You're faster.

560
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,153
If that were true,
I'd be doing them.

561
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:32,996
Perfusionist, get
out the manual crank.

562
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,158
Wait, the power's running out?

563
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:37,050
We'll have no lights,
no suction, no perfusion.

564
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:38,218
Party people,

565
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:40,115
it's time for you
to get in touch

566
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,023
with your not-so-secret
love for the Sugarhill Gang.

567
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:45,525
Why? Because in
less than eight minutes,

568
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:47,338
we are not just
going old school,

569
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:49,196
we are going O.G., baby.

570
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,011
Calm breath out.

571
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:55,051
Imagine someplace peaceful.

572
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,670
A bubbling brook.

573
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:59,389
You're not helping.

574
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:02,559
What's your happy place?

575
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,378
Happy. Think happy.

576
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:12,936
Can I put my head in your lap?

577
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:16,239
- Please.
- Sure.

578
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:19,192
Okay.

579
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:22,212
Why me?

580
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,281
- Okay.
- Okay.

581
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:25,966
Yeah.

582
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,386
- Better.
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,166
Looks like our bullet nicked

584
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,473
his descending
aorta and his spleen.

585
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,337
Can you repair it? Well,
depends what I find in there.

586
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,095
So, just to clarify, am I firing

587
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,815
all of you because an internist
accepted a trauma patient

588
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,434
after the hospital was
closed to all ambulance traffic

589
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,231
or because a doctor
took it upon himself

590
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:50,123
to cut a kid open
with no working ORs?

591
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,353
He wasn't gonna survive
transport, so I made the call.

592
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,255
I'm the attending
trauma surgeon on deck.

593
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,980
I made the decision
to keep him and cut.

594
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,599
He had seconds to live.

595
00:26:58,634 --> 00:27:00,128
At least now he's
got a fighting chance.

596
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,913
But you had no faith
in the first responders

597
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:03,481
- to keep him alive.
- I've been a first responder

598
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:05,483
at a war front, and his
wounds are up there with any

599
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:06,690
artillery damage I've seen.

600
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,575
He was bleeding out.

601
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,093
He had seconds.

602
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,473
It's like Niagara Falls in here.

603
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,308
The aortic damage
makes it almost impossible

604
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:14,514
to stop this bleeding.

605
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:21,521
Can you use an
extra set of hands?

606
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:30,029
Dr. Bell, this is one life.

607
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,532
At the command center,
you're saving many lives.

608
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,122
Dr. Bell. I-I'm sorry to
interrupt, but this is urgent.

609
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,723
Well, spit it out.

610
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,069
It's not a foreign
cyber crime ring.

611
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,004
The IP address that
launched the malware

612
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,779
came from inside Chastain.

613
00:27:45,815 --> 00:27:47,981
Are you kidding me?
This isn't the storm?

614
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:50,044
- How long have you known?
- Are you telling me

615
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,680
we're being attacked
by one of our own?

616
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,687
That's exactly
what I'm telling you.

617
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,322
Hey, it's Mabel's dad.
I found him collapsed.

618
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,896
He's been vomiting.

619
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,309
He's weak, disoriented.

620
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,395
I treated him for severe
hypertension earlier.

621
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,318
Jason, have you eaten?

622
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,331
Okay. With his high blood
pressure from this morning,

623
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,599
I'm afraid he's having a stroke.

624
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,535
We need to get him
up to CT for imaging.

625
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,886
All right, I'll handle him
here. You run up to imaging,

626
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,704
force your way to
the front of the line,

627
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,556
- and throw elbows
if you have to.
- Okay, you know I will.

628
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,629
All right.

629
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,580
<i>All right.</i>

630
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:27,920
You are going to be in
position for a long time,

631
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,503
- so I suggest you get your
stretch on. 37 seconds and counting.

632
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:34,077
Nervous nurse, when you crank,

633
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,124
you are this baby's
heart. You hear me?

634
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,068
You are responsible
for circulating

635
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,267
oxygen-rich blood through all

636
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,753
of her tiny organs, so...

637
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,121
feel the heart.

638
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,905
Be the heart.

639
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,357
Now say it with me.

640
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,059
Feel the heart.

641
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,677
Be the heart.

642
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:52,963
Louder, so I can believe you.

643
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,965
Feel the heart. Be the heart.

644
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,811
- Better. Not great.
- Ten seconds.

645
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,186
All right, position for lights.

646
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:01,788
Seven, six,

647
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,090
five, four, three...

648
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:07,193
Here we go.

649
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:10,980
Be the heart.

650
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,933
Feel the heart.

651
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,952
Be the heart. Feel the heart.

652
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,665
- Go for perfusion.
- Feel the heart.

653
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,991
Be the heart. Feel the heart.

654
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:21,975
- Be the heart.
- Suction.

655
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:24,828
Feel the heart. Be the heart.

656
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,664
Feel the heart. Be the heart.

657
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,060
A hacker tried to get
into our system before.

658
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:31,596
Almost released the
worm a couple months ago.

659
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,964
It's hard to believe that
one of us would do this.

660
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:34,916
Is it, though?

661
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,591
Oh, God, what is that banging?

662
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:40,176
Come on. Come on.

663
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,612
Linda, need some help?

664
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,681
I am sick of this crap.

665
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,166
My patient needs sedation.

666
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,902
All right. There's a trick.

667
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:50,966
You know, when they
brought these computers in,

668
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,239
they said life would be easier.

669
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:54,074
My day got an hour longer

670
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:56,087
and I get to spend even
less time with my patients.

671
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:57,521
That works when there's power.

672
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,896
This works when
there's no power.

673
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,367
You've done that before.

674
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,123
Yeah. Hey, you know what?

675
00:30:06,155 --> 00:30:07,965
Smash all the computerized
do-dads and gizmos.

676
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,851
I won't tell anybody.
Maybe we can actually

677
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,219
start looking people
in the eye again

678
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,323
instead of staring at
screens all the time.

679
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:17,547
Hey, I'm not bitter.

680
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,198
Yes, I am.

681
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,967
I mean, she's not wrong.

682
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:22,447
You think she knows how
to write computer code?

683
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:23,998
Definitely not.

684
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,233
You said the hackers
tried to shut us down before.

685
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,469
Do we have dates? I mean,
we can see who was working

686
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,027
on those days and go from there.

687
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,374
No, no, no, no,
no. Don't tell me.

688
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:34,147
Dr. Pravesh, no more power.

689
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,794
CTs are shut down
until further notice.

690
00:30:35,818 --> 00:30:37,829
- You got to be kidding me.
- Unless you got a generator

691
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:39,736
- in your pocket.
- Oh, come on.

692
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,804
- Dr. Wilson.
- Make it good, Pravesh.

693
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,391
Blood pressure's
been 180/120 all day.

694
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,110
Weak, vomiting, abdominal
pain. Good enough?

695
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:52,732
Good catch. Could be
a hemorrhagic stroke.

696
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,485
Get him over to Atlanta
General ASAP for a CT to confirm.

697
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,754
I'll call ahead and
have Neuro waiting.

698
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,022
Helipad. Go.

699
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:02,436
Your wife and children
are in good hands.

700
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,573
We got to get you checked out
before things get worse, okay?

701
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:07,681
Let's go. Let's go, let's
go, let's go. Come on.

702
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:12,135
Wait, hold on.

703
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:16,657
Oh, my God.

704
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,861
- Whoa. What?
- Get me a BP

705
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:23,625
- and a blood sugar
reading, please.
- Okay.

706
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,199
Squeeze my hands. Squeeze them.

707
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:29,180
- We're ready to take off.
- I need just a second.

708
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:30,614
- Okay. It's okay.
- Okay, smile for me...

709
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,555
Pupil's reactive.

710
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,051
If we don't go now while
there's a break in the weather,

711
00:31:34,075 --> 00:31:35,258
we don't get out.

712
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,945
Blood sugar is 88.

713
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,414
BP... 90/50.

714
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:43,094
His blood pressure is dropping.
He's not having a stroke.

715
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:44,896
- He's having an
anaphylactic reaction.
- You sure?

716
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,086
It really looked like a stroke.

717
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:50,107
It presented with GI symptoms,
so I didn't catch it at first,

718
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:54,093
- but I'm sure.
- So is he staying or going?

719
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,228
He's staying.

720
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:58,298
Jason...

721
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,700
Jason, what are your allergies?

722
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:02,986
Hey! Do you have an epi?

723
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:11,511
Peanut butter, kale,
honey, broccoli...

724
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,216
It's okay. It's okay.

725
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:19,219
Come on, come on.

726
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,423
Mangos.

727
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,727
I'm allergic to mangos.

728
00:32:26,762 --> 00:32:29,162
Second to last ingredient.

729
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,181
Oh, my God.

730
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:32,816
Jason, you're gonna be okay.

731
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,604
All right. Let's see
what's going on.

732
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,992
Mmm, any good drugs?
Can I get in on the fun?

733
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:42,993
There you go, sister.

734
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,495
Ready to relax and
explore your humanity.

735
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:48,710
Okay...

736
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,034
Hmm.

737
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,189
Is there something wrong?

738
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:56,301
Joplin, where are the
pills I gave you earlier?

739
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:58,341
- In my belly.
- Try again,

740
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,354
because you have an
allergy to doxycycline,

741
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,112
and I haven't given
you an antihistamine yet.

742
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,682
And I'm seeing no
hives, no reaction, so...

743
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,118
you clearly didn't
take the pills.

744
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,136
Okay, Nancy Drew.

745
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:12,622
You're right, I flushed the
antibiotics down the toilet.

746
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,206
What?

747
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,153
I mean, if you're not
gonna do what they say,

748
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:19,112
why are we even at the hospital?

749
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:21,398
Joplin, what are you doing

750
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,044
on your phone in the
middle of the night?

751
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,478
Just, like, texting,
Instagramming?

752
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,670
Uh, no. she writes
code for different apps.

753
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:29,505
It-it doesn't pay much,
but it's something.

754
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,192
What were you studying when
you dropped out of college?

755
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:36,512
Software engineering
at MIT. What's going on?

756
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,843
Better question is why
I'm not at MIT anymore.

757
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:42,235
Answer: hospital bills so
crippling, I had to drop out

758
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,454
and she had to
declare bankruptcy.

759
00:33:46,408 --> 00:33:49,826
Are you faking
symptoms to be here?

760
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,656
Look, we want less
hospital, not more...

761
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,047
Why would she fake her symptoms?

762
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:56,661
Because I think she hacked
into our system to shut us down.

763
00:33:56,685 --> 00:33:58,062
That's crazy. Joplin...

764
00:33:58,086 --> 00:33:59,319
This isn't the first time

765
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:00,431
that someone's hacked
into our computer.

766
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,505
The attacks started on July 4.

767
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,090
You were here then.

768
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:08,444
Is this true?

769
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,947
Did you do this?

770
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,750
- Why? Why would you do...
- Are you kidding me?

771
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,669
Medical bills ruined us.

772
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:18,171
Chastain ruined us. I
can't get the job that I want

773
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:19,522
without the degree from MIT.

774
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,523
We are making it work.

775
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,458
We are barely getting by.

776
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,372
You're working two jobs
in order to make payments

777
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,357
to Chastain for my
bill. And for what?

778
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:27,681
So the hospital can get rich?

779
00:34:27,716 --> 00:34:30,132
Damn right I hacked
into the billing department.

780
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,595
To get our lives back.
To wipe our slate clean.

781
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:33,386
Wait, the billing department?

782
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:35,738
No, your cyber
attack is responsible

783
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,523
for this entire power outage.

784
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,036
That's not possible.
The code I created

785
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,071
was only to wipe out billing.

786
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:41,595
Whatever you intended,

787
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,746
it did a hell of a
lot more than that.

788
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,459
You severed our
connection to the grid.

789
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,867
You said that was the storm.

790
00:34:46,902 --> 00:34:48,151
We were wrong.

791
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,253
Well, I-I messed up.

792
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,238
- It must've rep...
- People's lives

793
00:34:51,273 --> 00:34:53,139
are in danger because of you.

794
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:56,159
I... I-I can try to fix it.

795
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,234
Let me try to fix it.

796
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,638
If she can fix this, do you have
to tell anyone what happened?

797
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,823
You saw the damage
her virus caused.

798
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,020
Joplin's a good person
who did something stupid.

799
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,761
Young people do dumb stuff.

800
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:16,340
I hear you, but right
now let's just focus

801
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,831
on getting the hospital
back up and running again.

802
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,000
Look, I know I'm asking
for too much, but...

803
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,854
so far, no one's
gotten hurt, right?

804
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,856
We are barely
surviving as it is.

805
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,959
I honestly don't know how...

806
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,577
Please, I know this is bad...

807
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:32,445
Here. Uh, i-it's a full backup

808
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,375
of-of the hospital
computers I made

809
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,460
before I did what I
should've never done.

810
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:38,585
A-All hackers make 'em, in case.

811
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,660
Give it to I.T. They'll
know what to do.

812
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:44,958
I deserve whatever
happens to me, but

813
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:46,525
Rachel didn't know anything.

814
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,978
Make sure they know that.

815
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:50,029
And that I'm sorry. I really am.

816
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,000
I'll pass that on.

817
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,355
God. I'm sorry.

818
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,024
- Sorry...
- Don't...

819
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,171
I gave the drive to I.T.
Power's being restored now.

820
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,790
But Bell doesn't
need to know that yet.

821
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:07,458
No, we're gonna
lie to help Joplin out.

822
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:09,816
I like that way
you think. I'm in.

823
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:13,152
We can get you the
antidote to the malware.

824
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:15,249
The person is remorseful
and asking for leniency

825
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:16,239
before they hand it out.

826
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,523
Blackmail?

827
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:19,025
Let's just call it negotiating.

828
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,626
Well, what are we talking about?

829
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:22,306
A nurse demanding
more mental health days?

830
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,998
Some millennial intern's crusade

831
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:26,744
for more acai bowls
in the cafeteria?

832
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,162
A patient

833
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,047
whose life was
destroyed by Chastain.

834
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:31,087
And a PR nightmare.

835
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:32,922
Don't need another one of those.

836
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,235
Chastain's computers
were vulnerable.

837
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,054
- Our generators
weren't up to code.
- Not my fault.

838
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:38,939
- Press won't see it that way.
- Patients' lives

839
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,775
were in jeopardy. It's
unlikely they'll put the blame

840
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,365
on Charles the I.T. guy.

841
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,495
What is it with you two?

842
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:46,047
Sticking your necks
out for some patient

843
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,654
you just met a few hours ago.

844
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,155
Seriously?

845
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:51,241
Chastain shined during

846
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,326
a crippling power
outage likely caused

847
00:36:53,362 --> 00:36:55,862
by...

848
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:57,280
bad weather.

849
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:00,083
And a young patient's life

850
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,001
isn't completely ruined.

851
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:05,554
That's a win-win.

852
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,074
Well, nice try, but hacking
into a hospital database,

853
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:09,709
cutting off its power,

854
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:11,127
endangering countless lives...

855
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:14,359
I need a name.

856
00:37:14,383 --> 00:37:16,048
We're not asking for anonymity.

857
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,234
We're just asking for leniency.

858
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:23,556
Well...

859
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,386
handling this
quickly and quietly

860
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,611
is in everyone's best interest.

861
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:31,013
So, deal?

862
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,182
Yeah.

863
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,623
Wait for it.

864
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:44,077
Wait for it...

865
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,763
Ah.

866
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,431
And then there was light,

867
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,417
and he saw that it was good.

868
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,956
We saved that kid's life.

869
00:37:56,991 --> 00:37:58,558
He's gonna make it, by the way.

870
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:00,576
You sure<i> you're</i> gonna make it?

871
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,757
That improv surgery is the
craziest thing I've ever done

872
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,093
in my life. I mean, I don't
know whether to thank you

873
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,078
or to punch you.

874
00:38:07,102 --> 00:38:09,085
Hey, I carried a fully-grown man

875
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,847
up three flights
of stairs today.

876
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,689
And you're telling me this why?

877
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,640
Because I broke a sweat

878
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:18,060
and you know where
there's a secret shower.

879
00:38:21,116 --> 00:38:23,111
Dr. Benjamin's office.
You earned these today.

880
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:27,036
But... you didn't
get 'em from me.

881
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,672
You have my word.

882
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,026
You do know Benjamin
<i>is</i> back in the office now?

883
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,633
Good.

884
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:45,166
Uh, what happened
in the elevator

885
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,639
stays in the elevator.

886
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:50,109
Not something I'd
want to advertise.

887
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:51,494
Right.

888
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,966
Looks good.

889
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:01,320
Make sure he takes it
easy for the next few days.

890
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,656
Not sure that's how
this new-dad thing works.

891
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:05,074
I've got my eye on him.

892
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,190
I'll keep him in line.

893
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:09,145
Uh, thank you, Dr. Pravesh.

894
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,130
We can't... can't
thank you enough.

895
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:14,400
Mr. and Mrs. Thoms, someone
here is excited to see you.

896
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:21,540
Your daughter's a warrior.

897
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:22,987
We repaired her heart,

898
00:39:23,011 --> 00:39:25,595
and it's even stronger
than we expected.

899
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,527
How long has he been crying?

900
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:32,035
Since they took
Mabel for surgery.

901
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,020
Nothing we've tried
has calmed him.

902
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:43,179
I have an idea.

903
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:47,178
Until today, these
babies shared a womb.

904
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:51,353
They don't know an existence
without the touch of the other.

905
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,352
And then they were thrust
into a huge, cold world,

906
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:56,192
alone.

907
00:39:58,212 --> 00:40:00,479
They missed each other.

908
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,351
Everything's gonna be A-OK.

909
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,890
I don't think it's working.

00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:14,610

Resting comfortably.

922
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,600

You're fired.

929
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:35,875
What?

930
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,504
- I just saved your neck.
- You risked.

931
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,096
I saved. Get out.

932
00:41:41,883 --> 00:41:43,310
First thing tomorrow,
we need to...

933
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,000
You're wholly incompetent.

934
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,169
- Meaning?
- You're fired.

935
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:49,672
Talk to HR about severance.

936
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:01,300
Any available resident to ICU 3.

937
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:03,836
Dr. Bell.

938
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:05,722
You wanted to see me?

939
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:07,873
Great save today.

940
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:10,170
Thank you. You know, it's
days like this that make...

941
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,495
Just cut the crap and tell me
exactly what happened in the ER.

942
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,032
Who was there?

943
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,271
Who made the first cut,

944
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:23,806
you or Conrad Hawkins?

945
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,094
My place?

946
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:35,067
I don't know. I'm so tired.

947
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:37,603
Oh, we'll be sleeping like
babies before you know it.

948
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,905
That sounds amazing.
