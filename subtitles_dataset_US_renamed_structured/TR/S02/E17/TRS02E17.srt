<i>No. And he may never wake up.</i>

113
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,971

we'll never find out

I have a pretty good idea.

122

141
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:23,034
Oh. No, uh,

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,654
- we're just friends.
- Best friends. Together since...

143
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:29,474
Since she blocked off the
seesaw to explain the relationship

144
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,738
between distance and mass
to our kindergarten class.

145
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:35,141
But not together-together,
you know, it's-it's more like...

146
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:36,643
Like study buddies,
but definitely...

147
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,549
- Not a couple. No.
- No.

148
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,019
Uh, okay. Well, my mistake.

149
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,048
Um, but there are other
ways you can contract mono.

150
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,717
I mean, if you use
the same toothbrush,

151
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:47,375

00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,945
He was struggling. Whatever
he knew, whatever he did,

180
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,097
the guilt was starting
to eat away at him.

181
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,417
Are you thinking this
wasn't a suicide attempt?

182
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,318
- Yeah.
- I think Gordon tried

183
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:40,104
to have him silenced.

184
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,923
You're suggesting Gordon
had Abe Benedict shot?

185
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,425
Well, I would believe that

186
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,339
over Abe putting a
bullet in his own chest.

187
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:48,329
He was a heart surgeon.

188
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:50,109
He knew where to
aim if he wanted to die.

189
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,877
And suicide just doesn't
fit the man I know.

190
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,437
Abe jogged every night on
two bad knees to keep healthy.

191
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:57,472
The man loved life.

192
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:59,452
But he also took a million
dollars from QuoVadis.

193
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:01,470
That didn't fit the
man you knew, either.

194
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,611
Well, doctors commit suicide.

195
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:05,958
It happens. More
than we'd like to admit.

196
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:07,460
This is too coincidental.

197
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:08,694
This, on top of what
happened to Julian,

198
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,798
and we still don't even
know where she is.

199
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,467
Looks like the bullet hit
the spleen and kidney.

200
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,740
It clipped his heart as well.

201
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,124
.22 caliber.

202
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,255
Sometimes a bullet has
enough power to enter the body,

203
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,845
but not enough to go through.

204
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,998
Yeah, I've seen a bullet enter
a lung and end up in a leg.

205
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,312
You know, if we save his
life, we can get some answers.

206
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:28,386
Let's scrub in.

207
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:29,871
Keep me updated.

208
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,748
His hand is moving.

209
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,429
Sedation is too light.
Bolus 50 of propofol

210
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,665
and increase the rate.

211
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:48,739
Dr. Benedict? Can you hear me?

212
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,944
Whoa, whoa. He's
trying to say something.

213
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,198
Don't let him pull out
his tube, he could arrest.

214
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:04,422
- Damn it.
- Keep the propofol at that rate.

215
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,252
We can't force Abe to
speak or do anything else

216
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:07,758
that would harm our patient.

217
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,204
Stay focused. We
need to put saving his life

218
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,645
above everything else.
Get him to the OR now.

219
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:17,697
The bullet hit the spleen
and the left kidney.

220
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:19,120
Actively hemorrhaging.

221
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,475
- There's no time for repair.
- I'll resect the spleen.

222
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,007
Go.

223
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:25,909
Will you look at that?

224
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,017
Insidious devil.

225
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,905
Spleen is out.
Bleeding controlled.

226
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:42,160
He's acidotic and coagulopathic.

227
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,662
If you cut him any more,
he's not coming off that table.

228
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:47,415
- Damage control surgery?
- Yeah.

229
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,002
Now, listen up. We wrap
him but we do not close.

230
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,486
Take him out and let him heal,

231
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,522
and we bring him
back when he's ready.

232
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,658
- You couldn't close?
- No?

233
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,838
The amount of surgery
he needs to fix everything

234
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,914
would be too much for a
body to handle in one go.

235
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,760
How long until
you can go back in?

236
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:23,835
It's a long range.

237
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,886
Could be hours, could be days.

238
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:29,907
This is not the
outcome we wanted.

239
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:34,445
Formula for stress?

240
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,983
Sigma equals...

241
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,136
applied force over...

242
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,688
Can't concentrate.

243
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:45,890
We don't need to do this.

244
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,776
Please. You need to rest.

245
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:51,178
Can't. Too hard to breathe.

246
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:54,766
If I fall asleep... I'm
afraid I won't wake up.

247
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:57,902
Sydney, Evan.

248
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,337
This is Dr. Hawkins.

249
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,955
We're gonna take
a closer look at you.

250
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:04,291
- Hello.
- Double mono patients.

251
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:05,838
Sydney is stable,
but Evan is hypoxic.

252
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,228
Chest X-ray was just done,

253
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,246
and we're waiting
on the results.

254
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,926
But I think we
need to up the O2.

255
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,219
Look, please help him.
He's getting much worse.

256
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,593
Yeah, we should crank up the O2.

257
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,813
And let's order a
breathing treatment.

258
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:28,082
I like the dedication.

259
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,912
Still studying when
you feel this lousy.

260
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,686
Finals.

261
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:33,120
Mechanical engineering.

262
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,119
We're gonna design
a... high-speed train

263
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:40,194
from... Atlanta to Nashville.

264
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,440
So he can go home
on the weekends.

265
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,597
That's where we're both from.

266
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,171
Why is Evan so much worse
when we both have mono?

267
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:53,223
The truth is it's hard
to know. Each person

268
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,858
reacts differently to a virus.

269
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,188
But he's gonna be okay, right?

270
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:58,880
Um, just one second...

271
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:06,019
His X-ray's back.
This is really bad.

272
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,720
All right, let's get
him to the ICU.

273
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,160
Okay.

274
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,874
Let's start him on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

275
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:18,399
Call respiratory. Put him on a
BiPap when we get to the unit.

276
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,546
And I need another full
set of labs with a blood gas.

277
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,487
Yes, Doctor.

278
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,290
ICU? That's bad, isn't it?

279
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,553
Well, his mono's caused
him to develop pneumonia.

280
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:29,571
- Pneumonia?
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

281
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,390
Listen, let's just
try to stay calm

282
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:33,447
so we can be there
for Evan. Okay?

283
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,883
Okay. Calm.

284
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:39,754
Not one of my best traits,
but I can do it for him.

285
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:42,306
You got this. Here,
come with me.

286
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,010
<i>Dr. Friedman,
please call Recovery.</i>

287
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,732
- Lactate levels?
- Coming down.

288
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,401
- Most recent hematocrit?
- 24% stable.

289
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:54,496
But there was a lot of trauma.

290
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,998
Can we take him
back to surgery now?

291
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,916
He needs time for his
hemodynamics to stabilize.

292
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,669
His IVC is leaking. We
need to repair it quickly.

293
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,494
- Our first pass was crude.
- We bring him back in now,

294
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,708
- I don't think he makes it.
- We need to decide. Soon.

295
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,681
I know, Mina.

296
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,719
How's he doing?

297
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,089
If we dialed back his sedatives,

298
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,520
do you think he'd
be able to speak?

299
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,426
That's inappropriate, Pravesh.

300
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:21,023
It wouldn't hurt him.
And it might even...

301
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,363
You are too close to this case.

302
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,132
And you're not?

303
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:32,690
Go back to the ER, Pravesh.

304
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,159
I will keep you updated.

305
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,155
Book an OR.

306
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,039
We'll give him a half hour,

307
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,009
we'll go back into surgery,
and we'll finish the job.

308
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,903
Mono patient in the ICU.

309
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,640
Nurse says he's spiraling down.

310
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:07,759
Evan? Evan?!

311
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,205
What's going on?

312
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,506
It's like he's
drowning. Help him!

313
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,090
Get him up.

314
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,316
He has crackles
throughout his lungs.

315
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,351
BiPap isn't enough.

316
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:19,821
- He needs a vent.
- Please, what does that mean?

317
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,583
He can't breathe on his
own anymore, so the vent

318
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,051
- will breathe for him.
- Evan, I'm here.

319
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,193
I won't leave you.

320
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:26,194
We need to intubate now.

321
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:27,662
I'm already on it. I paged RT.

322
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:28,791
You need to wait outside.

323
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,047
I want to stay with him.

324
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,560
I'll come get you
when he's settled.

325
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,035
Evan.

326
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:38,089
Here. Pass it over.

327
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,481
Exposing the heart

328
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,439
and the abdominal contents.

329
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,546
Removing the packs.

330
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,652
14 in total?

331
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:12,422
Proceeding to repair the IVC.

332
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,877
Just keep it going.

333
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,390
Keep it steady. Keep it.

334
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:20,414
Keep it steady.
Keep it going. Keep it.

335
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,053
Take a step back.

336
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:28,072
Clear your head.

337
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,424
I have this.

338
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,832
Back in the game?

339
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,534
Back in the game, baby.

340
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,954
Works every time.

341
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:01,355
You should try it.

342
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,291
Oh, not in this
lifetime, but thanks.

343
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,929
You know, it's
just now hitting me,

344
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:10,932
despite my disappointment,

345
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,601
how much Abe means to me.

346
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:17,088
And I am gonna give
him a shot at redemption.

347
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,349
Howard Loomis.

348
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,037
Do I know you?

349
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,405
Marshall Winthrop.

350
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,068
Oh, of course.
We met at the, uh,

351
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,159
Signature CEO
Conference in Boca.

352
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:41,473
Yes. And you run
CliffCrest Management,

353
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:43,417
- a hedge fund out of Miami.
- I do.

354
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,866
I heard whispers that you
made a special trip here

355
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,400
to see Gordon Page.

356
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,981
I'm, uh, I'm late for
another meeting.

357
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:50,137
Is there a point to this?

358
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:52,056
Just giving you fair warning.

359
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,341
The bad news is not
all out on this company.

360
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,576
A whistle-blower was
going to come forward,

361
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,846
a prominent
doctor on the inside.

362
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,097
And?

363
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,982
Well, this morning he showed up

364
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:06,187
in the Chastain Park ER
with a bullet in his chest.

365
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,740
What-what are you saying?

366
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:13,410
Just that it may or may
not have been self-inflicted.

367
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:16,508
Gordon Page is a dangerous man.

368
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:19,449
Not someone you
want to do business with.

369
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:23,070
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but when a man like you

370
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:25,539
tracks down a man like
me with information like this,

371
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,842
then I start wondering.

372
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,760
What my angle is.

373
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:32,412
To stop a monster from
destroying more lives.

374
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:36,099
For men like you and me,
it's usually all about money.

375
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,120
But with this one, it's simply
about doing what's right.

376
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,260
His O2 sats keep going down

377
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:48,657
even though we've
gone up on the vent.

378
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,075
All right, there's
something new going on.

379
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,339
Pull up his most recent X-rays.

380
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,653
God. He has new
bilateral infiltrates.

381
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,154
His lungs are inflamed.

382
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,392
It's too much trauma

383
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,427
from the bullet
and the surgeries.

384
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:06,964
ARDS.

385
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,266
What do we do now?

386
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,500
He's maxed out on his
vent setting. What now?

387
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,009
Nic, if his lungs are
failing, he won't live long.

388
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,394
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

389
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,563
He needs ECMO.

390
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:24,315
Yep.

391
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:27,151
I'm on it.

392
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,870
Is he dying?

393
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,194
The virus is making
his lungs very sick.

394
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,846
Even the vent isn't getting
him the oxygen that he needs.

395
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,949
You have to save him. Please.

396
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:43,617
We have a plan.

397
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:45,648
And I promise we're
not gonna give up.

398
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,421
I screwed up.

399
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:49,790
I was too afraid to tell
him how I really feel,

400
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,745
and now I might
not get the chance.

401
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,728
You're in love with him.

402
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,600
Last summer, I...

403
00:21:59,635 --> 00:22:02,219
went to this engineering
intensive at Duke.

404
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:06,123
Thought I would set up
my future and make friends.

405
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,560
Then I got there,
and I... didn't.

406
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,679
I didn't even try.

407
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:14,648
I spent all day wishing

408
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,683
I could see Evan.

409
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,838
I quit after two weeks.

410
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:24,241
Told my family I
was just homesick.

411
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,677
But the truth was...

412
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,713
I was homesick for him.

413
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:33,700
I never told him
how I really felt

414
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:37,838
'cause I didn't want
to ruin our friendship.

415
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:42,009
And now...

416
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:45,179
it might be too late.

417
00:22:46,716 --> 00:22:48,415
Come here.

418
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,203
We're gonna do our best.

419
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:55,917
What's happening with Abe?

420
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,736
Nothing good. And
his lungs are failing.

421
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,026
I have a patient, Evan Weston,

422
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:02,374
- who needs to go on ECMO.
- We're having the same
discussion about Abe.

423
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:04,510
Yeah, well, the hospital
has two machines.

424
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:07,267
I'll see if they're available.

425
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,336
Uh, ECMO? What is that?

426
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:10,715
ECMO stands for

427
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:12,699
extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation.

428
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,936
It's a machine that's used
when a patient's lungs

429
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,522
are severely
damaged and the vent

430
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:18,579
isn't providing enough
oxygen for them.

431
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:20,380
Is it dangerous?

432
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,416
This move is very risky.

433
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:28,171
This is a last-ditch effort.

434
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:32,387
We'll have to get
the parents' consent.

435
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,596
Chastain does have two
machines, but one's taken.

436
00:23:35,631 --> 00:23:37,381
Has been for a week.

437
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,616
Great. So we have two
patients who need ECMO

438
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,452
if they have any chance to live.

439
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:43,988
And only one will get it.

440
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:46,323
How do we choose?

441
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,153
Can we transfer
one of these patients

442
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,578
- to a different hospital?
- They're both too sick.

443
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:51,723
- They wouldn't
survive transport.
- There must be

444
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:53,997
a spare machine
somewhere in Atlanta.

445
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,011
I called. All of the ones
in the city are in use.

446
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,579
The closest one is Louisville.
That's a day's drive away.

447
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,087
- Someone has to play God.
- Abe needs the machine

448
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:01,555
in the next 30 minutes.

449
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,591
So does Evan.

450
00:24:03,626 --> 00:24:06,126
Abe Benedict is a
world-renowned surgeon.

451
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:07,989
He's got at least
20 years to live,

452
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,514
which means he can teach
hundreds of budding surgeons

453
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,627
during that time.
Saving Abe will be saving

454
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,835
- many lives.
- He's also a possible suicide.

455
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,498
Look, I'm sorry, but are
we really gonna give this

456
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,750
to the 60-year-old man who
might not even want to live?

457
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:20,240
Abe did not attempt suicide.

458
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:23,244
Evan Weston is
a 22-year-old kid.

459
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,273
- He's got his whole life...
- Look, just... look,
hang on a second.

460
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,764
Everybody in this room has a
personal stake in the outcome.

461
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,283
It's already a major conflict.

462
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:31,668
I think we should keep
emotions out of this.

463
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,088
- So what are you proposing?
- Statistics.

464
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:35,522
At this point in their lives,

465
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,435
Evan Weston has the most
years to gain. He should get

466
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:39,354
- the machine. Well, and
there's another consideration.

467
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,195
The patient has to survive ECMO.

468
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,264
Evan's young, he's far stronger.

469
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:45,833
Abe...

470
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:48,052
just had major surgery.

471
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,054
I am sure

472
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,340
that Evan is a great kid, and
no one wants to see him die.

473
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:57,311
But Abe Benedict has damning
information about QuoVadis

474
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:59,457
and Gordon Page, the man
who may have had Julian killed.

475
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:01,677
Okay, that is a speculation.
I mean, you said so yourself.

476
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:05,302
No one wants to take down
QuoVadis more than I do,

477
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,254
but... Mina's right.

478
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,592
We need to keep
emotions out of this.

479
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,813
Evan Weston goes on ECMO.

480
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,547
That's the decision.

481
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:34,748
It looks like Abe Benedict will
never regain consciousness.

482
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:37,501
Hmm. I'm sorry to hear that.

483
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,853
Did you speak to Gordon's
investor like I suggested?

484
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:44,290
Howard Loomis had
a crisis of conscience.

485
00:25:45,928 --> 00:25:47,944
Yes, he did.

486
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,564
Gordon is scrambling.
But that means nothing

487
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,251
unless we can use his
desperation to take him down.

488
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,936
I'm listening.

489
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,891
I go back in, bluff,
make him believe

490
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,754
Abe Benedict told us
everything we need.

491
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,523
No way. You're not doing that.

492
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:06,279
I'll be wired this time.

493
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,631
The FBI is close.

494
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,602
They want him just
as bad as we do.

495
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:14,771
Son, this is the time.

496
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,251
If we don't seize
this opportunity,

497
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,642
Gordon gets away
with everything,

498
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,361
he rebuilds his empire.

499
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:24,297
Trust me, he'll find
the money somewhere.

500
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,588
Okay.

501
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:40,613
Dad.

502
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,818
Be careful.

503
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,346
This is a recording device,

504
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,949
and it will get every word
spoken within a 20-foot radius.

505
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,969
Got it.

506
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,523
Just stick to the script.

507
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,409
And remember, if
you get in trouble,

508
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:11,177
we're listening.

509
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,564
And we can get to you
in under five minutes.

510
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:39,039
♪ ♪

511
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,643
How you doing?

512
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:07,813
It just all looks so terrifying.

513
00:28:07,837 --> 00:28:10,587
Is that machine really
gonna help him breathe?

514
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,324
His lungs will barely move,
but that's because the machine

515
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,710
is actually breathing for him.

516
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,577
Look, why don't we get you
set up in the family room?

517
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,017
This could take a while.

518
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,191
When he wakes up...

519
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,743
if he wakes up...

520
00:28:35,197 --> 00:28:38,214
I'm gonna tell him how I feel.

521
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,934
I think that's a good idea.

522
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,821
Come on.

523
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,299
Things got...

524
00:28:57,753 --> 00:29:00,603
complicated, lately.

525
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,758
Never in a million years

526
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:08,612
did I think we would
end up like this.

527
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:19,522
I'm sorry, brother.

528
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,740
Ready to put Evan on ECMO?

529
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,261
- We're all set.
- All right. Let's do it.

530
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,852
♪ ♪

531
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:24,637
Oxygen saturation
is up. We're at 92%.

532
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,369
Nic Nevin probably
just saved your life.

533
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:29,709
Live long and prosper.

534
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,183
We still have work to do.

535
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,805
I've already upped
his PEEP to 18.

536
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,007
No, easy on his lungs.

537
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,659
Push too much, they'll pop.

538
00:30:45,694 --> 00:30:48,328
He's still hypoxemic.

539
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,885
He's showing signs of
multisystem organ failure.

540
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,836
How can I help?

541
00:30:57,873 --> 00:30:59,873
I got nothing.

542
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,547
Well, what if...

543
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:09,933
Wait!

544
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,219
Maybe...

545
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:15,574
we just need to change his
point of view on the world.

546
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:18,936
Well, I'm open to suggestions.
Good ones, at least.

547
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,010
We prone him.

548
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,763
Turn him over, let
gravity force more oxygen

549
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,415
into the rest of his lungs.

550
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,244
He just had major
abdominal surgery.

551
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:29,536
You turn him upside
down, his incisions will tear.

552
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:32,589
His insides will spill onto
the floor... literally, Pravesh.

553
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,702
Let's make sure they don't.
We'll tighten his bandages.

554
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,704
Come on, he's in
respiratory failure.

555
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,045
What else do we have to lose?

556
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,040
I say we go with
Dr. Pravesh's plan.

557
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:44,717
Okay.

558
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,520
Let's call and order
the rotating bed.

559
00:31:47,556 --> 00:31:48,755
Okay.

560
00:31:58,117 --> 00:31:59,666
Strap him in, wrap him up.

561
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:22,939
Secured.

562
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:25,158
All right.

563
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,327
Turn him over, nice and slow.

564
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:02,774
Loomis has decided to
take his money elsewhere.

565
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:05,632
I do whatever it takes
to get what I want.

566
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:08,613
Hmm. I can appreciate that.

567
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:12,472
Good, because I'm still
willing to make an offer.

568
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,342
Same number as before.

569
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:17,005
No, that was when
you had options.

570
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:21,348
I was paying a hefty
premium then to compete.

571
00:33:21,383 --> 00:33:25,318
I'm offering less now,
but still a substantial sum.

572
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:28,299
No. No. Why should I take that?

573
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:30,606
Because you don't have a choice.

574
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:34,878
Men like you and I
always have choices.

575
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:38,397
I can walk. Fold the company.

576
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,900
Raise capital and
reinvent myself.

577
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,536
Start over somewhere else.

578
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,871
It's my specialty.

579
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,757
Agreed.

580
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,226
But when I bury someone,
I make sure they're firmly

581
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,679
in the ground where nobody
can hear them scream.

582
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,332
You didn't do that.

583
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,986
Right now, Abe Benedict
is in a hospital room

584
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,666
at Chastain.

585
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,740
The air filling his lungs

586
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,243
is allowing his mouth to move.

587
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,278
He's talking.

588
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:12,065
Trust me, he's saying
things that leave you

589
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,834
only one choice.

590
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,569
I don't believe you.

591
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:20,407
You don't now.
But you soon will.

592
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:23,693
In 15 minutes, lights
will start flashing outside.

593
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,462
They will have a
warrant for your arrest.

594
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,681
Take my money and disappear.

595
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:31,267
I will run QuoVadis without you.

596
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,064
Go hide out on an
island somewhere

597
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,788
without extradition
laws to the U.S.

598
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,356
Live large.

599
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:39,659
That's as good as
an admission of guilt.

600
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,863
I don't care.

601
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:44,914
Best and final.

602
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,906
Call him.

603
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:55,091
Who?

604
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:58,244
Your son.

605
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:03,500
There are some details
I'd like to know from Abe,

606
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,586
now that he can talk.

607
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,923
O2 sats are no better.

608
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,003
It takes a few minutes
for gravity to do its job.

609
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,295
Yeah, well, he doesn't
have a few minutes.

610
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:18,431
- Is your dad...
- Going to QuoVadis, yes.

611
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,344
We're taking one last shot
at bringing down Gordon.

612
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,013
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

613
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,938
Guys. O2 sats are rising.

614
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:28,291
88.

615
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:31,360
92.

616
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,863
It's working.

617
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,606
I know. I know you're
thinking we should...

618
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,291
back off the sedation

619
00:35:45,327 --> 00:35:47,276
to see if we can
get him to talk.

620
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,013
Don't you?

621
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:53,633
Abe wakes up and bucks
his vent, his O2 sats will crater.

622
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,535
You said so yourself:

623
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,171
Abe Benedict needs a
chance at redemption.

624
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,147
Dial back the propofol.

625
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,000
He's waking.

626
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:33,006
Park him at 45 degrees.

627
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:49,689
Hey, boss. Welcome back.

628
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:52,208
Can you hear me?

629
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,628
Now, you wanted to talk to me.

630
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,599
Listen, man, whatever
you know that can help us...

631
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,302
Please, now is the time.

632
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:09,993
He wants to write it down.

633
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:31,948
SEVER?

634
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,067
We got to figure
out what this means.

635
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:41,574
You did good, man.
You're gonna be okay.

636
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:49,432
This is my dad.

637
00:37:55,757 --> 00:37:58,591
- Conrad.
<i>- Dad.</i>

638
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,559
- You okay?
<i>- Gordon Page</i>

639
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:02,178
<i>would like to talk you.</i>

640
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,908
<i>He wants proof</i>

641
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:06,682
that Abe Benedict is alive.

642
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,023
Okay. Put him on.

643
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,382
Dr. Hawkins.

644
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:25,234
SEVER.

645
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:31,874
SEVER.

646
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:34,877
<i>You want proof, there it is.</i>

647
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,658
<i>Abe Benedict is
alive and he's talking</i>

648
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:37,930
about you and your company.

649
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:38,948
There's nothing to talk about.

650
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,149
My company broke no rules.

651
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,779
<i>Made devices in China,</i>

652
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,987
copied faulty devices.

653
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,783
All the people you hurt.

654
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:46,822
I hurt no one.

655
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,119
<i>Heart valves that failed.</i>

656
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:50,171
The VNS device you put
in an eight-year-old boy

657
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,722
that stopped his heart
over and over again.

658
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,780
<i>I built this company
from nothing.</i>

659
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:55,398
Abe was overcome with guilt.

660
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,861
- Abe was a coward.
- No, he was

661
00:38:56,885 --> 00:38:58,129
- a hero.
- Abe was gonna destroy

662
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,397
everything that
I sacrificed for.

663
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:00,669
And you tried to kill him!

664
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:03,539
I had no choice!

665
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:08,861
<i>Dad?</i>

666
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,763
Dad?

667
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,505
Earlier today, I...

668
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,009
was admiring your $80,000 Rolex.

669
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,012
It's not often that I
change my watch

670
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,158
in the middle of the day.

671
00:39:28,182 --> 00:39:29,232
Search him.

672
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:36,139
Who's listening to us?

673
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,691
Who's listening to us?

674
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:40,259
The FBI.

675
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,479
Son of a bitch.

676
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,918
Bring him.

677
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,160
You're coming with me.

678
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:02,549
We'll leave through the garage.

679
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,803
FBI! Hands in the air! Freeze!

680
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,890
