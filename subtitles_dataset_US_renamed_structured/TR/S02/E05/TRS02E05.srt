00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:04,297
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident..
<i>- Oh, my God. It's Bradley.</i>

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:06,154
I love you, too.

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,917
<i>And I do think it'll
be different this tim.</i>

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,325
I hear you have a
wedding coming up.

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,389
- You studying up
to do a Bollywood dance?
- I have two left feet.

6
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,391
<i>Well, maybe I can
help. I was a dancer.</i>

7
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,915
Dr. Benedict at Atlanta
General told me all about you.

8
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,478
Said you were the best
student he ever had.

9
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,542
- You know Abe?
- Who's this douche?

10
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:22,582
Head of the hottest new medical
device company in the country.

11
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,239
Also the most eligible bachelor.

12
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,569
We all know you're the
most eligible bachelor.

13
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,488
<i>Dr. Bell is meeting
my boss, Gordon Page.</i>

14
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:30,523
I've done some reading on
your vagus nerve stimulator.

15
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:32,241
- Is it everything I hear?
- More.

16
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,610
It exceeded all
our expectations.

17
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,166
We're gonna help so many people.

18
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,936
If you can't land
Gordon, I will.

19
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,276
Rare high-altitude potatoes.

20
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,922
Glacier water.

21
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,530
Quadruple-filtrated through...

22
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:50,215
uncut diamonds.

23
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:54,669
Cheers.

24
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:56,387
Cheers.

25
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:01,293
Best one yet.

26
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,522
Well, have I convinced you?

27
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:03,762
No, you didn't need to.

28
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,875
I did my homework.

29
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,576
Your new VNS
device is top-rated.

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,461
All the QuoVadis
products are solid.

31
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,302
Why'd I buy all this vodka?

32
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:12,897
Because you want more. You
want exclusivity in my hospital.

33
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,441
Smart man.

34
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,778
So, what do you need

35
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,465
to make all QuoVadis devices
Chastain's standard of care?

36
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,467
It's not what I need. It's
what Chastain needs.

37
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,432
Something to impact
our bottom line.

38
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,071
A discount. Deep discount.

39
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:31,489
40%.

40
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,141
Whew.

41
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,776
I never give more than ten.

42
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,506
And that's a hell
of a profit margin.

43
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,009
- Before you mark up
the patients.
- 30.

44
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,066
20. Final offer.

45
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,129
And that's only because
you can hold your liquor.

46
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,620
Chastain can get that number

47
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,783
from any of the established
device manufacturers.

48
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,668
Why should I go with
you, aside from the vodka?

49
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,259
Because, as QuoVadis's
newest opinion leader,

50
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:54,279
you can speak at conferences,
like the one in Cabo next week.

51
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,098
You fly on the company jet.

52
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,933
Five-star hotel. Gourmet meals.

53
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:02,120
Abundant downtime to hit the
beach with a margarita in hand.

54
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,772
Of course, there's a small
speaking fee and stipend.

55
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:08,610
It's not much, but
we can offer you 200.

56
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,361
Thousand.

57
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,469
Uh...

58
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:29,381
That and a 25% discount,
and you have a deal.

59
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,371
♪ ♪

60
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:06,201
- Voilà.
- Mmm, doughnuts.

61
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:07,998
- I'm starving.
- Have one.

62
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,188
You're the best.

63
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:13,007
- Mmm. Chocolate. Good?
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,994
Morning. Fresh from the oven.

65
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,524
- Very kind of you.
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:19,881
- You made those?
- Someone else's oven.

67
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,317
QuoVadis is just
the delivery system.

68
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:23,851
No, thanks.

69
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,853
He doesn't do carbs.

70
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,537
I don't do bribes.

71
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,434
I heard you're
helpful in the OR,

72
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,703
but I'm not a fan of sales
reps inside the hospital.

73
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,255
Seems like a
conflict of interest.

74
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,119
- No offense.
- None taken.

75
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,125
You know what,
I'll take another one.

76
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,884
We don't make enough
to turn down free food.

77
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,929
I should've gone into finance.

78
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,564
And quit medicine?

79
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,066
Speaking of which, Bradley's
coming in for a heart valve.

80
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,868
Headlines: used to be
one of us, took a nosedive

81
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,737
through a skylight,
left the halls of healing.

82
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,105
Be nice. He's still one of us.

83
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,207
Oh, no, he's not.
Now he's a Muggle.

84
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,742
Hundreds of thousands
in med school debt,

85
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,943
- down the drain.
- Yeah, and he'll be

86
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,194
paying it off for decades.

87
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,438
Pravesh, they need you in VIP.

88
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,302
They don't page you
when they need me.

89
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,475
Looks like they do.

90
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,990
Hey, uh, do you
remember the Barnetts?

91
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,264
First-year intern,
pediatric rotation.

92
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,961
Two adopted kids with
medical needs, right?

93
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,878
Yes, and, apparently, you
made quite the impression.

94
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:14,486
The oldest boy hurt his wrist.

95
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,871
He's asking for the cool
doctor with the tattoos.

96
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:19,668
- Ha!
- Our peds resident
isn't here yet,

97
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,270
- so...
- I'm on it.

98
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,410
Don't do that.

99
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:23,828
In this new Mario game,

100
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,742
- I just like...
- Hey, Jasper!

101
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,061
- Henry.
- Hi.

102
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:30,229
Look at you, all grown
up. You driving yet?

103
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:32,115
Good to see you, Dr. Hawkins.

104
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,455
If that's still your name?

105
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,107
Yeah, I was an intern.

106
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,302
I was trying out some nicknames.

107
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:37,654
Yeah, it wasn't good.

108
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,160
Right, Hammer?

109
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,445
Hammer?

110
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,075
Anyway, here we are again.

111
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:44,293
Who knew our stairs
could be so dangerous?

112
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,695
Can you give me a little wiggle?

113
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,970
Elbow pit, dude.

114
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,256
Did he get his flu shot?

115
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,342
For sure. But
every kindergartner

116
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,278
has a cold right now. The
school is a phlegm factory.

117
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,858
We have been
seeing so many kids.

118
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,693
Is Henry's hand broken?

119
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,428
Can he still pitch
his game today?

120
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:04,381
Maybe not today,
but sometime soon.

121
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:07,689
Are you a righty or a southpaw?

122
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:23,054
Absence seizures.

123
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,656
He's had them since infancy?

124
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,169
Yeah, but they've
always been mild.

125
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,708
And we have them under control.

126
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,394
Is that why you fell, Henry?

127
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,896
It wasn't a seizure.
I just tripped.

128
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,543
I was reading to Jasper
when we heard the crash.

129
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,211
Okay, he probably

130
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,680
just needs a med adjustment.
It happens as kids grow.

131
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,219
We'll call for a neuro workup.

132
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,132
Keep icing his wrist.
Get an X-ray, too.

133
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:42,841
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool?
- Cool.

134
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,043
All right. Come here.

135
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,812
All right. All right.

136
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,891
Wash your hands.

137
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,983
He never takes that off. Ever.

138
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,095
'Cause it's awesome.

139
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,763
He loves this hat.

140
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,482
It inspired his police
birthday party this Saturday.

141
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:59,023
Right, dude?

142
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,245
I'm gonna try to move his
pediatrician visit up to today.

143
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,564
No, no reason for
an extra doctor's visit.

144
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,711
We'll check him out here.

145
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,500
We'll be back.

146
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,947
Hey. It's okay.

147
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,371
<i>You're worried
about the little brother.</i>

148
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,535
Yeah, Jasper had it rough
when he was fighting leukemia.

149
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,924
Chemo, radiation.

150
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,360
He had pneumonia twice.

151
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:20,589
Poor kid has been in
the hospital all the time.

152
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,074
How long has he
been in remission?

153
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:24,366
His last bone marrow
transplant went well.

154
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,051
Been clear for two years.

155
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,763
Now he's got a low-grade
fever and a cough.

156
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,705
Saw a yellow bruise on him,
and his nodes are swollen.

157
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:34,743
- Who's his pediatric oncologist?
- Dr. Richards. Retired in June.

158
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:36,577
Buzzkirk took her patients.

159
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,065
I know. I don't like him either.

160
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,538
Hi, I'm Dr. Pravesh.

161
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:54,378
Conrad can't even
answer his own pages now?

162
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,698
Bradley, you're my VIP patient?

163
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,544
VIP. That's me!

164
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:00,396
- How you doing?
- Never better, man.

165
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,215
You know, besides needing
a whole new heart valve.

166
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:04,000
But who cares,
right? I'm back here.

167
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,951
I get to see all my pals from
before leaving the rat race.

168
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:07,887
The rat race. Is that
what we're calling it now?

169
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:09,906
Well, in medical
marketing, we do, for sure.

170
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,296
Yeah, I got really
lucky with a major firm.

171
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,577
Signing bonus took care
of all my med school debt.

172
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,385
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

173
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,955
Boom. Debt-free and
pulling in mid-six figs.

174
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,658
Seriously, man. But
it's not just that, dude.

175
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,688
- I've never been happier,
honestly.
- That's great.

176
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,657
- You found something you love.
- I did.

177
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,265
So, how are wedding plans going?

178
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,166
Good. Never better.

179
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,335
Uh-oh. I know that look.

180
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,332
That's the look you used to get
when Conrad would pimp you.

181
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,351
You look really stressed, man.

182
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,358
Just normal wedding stress.

183
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:41,987
Dumb stuff that Priya
and I have to decide.

184
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,672
And we're not always
on the same page.

185
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,758
Uh-huh. Is everything
okay with you two?

186
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,585
It's crazy. You know,
this wedding just feels like

187
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:52,348
this endless
pile of to-do lists.

188
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,050
- Mm-hmm.
- Plus, I'm always here.

189
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,319
Mm. And here is not
exactly a walk in the park.

190
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,053
- Right.
- Look, I remember how it is.

191
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,805
Definitely no signing bonuses.

192
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,941
Right? Just sleep deprivation.

193
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:04,085
Hey, man. What
else is goin' on, man?

194
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,485
You were supposed
to be here an hour ago.

195
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:15,610
Rounds start at 6:00 a.m.

196
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:17,696
I had patients before you.

197
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,043
How many of them have a
tumor the size of a persimmon

198
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,617
- on their spine?
- I looked at your scans.

199
00:08:22,653 --> 00:08:25,953
Your tumor has shrunk
to the size of an apricot.

200
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:27,639
Never cared for apricots.

201
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,418
It's good news. It
means we can schedule

202
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,026
the surgery to remove the
tumor for tomorrow morning.

203
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,294
Any questions?

204
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,662
You gonna shave my head?

205
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,998
It's spine surgery.
Why would we do that?

206
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,528
Roger down the block
had his appendix out.

207
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,335
Came home with a Mohawk.

208
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,337
I'm confident that had
nothing to do with his operation.

209
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:44,822
What do you know about Roger?

210
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,191
Or hair? You barely have hair.

211
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:50,511
Where's Dr. Voss?

212
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:52,413
More suction,

213
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,410
- right here.
- There's so much blood.

214
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,818
I said suction.

254
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,688
Who put this valve here?

255
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,508
Cancel the surgery.

256
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,192
I'm booking your
spa day in Cabo.

257
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,484
Question: did you want
the couples massage or...?

258
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,918
You're not going alone, are you?

259
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:40,538
Ooh, couples massage.

260
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,872
Sounds delightful.

261
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,357
But perhaps it can wait.

262
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,525
A word, Dr. Bell?

263
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,578
Of course. Tilly, hold my calls.

264
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,166
I'm speaking at a
conference in Cabo.

265
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:55,103
I'd love a top woman
orthopod to introduce me.

266
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,572
Let's talk about a
screw, shall we?

267
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,624
A screw?

268
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,494
Does this look like
a 6.5 millimeter,

269
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,656
nine-grooved cancellous
bone screw to you?

270
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,364
Well, it shouldn't,

271
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,816
because it's 6.3 millimeters
with eight grooves.

272
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,362
Care to explain

273
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:13,037
why it showed up in the
middle of my clavicle surgery?

274
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,656
They accomplish the same thing.

275
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:16,957
The AorMed valve
is a thing of glory.

276
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:18,242
Sleek leaflets.

277
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,027
Perfectly aligned suture ring.

278
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:22,008
- She drives like a dream.
- Let me guess.

279
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:23,564
Changes in your OR?

280
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,750
An intruder. An
alien heart valve.

281
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,654
- It's a top-of-the-line...
- That's not the point.

282
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,473
You don't get to make
surprise, unilateral decisions

283
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:33,808
that affect our patients.

284
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,926
No ceremony. No discussion.

285
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,857
- No notice, even.
- You two can't agree
on anything.

286
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,921
Suddenly you're
on the same team?

287
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,610
A bomb just exploded in my body.

288
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,226
Jasper Barnett's labs.

289
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,048
White blood count over 150,000.

290
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,128
Low platelets,
blasts everywhere.

291
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,730
- Liver's starting to go, too.
- Henry came in

292
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,064
with a broken wrist,
but we thought Jasper

293
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,783
- was in remission.
- And now he's not.

294
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,106
He already has a rare phenotype.

295
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,707
It's known to be resistant.

296
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,377
And when a kid
comes back like this...

297
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,778
I'll give him a month.

298
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,658
Maybe two, tops. Only
reasonable thing now

299
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,494
is palliative treatment.
Anything else

300
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,078
at this point would do
more harm than good.

301
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:36,421
Let's hope Mom sees it that
way. They hardly ever do.

302
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,267
What if it had been
caught earlier?

303
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,657
Wouldn't have mattered.

304
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,286
His initial treatment was
aggressive and thorough,

305
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,922
and it was his best
chance at a cure.

306
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:45,124
They kept the cancer at
bay as long as possible.

307
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:47,414
Now it's back with a vengeance.

308
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,250
Guess I'll go spill the beans.

309
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,231
- Best to get it over with.
- Let me handle it.

310
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:54,505
They know me.

311
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,119
- I had them
on my intern rotation.
- Hey,

312
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,703
if you want to take the worst
part of the job, it's all yours.

313
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,564
How does someone like
that guy end up in pediatrics?

314
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,001
The same way HODAD
ended up in the OR.

315
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,724
You okay?

316
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:18,011
How do you tell a
mother her child is dying?

317
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,005
Found it.

318
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,490
Let's see.

319
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:32,104
So, look, this is way
before I broke my pelvis.

320
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:34,378
I told you I started early.

321
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,609
You're incredible.
Do you miss dancing?

322
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:39,032
No. I got my hip
replacement, got my life back,

323
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,312
and now when I sell devices,

324
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:41,980
I help other people
do the same thing.

325
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:43,504
I love it.

326
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:45,890
So, I showed you mine.
You show me yours.

327
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,458
What?

328
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,739
- The health monitor app
you're working on.
- Oh. Uh...

329
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,740
we're still making some
tweaks in the program.

330
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,959
If we could monitor
elderly patients from afar

331
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,300
with more accuracy...

332
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,296
You could see their
overall medical report

333
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,515
instead of relying on
day-of examination results.

334
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,871
Exactly.

335
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,385
And it's working, but
now we have to install

336
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,803
the device and pair it
with something wearable.

337
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:06,255
Wearables are huge
in the aging market.

338
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,912
So show me it.

339
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,132
All right.

340
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,685
Diagnosis:

341
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,137
a previously unbeknownst
cyst beneath the ulna.

342
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:19,251
It ruptured with such
power, such force

343
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,719
that it fractured
the strong bone.

344
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:23,761
You found that on the
Internet. A bomb in your body.

345
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,414
Oh, there was an
explosion. I created it.

346
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,682
It was undeniably godlike.

347
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,334
Right.

348
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,415
Let's get you in
a splint, shall we?

349
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:33,988
I'll order X-rays

350
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:36,557
to confirm you can be
treated nonoperatively.

351
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:40,177
So, my diagnosis
was correct, huh?

352
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,762
Your Web surfing was correct.

353
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,530
Let's talk

354
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,294
about our mutual
problem, shall we?

355
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,680
The craven king
in the high tower.

356
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:48,948
There are half a
dozen other devices

357
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,549
Bell is swapping
out for QuoVadis,

358
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:53,290
including one I need for a
spinal resection tomorrow.

359
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,344
That's where that man
makes my ego look nonexistent.

360
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:59,247
Not possible. But it's useless
to try and overrule him.

361
00:14:59,282 --> 00:15:00,748
At least for doctors.

362
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,283
Say more.

363
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,851
Well, if patients were unhappy

364
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:05,898
with administration
making medical decisions,

365
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:08,355
- Bell might listen.
- He'd have to.

366
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:11,092
The power of
persuasion. I like it.

367
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,394
- Yes, but can you use it?
- Me?

368
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,197
Oh, I'm damn near a master.

369
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:24,049
I'm gonna get you so much!

370
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,891
Did you get Jasper's
results back?

371
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:46,627
We'll go over everything
in the conference room.

372
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:49,396
You want to wait for
your husband to get here?

373
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:52,283
Uh, not happening.

374
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,002
It got tough. He bailed.

375
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,937
His loss. Let's do this.

376
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,105
I knew it.

377
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:19,693
Inside, I knew it.

378
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,141
If I had gotten Jasper
in here earlier...

379
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,715
We'd still be right here.

380
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,334
This isn't your fault at all.

381
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:28,686
You need to hear that.

382
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,188
There has to be something.

383
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,558
I will find him another
bone marrow donor.

384
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,704
Even if we found one right
away, he's not healthy enough

385
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,123
to go through the prep regimen.

386
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,841
Then when can he
start chemo again?

387
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,544
- We just have to get
even more aggressive.
- Zoey...

388
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:44,852
Jasper can't be cured.

389
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:54,478
And if we tried anyway,

390
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,665
the treatments are painful.

391
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,250
I will connect you
with an oncologist

392
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:04,055
so you can discuss it, but...

393
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,674
he would suffer.

394
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,531
I read about alternative
treatments in Mexico.

395
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,278
- We can go.
- Zoey...

396
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,152
No.

397
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:20,420
I will do whatever
you want to do.

398
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,406
This is your decision.

399
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,926
But my job is to
tell you the truth,

400
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,363
which is Jasper can't beat this.

401
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,034
You can't stop that.
You can't change that.

402
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:35,786
None of us can.

403
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,889
But what you can do...

404
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,909
is you can focus on the
quality of life he has left.

405
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,312
You can be with him every step.

406
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,784
And you can be there for Henry.

407
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,137
He's gonna need you.

408
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,713
I knew you couldn't resist

409
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,476
putting your hands
on my heart again.

410
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,367
That is a stretch.

411
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:09,803
Actually, Dr. Okafor misses
standing shoulder to shoulder

412
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,906
with a surgical
giant on the reg.

413
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,891
Little housekeeping
matter. Sign this.

414
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,579
It's a form saying that you
insist on the AorMed valve.

415
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:21,465
The website said QuoVadis is
the new protocol here at Chastain.

416
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,318
Which is why I need you
to insist on using the valve

417
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,254
that your brilliant
surgeon believes is best.

418
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,906
You want me to use those devices

419
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,019
to kick administration
in the cojones?

420
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,839
- Mm, maybe not quite that.
- But aren't they new
for a reason?

421
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,647
- Because they're better?
- Well, it should work that way.

422
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,583
But the FDA approves new devices

423
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,362
that have literally
never been tested

424
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,581
inside a human. Not
only do we not know

425
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:45,022
if they're better, we
don't know if they're safe.

426
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:47,285
Okay, and what exactly do
you like about the AorMed?

427
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:49,004
Do you really want
to have a conversation

428
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,706
on the finer points
of a heart valve?

429
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,524
Bradley used to be
a surgical resident.

430
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,798
At this hospital.

431
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,701
Great. I guess that's
better than a trip...

432
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,463
Triple-board-certified
master of the scalpel?

433
00:18:58,487 --> 00:18:59,631
Okay, well, I still work

434
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,600
in the medical field,
so I definitely have

435
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:04,052
- an understanding of what... Nobody
cares about your understanding!

436
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,811
I am the surgeon.
You are the patient.

437
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,807
I am the one who
knows what's best,

438
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:11,432
and you are the one who
takes a medically induced nap

439
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,863
in an OR with your life
in the hands of people

440
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:17,621
who are far more experienced,
more educated and more awake.

441
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,052
- I don't believe it.
- Unfortunately, it's true.

442
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,060
Medical devices are far
less regulated than pharma.

443
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,229
Thousands are
recalled every year

444
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,376
for harming the patients
they were supposed to help.

445
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,077
Which is why I
prefer older devices

446
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,079
that have a proven
safety record.

447
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,364
The hospital wouldn't
put something inside me

448
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,954
that would hurt me.

449
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:38,042
Doctors want the devices
that work best for patients.

450
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,177
Our administration chooses

451
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,578
the device manufacturer

452
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,893
that gives them the
greatest profit margin.

453
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:47,201
Now, I caution you not
to let them decide for you.

454
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,553
But ultimately it's your choice,

455
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,173
and I will support
whatever you decide.

456
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,441
Sign the damn thing.

457
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,385
What was that?

458
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:09,573
That was his charm offensive.

459
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:13,243
I think maybe you're trying
to tell your boss to buzz off.

460
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,698
But I support it.
You make the call.

461
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:20,517
Oh, I am so loving my
career change in this moment.

462
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,747
Poor you. I can't believe
you have to work with that guy.

463
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:24,238
Listen to me.

464
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:26,673
Good surgeons are
often arrogant jerks.

465
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:29,710
But Dr. Austin has the most
skilled hands I have ever seen.

466
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:31,540
You want happy chitchat
and fake empathy,

467
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,308
or you want your heart
fixed without complications?

468
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,243
I want the best surgeon
using the latest innovation.

469
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,745
Well, you can't have
both at Chastain.

470
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,469
Our surgeons want proof

471
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,888
that whatever the latest
innovation is, it works.

472
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:45,037
Got your page.
How can I help you?

473
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:46,760
Austin's X-rays.

474
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,708
It's a non-displaced fracture
through a benign cyst.

475
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:52,382
- He's cleared for surgery.
- Oh, good. He's one of our best.

476
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,151
Although he's no Kit Voss.

477
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,237
Thank you, Dr. Bell.

478
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,038
Randolph.

479
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:02,826
One of my patients is requesting
I implant a VertGuard device

480
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,296
instead of the QuoVadis one
for her spinal tumor resection.

481
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,882
I'm gonna need my
device back in this hospital

482
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,301
by tomorrow morning.

483
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,564
I made that decision
as a CEO and a surgeon.

484
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:15,172
QuoVadis is a trusted
brand with proven outcomes.

485
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,602
If you want me to talk
to your patient myself...

486
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:17,875
Over my dead body.

487
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,256
You've got some
tension in your neck.

488
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,025
I can see it from
here, Randolph.

489
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,066
I am not trying to
cause you stress. Truly.

490
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,827
Wow.

491
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,579
Well, that-that was...

492
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:40,364
that was effective.

493
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,466
How about a peace offering?

494
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,634
Your office in an hour?

495
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:47,688
That should be interesting.

496
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,907
Clear your schedule.

497
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,454
Hey, buddy.

498
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,840
Can I hang for a minute?

499
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,694
If you're looking for
Mom, she's in with Jasper.

500
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,230
Nope, just checking on you.

501
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,517
Do you know what I want
to be when I grow up?

502
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,118
A baseball player?

503
00:22:18,154 --> 00:22:20,220
Not anymore.

504
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,240
Now I want to be a scientist
or doctor or something.

505
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:26,276
Find a cure for cancer
that could save Jasper.

506
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,168
You are a great brother.

507
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,271
Do you know that?

508
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,095
Is that for Jasper?

509
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,647
His birthday's this weekend.

510
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:49,366
He loves police stuff so much.

511
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,035
We were gonna have a party
where he dressed up like a cop.

512
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,321
That's all he's
been talking about.

513
00:22:54,356 --> 00:22:57,590
It sucks, 'cause now
we have to be here.

514
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,049
I think we might be able
to do something about that.

515
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,750
Really?

516
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,786
I think I can pull that off...

517
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,121
with a little help.

518
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,423
Think you can help me?

519
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,559
Mmm, yeah.

520
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,844
Perfect.

521
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:20,847
Okay, unfortunately, Make-A-Wish
couldn't do anything official

522
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:22,466
for a couple of weeks.

523
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:26,286
<i>But</i> they did give me...
You ready for this?

524
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,639
These guys.

525
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:29,918
- Oh...
- Right?

526
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,086
Not the hat.

527
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,359
Jasper has his own.

528
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:34,289
Good call. Okay, you
ready for this, though?

529
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,129
Ta-da!

530
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,609
- Oh-ho!
- A police car!

531
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,616
Awesome, right?

532
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,263
No, seriously, junior year,

533
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:43,331
- Decatur Community Playhouse.
- You played Macbeth?

534
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,038
I understudied.

535
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:47,574
We found everything on the list.

536
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,877
Band-Aids, ketchup, hair spray.

537
00:23:49,912 --> 00:23:51,779
Oh, and these.

538
00:23:51,814 --> 00:23:53,030
So...

539
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,167
You just<i> found</i> real handcuffs?

540
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:59,753
Yeah.

541
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,354
Hmm.

542
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,328
You know your part, right?

543
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,514
You bet I know my part.

544
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,132
It's almost showtime.

545
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,809
Uh, Dr. Voss says I
should send you straight in.

546
00:24:22,844 --> 00:24:25,162
Uh... excellent.

547
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,898
Uh, no disturbances
for the next hour.

548
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,500
Let's make that two.

549
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:40,477
Who are you?

550
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,496
I'm Ken.

551
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,032
What kind of pressure
do you prefer, Doctor?

552
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,067
Uh...

553
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:58,289
- Oh!
- Oh! I got 18.

554
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:00,497
- You won.
- I won by one point.

555
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,599
You did.

556
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:09,590
I work undercover on the force.

557
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:15,929
The police station called.
There's a criminal on the loose.

558
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,583
Oh, no. A criminal?

559
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,719
His name is The Germ.

560
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,455
Things could get tough.

561
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:28,876
I need a partner.

562
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:30,527
Here.

563
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,430
I was gonna give this
to you for your birthday.

564
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,650
I can help you.

565
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:39,069
Yeah? Okay.

566
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,339
I got your squad car.

567
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,353
All right, let's solve a crime!

568
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,428
- All right, where to?
- I don't know,

569
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,214
but security caught
The Germ on camera

570
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,927
- sneakin' around.
- Uh-oh.

571
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,618
How do we find him?

572
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,237
The Germ has made a move!

573
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,519
Detective Okafor!

574
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:02,242
Talk to us.

575
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:04,861
He's stolen all of the bandages,

576
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,414
- except... one.
- Oh...

577
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:10,884
There's a red fingerprint on it.

578
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,453
You think it's blood?

579
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,771
That's ketchup.

580
00:26:18,394 --> 00:26:20,394
Hmm.

581
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:22,112
Good catch, eagle eye.

582
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:26,149
Where would The Germ
have gotten into ketchup?

583
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,968
Oh, the cafeteria!

584
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,497
All right.

585
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,870
Looks like we're going there.

586
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:32,622
Ready?

587
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,719
Let's do this!

588
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:36,120
Come on, let's go.

589
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:37,494
Let's go.

590
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,068
You see any clues?

591
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:52,125
Mm-mmm.

592
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,544
I see a handprint.

593
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,999
Hey, mister, we're
looking for The Germ.

594
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,318
It's Bob, okay?

595
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,030
I haven't seen him,
but if you want food,

596
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,933
you're out of luck,
okay, because someone,

597
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,968
they stole all
the sterile gloves.

598
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,325
I see one!

599
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:09,693
Jasper, look.

600
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,077
Another one, and another one.

601
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:12,929
We have to follow them!

602
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,816
- Move it, guys! Go!
- Let's go!

603
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,621
I think we're getting close.

604
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:23,340
Keep your eyes peeled, guys.

605
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:32,483
- The Germ!
- He's really here!

606
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:35,802
Stop bothering
me! I'm a super bug.

607
00:27:35,838 --> 00:27:38,455
- How do we stop him?
- We got to use what's here.

608
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,890
You can't fight me.

609
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,157
Like, maybe this?

610
00:27:46,148 --> 00:27:49,900
If you push these buttons
right here, you will stop him

611
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,685
with an electric shock.

612
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,270
You got this.

613
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,361
Stop it right now, Germ!

614
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:03,475
Okay, Germ,

615
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:05,694
Are you gonna give back
those bandages and gloves?

616
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:06,900
Never!

617
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,869
I'm MRSA the super bug.

618
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,174
Okay...

619
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,992
stop him.

620
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,929
You, you little
shrimp, I'll crush you.

621
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,665
Bring it. What are those?

622
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,652
What are those things?
Get away from me with those.

623
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,572
I'm trapped!

624
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,886
- Don't come any closer!
- Yeah, you are!

625
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:40,917
Ow! Ow! Ow. Ow.

626
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,205
You're arrested!

627
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,737
- Get up, kiddo.
- Don't make me go back!

628
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,795
It's so dark in there.

629
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,190
We got him now.

630
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:54,964
Get him out of here!

631
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,083
♪ ♪

632
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,630
♪ ♪

633
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,589
Is this damn hospital
gonna kill me?

634
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,374
Penny, tell me what's happening.

635
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:23,877
I don't know! I woke
up, the bed was wet.

636
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:25,229
I couldn't get up.

637
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,880
Incontinence, lack of sensation.

638
00:29:26,915 --> 00:29:29,449
- Can you feel this?
- No.

639
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:31,785
- How about here?
- Nothing below my waist.

640
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,232
Am I paralyzed?

641
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:36,234
My guess is cauda
equina syndrome.

642
00:29:36,258 --> 00:29:39,409
The tumor must be compressing
the nerves of your spinal cord.

643
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,406
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- Penny, Penny,

644
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,898
your surgery just
moved up to now, okay?

645
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:46,361
Book an OR.

646
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,163
If we don't get her
in there right away,

647
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:50,603
she's never gonna walk again.

648
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:53,585
All right, fast and focused.

649
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:55,686
Pull the mayo closer.
Ten-blade, full retractor set.

650
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,528
- Where's Okafor?
- On the way, Dr. Voss.

651
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,598
Damn it.

652
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,650
That's the QuoVadis device.

653
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:05,696
It's the only one they
had left in supplies.

654
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,166
- Do you want me to call out
for something else?
- There's no time for that.

655
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,134
Looks like I have to put
a device into her spine

656
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,993
that I already
convinced her not to use.

657
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,231
Dr. Austin. I don't
know if you remember,

658
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,822
but we've met before.

659
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:28,036
You're a horseman of
the apocalypse. I know.

660
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,171
I wanted to speak with you
about one of your patients.

661
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,839
- I don't do device reps. Sorry.
- Well, this device rep is

662
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,731
trying to tell you that Bradley
Jenkins wants a new surgeon.

663
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,067
Who does he want?

664
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,485
Archibald Simon.

665
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:40,331
I'm better than
Archie. Significantly so.

666
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:42,751
That's what everyone says,
but Bradley has his heart set

667
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:44,636
on QuoVadis, and
you won't use it.

668
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,377
I've installed over 600 valves
from 12 different companies.

669
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:49,307
I've tried what's out
there, and every single time

670
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:51,981
- I go back to the AorMed.
- Do what you want.

671
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,328
I know QuoVadis
devices are gold.

672
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,432
I'm just trying
to do you a solid.

673
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,921
Right. Sure you are.

674
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,657
Look, this doesn't affect
me one way or the other.

675
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,822
Either Dr. Simon puts in
the QuoVadis device here,

676
00:31:03,846 --> 00:31:05,329
or Bradley says he'll transfer

677
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,264
to Abe Benedict
at Atlanta General.

678
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,500
- Dr. Benedict?
- Mm-hmm.

679
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,055
I was his star resident. He
raised me on the AorMed.

680
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:15,071
Well, now he uses QuoVadis,

681
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,347
and he's willing to
poach your patients.

682
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,708
- Austin.
- Good evening, sir.

683
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:36,960
What's that?

684
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,711
A mere flesh wound.

685
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:41,231
I'll survive.

686
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,911
Well, good to see
you, as always.

687
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:45,101
- How'd you find me?
- Well, it's 7:30,

688
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,115
constitutional jog
at the alma mater,

689
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,288
rain or shine.

690
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,974
I know. I'm a creature of habit.

691
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,626
Which is why I was surprised
to hear that you've moved away

692
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,940
from the heart device
you've used for years.

693
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:57,363
Why the QuoVadis valve?

694
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:01,801
Uh, well, the truth is,
valves are very similar.

695
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,270
Then why the switch?

696
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:05,333
- The penicillin coating.
- Really?

697
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,636
I thought that was
much ado about nothing.

698
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,638
- You've found
it really makes a difference?
- Reduced the rate

699
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:12,261
of postoperative

fun. Who knew Jasper was

709
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,622
such a good little detective?

710
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,677

Good night, Officer Jasper.

715
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,709
I'm not gonna grow
up to be a police officer.

It was maybe one of
those things he gets.
