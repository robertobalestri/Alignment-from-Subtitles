What about an outpatient
clinic for the uninsured?

9
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,226
We will have to hire a
top primary care physician.

10
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,384
We need a diagnosis.

11
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,419

Compress the vein

00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,183

too much blood.

22
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:01,476

He's about to code.

We haven't had enough

But in what condition?

72
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:24,870
He could have neuro deficits

73
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:28,373
20 units of blood, FFP,
and platelets transfused?

74
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:32,560
That alone carries a
25% chance of mortality.

76

Lane Hunter. She's out on bail.

83
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,534
- What?
- That's impossible.

84
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:02,540
Bail was five million.

85
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,454
That's probably nothing to her.

86
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,305
I heard she billed Medicare
over $20 million a year

87
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,529
for unnecessary chemo.

88
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:09,531
But her accounts were frozen.

89
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,450
She found the money somewhere.

90
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,546
That won't change the
outcome. She's a murderer.

91
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,736
The jury will convict her.

92
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:21,309
We have interviews at the clinic

00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,200

96
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,637
I can't believe this.

97
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,807
We have to let the

00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,918
I'm thinking two zolpidem

99
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,438
He left a fine woman

100
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:51,189

101
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,941
I have no sympathy.

102
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,327

103
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,412

106

I at least feel pity for you.

107
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,633
He was sniffing around
Julian. The device rep?

108
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:10,825
An engaged man out
there, on the prowl.

109
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:15,797
I thought better of you.

110
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,536
You're a little too hard on him.

The heart wants
what the heart wants.

112
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:26,374
Sometimes the
head has no control.

113
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,826
We all have a moral compass,

114
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,872
and we have a choice
to follow it or not.

115
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,124
He had feelings for Julian?
He should have avoided her.

116
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:33,543
Instead, he kept
spending time with her.

117
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,316
What did he think would happen?

118
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,653
Anyway, when I'm done
with the clinic, I'll find you.

119
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,304
What do we have on deck?

120
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,974
Uh, just a VATS case.

121
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,361
You'll be bored.
Go join Dr. Voss.

00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,589
Are you going to be
volunteering on a regular basis?

125
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,258
Bai was our first med
student to sign up.

126
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,988
Who do we have first?

127
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,379
Um, Dr. Christina Ruiz.

128
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:07,398
Graduated from Johns
Hopkins in family medicine.

129
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,250
Huh, sounds promising.

130
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,835
Let's get started.

131
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,114
<i>Your clinic would
be the perfect fit</i>

132
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,371
for me.

133
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,900
I spent last year in Haiti
with Partners in Health.

134
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:16,919
I grew up in Atlanta
and want to give back.

135
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,660
Serve the underserved.

136
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:20,540
Access. Too many
hospitals treat and street.

137
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:22,531
There's no continuity.

138
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,583
Do you have any
questions for us?

139
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,368
Yes. The salary posted,
was that monthly?

140
00:06:27,403 --> 00:06:28,903
I'm kind of between jobs.

141
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:30,366
What if you pay my
malpractice insurance?

142
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,706
I've got a fair number

143
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,592
of totally frivolous lawsuits.

144
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,127
I'm sorry, but with the amount

145
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,012
of med school debt I'm carrying,

146
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:38,975
you don't need a
physician, you need a saint.

147
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,849
Is that really everyone?

148
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:42,901
Okay, uh, I wasn't
gonna mention it,

149
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,919
because it's a super long shot,

150
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:49,057
but if "saint" is the
criteria, I do know of a guy.

151
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,646
Oh, there he is.

152
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,764
Dr. Alec Shaw.

153
00:06:56,799 --> 00:07:00,569
First he was an
infectious disease doc,

154
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:03,971
then he volunteered on a
Navajo reservation doing outreach.

155
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,541
After that he got
into family medicine.

156
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,943
I first saw him in my
hometown, New Orleans.

157
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,556
Why didn't you
mention him before?

158
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,497
He just landed in Atlanta.

159
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,049
He's always on the move.

160
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:16,251
And he hates hospitals.

161
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:18,403
Hates institutionalized
medicine.

162
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,088
Oh. I like him already.

163
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:23,341
So he has no fixed
practice? No office?

164
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,728
He has kind of an office.

165
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:29,431
Well, let's go talk to him.

166
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:32,434
Um, you'll have
to wait your turn.

167
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:35,436
He never lets
anyone jump the line.

168
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:37,366
Hmm. My shift
starts in 20 minutes.

169
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,440
Oh, you guys go. I-I got this.

170
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,670
- You sure?
- Yeah.

171
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,910
All right, good luck.

172
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:52,454
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You bet.

173
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:54,767
Belly bomb?

00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,799
Who-who's Julian?

178
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,801

00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,875
H-How about jelly? No?

181
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,960
That guy is Julian's
replacement.

182
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,729
Where is she?

183
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,163
I don't know.

184
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,793
She said she was gonna
quit and leave town,

185
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:22,317
and now she's ghosting me.

186
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:23,951
That's harsh.

187
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:26,070
Look, about yesterday,

188
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,657
I'm sorry, man.

189
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:31,158
How's your dad?

190
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:33,295
Not clear yet.

191
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,413
You should go home.

192
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,715
I don't have one at the moment.

193
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,050
And I'd rather work.

194
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,002
I hear that.

195
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:45,390
There's an arm lac in ER Three.

196
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,842
I think you might
want to take this one.

197
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,375
- Okay.
- Look, what do you want me to do?

198
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,826
They're gonna stitch me
up and then we'll leave.

199
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,861
I... you know, I didn't
mean to fall, I fell.

200
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,347
We should have
just watched it on TV.

201
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,521
No way. You, of all
people, had to be there.

202
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm Dr. Hawkins.
What's going on?

203
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:04,058
We were at a
protest, it got crazy.

204
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,528
- At the prison?
- Yeah.

205
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,758
And neither one of us are
happy that we ended up here.

206
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,702
Lane Hunter killed
Roger's sister.

207
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:12,211
She came in with
stage I breast cancer.

208
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,920
Lane treated it
like it was stage IV.

209
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,755
All Judy probably
needed was a lumpectomy.

210
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,343
Instead, she died from a
reaction to Dr. Hunter's chemo.

211
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:23,627
I am so sorry.

212
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,214
I am not exactly a fan
of Dr. Hunter either.

213
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,534
Let's have a look at that arm.

214
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,398
- She had a pretty bad fall.
- Uh, it was a big crowd.

215
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:34,050
I tripped. Just stitch me
up and send me home.

216
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,057
Natalie used to be a cop.

217
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,738
- Nothing fazes her.
- Well, I'm seeing
some bruising here.

218
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:40,973
I'm gonna order an X-ray just
to make sure there's no fracture.

219
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,313
Hey, you're not hearing me.

220
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm fine. Stitch me and I'm out.

221
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:46,734
And she doesn't like doctors.

222
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:49,553
I get it. I know
what Dr. Hunter did.

223
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,591
Dr. Hunter gave Natalie chemo
and she didn't even have cancer.

224
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,127
She's the reason
I'm no longer a cop.

225
00:09:58,782 --> 00:09:59,992
Soon as I get an
answer, I'll let you know.

226
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,016
Doc-Doctor Bell.

227
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,458
Yeah?

228
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,010
My hero.

229
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,979
Dr. Bell, you have a call...

230
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,348
I bailed you out,

231
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,746
<i>I got you a great legal team.
Now it's time to hand over</i>

232
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,302
the deposition and the tape.

233
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:24,355
I'm checking into a
very nice hotel. Come by.

234
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,090
<i>Alone, of course.</i>

235
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,609
And let's discuss.

236
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:29,277
I'll send my lawyer.

237
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:31,128
Excuse me. Turn around here,

238
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,680
<i>go to Chastain Park.</i>

239
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm on my way to you.

240
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,736
What hotel?

241
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,271
Roger and I became
friends at Dr. Hunter's clinic.

242
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:47,323
Poor guy drove his sister to
every one of her appointments.

243
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,963
That's a good brother.

244
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:51,715
Yeah, that's what I tell him,
but he still blames himself.

245
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,486
What diagnosis were you given
for the weakness in your legs?

246
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,387
Neuropathy from the chemo.

247
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,701
It just won't get better.
Yeah, today it's even worse.

248
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,126
Protest must have
really wore me out.

249
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,122
Well, let's make
sure it's nothing more.

250
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:04,907
-We have one of the best -No.

251
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,192
Orthopedic spinal surgeons
in the country, Dr. Voss.

252
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:09,150
I want her to check you out.

253
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:12,170
Look, I was a legacy
officer in the Atlanta PD.

254
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:15,189
My mom before me,
Grandpa before that.

255
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:17,892
I wish I could have
it all back, but I can't.

256
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,889
Accepting that was the
hardest thing I've done,

257
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,713
but I did it.

258
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:29,337
This isn't the discharge desk.

259
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:33,224
I had a patient here.

260
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,762
She came in after having a
reaction to chemo from Lane.

261
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,098
Shock again, at 360!

262
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,349
The night she coded,

263
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:43,852
we all fought to save her.

264
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,534
I can't bring Lily back,

265
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,171
but if there is any possible way

266
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:06,257
to fix your legs,
I want to find it.

267
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,032
Give me and Dr. Voss one hour.

268
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,202
One hour.

269
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,891
- How long has that
been going off?
- It just started.

270
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,616
The RT's in a code down the
hall. Should I call for backup?

271
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,985
No, hold on, his
respiratory rate's too high.

272
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,581
Mr. Winthrop's peak
pressure is climbing.

273
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:38,172
He needs more sedation.

274
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,944
No, it's the vent settings.

275
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:45,090
It's trapping air in his lungs.
We need to get him off of it.

276
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,314
But he hasn't had a
spontaneous breathing trial.

277
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,013
I'm getting an attending.

278
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,220
The vent's too high.

279
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:53,737
It was stacking his breaths.

280
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,592
He's awake, we can extubate.

281
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:12,557
It's okay. I got you.

282
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,777
<i>So you blackmail
me with a sex tape,</i>

283
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,413
<i>tell me to come alone,</i>

284
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:19,948
and now<i> you</i> bring a lawyer?

285
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,632
Ugh, calm down.

286
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,767
Now, Martin handled
the wire transfer.

287
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,152
You are paid back, my friend.

288
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:26,932
The funds were transferred
from a shell company

289
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:29,134
in the Bahamas to an
account in your lawyer's name, -

290
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:31,426
so there's no evidence
of a financial relationship

291
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:33,044
between you and Dr. Hunter.

292
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,614
Great.

293
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,634
- Now the deposition
and the sex tape.
- Okay,

294
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:42,336
- Randolph, relax, please?
- Not feeling too relaxed.

295
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:43,815
Well, then, try.

296
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,823
I plan to.

297
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,226
Probably somewhere with
palm trees and dark rum

298
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,794
and pool boys with
very little clothing.

299
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,613
Oh.

300
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:55,215
But first we have
to get past this trial.

301
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,236
Cancer treatment is complicated.

302
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,705
The trial's outcome will
depend largely on how

303
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,824
Dr. Hunter's chemo
protocols are perceived.

304
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:07,128
The jury will rely on
testimony from medical experts.

305
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:10,131
Pillars of the community,
ready to stand up for her.

306
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:14,002
You want me to testify publicly

307
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:16,704
about what a great doctor
you are? Are you insane?

308
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:21,592
Uh... why don't you just tell
the jury the facts, Randolph?

309
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,895
Cancer treatment
requires experimentation.

310
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,848
Oncologists routinely
use drugs off-label.

311
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,851
When ones that the
FDA approves don't work,

312
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:32,853
we improvise.
Why? To save lives.

313
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,857
Find someone else.

314
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:39,193
All right, can we just
have a minute alone?

315
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:40,923
All right, I'll tell you
what... Release the tape.

316
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,514
I'll bounce back.
I'm not the only CEO

317
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,284
who's had consensual sex
with an unfortunate partner.

318
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,869
I'm done being blackmailed.

319
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:49,431
You're done when
I say you're done.

320
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,373
- You killed Lily Kendall.
- No, I didn't.

321
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:54,720
Which is exactly why they
have no evidence to prove I did.

322
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,961
You're the only
one with a motive,

323
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,407
you were at the
hospital that night,

324
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,882
I saw you there,
and I'll testify to it.

325
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,112
Hmm. You know, I heard once
about an appendectomy patient

326
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,120
that died in your OR.

327
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,739
You know, we all make
mistakes, but something tells me

328
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,443
you've had more than your share.

329
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,780
Whatever secrets
you have, Randolph,

330
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,699
I'll find them.

331
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,132
I'll hire a medical detective,

332
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,636
I'll depose your
entire OR staff.

333
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,723
Well, my staff will back me up

334
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,159
long before they'll support you.

335
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:35,794
Good news, brother.

336
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:38,919
You're not dead. Bad
news? You got maggots.

337
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:43,457
Hold tight, you're up next.

338
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:45,560
Oh, um, I'm not
actually a patient.

339
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:47,189
I'm a nurse practitioner
from Chastain Park.

340
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,564
I wanted to talk to you
about the community clinic

341
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,827
- we're opening...
- I already told
your med student no.

342
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,235
You want to switch it
out every couple hours.

343
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,948
Hamburger's gonna draw
'em out faster than any drug

344
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:56,938
you're gonna get
at her hospital.

345
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,956
Cheaper.

346
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,108
Safer, too.

347
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,195
Come on, Sammy, we're next.

348
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,948
The clinic will be free.
And with more supplies

349
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:09,667
and volunteers, you
can reach more patients.

350
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,347
And it's a lot bigger than
what you're working with here.

351
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:14,205
I grew up in a converted
school bus in Tennessee.

352
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,874
It was my dad's idea,
and not his best one.

353
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,210
Or his worst.

354
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,973
11 kids. Lots of
government cheese.

355
00:16:20,997 --> 00:16:24,682
So, to me, this
is the Taj Mahal.

356
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,612
Sammy, knock it off.

357
00:16:26,636 --> 00:16:28,213
- This is fun.
- You know, he's going through

358
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,232
- this licking phase.
- Is it metal?

359
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,867
It<i> is</i> metal.

360
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,524
I got something for him.

361
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:36,994
Strawberry, my favorite.

362
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,540
Good choice, little man.

363
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:42,133
All right, Gladys,
let's see that finger.

364
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,452
So, your boy's licking metal

365
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:48,072
- 'cause he's got
a mineral deficiency.
- Oh.

366
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,001
A good multivitamin
is all you need.

367
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:51,303
Oh, okay.

368
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,544
Let's see here.

369
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,467
Hey, look at you. Sugar's down.

370
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:01,564
You been hitting that South
Bend Park? Eating those greens?

371
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:04,150
Stopping diabetes before
I get it, just like you said.

372
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,025
Thanks for the lollipop, Doctor.

373
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,511
Look, I'd love to talk to
you for just a few minutes.

374
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:11,857
Look, I don't have
time for breaks.

375
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:13,325
I got a long line
out there, so...

376
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,900
I heard you got free flu shots.

377
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,485
Yes, we do.

378
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,281
You ever had a
reaction to one of these?

379
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:22,190
- No.
- Take a seat.

380
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:25,243
I'll help you get your line down

381
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:28,595
if you give me some pointers
on how to run our clinic.

382
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:34,118
All right, you're gonna
feel a light pinch.

383
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:37,020
You were diagnosed with
nerve damage from the chemo,

384
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,034
but actually the chemo
caused osteopenia.

385
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,459
You see this here?

386
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,796
You had a tiny
fracture on your T12.

387
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,892
That's what caused the
weakness in your legs.

388
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,610
When you fell
today, it got worse.

389
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,529
Now it's compressing
against the spinal cord.

390
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:53,120
It's become an emergency.

391
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,856
I knew it. I knew one test
and I'd end up in surgery.

392
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:57,453
No, Natalie,

393
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,459
these two are the real deal.

394
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,062
Listen to Dr. Voss.

395
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:02,374
It's nothing short of a miracle

396
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:03,564
that we caught this.

397
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,233
If we don't operate,

398
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:07,701
you'll be paralyzed from
the waist down within hours.

399
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:09,331
But if you get in there
right away, there's a chance

400
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,133
they can remove the
compression altogether.

401
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,585
You would have
your strength back.

402
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:14,619
And then everything
that Lane took from you,

403
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:15,860
that'd be in the rearview.

404
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:20,915
Back surgery is dangerous.

405
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,011
Are there risks? Yes.
But the alternative

406
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,469
is you'll spend your
life in a wheelchair.

407
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:29,289
I can give you a really
good shot at walking alone.

408
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:36,481
I'm so mad at you.

409
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,866
Is that a yes?

410
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,421
- I don't get it.
- Thank you.

411
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:51,778
I don't know why she's
not texting me back.

412
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:54,632
Salespeople move
on. So should you.

413
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,844
Julian still thinks I
got married last night.

414
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,251
I have to tell her, or then...

415
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:59,470
Julian is not
returning your texts.

416
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,871
Get a grip, bruh.

417
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,691
- How many did you send?
- Like...

418
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,460
Oh, so y-you're going for the
crazy stalker approach, huh?

419
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:09,463
Listen to me, it's
not a good look.

420
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:11,515
Stop.

421
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,823
As new technologies
emerge in medicine,

422
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:27,865
as in other fields, the
U.S. military strives

423
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,133
to be on the cutting
edge of the industry.

424
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,997
That's why we're
at QuoVadis today.

425
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:34,532
Gordon, I hear from DARPA,
the first thing they want to look at

426
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:38,959
is the impact of your
VNS device on memory.

427
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:41,678
You want to use it to cure PTSD?

428
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,982
We're interested
in the possibility.

429
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,919
This company's future
with the military is limitless.

430
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,353
Don't you agree?

431
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,096
- Hey, you ready for the OR?
- I'm a little stressed.

432
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,682
No.

433
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,401
No, make that scared.

434
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,637
- But let's do this.
- Is she okay?

435
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,056
I need an EKG now.

436
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,779
Your heart's racing.

437
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,625
Has this ever
happened to you before?

438
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,699
Palpitations
sometimes. Nothing big.

439
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:22,182
I've never had my
spine sliced into, so...

440
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:25,923
Natalie, breathe.

441
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,760
Breathe. Natalie.
Get the crash cart.

442
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,128
Pulse 160, BP's dropping.

443
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,215
She's in unstable V tach. Defib!

444
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,137
All right, 200. Let's go.

445
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,556
- Clear.
- Natalie.

446
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:44,976
300. Clear.

447
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,708
Give her 150 of amio
and transfer her to the ICU.

448
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,377
What's wrong with her?

449
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,494
With the amount of
chemo Lane gave her,

450
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,678
I'm worried the dosages
also damaged her heart.

451
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:57,938
All right.

452
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:01,658
You bought a good hour
of my time by helping out.

453
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,612
Why do you do it?
What drives you?

454
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:06,630
Uh, grew up in a church.

455
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,634
Service to the poor,
the needy, the stranger...

456
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,235
It's in my DNA. You know,
I'm a lapsed Catholic, at best,

457
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,490
but the drive to reach people
others ignore is still there.

458
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,093
You did a stint on a
Navajo reservation

459
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:21,573
- with PIH?
- Yeah, that's where I learned
problems start upstream.

460
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:23,442
You got to keep people
from getting sick to begin with.

461
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:26,350
Vaccines are gonna
do more than rosaries.

462
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,270
Now I hand out condoms
instead of prayers.

463
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:33,640
- I noticed you're low
on basic supplies.
- I get more

464
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,620
from the Georgia Prescription
Assistance Program next week.

465
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:38,279
What if I could score
what you need now?

466
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:47,204
This place could use some love.

467
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,373
Well, if you know
any contractors

468
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,326
jonesing to help some
people out, let me know.

469
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:54,628
So why are you doing all this?

470
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:56,680
Knock-knock.

471
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,265
Oh, sorry, sir,

472
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,283
we're not actually
open right now.

473
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,280
Oh, okay, uh, I-I just
saw the sign and...

474
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,021
What's going on here?

475
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,525
I was playing catch with my
kid and, uh, took one in the eye.

476
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,520
- Oh.
- Can't really see
anything out of it.

477
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,561
- What's your name, brother?
- Russell.

478
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,647
Let me just look
at this eye, Russell.

479
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:15,899
Yeah, orbital
compartment syndrome.

480
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,368
Yeah, if we don't relieve

481
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,131
some of that pressure,
he's gonna lose his eye.

482
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:21,138
Do I have to go to the ER?

483
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,373
I have lousy insurance.
Huge deductible.

484
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,676
And I just paid
my student loans.

485
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,245
Uh... you'll need an
ophthalmology consult

486
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:30,664
in the ER after this, but we
can do the procedure here.

487
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:31,760
Yeah, we have
everything we need here,

488
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,734
and it'll save you some money.

489
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,170
Okay.

490
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:38,839
♪ ♪

491
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:47,348
Here you go.

492
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:48,382
Thanks.

493
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,490
Okay, you ready?

494
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:57,491
Just breathe.

495
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:58,859
Okay.

496
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:04,498
All right, let's see.
What about that?

497
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:06,567
- You feel anything there?
- Mm-mm.

498
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,347
Good.

499
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:10,154
All right.

500
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:19,930
There you go.

501
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:20,914
There we go.

502
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:22,644
There you go. There you go.

503
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,268
My eye still there?

504
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,719
Still there.

505
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:27,772
Congrats.

506
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,524
Looks like your clinic
just treated its first patient.

507
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,621
Well, he still needs that
consult, so it looks like

508
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:34,456
you're going to
Chastain after all.

509
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,064
Natalie definitely has
chemo-induced cardiomyopathy.

510
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:38,782
And the compression fracture

511
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:41,035
has a large bone
fragment that's causing

512
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,831
- her spinal cord compression.
Decompression and fusion

513
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,487
is the only way to give her

514
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,940
- a chance of walking.
- We need to get in there now.

515
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:49,476
Implant the cage
here for spine fusion.

516
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,223
Her heart might not
be strong enough.

517
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:53,058
- She's in the ICU
on an amio drip.
- We can try

518
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:54,448
to manage it with ACE inhibitors

519
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:55,677
- and beta-blockers...
- We don't have time.

520
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,345
We've got three,
maybe four hours

521
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,637
before the compression
becomes irreversible.

522
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,255
<i>If</i> she survives surgery.

523
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,845
Lane took Natalie's
choices away.

524
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,515
We're giving her this one back.

525
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,516
I came in for some
damn stitches!

526
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,829
Natalie, they're trying to help.

527
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:16,186
This is crap! My options are

528
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,916
full paralysis or
possible death?

529
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,284
Or full recovery.
That's the hope.

530
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:20,636
We do the fusion

531
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,420
while monitoring
your cardiac function.

532
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:24,828
You're the heart guy, right?

533
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:25,829
So?

534
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,009
Well, under normal
circumstances,

535
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:28,415
I would advise against it,

536
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,351
but these are not
normal circumstances.

537
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:34,839
Dr. Hawkins...

538
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,874
what would you do?

539
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,526
You are the one who's gonna
have to live with this decision,

540
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,218
so you are the one
who needs to make it.

541
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:50,387
But if it<i> was</i> me...

542
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:53,974
I am not letting Lane
Hunter hold me down.

543
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,510
I'm taking the risk.

544
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,148
Crap.

545
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,168
I got to try.

546
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,826
- You gave me a scare.
- They said...

547
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:15,162
I almost died.

548
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:17,281
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

549
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,334
I shouldn't have left you.

550
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:23,721
Always taking the weight of
the world on your shoulders.

551
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,806
The blame.

552
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:28,425
Not this time.

553
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,493
Well, you asked for
one thing: no Bell.

554
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,647
I guess he's
better than nothing.

555
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,194
I want things to change for us.

556
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:50,580
I've waited a long time
to hear those words.

557
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,699
Well, hey, we're both stubborn.

558
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:55,569
Yeah, that's... that's true.

559
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,841
Hmm.

560
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:04,428
I have spent half my
life without a father.

561
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,932
We're gonna fix that.

562
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,800
I'm gonna hold you to that.

563
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:27,016
Thank you.

564
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,039
Excuse me, um, I'm
looking for Dr. Bell's office.

565
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:34,208
Tenth floor.

566
00:26:34,243 --> 00:26:36,460
Hey, uh, you're
Julian's boss, right?

567
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:37,578
Yeah. Gordon Page.

568
00:26:37,613 --> 00:26:40,130
Devon Pravesh. Have you spoken

569
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,327
- to Julian today?
- No. She didn't show up
for work.

570
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,001
Had to get a replacement.

571
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,098
A no-show isn't like
her, but I guess it's

572
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:48,555
because of what she's
been going through.

573
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,425
Yeah. She, um, mentioned
some issues with work.

574
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,643
Really? What'd she tell you?

575
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,230
Honestly, not much.

576
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:57,743
Yeah, Julian told
someone in the office

577
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:59,967
that she got too close
to a doctor at Chastain,

578
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,947
and it turned into
more than she wanted.

579
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:04,521
I just hope he didn't
scare her off. She's good.

580
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,506
Anyway, thanks
for the directions.

581
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:13,157
Great news. Ophthalmology says

582
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:15,126
that Russell's eye
is looking good.

583
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,045
They're gonna keep him
overnight for observation.

584
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,189
Is that necessary?
It's gonna rack up a bill

585
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,715
- he won't be able to pay.
- Hey.

586
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,283
- Can I help? I doubt
you can do anything

587
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,551
about a bloated
hospital billing system

588
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,793
that charges 300
bucks for an aspirin.

589
00:27:25,828 --> 00:27:27,294
Conrad, this is Dr. Shaw.

590
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:28,712
Alec, Dr. Hawkins.

591
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,809
- We're trying to get him
to run the clinic.
- Ah.

592
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,693
Can't get past the
toxic hospital culture,

593
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:33,851
the lack of transparency,

594
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:35,101
the endless documentation...

595
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,720
Don't forget about the upcoding,

596
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,667
fragmentation of care,
over-testing, overtreatment.

597
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,952
- Not helping.
- Look, we know

598
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:42,792
we're going up against Goliath.

599
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,145
And it's true, all
we got's a slingshot.

600
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,481
But we have damn good aim.

601
00:27:47,516 --> 00:27:50,200
Well, it seems like a
waste of both your talents.

602
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,118
I do my own thing. Sorry.

603
00:27:52,154 --> 00:27:53,370
Eh. No worries.

604
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,883
Just remember, wars are
fought on the battlefield,

605
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,206
not from the sidelines.

606
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,752
Look, let me buy
you a cup of coffee,

607
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,471
- introduce you to the team...
- No, I got to get back.

608
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:02,162
It's nice meeting you, Nic.

609
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,500
Damn. He was perfect.

610
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:11,104
I don't believe it.

611
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,497
Deflating the lung.

612
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,123
Dr. Voss, you
have spinal access.

613
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,505
I would have risked
the surgery, too.

614
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,112
Really? You would

615
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,831
risk it all just for a chance
of something better?

616
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,511
For the chance at
the life you want,

617
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:41,034
so would I.

618
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:44,132
Oh, hell.

619
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,290
The bone is weak from the chemo.

620
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,703
- I can't get fixation.
- What about a graft
from her hip?

621
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,294
We can't get it fast enough.

622
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,629
Dr. Okafor, what's our move?

623
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,550
Let me see her X-rays.

624
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:00,787
All right, show me her ribs.

625
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:07,027
They're less damaged. We
can make a graft from her ribs.

626
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:09,396
How long do you think it'll
take? Her echo was showing

627
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:10,959
severely depressed
ejection fraction.

628
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,349
We'll have to move fast, then.

629
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,258
Julian?

630
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:30,834
Hey, it's Devon.

631
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,502
Are you okay?

632
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,789
Look, I know I
shouldn't be here,

633
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:39,092
but, um, what you
said about QuoVadis...

634
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:41,728
we should talk about it.

635
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,947
We should talk about everything.

636
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:46,583
Just call me.

637
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,434
Please.

638
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:01,731
All right, he's gone.

639
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:03,917
Mr. Page?

640
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:05,919
Yeah, the place is clean.

641
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:08,705
Someone came by.

642
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,290
Yeah, same guy.

643
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,711
Security's on the way.

644
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:18,181
This office is a
shrine to your ego.

645
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:20,684
Lacking confidence without me?

646
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,330
Hardly. You have
about two minutes

647
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,888
to say whatever it is
you came here to say.

648
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:28,608
You know, words aren't
getting through to you, Randolph.

649
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:32,362
So I thought that this... might.

650
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:39,369
Really brings out the
desperation in your eyes,

651
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,321
don't you think?

652
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:43,540
Where did you get that?

653
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,576
That lawyer you found me,

654
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,393
he can dig up anything.

655
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,796
Now, tell me something.
What do you think is worse?

656
00:30:49,832 --> 00:30:51,860
Trying to buy sex
from an undercover cop

657
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:54,518
or failing to
self-report your arrest

658
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,587
to the State Medical Board?

659
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,907
So, where's the copier?

660
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,893
I think everyone

661
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:05,512
- will want their very own.
- You're a monster.

662
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:08,698
Look around, Randolph.

663
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:10,833
Either you agree
to tell the jury

664
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,853
how wrong you were about me,

665
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:15,522
or all of this disappears.

666
00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:17,324
You can call off your dogs.

667
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,860
Happy to show myself out.

668
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,764
♪ ♪

669
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,940
Nice of you to stop by.

670
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,295
Sorry.

671
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,129
Busy morning.

672
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,048
You're recovering well.

673
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,718
Hematocrit's stable.
Kidney function's good.

674
00:31:44,753 --> 00:31:46,397
I'm a little surprised
you didn't kill me

675
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:47,888
when you had the chance.

676
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:52,153
You know, my first
year as an attending,

677
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,944
they brought a guy into
my OR with six bullet holes.

678
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,708
He killed two cops,
and everybody said

679
00:31:56,732 --> 00:31:58,198
he deserved to die.

680
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:00,383
When I pick up a
scalpel, I don't care

681
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,868
who's on the other end.

682
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:03,703
That's the discipline.

683
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:06,405
I'm a surgeon first. That's
all that matters to me.

684
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:09,076
Oh, so you wanted to
kill me, but you were...

685
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:10,776
too principled.

686
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,311
That's charming.

687
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:26,977
<i>You</i> paged me?

688
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,646
You don't 911-page
me to come to you.

689
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,847
That's Natalie Ramirez.

690
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,733
Lane Hunter ruined her life.

691
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,185
Destroyed her
heart and her spine

692
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,464
with chemo that she didn't need.

693
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,955
And now she may die in that OR.

694
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:42,192
And she's one of the lucky ones.

695
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:44,177
You think I don't care? I do.

696
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,163
Then why was
Lane in your office?

697
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,869
Guess what. I am sick and tired

698
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,955
of you thinking you have
any right to question me.

699
00:32:55,991 --> 00:32:56,957
You're a resident.

700
00:32:56,992 --> 00:32:58,759
Who I would love to fire.

701
00:32:58,794 --> 00:33:00,788
Except your father,
whose life I just saved...

702
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,012
Thank you very much...

703
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,446
Would fire me.

704
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,043
So you got me down
here to see this woman.

705
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,017
I've seen her.

706
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,052
Good for you.

707
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,387
Made my day.

708
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,866
If Lane gets off,
how many others

709
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,023
like Natalie will there be?

710
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,834
This should do the trick.

711
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:30,840
Spinal nerves

712
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:31,875
still viable.

713
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:36,524
She's in V tach again.

714
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:37,664
Wet laps.

715
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:39,076
The anesthesia

716
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,762
is too much for her
heart. We need to stop.

717
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:41,929
Get the cage and screws ready.

718
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,898
- Clear.
- Just let me finish fusing.

719
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,066
- Clear!
- It's in.

720
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,078
On three. One, two, three.

721
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:54,080
Clear.

722
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,745
She needs double
sequential defibrillation.

723
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,036
Give her another 150 amio.

724
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:01,232
Start a procainamide drip.

725
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,460
Clear. And go.

726
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:16,435
She doesn't have the time
you need to finish the spine.

727
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,733
We need to take her back
to the ICU, let her stabilize.

728
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,040
We do that, she's paralyzed.

729
00:34:20,075 --> 00:34:21,591
We don't and she's dead.

730
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,326
Can you stabilize her here?

731
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,974
Central line to assess
the cardiac index

732
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,532
and output numbers. How
long would it take, Okafor?

733
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,611
For most, five
minutes. For you, four.

734
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,130
And if she needs
ventricular assist?

735
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,720
20 to deploy percutaneously.

736
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,900
Her spine can stay in a
sterile dressing while you work.

737
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:38,086
I need 30 to finish, then
we get her back to ICU.

738
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,821
All right. Heart first,

739
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,811
then spine, if
she's still stable.

740
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,481
And if her spinal
cord is still viable.

741
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,794
Nic?

742
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,546
You're here.

743
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,665
Grant applications.

744
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,416
All day...

745
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:05,230
I've been trying to
get you to join us.

746
00:35:05,254 --> 00:35:06,630
And it has been...

747
00:35:06,654 --> 00:35:09,472
a day.

748
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,291
There's so much I can't fix.

749
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:15,795
But this, this clinic...

750
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:18,264
I can do.

751
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:21,601
And I'll do it without you.

752
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:23,103
Don't get me wrong...

753
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:24,771
What you're doing here is great.

754
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:27,774
But is it really
about the patients?

755
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:29,809
Seems like...

756
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:33,113
you'd rather rail
against a broken system

757
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:34,792
than actually
fight to change it.

758
00:35:34,816 --> 00:35:36,365
You serious?

759
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,785
I spent the better part
of my life in service.

760
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,286
All I do is fight.

761
00:35:40,322 --> 00:35:43,072
Well, maybe not hard enough.

762
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,515
<i>So, this is about one</i>

763
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,127
- of your employees?
- Julian Booth.

764
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,519
Um... she never
showed up for work today

765
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,055
and is not the type
to just disappear.

766
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,334
Well, do you have
reason to believe

767
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,536
that someone
could have hurt her?

768
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,776
There's a guy you
may want to look into.

769
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:06,479
Um, he's an intern at Chastain.

770
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:09,332
His name is Devon Pravesh.

771
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,820
This is her work phone.

772
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,155
We found it at her desk.

773
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,906
Mm, I'm alive.

774
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,091
And you're gonna stay that way.

775
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,771
We had to place
a ventricular device

776
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:39,012
to keep your heart
pumping effectively,

777
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:41,581
and we'll schedule a transplant
eval when you're healed.

778
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,351
Right now it's
working perfectly.

779
00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:45,746
And after PT

780
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,666
and rehab, you'll be
able to walk again.

781
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,374
Will I be able to go
back to the police force?

782
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,826
We don't know that yet.

783
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:56,229
But...

784
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:58,581
you are gonna lose that cane.

785
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,395
That much I can promise you.

786
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:01,879
I hate that thing.

787
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,790
You deserve to be happy.

788
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,711
So do you.

789
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:14,831
Your sister
would've wanted that.

790
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:19,719
Thanks, guys.

791
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,057
Easy on the hot water.

792
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,742
Sit when you pee.

793
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,628
You may use my condiments,
but do not touch my alcohol.

794
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:48,298
I would never.

795
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,311
Outside of the guest
room, it's either clothing

796
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,285
or a bathrobe
with full coverage.

797
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,254
I don't want any surprises.

798
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:56,289
Why are you helping me?

799
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,925
Because you need it.

800
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,681
Wayne Jackson.

801
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:08,734
In asystole for 15 minutes
before anyone noticed.

802
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,281
Kathy Mars. The hospital

803
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:12,405
billed her 12 grand
for a damn bee sting.

804
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:15,692
Matthew Teter came in
with stage IV colon cancer.

805
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,839
He would've lived if
he'd had early detection.

806
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,923
Every time I thought I got
close to making things better,

807
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:24,100
I saw another patient
lose to a broken system.

808
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,487
So, yes, it is about
the patients for me.

809
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:31,290
But you're crazy if you
think you can change things.

810
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:34,127
Maybe I am.

811
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:43,636
I like crazy.

812
00:38:49,644 --> 00:38:52,145
- Yeah, sure.
- Here.

813
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,714
We'll just, uh, get these...

814
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,410
So the pay sucks.

815
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,401
Beyond sucks.

816
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,737
And Chastain could slash
our funding at any time?

817
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,054
Without warning.

818
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,424
I won't be bossed around.

819
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:07,961
You start tomorrow.

820
00:39:07,996 --> 00:39:09,713
I start now.

821
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,918
Congratulations.

822
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,720
You graduated from the ICU.

823
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,971
Eh. Yeah, unfortunately,

824
00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:20,723
not from clear liquids.

825
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,926
You need something for the pain?

826
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:23,927
No.

827
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,579
No, I want to be alert for this.

828
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:31,033
Son, I've been fighting
this disease for a while now.

829
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,551
I got lucky this time,

830
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:35,071
but it only gets
worse from here.

831
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:38,324
Dr. Simmons says you will
be back on semisolid foods

832
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:39,736
in a week. In two to three days,

833
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,871
you will be out of the hospital

834
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:42,612
and starting physical therapy.

835
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:45,376
- You will get
your strength back.
- We both know

836
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,601
my chances for a meaningful
recovery become less

837
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,620
and less with each
surgery I have.

838
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,956
I need you to stay positive.

839
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:56,009
Patients who believe they'll
recover have better outcomes.

840
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:58,261
Positive thinking won't
change what's happening

841
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,446
to this body of mine.

842
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,433
I'd like to formalize things.

843
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:12,541
You want an advanced directive.

844
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,394
If something like this

845
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,445
happens to me again,

846
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:19,598
I don't want my life prolonged

847
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,879
by aggressive measures.

848
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:23,453
That's a long way off.

849
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,555
I'm serious.

850
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,792
I need to know you'll
respect my wishes.

851
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,179
Of course.

852
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,467
Thank you.
