You need to pull all

The valves worked fine when
simulated for older patients,

- They shattered like glass.

Look, it's very clear that a
defective QuoVadis valve

killed Bradley, not these hands.

Well, that-that...
that proves nothing.

68

Billions of dollars are given to
doctors every year by industry.

69
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:34,006
It's standard practice.

70
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,069
QuoVadis paid
Dr. Benedict a small fortune

71
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:38,176

00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,895
Look, I know, as
a fellow surgeon,

73
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:43,915
you are not gonna stand
around and allow our doctors

00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,169
to use products that
cause harm to our patients.

75
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,989
Okay, well, uh, here's
how I want to proceed.

76
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,826
I-I want to take you off
all high-risk procedures.

77
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,440
- High-risk procedures
are my thing, Bell.
- I understand,

78
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,698
but if you want to
prove it's the valve

79
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,082
that caused Bradley's death,

80
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,328
you need to keep
your record clean.

81
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:03,862
You need to take
the easy layups,

82
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,154
the bread and butter procedures.

83
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:07,973
And while I do that?

84
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:12,210
You have my word
I will look into this.

85
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:39,020
Here is your skinny latte.

86
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:44,409
Get me a meeting with Gordon
Page. Tell him it's urgent.

87
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,065
So?

88
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,668
What's so urgent that it
required a face-to-face meeting?

89
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:56,754
I received some
information today

90
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,207
suggesting your heart
valve may be defective.

91
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:00,925
Wh-What information? From where?

92
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,838
Well, one of our
doctors tested the valve,

93
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,363
and they're convinced you
have a significant problem.

94
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,998
It may cause sudden death.

95
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,033
Look, this is absurd.

96
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,269
- We do all our own testing.
- Right.

97
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,200
Have you done
follow-ups on patients

98
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:16,052
that have received
QuoVadis valves?

99
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,221
What's the mortality rate
at six months or a year?

100
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,994
Naturally, some of them die

101
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:23,031
due to underlying
diseases or surgical errors.

102
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:24,594
Well, and some
device manufacturers

103
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,346
use that fact to hide
device problems.

104
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,086
Is that what you're implying?

105
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,671
No, I'm-I'm... no. I'm
not implying anything,

106
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:33,041
but I want to see data
on the safety of the valves.

107
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:34,592
And if it doesn't exist,

108
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:36,438
QuoVadis has to pull
them from the market.

109
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,391
I'm sorry, are you, are you
asking me to issue a recall

110
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:40,114
during the run up to our IPO?

111
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,227
Oh, yeah, while you do
more testing. Yes, yes.

112
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:43,134
Okay. Yeah, um, okay. I've heard

113
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,736
just about enough of this.

114
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,222
You can't tell me how
to run my business.

115
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:48,735
Who the hell do
you think you are?

116
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,537
You came to me
desperate for money,

117
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:51,926
so I made you an opinion leader.

118
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:53,144
I put you on my board.

119
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,946
I arranged speaking fees

120
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,809
to get you out of whatever
trouble you were in.

121
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,532
And I'm grateful.

122
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:00,396
I asked no questions. I
asked nothing in return

123
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,920
except for loyalty to me.

124
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,658
And to our product.

125
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:10,928
Ugh, this is an extremely
disappointing conversation.

126
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,481
I made an investment in you.

127
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,100

129
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:29,113

Hey, I got your text. What's up?

134
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,288

What do you

137
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,447
It's more approachable.

138
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:47,977
Well, yeah, I like
it 'cause it's mine,

139
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,712
which you borrowed
without asking.

140
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,147
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be

141
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,937

142
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,157
Oh, yes, and I missed the bus.
Can I borrow 20 bucks for a cab?

143
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:58,827
- I'll pay you back. I promise.
- Yes, hurry up.

144
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:01,296

149
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,562
What's that supposed to mean?

150
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,564
Opioids can cause euphoria.

152
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,618
Unbelievable.

153
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:27,171
First, I'm codependent,
now I'm not doing enough.

154
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,373

155
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,692
We're actually in
a really good place.

156
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:34,429
Okay.

157
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,149
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

158
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,386
Our time on this earth begins
and ends with a heartbeat.

159
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,371
It is the first sign of
life within the womb,

160
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:47,975
and it is the last organ to
stop functioning in death.

161
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,940
The best part is feeling
like you're actually there.

162
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,698
Is it the seat of
our emotions? No.

163
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,184
- Do I want you to be...
- Virtual reality lets me attend

164
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:59,770
all my med school classes
and practice virtual surgeries.

165
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:03,090
But I do miss seeing patients.

166
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,109
Eh, new lungs
could change all that.

167
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,412
You would finish your
fourth year of med school,

168
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,397
maybe even come
here as an intern.

169
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,900
I can't think of
anything more amazing.

170
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,037
Yeah, all right. Here
we go, here we go.

171
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:26,514
Take a big breath. Blow
it out forcefully, sweetie.

172
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,467
Conrad, these are
Eloise's parents.

173
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,637
Florence and Dan
Camden, this is Dr. Hawkins.

174
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,707
- Hello.
- I've asked him
to do a complete workup.

175
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,988
Before we can move forward,
we need to be certain Eloise

176
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,362
is still healthy enough for
a double lung transplant.

177
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:43,815
We heard the donor is
already here at Chastain.

178
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,267
Can I ask who she is?

179
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,580
She's a young woman

180
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:50,055
who died of an opioid overdose.

181
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,057
That's awful.

182
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,376
I'm sorry. And
here I am, so happy.

183
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,395
Oh, it's okay.

184
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,482
You can have sympathy for
the donor and still be grateful.

185
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,500
Because the donor was an addict,

186
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,396
there is a very small
risk of complications,

187
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,004
but don't worry, the organs

188
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,000
have been through testing
to ensure they're safe.

189
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,769
When we thought a donor
might not come through,

190
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:10,925
Dan and I were tested.

191
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:12,459
We're both a match

192
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,490
and we can each supply
a lobe of our own lungs.

193
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:17,026
- Would that be better?
- Mom, we've been through this.

194
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,028
That would put both
of your lives at risk.

195
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:22,586
I've lived with
CF all of my life.

196
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,973
50 pills a day, hours
of breathing treatments.

197
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,442
Dad works three jobs to
pay for all my medical bills.

198
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,778
Mom has had to
take care of me 24/7.

199
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:33,147
Uh... they have suffered enough.

200
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,950
The donor lungs are
going to work, I'm sure of it.

201
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,881
As you can no doubt tell,
this case is personal to me.

202
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,872
I've been Eloise's med school
mentor since her first year.

203
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,374
Oh, she's frail, Kit.

204
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,127
- I hope we're not too late.
- I know.

205
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,897
Without new lungs, she
won't live another year.

206
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,566
And that would break my heart.

207
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,734
They found Julian's car.

208
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:19,360
We now go live to the
scene of a breaking story.

209
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:21,257
Earlier this morning
birdwatchers stumbled

210
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,481
across a car submerged in water.

211
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,527
It's registered to a local
woman, Julian Booth,

212
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,979
who's been missing
for some time.

213
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:29,003
Dive teams are now
looking for a body.

214
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,852
Hey, Conrad, what's up?

215
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:47,455
They found Julian's car.

216
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,341
Where?

217
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,611
Pulled it out of the
Chattahoochee River.

218
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,115
Did they find her body?

219
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,071
Still searching.

220
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:06,023
Devon,

221
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,776
she could have made it out of
the car. Until we know more...

222
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,110
Then where is she?

223
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,874
- Why haven't I heard from her?
- Look,

224
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,916
no matter what happens,
we're all here for you.

225
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,218
Whatever you need.

226
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:21,605
Thanks for the call.

227
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,763
How long have you
been in the hospital?

228
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,302
Three weeks.

229
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,139
I know you're scared,
but you're not alone.

230
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,592
Look... that's me.

231
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,776
I was diagnosed
with cystic fibrosis

232
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,429
when I was six weeks old.

233
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,632
I need a new heart.

234
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,550
I heard. The nurses told me.

235
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:50,951
I need new lungs.

236
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,448
The doctors are
gonna help us both.

237
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:54,972
Eloise.

238
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,757
Hi, guys.

239
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,059
This is Jeannie.

240
00:12:58,094 --> 00:12:59,304
Hello, Jeannie.

241
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:01,106
Can we borrow Eloise
for a few minutes?

242
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,680
Sure.

243
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,948
- Will you come back?
- Absolutely.

244
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,857
Let's take the limo, shall we?

245
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,080
Where to?

246
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,415
Your room.

247
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,330
Your parents want to
hear what we have to say.

248
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,960
I think, somehow, I'm going to
need more oxygen to handle this.

249
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,479
I don't like the
look on your faces.

250
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,059
We have the
results of the tests.

251
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,802
Unfortunately, your
previous labs have worsened.

252
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:43,454
You now have extremely
elevated liver enzymes,

253
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,024
clotting factors, and
blood sugar levels.

254
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,953
Okay, I've been in
med school long enough

255
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,109
to know what that means.

256
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:53,147
I'm no longer eligible
for a lung transplant.

257
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:55,161
Usually, that would be the case,

258
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:58,402
but we've found a
potential solution.

259
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,339
A lung, liver and
pancreas transplant.

260
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,018
A triple transplant?

261
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,342
How did this happen?

262
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,378
Eloise's cystic fibrosis
has caused liver failure

263
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,381
and pancreatic insufficiency,
on top of her respiratory failure.

264
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:15,152
A triple transplant...
sounds impossible.

265
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,323
It's dangerous, rare,
but not impossible.

266
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,159
This operation has been
done successfully before.

267
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,527
How many times?

268
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,130
Once, in Canada.

269
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,823
Without this surgery,
how long do I have?

270
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:37,942
Not long, Eloise.

271
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,694
Weeks?

272
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,747
Maybe a little bit more.

273
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,208
It's okay.

274
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:56,744
- This isn't over.
- Mm-hmm.

275
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:00,547
We know what we have to do.

276
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,434
Can we get all three organs
from the donor we already have?

277
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:06,921
Yes.

278
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:11,904
Now, we just have to
convince the ethics committee.

279
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:13,177
Kit?

280
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:28,259
Come here.

281
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,252
You okay?

282
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:40,304
No.

283
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,207
This is awful.

284
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,845
I put a brave face
on it for the family.

285
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,331
Oh, but, my God, Conrad.

286
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,017
Where in the world are
we gonna find a surgeon

287
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,972
crazy enough to
even take this on?

288
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,606
A triple transplant?

289
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,269
Dr. Austin can't do
it. Bell assigned him

290
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,659
to low-risk surgeries.

291
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,938
We've been doing
stents all morning.

292
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,873
And you know I
am royally sick of it.

293
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,248
This quarterback is
coming off the bench.

294
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:09,516
There's no way.

295
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,119
Please, Randolph, as a
friend, just hear me out.

296
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:13,788
This is deeply important to me.

297
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,956
It's bad for Austin.
It's bad for Chastain.

298
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,803
I mean, I mean,
it looks like a...

299
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:19,293
Just a crazy publicity stunt,

300
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:21,190
and the ethics committee
will never allow it.

301
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:24,031
You chair the committee, you
can persuade them. I'll help.

302
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,644
- We can double-team them.
- Kit, I'm-I'm sorry.

303
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,229
I... It's-it's out
of the question.

304
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,437
You go ahead
and try if you'd like.

305
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:32,473
But I... I can't help
you on this one.

306
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,469
Mr. and Mrs. Basilico?

307
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:02,865
How are you doing?

308
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,039
Nicolette Nevin. Aw...

309
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:07,708
Jessie's older sister.
Do you remember, Eric?

310
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:10,377
Of course. You had blue hair.

311
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:14,265
I did. Teen years. How's Letty?

312
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:21,722
Maybe you'd like to see her.

313
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:24,342
She's gone, Nic.

314
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,411
Multiple doctors confirmed.

315
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,063
They're keeping her on the vent

316
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:31,231
because she wanted
to be an organ donor.

317
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:35,052
Apparently, she's donating
to a young woman here.

318
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,855
What happened?

319
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,674
Opioid overdose.

320
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,676
She's struggled with addiction

321
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:43,355
since her senior
year in high school.

322
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:46,964
I know that Letty tore her
ACL at the state championship.

323
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,784
Yeah, and her
doctor gave her Oxy.

324
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,314
They were handing
it out to everybody.

325
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,638
I know.

326
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,218
She never really got sober,

327
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,143
although we thought she did.

328
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,095
I really thought she'd
make it this time.

329
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,765
I didn't see any
signs she was using.

330
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:07,301
I did.

331
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,139
She wasn't eating
much, she'd lost weight.

332
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,208
Her moods were
all over the place.

333
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:17,261
She'd be anxious, on edge,

334
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,613
and then she'd be up, so up.

335
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:23,167
Why didn't you say anything?

336
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,137
I didn't want to see it.

337
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,937
What are you doing?

338
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,132
What'd you do with the
money I gave you, Jess?

339
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:03,201
I told you, I used it for a cab.

340
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,942
You're lying.

341
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,722
Did you even go to
that job interview?

342
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,596
So what if I didn't?
Whole thing was your idea.

343
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,015
I don't want to be a paralegal.

344
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,002
Stop going through
my stuff, Nic. Hey, quit it!

345
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,104
Quit lying to me! I
know you're using.

346
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:18,967
- God, I've been so stupid.
- You are insane.

347
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,957
You know that?
Completely insane.

348
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,376
I am not the problem
here, you are.

349
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,062
Hey! Give me that,
you controlling bitch!

350
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,552
Okay, I know what you
think, but it's not true, okay?

351
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,071
I-I keep these in
case I need them.

352
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,172
Stop. Just stop!

353
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,741
There is a huge amount
of pressure on me.

354
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,011
And you are in my
face day and night.

355
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:43,029
So, yes, I-I took a
few. Sometimes, okay?

356
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:46,000
Be-Because of you!
Y-You are driving me crazy!

357
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:48,185
This is<i> my</i> fault?

358
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,188
Unbelievable. Yeah, it's always
my fault with you, Jessie, huh?

359
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:55,192
Oh, poor little Nic.
Always a victim.

360
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,346
Jessie... Jessie,
stop. Listen to me.

361
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:01,009
You are using, and
you are in trouble.

362
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:07,188
Remember your friend
Letty from high school?

363
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:10,491
She's at Chastain, Jess.

364
00:20:10,526 --> 00:20:14,378
She's dead because she OD'd.

365
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,524
I don't want that to be you.

366
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,948
- No.
- It's true.

367
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,551
Come with me to
Chastain. I'll show you.

368
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,222
I don't believe you.

369
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,959
Fine. Fine.

370
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,296
Either way, pack your bags,

371
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,365
'cause you're going to rehab.

372
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,533
I'm not going anywhere.

373
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,942
Then get out.

374
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,379
Get out.

375
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,199
I'm done, Jess.

376
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:55,553
I'm done trying to save
you. I'm done enabling.

377
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,054
I'm done worrying.

378
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,424
That's enough.

379
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:05,891
And if you die... I
won't feel guilty...

380
00:21:05,915 --> 00:21:09,149
'cause I gave you every chance.

381
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,268
So, here, you want your pills?

382
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:14,004
You need them
that bad? Take 'em.

383
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,789
Take 'em, Jess.

384
00:21:15,825 --> 00:21:17,519
I can't stop you
from killing yourself

385
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,476
if that's what you want.

386
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,175
When I come home, I
don't want to find you here.

387
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,070
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm a friend of Julian's.

388
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,373
Tell her she's a week
behind on her rent.

389
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,024
She's not returning my calls.

390
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,493
Um, when was the
last time you saw her?

391
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:28,028
I don't know. Over a week.

392
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,146
She left the cat all alone.

393
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,466
I've been feeding it,
but it's driving me crazy.

394
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,585
I bet.

395
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,803
That's actually why I'm here.

396
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,684
Julian asked me to
come pick up the cat, but

397
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,819
I forgot her key.

398
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:43,843
If you let me in, I can
take the cat home with me.

399
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,021
Here's the key.

400
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:56,556
Thank you.

401
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,938
All set.

402
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:04,424
Thank you.

403
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,094
Hey.

404
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,012
Come on.

405
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:12,732
This, my friends, is what
you call a paracentesis.

406
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:15,402
It's pretty gross. Look
left, and you can see

407
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:18,638
Dr. Hawkins is removing fluid
that's collected in my abdomen.

408
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,962
You don't have to
stream this, Eloise.

409
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,298
People want to
know how I'm doing.

410
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,966
I've live-streamed all my
procedures for the last year

411
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,319
to med students and the
cystic fibrosis community.

412
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:36,423
As you can see,
my belly is shrinking.

413
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,525
Maybe I'll finally get some abs.

414
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,946
It also means that I'm
in severe liver failure.

415
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,432
I came in thinking I
was getting some lungs.

416
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:48,485
Now, we've learned that I
need a new liver and pancreas.

417
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,725
So, I will have a triple
transplant and make history.

418
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,726
Okay. Feel better?

419
00:24:56,762 --> 00:25:00,064
- Yeah. Thank you, Dr. Hawkins.
- My pleasure.

420
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,782
Oh.

421
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:05,785
Dr. Austin and Dr. Okafor
are gonna be your surgeons.

422
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:09,807
Wow. We are honored.

423
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,292
It's Dr. AJ Austin in the flesh!

424
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,295
I love your lectures.

425
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,014
Thank you.

426
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:17,998
"Our time on this earth

427
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:20,834
begins and ends..."

428
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,555
And ends with a heartbeat.

429
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,708
Hi, Eloise.

430
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:30,928
I have a consent
form for you to read.

431
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,513
After the surgery, you'll
be on dozens of new drugs.

432
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:36,400
I'm sure you have concerns
about rejection and...

433
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:39,186
I may have a chest tube,
breathing tube, feeding tubes,

434
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:43,590
Foley catheter, and central
line for weeks, maybe months.

435
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,709
But I've got a life to live.

436
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,178
- I just have one question.
- Mm-hmm.

437
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,831
Can we livestream my
surgery to med students?

438
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:52,126
Uh...

439
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,617
Not the best idea,

440
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,185
under these circumstances.

441
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,404
But... since it's so rare,

442
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,840
whether I live or die, isn't
there a lot to learn from this?

443
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:02,020
Tell you what.

444
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:03,910
We'll talk to the bigwigs.

445
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:06,896
And for the record...
I'm cool with it.

446
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,017
Okay.

447
00:26:10,052 --> 00:26:11,762
Hang tight. We're getting close.

448
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:15,038
Just one more hurdle left to
cross: the ethics committee.

449
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,223
Ah...

450
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:17,691
Look, we can keep going

451
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:18,954
around and around
about this all day,

452
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:20,243
but the problem is,

453
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,906
two lungs, a liver,
and a pancreas

454
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,925
could go to four people
instead of just one,

455
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,199
all of whom have a far
better chance of survival.

456
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:28,418
This is an exceptional person.

457
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,871
She's a top medical student
who'll make a great doctor.

458
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:33,206
We understand how you feel.

459
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:35,909
But all of our patients
are equally deserving.

460
00:26:35,945 --> 00:26:37,054
Of course they are.

461
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,290
And the other candidates
will get organs, too,

462
00:26:38,314 --> 00:26:40,008
just not from this donor.
They'll have to wait

463
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,959
a little longer, but
they'll still be next in line.

464
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:44,485
You're talking about a
five percent success rate.

465
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,587
These odds may be long,
but they are not impossible.

466
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:49,167
And it doesn't
account for variables,

467
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,636
- like the skill of the surgeons.
- Eloise started a nonprofit

468
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,927
to empower children
with disabilities.

469
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:55,656
She works for
access to medications

470
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,448
for those who can't afford them.

471
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:58,848
She's touched so many lives.

472
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,128
Dr. Bell, we're deadlocked.

473
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,284
This is up to you,

474
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,937
and you are worried
if this doesn't succeed,

475
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:06,756
it will be a blow to
Chastain's reputation.

476
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,486
But no matter what,
we advance science

477
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,789
and we open new possibilities
for thousands in the future

478
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:13,930
who could benefit
from this kind of surgery.

479
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,144
We can't just give up
and say it's too difficult.

480
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,553
It will never be
possible if we don't try.

481
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,482
I remember a surgeon

482
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,179
who took on the
toughest surgeries

483
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:35,536
in the state of Georgia.

484
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,554
Who gave hope to
people who had none.

485
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,938
Who had no fear.

486
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:41,725
He would have
jumped at the chance

487
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,178
to advance the science
and make medical history.

488
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:57,568
We are taking a
really big risk here.

489
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,994
But we are gonna
try to save this life.

490
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:09,480
No second chance
when it comes to

491
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:11,199
a Donation after Cardiac
Death. When that heart stops,

492
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,984
those organs stop
getting perfused with blood

493
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:14,974
and quickly become unusable.

494
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,228
When we hit that OR, we got
to be lightning fast to save them.

495
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:24,167
I thought no surgery
could scare me anymore,

496
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,203
but my heart is in
my throat this time.

497
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,541
Letty's heart has stopped.

498
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:38,426
All right, let's get
this show on the road.

499
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,761
No, not so fast.

500
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,429
We still have the five-minute
buffer to make sure

501
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,797
- the heart's actually stopped.
- I think Dr. Austin

502
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,788
is aware of the IOM guidelines.

503
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,273
Just a reminder to
do the right thing.

504
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,585
Let's dance.

505
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:02,906
Luckily, the Raptor's fearless.

506
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,975
Thank God. We need his courage.

507
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,010
- Sternal saw.
- 10 blade.

508
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,102
Catheter.

509
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:18,500
Cannulate.

510
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:19,617
Preservation fluids.

511
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,481
Fast and furious, baby.

512
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,111
Checking the liver...

513
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,252
and the pancreas.

514
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:35,088
They both look viable. Yours?

515
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,324
Lungs are not viable.

516
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,011
There's black discoloration.
A rare complication.

517
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:44,447
The nodules must not have
been detected during imaging.

518
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,151
We can't use these lungs.

519
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:51,188
We're done.

520
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,030
Remove the liver and pancreas.

521
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,931
Put them on ice.

522
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,666
There's another option.

523
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,150
This can't be over
before it starts.

524
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,668
It's not. You've already
been established

525
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:12,176
as lung donor matches.

526
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,105
We are gonna use a lobe
of lung from each of you

527
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:16,249
and the liver and
pancreas we just procured.

528
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,633
- If you agree.
- Of course,

529
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:22,113
but she'll only have
two lobes of lung.

530
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,898
All she needs is
two lobes of lung.

531
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,706
And they will expand over time.

532
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,191
Better than her diseased ones.

533
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,870
Much better than
her diseased ones.

534
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,655
But they haven't been
prepped for surgery.

535
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:32,390
They haven't fasted, they could
aspirate when they go under.

536
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,864
Anesthesia can do a
rapid sequence intubation

537
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,666
to limit the risk of aspiration.

538
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,118
Let's get you both to pre-op.

539
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:39,870
If we don't move forward,

540
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,632
we may never have
another opportunity like this.

541
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:44,324
You're our daughter, Elo.

542
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:47,027
The board has agreed
to livestream the surgery,

543
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:49,057
but only to Eloise's
med school classmates,

544
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,009
- just a limited feed.
- Like she said,

545
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:52,977
no matter what, it will
be a great learning tool.

546
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:54,529
This just went from
an incredible long shot

547
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,135
to virtually impossible.

548
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,999
Well, then, we'd
better work a miracle.

549
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,263
There's an entire family
in there counting on us.

550
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,144
Hey, I'm on call for thoracic.

551
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:05,190
Said you guys could use a hand.

552
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:06,334
Welcome to the team, bro.

553
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,995
Hmm.

554
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,197
Diseased liver and
pancreas removed.

555
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:26,149
So far, so good.

556
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,674
Donor liver and pancreas,
ready for implantation.

557
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,418
Mom and Dad are stable.

558
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:48,071
Here we go.

559
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,107
How many people
are watching this?

560
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:57,781
Not many.

561
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,932
Probably just the gunners.

562
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,111
They're finishing the
liver and pancreas.

563
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,996
We need the right
lower lobe of lung.

564
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,082
The lobe's harder to
remove than we expected.

565
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,958
Mom has some adhesions
to the chest wall. Stapler.

566
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,416
Transecting the
segmental branches

567
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,984
off the pulmonary artery.

568
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:38,337
Get Dr. Austin. Now!

569
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,951
One order of lung to go.

570
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,101
- Mom's crashing. They need you.
- Get this to Okafor

571
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,607
and Bell to implant.

572
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,726
Page Dr. Weiss, tell
her to come close up.

573
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:03,057
Have we activated massive
transfusion protocol?

574
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,110
Yes. I've been trying to
repair the pulmonary artery,

575
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:07,295
but the damage is extensive.

576
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,153
Artery forceps to me.

577
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,734
Dr. Austin needs you
to implant the lung.

578
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,564
- Where's Dr. Austin?
- He's helping with the mom.

579
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,349
- She's bleeding out.
- What?

580
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,723
You stay. I'll go.

581
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:44,499
What's happening?

582
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,006
It's impossible to see anything.

583
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,757
We need to convert to open.

584
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,125
10 blade.

585
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,211
Retractor to Bell.

586
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,100
Put your finger on
that proximal P.A.

587
00:33:58,103 --> 00:34:00,670
Getting the lung
out of the field

588
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,422
will give us a better view.

589
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,625
Looks like the lobe got damaged.

590
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,195
Implant the lung with
Mina. I'll fix the bleed.

591
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:16,185
3-0 Prolene.

592
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,437
On my mark, let go
and I'll sew this up.

593
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,193
- You ready?
- Yeah.

594
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,609
Go.

595
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,993
Suction. Lap.

596
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,031
Had to check on a patient.

597
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,567
- How we doing?
- Florence lost a lot of blood.

598
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:34,036
- They're working to save her.
- Eloise?

599
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,722
They're putting in Florence's
right lower lobe now,

600
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:39,292
but it may be damaged.

601
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:43,813
Eloise can't live
with only one lobe.

602
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,634
Dad's lobe on
the left looks good.

603
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,404
Mom's lobe on the right
shows some contusions.

604
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:53,590
Let's hope this works.

605
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,609

Your dad's procedure went great.

Your mom...

660
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:58,091
There were some complications
with the pulmonary artery.

661
00:37:58,126 --> 00:38:01,127
It can happen in
difficult surgeries like this.

662
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:04,080
- Recovery's not gonna be easy.
- But...

663
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,849
we believe she can make it.

664
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,935
Oh... Mom.

665
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,098
Mom, I'm here.

666
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:27,137
Right here, where you've
always been: beside me,

667
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:30,923
helping me.

668
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:33,193
Mom, can you hear me?

669
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:52,111
You're famous.

670
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:54,480
Just think how much
more insufferable you'll be.

671
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:55,981
I wouldn't count on it.

672
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:58,151
I have recently
dined on humble pie,

673
00:38:58,186 --> 00:39:00,453
and it's a flavor I
will not soon forget.

674
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:03,022
That surgery was insane.

675
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:05,052
I mean, we're all
proud of the work we did

676
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,854
and are happy for
Eloise and her family,

677
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,212
but that could have
ended very badly.

678
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,030
A triple tragedy.

679
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:14,016
Skill certainly played a
large part, but so did luck.

680
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,136
It was practically a miracle.

681
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:20,056
Check it out. Our next surgery.

682
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:22,358
What are you gonna do?

683
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,894
Uh,<i> we</i> are going
to perform a flawless

684
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,030
aortic valve replacement.

685
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,915
- With a QuoVadis valve?
- A-A QuoVadis valve? Excuse me?

686
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,668
There are no QuoVadis
valves on Chastain shelves.

687
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,565
Are you telling me...

688
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:36,050
Bell pulled them?

689
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,057
Every last one.

690
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:41,060
We've got the old reliable
valves back for good.

691
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:42,790
- Well, today is
truly miraculous.
- Mm.

692
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,232
Bell, of all people,
did the right thing.

693
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:53,022
You pulled the
valves. Are you insane?

694
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,107
It was the right thing to do.

695
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,744
And I believe, eventually,
you'll agree with my decision.

696
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,563
This is way out of line.

697
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,781
Obviously, there will
be consequences.

698
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,817
You'll regret this, Dr. Bell.

699
00:40:13,461 --> 00:40:16,012
Long day.

700
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:21,033
A great day.

701
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,432
I'm leaving, Dr. B. Uh, don't
forget you have that dinner

702
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,467
with the CEO of
Atlanta General at 8:00.

703
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,874
I canceled it. I have surgery.

704
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:30,655
Ah, that's a nice change.

705
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,362
See you tomorrow, boss.

706
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:38,651
To you.

707
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,454
Thank you for what you did.

708
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:48,010
Thank you.

709
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:50,029
Allow me.

710
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,111
It's a good look.

711
00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:08,514
Yeah, I just had it pressed.

712
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,100
You've reached Mark Truscott,

713
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,284
Director of the Center
of Devices at the FDA.

714
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,110
Leave a message.

715
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,703
<i>You broke into Julian's place?</i>

716
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,388
Not exactly.

717
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,874
The landlady let me
in to get Julian's cat.

718
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,626
Don't ask.

719
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,711
- And you just took
her phone bill.
- Yes.

720
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,014
Look at the last number
that Julian called.

721
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:45,168
On the 3rd, the day
I saw her in the park.

722
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:46,719
The day she disappeared.

723
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:48,715
I tried the number
about an hour ago

724
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,302
and I got an answering machine.

725
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:54,477
It was an office at the FDA.

726
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,345
Julian was a device rep.

727
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:57,925
She probably called
them all the time.

728
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,227
Or maybe she found something out

729
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:01,384
and she was trying
to blow the whistle.

730
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:06,706
Look, you said it yourself.

731
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:09,759
Bradley died because
of a defective valve.

732
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,679
He was my best friend.

733
00:42:13,715 --> 00:42:17,083
Did QuoVadis know
the valve was bad?

734
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:21,387
If so, they killed him.

735
00:42:21,423 --> 00:42:24,173
Julian told me that
something was wrong at work.

736
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:27,993
She felt like everything
was falling apart.

737
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:29,879
What do you think she meant?

738
00:42:31,198 --> 00:42:33,716
I think she was in danger.

739
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:37,219
Did they kill her?
Did she run away?

740
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,906
I don't know.

741
00:42:39,941 --> 00:42:42,892
Something is up with QuoVadis.

742
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:50,999
Let's figure out
what to do next.
