Who are you? <i>Ms. Booth

You or Conrad Hawkins?

alcohol test. Tox, too.

133
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,714
Got it.

134
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,169
Mm. So, Julian,
what do you advise

135
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:31,389
for an abdominal wall
this well-upholstered?

136
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,707
Try these retractors.

137
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,876
They're non-slip.
Designed for bariatrics.

138

152
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,722
can entertain like a rock star.

153
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:10,912
His open bar is epic.

154
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:13,098

155
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,584
Oh. If you need a
plus-one, I'm free.

156

The pick.

157
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,953
See how we mind
the patellar tendon

158
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,772
as we saw the posterior tibia.

159
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,445
Retractor, please.

160

PCL, right?

161
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,581
That's right.

162
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:50,118
Oscillating saw's best
to resect damaged areas

163
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,469
of the proximal tibia.

164
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,621
Then we size the implants

165
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:55,624
and cement the components.

166
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,825
Oh, it's a beautiful
procedure, isn't it?

167
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,978
Go ahead, you try.

168
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,513
Get in there and
do the next cut.

00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,811
- Make an appointment.
- Amazing thing.

178
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:52,263
I checked the schedule, and
we're both available right now.

179
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,581
I'm on a much-needed break.

180
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,700
Which you'll share with me.

181
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,253
I let you get away
with this why?

182
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,670
Hmm.

183
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,169
I need to establish better
boundaries with staff.

184
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:05,693
Why, dear man, did you assign me

185
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:08,612
yet another moist
towelette of a resident?

186
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,833
What, Coleman? He graduated
Baylor at the top of his class.

187
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:14,051
He nearly fainted in my OR.

188
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,588
We're a teaching hospital.
Teach him, he can learn.

189
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,458
Who's this douche?

190
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,722
Head of the hottest new medical
device company in the country.

191
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:25,430
Also the most eligible
bachelor, I'm told.

192
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,681
Oh, come on, Bell.

193
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:29,216
We all know you're the
most eligible bachelor.

194
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:32,520
All our residents are standouts,

195
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,856
or they wouldn't be at Chastain.

196
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:37,074
I love Atlanta.

197
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,909
The street art, the craft beer.

198
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,912
A rough-but-ready Irishman

199
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,398
in Buckhead I've been
spending a lot of time with.

200
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,595
But have you seen the
surgical suites at Walter Reed?

201
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,587
Mayo and Stanford
keep calling, too.

202
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:52,051
I-I don't know how
they all get my number.

203
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:55,610
I may be able to find
you a replacement.

204
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,281
What? What is it?

205
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,386
A piece of bone.

206
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:08,956
Ah. It's an occupational hazard.

207
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,004
Keep me happy, Randolph.

208
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,431
What's your full name?

209
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,949
Josh Robinson.

210
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,129
Do you remember where you
were when you lost consciousness?

211
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,902
Uh, at a concert in the park.

212
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:25,306
Reviewing your chart, you've
had quite the interesting life.

213
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:26,803
How did you get
so many injuries?

214
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:31,762
Uh, well, this one,
heli-rafting in Queenstown.

215
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,782
Um, mountain biking in Morocco.

216
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:38,085
Heat stroke, passed
out. And, uh...

217
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,632
Death Drop in
Zambia, two years ago.

218
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,122
Still can't bend it right.

219
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:43,035
Someone knows how
to use their vacation time.

220
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,704
I'm a professional
adventure guide.

221
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,710
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

222
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,562
I just took a group free diving.

223
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,543
- Wow.
- Oh, nice.

224
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,467
You on any medications?

225
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,704
Uh, yeah. It's in my bag.

226
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,889
Oh, there it is.

227
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:01,276
- Do you mind?
- No.

228
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:02,655
You have injuries to
mark your experiences.

229
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,995
I get tattoos to mark mine.

230
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,509
I don't see any
prescription drugs.

231
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,983
These are all supplements.

232
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,668
Oh, Pharma. Bad juju.

233
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,231
Josh.

234
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,506
Do not get me
started on Big Pharma.

235
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,576
Milk thistle, kava
kava, omega-3.

236
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,589
Ironic you take all these
supplements to stay healthy

237
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,464
and you end up stampeded
by a bunch of drunk music fans.

238
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:26,334
Stampede? What stampede?

239
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:28,681
<i>And that's when you
realized that my client</i>

240
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:31,589
- passed out before the stampede?
- Yes.

241
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,975
And how many patients did
you treat that day, Dr. Hawkins?

242
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:37,511
I don't recall.

243
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:41,365
More than five? More than ten?

244
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,870
I'll tell you. 20.

245
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,989
Chastain strictly adheres
to ACGME guidelines.

246
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,602
How can one resident
possibly provide

247
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,271
the standard of care
to that many patients?

248
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,878
We do it every day.

249
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,377
<i>Disturbing footage today</i>

250
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:00,028
<i>from the Hotlanta
Music Festival.</i>

251
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,214
Liver and kidneys
have seen better days.

252
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:03,671
History of Crohn's, too.

253
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:06,374
So, lots of signs
of the rock star life.

254
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:07,803
I'm worried the swelling
from his injury could cause

255
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,393
too much pressure in his leg.

256
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,695
Could lead to poor blood
flow and muscle necrosis.

257
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,909
Compartment syndrome. So
if we don't relieve the pressure,

258
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,528
he'll lose the leg.
What's your plan?

259
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,886
Fasciotomy. I had Ortho
come check his pressures.

260
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,804
- Good.
- They're only at 20.

261
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,555
Well, watch it closely.

262
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,419
If it hits 30, they'll need
to operate right away.

263
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,370
Which is why I have
him on the OR's radar.

264
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:28,713
But the anesthesiologist said
he'd like to have him sober.

265
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:33,133
Well, his blood alcohol
concentration is .04.

266
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,819
Give him a few hours.

267
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,655
He says that he hasn't
had a drink in a year.

268
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,708
But his serum alcohol
level tells us he did.

269
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:44,245
Tests don't lie. Alcoholics do.

270
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,298
Yeah, maybe sober
companions, too.

271
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:55,673
How does one man
take all of these?

272
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,852
Those are just the supplements

273
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,937
that our adventure
guide remembers taking.

274
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,426
Kava kava was banned in Europe

275
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:00,762
for causing liver toxicity.

276
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:02,441
That might explain
all the bleeding,

277
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,526
- but not why he passed out.
- If I had to guess,

278
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,512
supplements and dehydration
caused an arrhythmia.

279
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,631
- Knocked him out.
- I'm glad you called.

280
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,855
My firm has over 50
years of experience

281
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,357
with neck injuries, right?

282
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,276
You say the ER doctor
didn't even order an MRI?

283
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:17,695
That's malpractice.

284
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,848
You know, I'm all for patients'
rights, but doctors' jobs

285
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,367
are hard enough without
these vulture lawyers.

286
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,197
And who gets sued
the most? ER doctors.

287
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,216
Patients need to be able to
sue. It's their only recourse

288
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,707
- for medical error.
- It's abused, and it leads

289
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,854
to cover-our-asses
overtreatment and overtesting.

290
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,556
Forcing doctors to
practice defensive medicine.

291
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,647
Well, let's just
focus on our patients

292
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,681
and ignore the vultures.

293
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,677
Thank you.

294
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:52,864
I understand that you and
Nurse Nevin are in a relationship.

295
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,233
- Correct?
- That's irrelevant.

296
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,912
Do you think working
with your girlfriend

297
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,153
could possibly have
affected your performance?

298
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:00,905
Objection. Argumentative.

299
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,742
No. Never. There is no better
nurse practitioner than Nic.

300
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,911
Your client was
lucky to have her.

301
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,931
Wouldn't you agree, Josh?

302
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,168
Easy.

303
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,764
Isn't it true

304
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,187
that you have a history

305
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:21,059
of deviating from protocol?

306
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,512
I know what you're trying to do.

307
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,715
You're suggesting I
put my patient at risk,

308
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:32,219
but you don't know a
damn thing about medicine.

309
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:35,139
Let's take five.

310
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:42,030
- Conrad.
- I know, I messed up.

311
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:43,275
I don't need to
hear it from you.

312
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,259
This lawsuit could
end your career.

313
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,919
You could even be
found personally liable.

314
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,882
And the hospital
won't stand by you.

315
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:52,372
Not everyone at
Chastain is on your side.

316
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:54,959
- But you are?
- Yes.

317
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,378
You have no idea
what this is like for me.

318
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,797
I know exactly
what this is like.

319
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,265
I get sued all the time.

320
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,978
Yeah, you probably
win every single one,

321
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,301
no matter what you say or do.

322
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,636
Oh, don't be naive.

323
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,739
What happened doesn't matter.

324
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:11,704
A doctor can do everything
right, and still get screwed.

325
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:14,979
Just control your emotions,

326
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,149
and let the
lawyers do their job.

327
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,951
I have to tell the
truth, no matter what.

328
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,338
Then you'll lose.

329
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,660
Maybe.

330
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:41,789
This metalhead is lucky
you brought her to me.

331
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,992
That paper-thin portal vein

332
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,628
could easily be ripped
by a mere mortal.

333
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:50,431
I can do the Pringle Maneuver.

334
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:52,528
I can do it better.
Observe. Right angle.

335
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:53,996
Well, I've done it before,

336
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,614
- flawlessly.
- Well, if there's nothing

337
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:58,940
left for you to learn,
Dr. Okafor, why are you here?

338
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,191
Good question.

339
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,828
Pressure's still dropping.

340
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,125
We must have another
bleeder in there somewhere.

341
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:08,493
- Give me another right angle.
- She's losing too much blood.

342
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:10,702
- Let me help.
- Too many cooks.

343
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:14,122
Can we think about the safety
of the patient and not your ego?

344
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:17,207
Yeah, in the words of
my colleague Dr. Seuss,

345
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,962
"With this brain in my head
and this blade in my hand,

346
00:16:20,997 --> 00:16:24,882
I shall save every man,
woman and child in the land."

347
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,552
- That is not Dr. Seuss.
- It's an adaptation.

348
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,838
Let me break it down,
Okafor: my house, my rules.

349
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:35,726
Pressure's coming back up.

350
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,645
Course it is.

351
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,880
Oh, it's so good to be king.

352
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,534
I'm getting sick of the king
treating me like his valet.

353
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:50,408
I'll tell you what:
you can close.

354
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,748
Your life can
change in a moment.

355
00:16:56,783 --> 00:17:01,419
Levi was born with a
congenital corneal disease.

356
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,055
He'd never seen his mom,

357
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,090
until a synthetic cornea

358
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,510
<i>from QuoVadis made it possible.</i>

359
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:11,423
<i>Utilizing advanced
nanotechnology,</i>

360
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,433
<i>we provided better bio
integration, quicker healing...</i>

361
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,518
I don't like being summoned.

362
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,070
<i>You see, at QuoVadis,</i>

363
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,689
<i>we measure our success</i>

364
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:24,192
<i>by how much we improve
the quality of people's lives.</i>

365
00:17:24,227 --> 00:17:26,410
<i>Which is why I'm so passionate</i>

366
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,762
<i>about our latest
breakthrough device:</i>

367
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:33,151
<i>a safer, a more effective
vagus nerve stimulator.</i>

368
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,783
Remember that rep serving
free lunch with her device demos?

369
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,790
- Mm.
- This is her boss.

370
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,094
He's barely 30. His
company valued at $4 billion.

371
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:44,462
He's a salesman, Dr. Bell.

372
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,057
The first thing they
sell is themselves.

373
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,399
This talk of his has
over a million hits.

374
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,635
I find it quite moving.

375
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,053
What am I doing here?

376
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,222
Oh, I'm assigning you to Ortho.

377
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:57,642
Ha. Bell just made a funny.

378
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,638
I-I am not changing
my residency.

379
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,657
Well, no one said you
were. You're just rotating

380
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,292
through a different
surgical specialty.

381
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,660
This is a teaching
hospital, and when we said,

382
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,950
"See One, Do One, Teach One,"

383
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:09,120
we didn't literally
mean just one.

384
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,122
See mine, do mine, be mine.

385
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,573
Okafor belongs to me.

386
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,142
I belong to no one. I
chose general surgery.

387
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,778
Me, not you.

388
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:21,466
Well, my bad, Dr. Bell.

389
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,178
I now see the value in
Okafor doing a dance

390
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,002
with our friends in Ortho.

391
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,372
Happy hammering.

392
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:46,157
Dr. Okafor, lovely to meet you.

393
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,025
You come highly recommended.

394
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,011
What did Dr. Austin really say?

395
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,196
That you're extremely demanding,

396
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,500
and in need of an
attitude adjustment.

397
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,784
Also too talented for Ortho,

398
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,454
which he called
glorified carpentry.

399
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:04,175
That was rude of
him, but accurate.

400
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,724
You know what's
beautiful about Ortho?

401
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,365
When something
is broken, we fix it.

402
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,151
First up, full hip replacement.

403
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,555
Shall we go and give the
patient the ability to walk again?

404
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:25,313
Come on, just let
it go. Relax, relax.

405
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:26,813
LFTs just came in.

406
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:28,743
Let me guess.
Alcoholic liver disease?

407
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,151
Early stage.

408
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:31,663
Relax, relax, let it go.

409
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:33,371
Ingrid, what's going on?

410
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,072
We're having a party.

411
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,224
Are you sure all
he's had are IV fluids?

412
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,238
Oh, I never took my
eyes off him, I swear.

413
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,142
Does this thing
have a gas pedal?

414
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,716
Hey. What'd you slip him?

415
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,002
A drink? Pills?

416
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:50,788
Let me have a look at that leg.

417
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,709
I'm not drunk. I'm
sober as a judge.

418
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:57,389
Pressure's too
high. We can't wait.

419
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:58,907
All right, we need to
get him up to surgery,

420
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,066
or he'll lose his leg. Let's go.

421
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:06,604
It's his leg, but if he keeps
drinking, it won't matter.

422
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:12,944
You're up.

423
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,545
You want me to do the impaction?

424
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,815
Mm-hmm.

425
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:30,310
This hip replacement
needs to be attached firmly.

426
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,885
Think of something
bothering you.

427
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,555
Pissed you got reassigned?
Get out those frustrations.

428
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,126
The news reports
said hundreds of people

429
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,900
were injured at the concert,

430
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:56,237
most of them seriously, so
why am I only seeing 40 admits?

431
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:57,649
Where are the brain
injuries, the skull fractures,

432
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,906
the ICU admissions?

433
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:00,474
My understanding is

434
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,793
the serious cases all
went to Atlanta General.

435
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,940
All of them? We're a
level-1 trauma center.

436
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:09,116
Why are the EMTs not
sending us the serious cases?

437
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:12,086
Because Atlanta General
has a new EMT lounge.

438
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:15,005
They have a 72-inch
TV with sports channels

439
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,675
and a popcorn
machine with real butter.

440
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,261
They have a lounge
just for the EMTs?

441
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:23,096
I heard Trinity Memorial
is building a better one.

442
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:25,027
We don't even give
them stale bagels.

443
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,684
It's no wonder the ambulances
are going elsewhere.

444
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,487
Give us the room.

445
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:41,682
Maybe it's time you
start doing your job

446
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,369
and let someone else cut
open obese Saudi princes.

447
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:49,340
He requested the
chief of surgery which...

448
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,125
is me.

449
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,544
I've been doing due
diligence for the board.

450
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,996
Our costs are rising

451
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:58,049
and our profit
margins are shrinking.

452
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,044
Yeah, which is why
I have a meeting

453
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,885
with Gordon Page tonight.

454
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,305
Let me guess,
Chastain agrees to use

455
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,524
only QuoVadis medical devices

456
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,060
and in exchange,
Gordon gives us...

457
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:12,730
A 20% price cut to
boost our profit margins.

458
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,849
Strong deal for both sides.

459
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:17,384
I need a better one.

460
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,020
I've already told the board

461
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:23,407
not to worry because if
you can't land Gordon, I will.

462
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,514
I didn't have time to
go home and change.

463
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:38,589
Is this too wrinkled?

464
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,758
- No.
- Thanks.

465
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,938
There isn't a full-length
mirror in the ladies room.

466
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,346
I'll get right on that.

467
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:48,232
This party of
Gordon's is a big deal.

468
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,362
I don't get a lot of face
time with him. He's too busy.

469
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:52,197
I want to make a
good impression.

470
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:53,398
Oh, come on, Gordon
can't be tougher

471
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:55,922
than some of these
doctors at Chastain.

472
00:22:55,958 --> 00:23:00,110
And you've been winning us
over since you walked in that door.

473
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,579
You got this.

474
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,447
I hope so. If I can be the one

475
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,549
to bring Gordon
and Bell together,

476
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,587
I could be looking at a
bonus, which I really need.

477
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm helping my parents put
my little sister through college.

478
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,125
You're gonna do great, Julian.

479
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,593
Thanks.

480
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,963
Oh, hey, could
you do me a favor?

481
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,381
Sure.

482
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,933
I heard you're treating
Rhys Barrett in VIP.

483
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,887
If I confirmed that, I
would be violating HIPAA.

484
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:30,007
Just blink if he's here.

485
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:35,962
My parents would not
stop playing his albums

486
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,742
when I was a kid;
his songs are basically

487
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:38,965
the only ones I knew

488
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,411
until I dropped
out of high school.

489
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:41,819
I'm still not telling you.

490
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,153
Pretty please.

491
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,405
Wait, you dropped out?

492
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,490
I went back. Anyway,
I'll always have

493
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:47,952
a special place in
my heart for Rhys.

494
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:50,244
I know he hasn't
toured for years.

495
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,830
Drugs and alcohol, I guess,
which is such a shame,

496
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,815
but I will always be a fan.

497
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,202
I'd love to meet him.

498
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,907
So who's my biggest competition?

499
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:12,316
Trinity Memorial beats you
on cochlear implants by 15%

500
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,935
but doesn't come close
on caths or aortic valves.

501
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,620
St. John's will make a play.

502
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,239
Yes, but with the VNS,

503
00:24:18,274 --> 00:24:21,141
Gordon wants
high-volume pilot hospitals.

504
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,637
- More patients, better outcomes.
- Well, for a guy

505
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,757
who just moved to Atlanta,
he certainly has settled in.

506
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:33,153
Gordon.

507
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:34,516
I'd like to introduce you
to the CEO of Chastain,

508
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,091
- Dr. Randolph Bell...
- Randolph Bell.

509
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:39,188
I've been looking forward
to meeting you, Dr. Bell.

510
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:41,172
Hope Julian here has
made herself useful.

511
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:42,608
Oh, she's been invaluable.

512
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:44,525
So I've done some reading
on your vagus nerve stimulator.

513
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:45,777
Is it everything I hear?

514
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:49,186
More. Yeah, we just
wrapped our European trials.

515
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,532
It exceeded all
our expectations.

516
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,306
We're gonna help so many people.

517
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:53,985
Well, I'd love to see
the data from those trials.

518
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,154
Previous VNS stimulators
have all had issues.

519
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:58,978
Not ours. But we'd
value your thoughts.

520
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,792
- Hey, Gordon.
- Ooh.

521
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:02,160
Can I introduce
you to the governor?

522
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:03,534
He's on our board.

523
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,852
His son suffers from
refractory seizures,

524
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:07,516
so we might have
some answers for him.

525
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,207
Governor.

526
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,214
You're even better
than your reputation.

527
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,366
I need opportunities
to hone my skills.

528
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:21,668
Lately, Dr. Austin
would rather show off his.

529
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,872
AJ does seem like
a grade-A narcissist.

530
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:27,725
He's also the most brilliant
surgeon I've ever seen.

531
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,476
No offense.

532
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:31,478
Well, you haven't
got to know me yet.

533
00:25:31,514 --> 00:25:35,899
There are things I can teach
you even the Raptor doesn't know.

534
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,384
I'm listening.

535
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,855
♪ ♪

536
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:53,066
And one for you,
fresh from Havana.

537
00:25:53,101 --> 00:25:55,068
Thank you.

538
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:57,904
Awful, what happened
today at that music festival.

539
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:01,258
Yeah, thank God no one died.

540
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,854
You know, you're
the only CEO here

541
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:04,239
who didn't tell me in
the first two minutes

542
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,512
how much they made from it.

543
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:08,098
Well, don't give
me too much credit.

544
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:11,918
To be perfectly frank,
we didn't do so well.

545
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:14,087
I'm impressed by your honesty.

546
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,539
I'm interested to
know more about you.

547
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,909
Were your parents in medicine?

548
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,729
My parents...

549
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:25,783
ran a hardware
store on Peachtree.

550
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,367
Worked seven days a week,

551
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:28,780
not that it got them anything.

552
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,904
- You wanted more?
- You know,

553
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:32,116
I just wanted them
to wake up one day

554
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,457
and not have to go in,

555
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,076
not have a job to do,
no bills to worry about.

556
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:40,113
And being a doctor seemed like

557
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:43,133
the hardest, best
thing I could become.

558
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,947
I'd have the power to
change their lives and...

559
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:47,504
Did you?

560
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,427
Well, they died while
I was still a resident.

561
00:26:53,462 --> 00:26:56,814
They'd be proud if
they could see you now.

562
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,265
Look at you.

563
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,250
You're at the top of your game.

564
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,938
Well, I'm not done yet.

565
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:07,608
Look, I want Chastain to
handle the launch of your VNS

566
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:09,793
and-and I want us to negotiate

567
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:12,145
a financial relationship
that benefits us both.

568
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,340
I'm talking to several
CEOs who want the same.

569
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,167
Tonight? Enjoy the party.

570
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,703
I'm not ready to
make my decision.

571
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:27,594
They fixed his
leg, but get this:

572
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:30,513
Rhys's blood alcohol
actually rose during surgery.

573
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:31,943
He's telling the truth.
He's not drinking.

574
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,101
Which means to save his liver,

575
00:27:34,136 --> 00:27:35,530
we have to figure out
what's really going on.

576
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,520
And...?

577
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:37,771
There's no explanation.

578
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:40,858
And what? We've
been watching him.

579
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,837
The only thing he's put
in his mouth is licorice.

580
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,394
And?

581
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:53,287
Those vines...
They're pure sugar.

582
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:54,688
I'm gonna order an EGD.

583
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,141
You snowboarded down a volcano?

584
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:05,382
- Yeah, I did.
- How is that even a thing?

585
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,228
You're a hell of a
risk-taker. I respect that.

586
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,314
You guys ever take,
uh, adventure vacations?

587
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:10,854
Last year I went to Rwanda

588
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,855
to volunteer with
Partners in Health.

589
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:13,568
That's the kind
of vacation I like.

590
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:15,520
Yeah, he slept in a tent, made
friends with the village goat.

591
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:18,312
Yeah, they gave
him to me as a gift.

592
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:20,275
They had this whole amazing
ceremony and everything,

593
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,410
but obviously, I couldn't
take him with me.

594
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:23,517
Hmm. And when
Conrad left, they ate him.

595
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:24,518
No.

596
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:25,993
I don't like to talk
about that part.

597
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,692
Wait a second.
What's going on here?

598
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,373
<i>Mr. Robinson's arm had a clot.</i>

599
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,247
- Correct?
- Yes.

600
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,260
I suspected disseminated
intravascular coagulation.

601
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,418
It's a blood
disorder that causes

602
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:43,014
simultaneous
clotting and bleeding.

603
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:44,738
Why did you think DIC?

604
00:28:44,773 --> 00:28:46,935
The liver toxicity from
the supplements combined

605
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,770
with the traumatic injuries
from being trampled

606
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,405
used up his blood's
clotting factors.

607
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,190
His blood work
later confirmed it.

608
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:54,025
This is life-threatening,
correct?

609
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:55,098
It can be.

610
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,550
So you alerted your attending?

611
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:58,051
I did not alert my attending

612
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:00,570
because Mr. Robinson was stable.

613
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,806
The next step was
to remove the clot.

614
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:08,039
Continue advancing
the cath to the cloth.

615
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:11,698
And this is where we
confirm placement?

616
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:14,368
Yes. Inject contrast.

617
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:16,253
Once we get this clot,

618
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,266
we'll go down and
get the one in your leg.

619
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,617
So, you're saying
what's wrong with me

620
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,124
was caused by my supplements?

621
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,709
Aspirating.

622
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:24,778
Ah, it's an easy mistake.

623
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,274
Supplements are
completely unregulated.

624
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,809
People hear "natural"
and they think safe.

625
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,513
Good.

626
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,812
- So what's next?
- I want to monitor you

627
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,153
on low-dose heparin before you
go back to conquering the world.

628
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:41,962
Thanks, man.
You're a great doctor.

629
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:46,266
And if any of y-y-you...

630
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:48,569
What's happening?

631
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:49,748
Slurred speech.
Right-sided weakness.

632
00:29:49,772 --> 00:29:51,449
There might be
another clot in his brain.

633
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,473
We need to get him to CT now.

634
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,267
How you doing, Josh?

635
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,603
Okay, one more minute.

636
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,433
Josh's heart rate's slowing.

637
00:30:08,457 --> 00:30:10,757
His respirations are irregular.

638
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,872
And severe hypertension.
Cushing's triad.

639
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:18,348
That's not a clot.

640
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:20,016
That's a massive hemorrhage.

641
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,332
He needs surgical
decompression. Page Neurosurgery.

642
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:29,208
- He's starting to seize.
- His ICP's going up.

643
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:32,690
- Where's Dr. Jacobs?
- In a resection.

644
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:34,114
It'll be another ten minutes.

645
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:37,034
No, that's too late.
We need him now.

646
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,536
- Left pupil's blown.
- He'll never make it.

647
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:44,302
How long did you
wait for Dr. Jacobs?

648
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:47,127
The CTs show that
Mr. Robinson's hemorrhage

649
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:49,082
would have rendered
him brain-dead.

650
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,638
We have a right to know how
long Dr. Hawkins waited for Neuro

651
00:30:57,673 --> 00:30:59,713
before taking matters
into his own hands.

652
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:06,647
It was an emergency. He
wasn't watching a clock.

653
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:07,848
Ju... Move on.

654
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,083
The burr should've
been performed

655
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,735
by a trained
neurosurgeon in the OR,

656
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,392
not a third-year in the hallway,

657
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:21,423
where my client was more
likely to contract the meningitis

658
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:23,091
that would put him on
a long road to recovery.

659
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,065
I had done them in Afghanistan.

660
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,394
You're not on a
battlefield, Dr. Hawkins.

661
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:27,512
Now answer the question.

662
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,136
Seconds?

663
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:33,707
Think back.

664
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:35,959
How long did you wait?

665
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,132
- How long...?
- I didn't.

666
00:31:57,232 --> 00:31:58,793
Scrapings from
your stomach lining

667
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,795
stained positive for an
overgrowth of fungus.

668
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:03,069
Something called A.B.S.

669
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:04,737
I have abs?

670
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,389
Auto-brewery syndrome.

671
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,959
Sounds fun, but
I'm guessing it's not.

672
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:12,445
One cause of A.B.S. is
consuming so much alcohol

673
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:15,615
in the past that yeast
builds up in the stomach.

674
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:18,635
That yeast now turns
carbs into alcohol.

675
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:20,887
I'm making beer inside me?

676
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:24,257
Yeah, and these were making it
worse because sugars are carbs.

677
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,793
Well, they ought to
put that on the label.

678
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:28,645
We'll get you on an antifungal.

679
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:30,909
Cut carbs, stick to
meat and vegetables.

680
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:33,767
In a few hours, you'll
be sober again, for real.

681
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:35,819
Did you say, uh, low carbs

682
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:37,837
or no carbs?

683
00:32:52,454 --> 00:32:55,121
You can thank me later.

684
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:56,773
For?

685
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,953
For talking to Bell
tomorrow and persuading him

686
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,427
to send you home to my OR.

687
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:04,931
I don't want those hands
picking up any bad habits.

688
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:08,184
I'm fine where I am.

689
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,340
My mentor, Dr. Abe Benedict,

690
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:16,793
studied under DeBakey himself.

691
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,289
It's a sacred lineage,

692
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:21,297
a genealogy of giants,

693
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,366
and you belong in that line.

694
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:27,704
I'm not interested
in being in your

695
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,039
line of giants. I am the first

696
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,659

704
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,247
You all right?

705
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:13,917
Yeah.

706
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:18,421
I was pretty far gone
before I met Tony.

707
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:22,225
Honestly, I don't think
he thought I'd make it.

708
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:25,027
He couldn't get through to me,

709
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,081
but in the end, my fans did.

710
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:32,719
I started getting all these
tweets and DMs, letters.

711
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:36,256
I never realized
how much they cared.

712
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,609
Saved my life.

00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,062

hurt at the park today.

714
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:46,616
Accidents happen.
It's not your fault.

715
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,046
I just wanted so badly

716
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,053
to hit that stage again,

717
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,440
to feel that crowd out there.

718
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:57,777
People who actually
came to hear me play...

719
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,746
I let them down.

720
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:02,131
No. No, you didn't.

721
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,835
Feels like it.

722
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,765
- Dr. Okafor's a natural.
- Give her a week.

723
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,466
She'll be missing

724
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,985
the delicate artistry of
our body's vital organs.

725
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:27,073
- You're worried I'll ruin her.
- She's an artist,

726
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:30,410
likely to become one of the
great cardiothoracic surgeons

727
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:33,163
of her generation.

728
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,532
Don't take that from her.

729
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,348
Did you ever think
maybe the best decision

730
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,506
is her decision?

731
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,022
You said we're
going to the cafeteria.

732
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:02,442
I lied. I had a better idea.

733
00:36:02,477 --> 00:36:04,705
Because this hospital was
founded on a simple idea:

734
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,330
improve the health
and well-being

735
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,499
of Atlanta, and today,

736
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:11,211
Chastain's commitment
to this community

737
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,119
is as strong as ever,

738
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:15,788
which is why we are
forgiving the medical bills

739
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:18,636
of every single patient of ours

740
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,127
who's been affected
by this tragedy.

741
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:24,096
And we're asking all Atlanta
hospitals to do the same.

742
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:33,506
And we have a really
special surprise for you.

Mr. Rhys, I'm
Dr. Bell. Thank you.

They're all yours.

What do you think?

746
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:46,703
Good enough place
for a comeback?

747
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,772
You've earned it.

748
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:57,063
I know some of you

749
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,615

and you're-you're hurting.

750
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:05,088

I broke a rule to save a life,

But we are both fighters.
We will win this your way, son.

00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:38,767
And I will be with you

00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,668
I get it.

815
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:15,338
A doctor saves you,
you come home grateful,

816
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:18,824
but rehab gets
hard, money dries up

817
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,827
and your future
doesn't look like

818
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:23,295
you hoped it would.
Soon, the doctor

819
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,266
who stuck his neck
out to save your ass

820
00:41:26,301 --> 00:41:27,861
starts to represent
an opportunity.

821
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,802
It's not personal.

822
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:32,638
It is for me. Conrad's my son.

823
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:35,841
So here's what happens next.

824
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:40,680
I am having a nondisclosure
agreement drawn up as we speak.

825
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:43,032
It will be delivered
to you within the hour,

826
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,151
along with a generous check.

827
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:48,203
It is an off-the-record
settlement

828
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,524
that Conrad will
never know about.

829
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:53,042
You will sign it.

830
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,879
My son will be in the
cafeteria getting a coffee

831
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:58,130
before his next shift.

832
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:01,200
You are going to go
find him, apologize,

833
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:05,221
tell him you will not
be taking a dime,

834
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,390
shake his hand, and leave.

835
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,392
- And if I don't?
- Mr. Robinson,

836
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:13,229
I am a man of almost
unlimited means,

837
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:15,514
and I will use them
to keep you in court

838
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,067
the rest of your natural life.

839
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,519
Now, you seem like a nice kid.

840
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:23,722
I would hate to see
you broke, on the street,

841

buried in legal bills
you cannot afford to pay.

842
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:29,662
Because the truth is,

843
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:33,749
you can't win a
lawsuit that never ends.

844
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:38,704
So, the next time
someone saves your life,

845
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:41,557
just... say thank you.
