- We all need to find our people.
<i>- They were awesome.</i>

135
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,431
Didn't act like I was
different from them,

136
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,168
with their normal
homes, normal families.

137
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:28,352

140
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,794

have been pretty special.

144
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,856
But I liked him so much.

145
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,537
So much that I kind of
stopped hanging with my bros.

146
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:54,062
Oh, it happens.

147
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:56,531
We all get wrapped up
when we're in a relationship.

148
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,428
Yeah, well, I got
a little extreme.

149
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:02,370
I ignored them until Jonathan
ghosted me for a barista.

150
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:05,207
So then I had no
boyfriend and no homies.

151
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:07,391
That's why I asked
them to go camping.

152
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,255
I thought I could get
back in with them.

153
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,973
But the moment we
got to our campsite,

154
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,981

me about everything.

156
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,118

No major bleeding.

Does have a grade II
splenic lac, but it's stable.

160
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:26,255
That still doesn't explain
how he lost so much blood.

161
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,407
Two to three liters, at least.

00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,500
Man, you're good at
dealing with those patients.

178
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:08,319
Eh, she likes to feel needed.

179
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,507
Look, I know we're just
colleagues, which I respect,

180
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,875
but am I allowed to
ask about your sister?

181
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,478
Of course. I don't
have an answer.

182
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,164
Are you okay?

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,143
Well, I found out my blood's
a match, waiting to see

184
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,801
if my father's is. I got
my CT this morning.

185
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,386
Should get results soon.

186
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,455
Who's going with you... Conrad?

187
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,707
He doesn't know about it.

188
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,527
It's fine. I don't
want to talk about it.

189
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,528
Absolutely.

190
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:37,065
Not my business.

191
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,847
We're giving him
supplemental oxygen,

192
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:44,238
but his O2 sats keep going down.

193
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,975
Why is it so hard to breathe?

194
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,156
These are normal
red blood cells.

195
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,563
These are fragments of
cells that have burst open,

196
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,849
and these are cells
that are sickled.

197
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,929
That combination is making
it so you don't have enough

198
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,404
red blood cells to carry the
oxygen throughout your body.

199
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,857
But I've never been diagnosed
with sickle cell disease.

200
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,921
That's 'cause I think
you've got a sickle cell trait.

201
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,422
It's usually asymptomatic
unless there are

202
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,946
major bodily stressors.

203
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,548
Like in your case, severe
altitude and dehydration.

204
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,717
Dr. Hawkins. The
blood bank just called.

205
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,072
They have one unit of
blood available for our patient.

206
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,073
Tell them to send that now,

207
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,769
- but that's still
not gonna be enough.
- Okay.

208
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,033
Could we get a little help
with transport in here?

209
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,080
We're gonna take a little
trip down to the basement.

210
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,485
All right. Here we go.

211
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,721
Contacted Atlanta General.
We're all in the same boat.

212
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,362
Postpone elective surgeries,

213
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,626
- encourage employee donations...
- Dr. Bell!

214
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,566
Dr. Bell! 911! 911!

215
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:47,068
My mom is in the ER!

216
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:49,237
I repeat, my mom is in the ER!

217
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,991
That's all you, bro.

218
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,442
So how long has
this been going on?

219
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,562
Well, redness and
swelling for a few days.

220
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:04,919
I thought it was age or
weather or something.

221
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:07,955
But then I slipped in
the shower and twisted it.

222
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,592
And now it's really bad.

223
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,121
Go ahead, Dr. Bell.
We're all adults here.

224
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,856
We all know you
two did the deed,

225
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,359
- so just don't make it weird. Just examine her.
- Grayson? Grayson?

226
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,566
Please? Thank you.

227
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,352
Grayson.

228
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,856
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

229
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,993
Your mother is gonna
need a specialist.

230
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,361
Who's the ER
ortho consult today?

231
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,979
Right here, just finished.

232
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,581
Hello.

233
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,617
- Morning.
- I'm Dr. Kit Voss.

234
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:37,685
Vivian Betournay.
Nice to meet you.

235
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,321
I, uh, slipped in the shower.

236
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,818
I'll have handrails put in.

237
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,653
- I know a guy.
- Y-You know my assistant,

238
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,978
um... Vivian is, um,
Grayson's mother.

239
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,981
- Mm.
- Dr. Voss is one of our
very best physicians.

240
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,777
Thank you, Randolph.

241
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,983
Let's get an X-ray, and
then I'm going to need

242
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,773
to get an arthrocentesis.

243
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:00,875
Fritz...

244
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,194
this hyperbaric chamber
is gonna pressurize,

245
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,314
just like when a submarine
dives underwater.

246
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,300
Increasing pressure's
gonna allow extra oxygen

247
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,685
to dissolve into your blood.

248
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,571
How long will I be in here?

249
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,190
Till we can get more
blood for a transfusion.

250
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,292
This hood is gonna
give you pure oxygen.

251
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:19,888
Nurse Robert will stay with you.

252
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,174
There's a tech outside,
page me if anything changes.

253
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,315
You good?

254
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,034
All right, I'm gonna
take that as a yes.

255
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:28,887
Dive time.

256
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,845
Ready?

257
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,800
Take him down to 60 feet.

258
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,390
- Who's coming tonight?
- Anyone who wants a beer

259
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,013
and to complain about Chastain.

260
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,398
It keeps us sane.

261
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,678
- Irving?
- Always.

262
00:11:58,702 --> 00:12:00,684
- Conrad?
- Not unless Nic comes

263
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,514
and she has a lot with
her sister right now,

264
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,300
- so probably not.
- Hmm. Raptor.

265
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,524
Unclear. Maybe he'll bring
that woman from this morning.

266
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,343
Are you here for Mr. Harper?

267
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,346
Shira Smook, anesthesiologist.

268
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:13,515
Just came over from
Coburn Civic Med.

269
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,049
Mina Okafor, surgical resident.

270
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:18,052
Devon Pravesh,
intern. By the way,

271
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,865
I called the blood bank
about Mr. Harper's surgery

272
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:22,223
and they still have ten
units of type A positive.

273
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:24,642
Are you sure it wasn't a typo?

274
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,695
Type O, typo.

275
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,632
Sorry, bad jokes, they keep
the lambs from screaming.

276
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,495
- Everybody needs something.
- Exactly.

277
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,404
I'll be in Mr. Harper's
OR with you, Dr. Okafor.

278
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,801
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Mr. Harper does not. He wishes

279
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,808
he were anywhere else but here.

280
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,310
- How am I looking, doctors?
- We had hoped

281
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,552
the bowel obstruction
would resolve on its own.

282
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:52,514
Unfortunately, it has
become emergent.

283
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,805
You need an operation.

284
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,723
So, no way I'm gonna

285
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,686
make it to the
convention this weekend?

286
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,811
It's<i> nut</i> looking good.

287
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,381
Sorry.

288
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:09,904
Where's your partner in crime?

289
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:12,251
Grayson went to get snacks.

290
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:13,753
Have my results come in?

291
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:15,760
Vivian...

292
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,328
you have gonorrhea.

293
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,094
Remember, I'm the knee patient.

294
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:25,586
The knee? Uh, my vagina is fine.

295
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:27,650
The disease can travel
through your bloodstream

296
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,674
and infect your joints.

297
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,642
Although gonorrhea
is transmitted

298
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,260
through sexual intercourse,

299
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:36,631
it can be asymptomatic
until it shows up elsewhere.

300
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,965
As it did here.

301
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:40,651
Bright side, all you
need are antibiotics

302
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,950
and a washout in the
OR under mild sedation.

303
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:46,473
Well, I would rather have
the traditional gonorrhea,

304
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,443
you know, the vagina kind.

305
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:51,929
That never gets amputated.

306
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:57,351
You know, for the
record, it's been, uh,

307
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:59,248
it's been more than
six months since I was,

308
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,722
- uh, with her...
- I'm sure you're fine.

309
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,524
I could run a test.

310
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,526
No...

311
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,516
Lindsay.

312
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,484
Here you go.

313
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,469
Dr. Bell.

314
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,388
Brett.

315
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,357
How can I help you?

316
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,175
I'm getting out tomorrow, right?

317
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,437
Yeah, I hope so.
I'm sure you want

318
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,873
to get away from
all these doctors.

319
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,541
To tell the truth, I'm
not actually trying

320
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,376
to get away from<i>
all</i> the doctors.

321
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,683
You know... Kit and me...

322
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,152
Things are looking up.

323
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:34,271
Oh, really?

324
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,842
I know, right? Later-in-life
romantic reunion?

325
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,506
We should be a Hallmark movie.

326
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:43,247
We've got plans this weekend.

327
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,833
So... if you can
spring me early...

328
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:48,702
- I'll check your chart.
- Thank you.

329
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,794
I told you you
didn't have to come.

330
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,380
Oh, I'm happy to be here.

331
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,815
This is tough stuff.

332
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,363
I've seen other people navigate
the organ donation process.

333
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:06,854
It's... a lot.

334
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,701
Nic Nevin?

335
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:11,392
We reviewed the images
from this morning's CT scan.

336
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:13,439
It shows that you have
an arterial anomaly

337
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:15,713
- with your kidney.
- What kind of anomaly?

338
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,197
An abnormal additional artery.

339
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,094
Now, it's not dangerous
and it doesn't affect

340
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,651
Miss Nevin's day-to-day life,

341
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,286
but it does disqualify her

342
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,956
from being a donor. I-I'm sorry.

343
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,980
There are other ways. I
can start making some calls.

344
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,394
See about getting Jessie into
a different transplant program.

345
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:36,951
Yeah.

346
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:38,936
Thanks for coming.

347
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:52,349
Hi.

348
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:55,081
Your assistant's mother
has septic arthritis.

349
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,171
I've scheduled her
a washout in the OR.

350
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:00,158
Well, thank you very
much for taking care of her.

351
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,993
I checked Brett's chart

352
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,424
and he's happy to be
going home tomorrow...

353
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,631
with you.

354
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,868
Brett wants us to try again.

355
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,371
Oh. And do you want that?

356
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:17,108
I'm leaning in that direction.

357
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,628
Well, I just... it sounds like
you'd be very happy with him.

358
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,780
I'm leaning.

359
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,099
I'm not there.

360
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:26,950
Interesting.

361
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,870
Dr. Bell!

362
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,203
Dr. Bell.

363
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,356
Did you give my mom gonorrhea?

364
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,058
What, you gonna hit me?

365
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,946
No.

366
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:40,481
No, I'm a... I'm a pacifist.

367
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,389
Here, wait, let me...

368
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,421
So, Dr. Pravesh will take
you to pre-op in about an hour

369
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,474
and I will meet you
in the operating room.

370
00:16:55,498 --> 00:16:57,648
I-I guess there's
no way that I could

371
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,416
stay in costume for the surgery.

372
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,096
- Is there?
- It's not sterile.

373
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,649
- Okay. Would you mind, then?
- Yeah.

374
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,556
It's a shame,

375
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,508
I-I was really looking forward
to the convention this year.

376
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,194
Is it a, um...

377
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:12,880
squirrel convention?

378
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,715
No, no, no, no.

379
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,996
There's rabbits, too,
and, um, chipmunks.

380
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,586
Uh, the occasional weasel.

381
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,833
Almost all the rodents
are represented.

382
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:22,685
Yeah, people-people
think it's a sex thing,

383
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,308
but it's not.

384
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,912
I'm sorry you can't go.

385
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,908
Well, it's the one time
a year when I actually

386
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:31,749
get to be with people who are...

387
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,584
you know, like me.

388
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,254
Dr. Okafor?

389
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,235
I just came from blood
bank, they're down

390
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,019
- to four units of A positive.
- Oh, don't worry.

391
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:43,022
One of those is
ours. I put one on hold

392
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,907
- for Mr. Harper's surgery.
- Okay, good.

393
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,915
Then... we don't need to
throw in the<i> bowel</i> just yet.

394
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:52,303
Throw in the bowel? That...

395
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,771
that really is terrible.

396
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,840
Well, thanks.

397
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,760
Okay, this one laughed at that.

398
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,563
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, come on. She's funny.

399
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,260
Uh-huh. I see what's happening.

400
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,084
You know, I may just be a
guy getting out of a squirrel suit,

401
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,769
but I'll tell you this:

402
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:10,755
that doctor was
flirting with you.

403
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,668
- No, she's not.
- Oh, no, I agree

404
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,908
with our patient...
Her joke was a flirt joke

405
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:16,805
and your laugh...
was a flirt laugh.

406
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,246
- No, it wasn't.
- Uh-huh. I approve.

407
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,326
You know, look, we're
all weird in our own way,

408
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,051
but if you can find someone
whose weird matches your own,

409
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,003
I say go for it.

410
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,321
Well, I do not approve.

411
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,057
At least not until she
comes up with better jokes.

412
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:31,225
All right. Lay back.

413
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:33,611
Okay. Ow.

414
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,496
Thanks for the latte.

415
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,176
Thanks for being here.

416
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,835
Look.

417
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,082
Things are about to get tough.

418
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:46,640
We don't know when or
if Jessie's getting a kidney

419
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:49,343
and dialysis is hard even
when there are no complications,

420
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:53,097
and there are almost
always complications.

421
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,082
Are you trying to scare me away?

422
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:56,751
No, I need to make sure

423
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:58,797
that you're not gonna run
when things get harder.

424
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,705
Jessie didn't even finish rehab,

425
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,140
I'm just...

426
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,226
I'm worried this is
all too much for her.

427
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,864
Nic, I...

428
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,304
Why don't we just put
all this aside for a minute?

429
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,673
Hmm?

430
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,709
What about you?

431
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:23,995
I'm fine.

432
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,841
- Let's just focus on Jessie.
- No.

433
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,364
You're not fine.

434
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,749
That's why I'm here.

435
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,969
I knew that you'd
put everything aside

436
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,082
to take care of your
sister, like you always do.

437
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,834
Of course I would.
What else would I do?

438
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,658
Are you sleeping? At all?

439
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,044
You were still awake when
I went to bed last night,

440
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,680
you were the first one up.
Plus Conrad. Jessie said

441
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,715
you're having
problems with him, too.

442
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,371
Look...

443
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:52,739
your sister got here

444
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,226
because of her bad decisions.

445
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,195
Addiction is a disease.
She didn't ask for this.

446
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,080
Neither did you.

447
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:05,535
And I'm here for you, too.

448
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,390
So I want you to
just hang in there

449
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,559
until we get my results.

450
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:13,444
If I'm a match...

451
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,462
we're golden.

452
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:23,732
Should I bring the
patient back up?

453
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,939
No, we take him
out of the chamber,

454
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,570
he won't have enough
circulating oxygen to survive.

455
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,194
Hey. Hang on, I'm coming in.

456
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,381
Oh, God, it hurts!

457
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,369
Talk to me.

458
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,866
<i>Abdominal pain.</i>

459
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,774
And his pressure just dropped.

460
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,644
- Where is the pain, exactly?
<i>- Left upper quadrant.</i>

461
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,541
<i>Okay, give him 50 of
fentanyl, set up the ultrasound.</i>

462
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,032
<i>Fritz? Keep breathing.</i>

463
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:52,766
In...

464
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,968
out.

465
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,303
In...

466
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,440
<i>out.</i>

467
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,158
In...

468
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,032
Push another 50 of fentanyl.

469
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,737
There's free fluid
around the spleen.

470
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,577
His injury's getting worse.

471
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,014
He's gonna bleed
out. Page Dr. Austin.

472
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,169
We need to get this
spleen out of Fritz now!

473
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,265
It's a little tight in here.

474
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,683
What, you couldn't find
a less convenient place

475
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,585
for surgery, Dr. Hawkins?

476
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:36,255
- Was the surface of the sun
already booked?
- Give it a minute,

477
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,923
it grows on you.

478
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:41,332
Ah, the best filtered
air outside of an OR.

479
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:44,952
Nurse Pund.

480
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,454
You turn that Bovie on
in here, we could all go up

481
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,423
like Roman candles.
Pop, pop, pow.

482
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,691
In this chamber, you
can't use anything

483
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,722
that could cause a
spark, so no Bovies.

484
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,774
And no defibrillators, either.

485
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:57,932
If he codes, we can't
shock him back to life.

486
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,217
No worries. These magical
babies will make sure

487
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,604
nothing happens to our
forest-wandering friend.

488
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,089
10 blade.

489
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,147
That's Chastain's last bag.

490
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,302
Okay.

491
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,904
So we can't lose
any blood at all.

492
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:35,902
There's a small perf
in this dead bowel.

493
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,149
Mr. Harper's going to
have significant discomfort

494
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:38,484
from the peritonitis.

495
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:40,151
I'll make sure we
have the pain meds.

496
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:41,487
How much longer
you think it'll be?

497
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:43,438
Maybe about 20
minutes until we close.

498
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,313
Great, his backup
IV line just blew.

499
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:47,931
I'd hate to start another one

500
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,761
- if it's just going to be...
- Don't say it.

501
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,868
In vein.

502
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:53,916
Fine, you don't appreciate

503
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,540
a pun, I can respect
that, not everyone does.

504
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,042
All I'm saying is,

505
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:02,146
if he really needed to<i>
squirrel</i> away some<i> nuts...</i>

506
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:09,419
What's that sound?

507
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:17,912
I've-I've never heard
Dr. Okafor laugh before.

508
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,799
It's unsettling.

509
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,969
Yes, it is.

510
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,857
I was not expecting that.

511
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,422
If I'd known nerve blocks

512
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,274
killed all feeling
so effectively,

513
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:37,697
I would've gotten one when
I married Grayson's father.

514
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:40,200
- You don't feel this at all?
- No, nothing.

515
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:41,916
Here we go, then.

516
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:47,258
How is Grayson? Seemed
a little upset earlier.

517
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,487
Well, you know,

518
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:52,212
I'm sure it's not easy
watching your parents fall apart.

519
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:54,393
- Do you have children?
- Two.

520
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,816
I'm not with
their father either.

521
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,064
Well, that's how it goes.

522
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:00,721
That's not always how it goes.

523
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:02,117
You're young. You don't know.

524
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:05,904
At first, you're in love
and planning for the future.

525
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:09,079
Next, you're having your
cheating husband's STD

526
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,680
drained from your knee.

527
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,811
- Could be worse.
- There is no way.

528
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:15,080
The gonorrhea could've
infected your eye.

529
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,654
Pus literally dripping
from your eyeball

530
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,856
and running down your face.

531
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,625
Oh! You win. That's
disgusting. Oh, my God.

532
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,445
Ugh, more than anything,

533
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:28,299
I just can't believe
that I'm here, at my age.

534
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,978
I'm right there
with you, sister.

535
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,430
Was your marriage
as bad as mine?

536
00:24:31,454 --> 00:24:33,765
Marriages, actually.

537
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:36,323
Two. And no, they weren't.

538
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:38,592
At least, the first one wasn't.

539
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:40,177
He was actually a decent guy.

540
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:41,878
Should've held on to him.

541
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,148
Maybe I should have.

542
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,984
Maybe it's too late now.

543
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,947
Well, a smart surgeon

544
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:52,606
like you... I'm sure
you have other options.

545
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:54,682
I think I do.

546
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:59,946
Hey. I dropped
Jessie off at dialysis

547
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:02,182
a while ago, what's going on?

548
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,090
You're not a match.

549
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,480
Did you bring my meds?

550
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:24,471
<i>Dr. Kennedy to triage.</i>

551
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:26,840
Those anti-craving strips

552
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,795
aren't working
anymore. I-I just...

553
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,027
Still want to use.

554
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:35,315
So bad.

555
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:37,317
That'll get better, Jess.

556
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:40,437
I'll up your dose. You got this,

557
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,372
- I promise.
- Nic, if I couldn't

558
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,035
stay off drugs when
my life was good,

559
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:46,076
how am I supposed to do it now?

560
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,235
- Dad's pulling the car around.
- Great.

561
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:00,908
These short gastrics
are killing me.

562
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,187
Can we call the
blood bank again?

563
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:04,895
I just touched
base. Still nothing.

564
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:07,514
He's getting acidotic.
There's not enough oxygen

565
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:09,830
- delivery to his tissues.
- I need more hands.

566
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,952
Hawkins, get Okafor in here now.

567
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,222
I'm on it.

568
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:18,141
- Take them down to 100 feet.
- That's pretty deep.

569
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,579
I'm buying us some time.

570
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:27,979
I'm sorry, but we're just all
out right now. If you could just

571
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,898
have a seat, we'll be
with you. Thank you.

572
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,500
Uh, if you're here about
one of the transplants

573
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:33,818
that got pushed, nothing I can
do about it, we're out of blood.

574
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,876
No, no, um, I was here this
morning about a kidney donation.

575
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:38,928
- Last name?
- Nevin.

576
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:43,845
- Jessie?
- Yeah.

577
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,109
Sorry, nothing I can do
until the donor calls back

578
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,822
- to schedule his follow-up.
- The donor?

579
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,940
Uh, Kyle Nevin. We
can't move forward

580
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,443
with the intake
until he does that.

581
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,646
- Kyle's a match?
- Right, but like I said,

582
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,743
we can't move ahead until
he calls for the follow-up.

583
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:59,816
- Is there anything else?
- No, thanks.

584
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,342
- Fogarty clamp.
- He's not clotting.

585
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,256
Pressure's dropping.

586
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,008
<i>His organs are shutting down.</i>

587
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,281
Would it help if we dive deeper?

588
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,001
No, increasing the pressure
can only do so much.

589
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,031
If we don't get real blood
into him, he's gonna code.

590
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,139
- He's dying
right in front of us.
- Take me down

591
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,625
- as fast as you can.
- They're at 100 feet.

592
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,639
If I drop you down
that far too fast, it'll put

593
00:27:27,663 --> 00:27:30,013
- too much stress on your body...
- Do it anyway.

594
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,675
♪ ♪

595
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:14,824
<i>- More bicarb.
- It won't work.</i>

596
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,093
<i>Without more blood,
he's going to die.</i>

597
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:21,348
I'm O negative, universal donor.

598
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,918
- Sylvie, help me out.
- Didn't you just donate?

599
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,854
Another bag. That was only half.

600
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:29,334
Oh, okay, this
isn't the military.

601
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:31,086
Blood needs to be
screened for HIV,

602
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,027
- hepatitis...
- I'm clean. Trust me.

603
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:37,175
Chu. Hold up.

604
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,366
Now, I don't doubt
that your blood is clean,

605
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,868
but if he dies right now,
we are all legally protected.

606
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:43,120
Whereas if we put

607
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,438
your unprocessed blood
in him and then he dies...

608
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,373
So don't let him die.

609
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:54,547
All right. You heard the man.

610
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,216
Let's save this kid's life.

611
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,420
Knock, knock.

612
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,128
- Hey.
- Hey.

613
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,715
I heard the surgery
w-was a success.

614
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,718
How do you feel?

615
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,603
It's not my finest moment.

616
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:19,723
I-It could happen to anybody.

617
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,259
And, FYI, I got
tested, I'm clean,

618
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,439
so neither one of us
gave the other gonorrhea.

619
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:25,612
I know that.

620
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,464
It was my jackhole ex-husband.

621
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,801
But I get to tell him
that he has gonorrhea,

622
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,802
and that will be very fun.

623
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,174
Hey.

624
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:42,178
How about you?

625
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:45,599
Are you seeing
anybody right now?

626
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:47,684
Well, complicated, but no.

627
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,435
Really?

628
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,321
Well, you should...

629
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,507
'cause you're a decent guy.

630
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,443
And not awful in bed.

631
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,765
I started seeing
someone a few weeks ago.

632
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,517
He's sweet

633
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,120
and kind.

634
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:10,490
We're taking it slow...
Thank God... so no sex yet.

635
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:13,176
He's a lucky man.

636
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,764
You were good for me, Randolph,

637
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,816
at least for my ego.

638
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,771
It's only a matter of time

639
00:30:24,806 --> 00:30:27,507
until you find the one.

640
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:32,396
I don't know if that's in
the cards for a guy like me.

641
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:42,038
How you feeling, Hawkins?

642
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:45,125
If Fritz is good,
I'm feeling fine.

643
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:52,415
Fritz's "friends" are here.

644
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,917
Well, go.

645
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,720
<i>We're almost done here.</i>

646
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,839
Hey, yo.

647
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,677
Respect.

648
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:24,748
I'm, uh... feeling light-headed,

649
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:27,417
yet relaxed.

650
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:30,037
Like you've just
had a stiff martini?

651
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,455
Exactly.

652
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,851
Nitrogen narcosis.

653
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,243
Good ol' martini effect.

654
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:37,805
You know, I've
always heard about it.

655
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,062
I've never felt it.

656
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,114
It's fascinating, Mina.

657
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,550
Not at all unpleasant.

658
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:46,119
Gases at high pressures can...

659
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,865
cause temporary
disruption to nerve signaling,

660
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,107
impair judgment

661
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:51,758
and delayed response times.

662
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:55,077
It's rare, but it can
happen to anyone.

663
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,148
So, it's like you're drunk?

664
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,866
Yeah, pretty much.

665
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:02,819
All right, Okafor, I'm
gonna need you to finish

666
00:32:02,855 --> 00:32:05,021
closing up.

667
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,991
Thank you, Chu.

668
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,576
Whew.

669
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:14,548
So...

670
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:18,001
you were with a
woman this morning.

671
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:21,621
Uh, well, sometimes I'm
with women in the morning

672
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:23,773
and also the evening.

673
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,639
Wait, are you trying
to take advantage

674
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:32,115
- of my inebriation?
- Mm. Perhaps.

675
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,484
Only if it's working.

676
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,247
Cute.

677
00:32:36,271 --> 00:32:38,605
Well, that pretty
lady you speak of

678
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,991
was a liaison to
an adoption agency.

679
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,193
- Are you adopting a child?
- No.

680
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,696
No, I looked up
my birth parents.

681
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:48,832
Get this.

682
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:52,769
Bio Mom is a doctor.

683
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,933
What are the odds?

684
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:57,824
Turns out that was the problem.

685
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,387
She was in med school
when she got pregnant.

686
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,005
She wanted to
focus on her career,

687
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:03,195
so they decided to give me up.

688
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,816
Where are they now?

689
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,485
Right here in Atlanta.

690
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,281
Together, married,

691
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:11,704
three grown-ass kids.

692
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,205
The ones they didn't give away.

693
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,193
I guess old August Jeremiah

694
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,529
just showed up
at the wrong time.

695
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,236
Ooh.

696
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,545
Uh... Hey, hey,
hey. Shh, shh, shh.

697
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:38,381
- Jessie's sleeping...
- You haven't changed a damn bit.

698
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,011
It's not that you can't
give Jessie your kidney,

699
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:42,335
it's that you won't!

700
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,378
- Nic, it's complicated...
- Why can't you, for once...

701
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:54,013
For once... do something
that is not selfish?

702
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:57,484
There's a reason they don't
hand out kidneys to addicts.

703
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,102
They use again, they destroy

704
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:01,771
- perfectly good organs.
- She is your daughter.

705
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,252
- Okay, so maybe in-in
six months, a year...
- She might not last that long.

706
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:07,043
That's exactly my point!

707
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:10,029
Who's it gonna help if she
has my kidney inside of her

708
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:13,199
and she OD's?

709
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:18,254
Wow.

710
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,556
- I'm sorry, I...
- You didn't...

711
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,238
you didn't come here
to help either one of us.

712
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:27,047
You came here to
make yourself feel better

713
00:34:27,082 --> 00:34:29,465
for being a crappy
father our entire lives.

714
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,429
- That's why you're here.
- That's not fair,
and that's not right.

715
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:33,553
Get... out.

716
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:35,438
And don't come back.

717
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,759
Get out.

718
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:06,652
Is someone here
to see Fritz Rawlins?

719
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,288
Is Fritz okay?

720
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:11,424
- He will be.
- Look...

721
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,187
we weren't trying to make
him run away from us.

722
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,073
Yeah, we just wanted to get
some things off our chests, like how

723
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:17,108
it wasn't cool when he dropped
us to hang with Jonathan,

724
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:19,110
- so we told him that.
- And he got mad.

725
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:21,767
And then we got mad,
and then it got ugly.

726
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,514
Yeah, Fritz stomped
off, said he had to pee.

727
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,655
I-I guess we
should've been clear.

728
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,093
It's not about him
being with Jonathan.

729
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,308
I mean, we don't like him.
The guy's a schmuck...

730
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:34,943
Dude's a part of
our rival fraternity.

731
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,315
Fritz could do way better.

732
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,818
But we just missed our homie.

733
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,107
I'm pretty sure he
missed you, too.

734
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,704
Come on. I'll take you to him.

735
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:49,979
- Come on.
- Thanks... thanks, Doc.

736
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,621
Hey, Dr. Bell. I, uh...

737
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,657
I just wanted to
make sure we're chill.

738
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,376
You know, after-after our beef.

739
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,165
Can I still work here,
even after I almost hit you?

740
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:15,633
You know, Grayson, during the
course of your employment here,

741
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:19,175
I've had multiple
reasons to fire you.

742
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,461
Mostly for inappropriate
suggestions

743
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:24,146
of a personal nature, and for
your seeming inability to speak

744
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,000
in any manner that
even remotely resembles

745
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:28,517
the English language.

746
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,706
But...

747
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:36,226
defending your mother...
I'm not gonna fire you for that.

748
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,067
You're the dopest, Dr. B.

749
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,998
I'll s-see you tomorrow.

750
00:36:47,022 --> 00:36:50,006
No, uh... seriously,
look at you.

751
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,775
I mean, you're-you're
literally giving your blood

752
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,426
to help other people.

753
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,862
My pops would never do that.

754
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:57,647
He's only in it for himself.

755
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,845
That's why I liked the idea

756
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:03,369
of-of you hanging
out with my mom.

757
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:04,854
You're not like that.

758
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,450
I don't think you
know me very well.

759
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,875
I think I do.

760
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,293
You're one of the good ones.

761
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:12,345
You just keep it way deep down,

762
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:14,580
so people will think
you're a hard-ass.

763
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,618
Can we get a needle in this kid?

764
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,588
Oh.

765
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,778
- Hey, sleepy.
- Hi.

766
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:33,482
Apparently, dialysis makes
me take three-hour naps.

767
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,321
Where's Dad?

768
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,036
Right on schedule.

769
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,464
It's just you and me now, huh?

770
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,934
It's just us.

771
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,926
Good.

772
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,228
I like it better
that way anyway.

773
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,979
All right, Mr. Harper,
you're up for a milligram

774
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,169
of hydromorphone.

775
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,652
You don't need all of this.

776
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,234
Go ahead.

777
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,302
Go ahead what?

778
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,333
You took advantage
of my altered state,

779
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:05,341
and now you want to explore
the information that you gathered.

780
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,354
Oh, please. You
wanted to tell someone

781
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,261
about your biological parents.

782
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,883
Will you contact them?

783
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:16,318
I don't know.

784
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,588
I understand why
you would be upset.

785
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,091
I'm not upset.

786
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,327
I'm not angry, either.

787
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,180
Every day, I choose my
career over my personal life.

788
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,700
It must be in the DNA.

789
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:37,157
But if you wanted
to be angry at them,

790
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:39,209
that'd be okay with me.

791
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,762
Are you still drunk from
the hyperbaric chamber?

792
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,449
Maybe.

793
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:55,642
I can be angry for you.

794
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:06,485
Thank you.

795
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,982
Dr. Voss. Look, I
wanted to thank you

796
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:20,411
for taking care of
Grayson's mom.

797
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:23,135
And for your discretion.

798
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,573
Eh, what's a little
"gono-knee-ah" between friends?

799
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:29,425
- I, uh...
- And I liked her quite a bit.

800
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,412
- I understand the attraction.
- Well, to be clear,

801
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:35,748
that was... a
temporary situation.

802
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:38,484
Well, I certainly know
my way around those.

803
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:41,737
Um...

804
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,590
Look, I want to tell you...

805
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:46,225
you're not gonna screw it up.

806
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,946
Whatever you end up
doing, it'll be the right thing.

807
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:52,348
It'll be the good thing.

808
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,084
And if you don't

809
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,787
lean in that direction,

810
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,272
I'm here for you.

811
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,304
Okay.

812
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:05,194
Have a good night.

813
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,196
