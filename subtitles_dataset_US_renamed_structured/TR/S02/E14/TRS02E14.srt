One thing I'm a little sick of

47

is everyone asking
me, "How's your heart?"

48
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,094
I hear that.

49
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:54,779

50
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,349
It was still in the

00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,346
- Why are those here?
- Don't look at me.

52

They're for Gertie
down the hall.

53
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,157
It's a thank you for
taking Julian's cat.

54
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:07,203
Aw, Gertie's a good woman.
She deserves flowers.

55
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:11,163
As for me, I told Micah no
flowers, no cards, no candy.

56
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,293
- I'll walk you out.
- So I take it

57
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:15,945
you guys don't have
plans for tonight, then?

58
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,919
Oh, I don't do
corporate holidays.

59
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:20,706
Oh, she's crazy. I think all

Micah and I are right

dinner on Valentine's Day.

00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,031
Oh, is this Dr. Devon
I see with Miss Mina?

71
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,366
Hi, Gertie. I was actually
just coming to see you.

72
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,818
Thank you again
for taking Julian's cat.

73
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:53,171
Oh, please. Needy Pete's a joy.

74
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,990
That's what I'm calling the cat.

75
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:57,576
Little kitty can't
stand to be left alone.

76
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,878
Here. Gluten-free, dairy-free,

77
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:02,714
- sugar-free, still delicious.
- Hmm.

78
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,666
Secret recipe.

79
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,902
You come by and visit with
Pete and me any old time, okay?

80
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,005
Not on Tuesday afternoon.
That's Pilates day.

81
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,341
Wednesday and Thursday is yoga.

82
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,593
Monday and Friday is tap class.

83
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,607
Guess what I'm
saying is call me first.

84
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,080
You got it.

85
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,181
Thanks.

86
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,602
Hmm, I think she wants
to be your valentine.

87
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,103
Hilarious.

88
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,218
You'd make such a cute couple.

89
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,330
Happy VD, boss-man.

90
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:37,015
What do I have today?

91
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,383
Uh, couple of meetings,

92
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,963
and tonight that
black-tie fund-raiser.

93
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,570
Do you need a date for that?

94
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,233
Lots of lonely,
desperate ladies today.

95
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,741
No, Grayson.

96
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,943
Look, don't say I'm the
one that told you, but, uh,

97
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,912
the 'rents are
back on the rocks.

98
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:53,448
What?

99
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,284
My mom's mad at my dad again.
Maybe you can get back in there.

100
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,873
Grayson, for someone
in my position,

101
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,859
tonight's fund-raiser is as
necessary as it is boring.

102
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:06,555
And consequently,
I'll be going alone.

103
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,079
However, you may not be aware

104
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,725
that I have a
long-standing tradition

105
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,567
of spending "VD" with
a scalpel in my hand,

106
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:14,330
so I need you to book
back-to-back surgeries.

107
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,938
I don't care what the
specialty is, make that happen.

108
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,102
- You got it, boss-man.
- Don't call me boss-man.

109
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,886
- You got it, boss.
- Nope.

110
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,212
I got your text.

111
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:26,009
You know the last
person Julian called?

112
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,144
I tried that number
again on the way to work,

113
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,113
and I finally got a
person on the other line.

114
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:33,672
It's an FDA agent
named Mark Truscott.

115
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,752
He was the last person
that Julian called.

116
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,093
- Did he say why she called?
- No.

117
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:40,123
Did it have anything
to do with QuoVadis?

118
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,263
No. She wanted advice.

119
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,910
She was thinking
about changing careers.

120
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,695
I guess that makes sense,

121
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,864
given what she told you
about things being off at work.

122
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,738
Yeah, but Truscott
scheduled a meeting with her.

123
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,140
And she never showed.

124
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,175
That's very odd.

125
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,163
I don't even think the police
are looking for her anymore.

126
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,082
It's like everyone has moved on.

127
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,668
Except me.

128
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,927
What do you think we'll
see the most of today...

129
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,463
Suicide attempts or
proposals gone wrong?

130
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,865
- Such a cynic.
- How do proposals go wrong?

131
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,645
You know, hot-air
balloon mishaps,

132
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,370
accidentally drinking engagement
rings in champagne glasses,

133
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,940
people doing stupid
things in the name of love.

134
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,952
See, that's why it's
better to do stupid things

135
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,896
- in the name of sex.
- Hear, hear.

136
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,299
Hmm.

137
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,616
You know you're supposed
to read those first, right?

138
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:43,057
"Wink, wink." High
literature indeed.

139
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,496
I ordered some
special ones online.

140
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:49,976
Just for you, Irving.

141
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:56,237
Um, I think HR would discourage
me from reading these out loud.

142
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,748
What are you doing?

143
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,261
Well, I figure if
I'm going to accept

144
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,946
a fortune from a
stale piece of sugar,

145
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,405
I should at least have
control over what it says.

146
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,223
Oh, look at that.

147
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,325
- "Real love."
- Yeah, don't bother.

148
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,060
Another one with the cynicism.

149
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,006
Listen, bruh,
instead of focusing on

150
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,059
resentment over what
we currently do not have,

151
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,594
let's use today
as an opportunity

152
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:25,900
to celebrate what's to come.

153
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,956
AJ Austin, doctor of love.

154
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,889
70-year-old female found
unconscious and asystolic.

155
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:37,579
A neighbor initiated CPR.

156
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:40,632
She's been down for
30 minutes. Still no pulse.

157
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,867
All right, stop compressions,
hold ventilations.

158
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,269
Gertie.

159
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,392
Time of death: 9:06.

160
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,564
She was fine an hour ago.

161
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,431
How did she die?

162
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:00,902
♪ ♪

163
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,394
I only stayed
there a little while,

164
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:18,586
but still, Gertie remembered
everything about me.

165
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:21,956
She delivered cookies
for all the holidays.

166
00:07:21,992 --> 00:07:24,910
She acted like
everyone's mother.

167
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,939
Except in a good way.

168
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:29,681
She once told me that
the boys used to call her...

169
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,917
Flirty Gertie.

170
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:35,804
Dr. Okafor and Dr. Pravesh.

171
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,589
This is Gertie's niece, Nora.

172
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,991
It's nice to meet you
both. Is Aunt Gertie okay?

173
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,943
Uh, please, have a seat.

174
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,340
Gertie was found unconscious
in her apartment building.

175
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,292
Someone called 911,
and the paramedics did

176
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,478
everything they
could to revive her...

177
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:03,048
but your aunt died.

178
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,805
We are so sorry for your loss.

179
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,317
Damn it.

180
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,354
Of course. Of course she
died, today of all days. Damn it.

181
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,659
Now what?

182
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,723
Well, you were listed
as her next of kin.

183
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,013
Great. So who do I need to call?

184
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,299
Funeral home? Cremation place?

185
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:40,585
Chastain social workers
can help with all of that.

186
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,347
If there's someone
else you need to notify,

187
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:44,250
like other family members,
they can help with that, too.

188
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,775
There is no one else.
I'm her only living relative.

189
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,548
How long until the
insurance money kicks in?

190
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:56,150
Look, I know that she was sweet
to everyone else, but with me,

191
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:57,919
it was judge, judge, judge.

192
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,039
She hated every guy that I
brought home, every damn one.

193
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,357
But this time, I thought
she might like him.

194
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,371
He's nice, no kids, owns
a bike shop in Portland.

195
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:07,023
I don't make a lot
as a telemarketer,

196
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,175
so I was coming over
today to ask Gertie for money

197
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:10,898
to help me move to be with him,

198
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,096
and I don't know if she
would have said yes, but...

199
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,335
Doesn't matter.

200
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,215
This is giving me another
one of my headaches.

201
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,890
Where's the, um...
the death certificate?

202
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,543
We don't have the cause
of death yet to list on it.

203
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,945
She's gone. Say she
died from being old.

204
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,581
Calling the cremation
place to come pick her up,

205
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:28,616
so give me that
death certificate ASAP.

206
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,281
Your ortho consult's in Bay Two.

207
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,201
Chet Aiken, 26-year-old male,
single, motor vehicle accident.

208
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:48,536
Ugh. Boys and their cars.

209
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,611
Yeah. I had to put
him behind a curtain.

210
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,490
He was freaking people out.

211
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:55,393
License and registration.

212
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,029
They said a doctor
had to get it off me.

213
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,033
Well, that's true.

214
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,887
Looks like a clean impalement.

215
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:09,390
- Hold the door.
- Hmm?

216
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,576
- Think of England.
- What?

217
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,662
Mmm!

218
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,297
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

219
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:18,745
Had to be done.

220
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:22,081
You're lucky you didn't
hit any bone or arteries.

221
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:25,089
- Do you have any neck pain?
- No.

222
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,459
You were the driver, right?
How fast were you going?

223
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,945
Um, I don't know. I couldn't
see the speedometer.

224
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:33,798
How did the door
end up in this position?

225
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,767
These look like
seat belt abrasions,

226
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,181
but they're on the
back of your neck.

227
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,621
Did the airbags deploy?

228
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:42,356
I don't see any facial
bruising or lacerations.

229
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,657
I-It happened so fast.

230
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:46,611
She was fine, but
my-my seat belt wasn't on.

231
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,224
You had a passenger?
Is she here?

232
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,314
No. She didn't want to come.

233
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,701
I mean, we didn't know
each other that well.

234
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,537
You weren't driving in the car.

235
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,723
Her profile was awesome.

236
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,693
Like, so awesome that I thought
I might be getting catfished.

237
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,345
Her name even
sounds fake pretty.

238
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,831
- Bella. Am I right?
- Mm.

239
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,283
And then I meet her,

240
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:10,334
and she's as hot
as she is online

241
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,570
and funny and smart,

242
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,489
and she asked me to get
coffee today, on Valentine's Day,

243
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:18,042
so, I mean, she must
like me, too, right?

244
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,044
She must like a part of you.

245
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,915
And then after coffee,
we ended up in my car.

246
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,151
But not-not out in the
open. We're not animals.

247
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,754
But one of us hit
the emergency brake.

248
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,590
We rolled down the hill,
and, bam, right into a fence.

249
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,660
It's just, I can't quite work
out the physics of the thing.

250
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,512
Well, the seat was here,

251
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:41,382
and-and... and she-she was,
she was strapped in, like...

252
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:45,152
And I... I was
more... I was like...

253
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,171
I am an idiot.

254
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,907
Mm, no, you're gonna be okay.

255
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,746
Hello. Dr. Hawkins.

256
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,565
I'm Andre. This is Otto.

257
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,378
How fast can you
get him admitted?

258
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:03,120
Oh, honey, don't be
so extra. It's just a virus.

259
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,034
Just give me some
fluids and acetaminophen.

260
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,869
Two years in med
school a century ago

261
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,370
does not make
you a doctor today.

262
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,929
- Says you.
- Got out while you could.

263
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,598
Good for you. Yeah.
What do you do now?

264
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,065
I'm a substitute teacher.

265
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,762
Middle school. That's
why he talks like that.

266
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,736
Oh, you low-key love it.

267
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:22,273
And I want out because we've
got lit Valentine's plans tonight.

268
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,742
Denied.

269
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,255
- Wha...
- We're saving our nickels.

270
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,207
It's too late. I
already made a rezzy.

271
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:30,759
- All right, what can you tell me
about your symptoms?
- Allow me.

272
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,418
He's been tired, weak, dizzy,

273
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,896
and some of his
joints are swollen.

274
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,421
Are you on any medications?

275
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,484
Oh, zero. I-I've been
sober for 20 years.

276
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,259
I don't even take an
aspirin for a headache.

277
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,478
- Stubborn old coot.
- Mind over matter, my love.

278
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,665
I like that. I'll be back when
I have your initial lab results.

279
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,668
Uh, Dr. Hawkins,
hold on, please.

280
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,631
We have a catastrophic
health care plan

281
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:54,055
with a high deductible.

282
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,224
- Joys of insurance, huh?
- Mm.

283
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,125
Don't worry.

284
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:00,594
I will only order tests that
are absolutely necessary.

285
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,994
Give the appy in OR
Three to someone else.

286
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,980
I want the partial colectomy
that's on the way in.

287
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,598
Yes, Dr. Bell.

288
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,324
I need to fast-track an autopsy.

289
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,010
Today I'm a surgeon.
Ask somebody else.

290
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,623
It's for a patient who
died very suddenly.

291
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:19,508
She was an active 70-year-old
with no apparent symptoms...

292
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,710
- 70? It was her heart.
- That doesn't make any sense.

293
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,329
We can't know that
until the autopsy.

294
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:25,786
She was a nonsmoker, she
participated in her community,

295
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,649
she was physically
active on a daily basis.

296
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,123
Why are you still talking about

297
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:31,676
an autopsy like it's a
forgone conclusion?

298
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,294
They cost thousands of dollars.

299
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,357
Unless the family wants
to pay out of pocket

300
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,647
or the coroner wants it

301
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,933
or her insurance authorizes
it, it's not happening.

302
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:40,613
It's not coming out
of Chastain's budget

303
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:44,171
because, trust me...
it's always their heart.

304
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,839
Dr. Okafor.

305
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,158
I understand the patient
brought into the ER today

306
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:05,643
was a friend of yours.

307
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,046
She was my neighbor.

308
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,715
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

309
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,551
You want to talk about it?

310
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,052
No.

311
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,457
Excuse me, I
need to make a call.

312
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,545
Hi, Micah.

313
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,815
I changed my mind about dinner.

314
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,410
See? I knew it.

315
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,752
Deep down, you
love Valentine's Day.

316
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,489
No. But I love you, and...

317
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:36,774
<i>you love Valentine's Day.</i>

318
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,760
And life is too short.

319
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,779
I don't want to be selfish
and just think of myself.

320
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,375
<i>No, you're not being
selfish. You literally</i>

321
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,510
think about everyone.

322
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:46,050
And I like where this is going.

323
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,719
So, we can have dinner

324
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,088
with all of the traditional
couples tonight.

325
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,924
<i>Yes. It's a little late</i>

326
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,543
for reservations... we might
end up at an all-night diner.

327
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,945
But if I'm with
you, it's all good.

328
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:09,357
Good news, Chet.
You're gonna be just fine.

329
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:11,292
We reduced your
wrist dislocation

330
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,210
and cleaned up the wounds.

331
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,097
We put you in a splint, and
as long as you keep it immobile,

332
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,698
it should heal quickly.

333
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,545
I'll write you a
prescription for antibiotics

334
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:21,786
so you won't get an
infection in that arm.

335
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,421
Thanks so much, Doc.

336
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,305
Oh, don't mention it.

337
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,810
We're a little backed up
because apparently this holiday

338
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,994
makes people do
oddly dangerous things,

339
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,914
but someone should be in
in a bit and get you in a sling,

340
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,883
and you can get out of here.

341
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,996
This is the kind of crap
that only happens to me.

342
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,221
I meet a hot girl,

343
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,589
I think she's into me,
and I do something stupid.

344
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:46,177
Well, to be fair, you did have
a slight technical malfunction

345
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,395
when you hit the
emergency brake.

346
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,731
- No one could've predicted that.
- Maybe.

347
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,584
But she wouldn't even
come to the hospital with me.

348
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,937
I mean, I should've had
car sex with a nice girl.

349
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:59,840
- You'll get through this.
- People like you don't get it.

350
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,126
I mean, you've never
done anything like this.

351
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,546
Well, maybe not
exactly like this.

352
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,382
You're severely anemic
and your sodium's low.

353
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,839
Looks like someone's getting

354
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,458
steak and spinach
for dinner, extra salt.

355
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,194
I already told you, Italian.
We have a reservation.

356
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,430
Otto... you're
also showing signs

357
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:26,600
of low kidney failure, so I
need to run some more tests.

358
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:29,486
You won't be able to
leave the hospital today.

359
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,539
On the upside,

360
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,159
cafeteria makes
a mean spaghetti.

361
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,446
I'll bring two bowls up,
we'll pretend we're in Italy.

362
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:40,614
Remember Rome,

363
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,733
when the Pope blessed
us in the streets?

364
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,129
You wish.

365
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,621
The Pope is not known for
his great love of our people.

366
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:49,134
Well, maybe it's a
blessing in disguise.

367
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:51,002
I can cancel tonight
and put that money

368
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:54,044
into that Alaskan tour
we always wanted to take.

369
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,800
I'll be back when
I have the results.

370
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,167
Oh, remember that
Caribbean cruise we went on?

371
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:03,954
Oh, how we danced.

372
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:11,578
Damn it.

373
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,848
No one cares about
the truth, not the police,

374
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:15,366
not this hospital.

375
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,050
Gertie's primary care physician

376
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,663
said she died of
atherosclerosis,

377
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:20,449
which she was
never diagnosed with.

378
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,890
Uh, it's because of her
age. We can't get an autopsy

379
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:24,953
because no one cares
what kills the elderly.

380
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,889
And now we're supposed
to give a death certificate

381
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,947
to the family that
says a lie. It isn't right.

382
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,783
The government bases their
stats on death certificates.

383
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:36,754
We might have to
work outside the system

384
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,507
if we want to get this done.

385
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:42,276
Would you consider donating
Gertie's body to science?

386
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,356
Chastain has a relationship
with a local university...

387
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,030
W-Why?

388
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,960
Well, you'd be helping
to educate future doctors.

389
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,467
Look, my head is killing me.

390
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,730
I'm not weeding through a
bunch of extra paperwork.

391
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:52,948
I just want her
death certificate

392
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,092
so I can get the money
and move to Portland.

393
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:59,777
If you donate her body, you
don't have to pay for a funeral.

394
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,995
And I'll get the
death certificate?

395
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:05,733
Where do I sign?

396
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,567
- What do we have?
- His oxygen levels are dropping.

397
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,720
He was talking about the Pope
and he wasn't making any sense,

398
00:18:14,744 --> 00:18:16,221
and then he started
coughing up blood.

399
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:18,745
Oh!

400
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,748
Page Pulm and Thoracic.

401
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,816
Tell them he has
massive hemoptysis.

402
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,519
I need that airway cart now.

403
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:28,923
Step back.

404
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,662
Bronchoscope.

405
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:45,119
Thank you.

406
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,321
I need a double-lumen
endotracheal tube.

407
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,979
His left lung is hemorrhaging.

408
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:55,861
What are you doing?

409
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,636
I'm inserting this tube
to block off the bleeding

410
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,355
and to allow the good
lung to keep getting oxygen.

411
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,611
- Will he be okay?
- We just bought Otto some time

412
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:14,646
so we can figure out why
this bleeding is happening.

413
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,920
Let's get him to
Interventional Radiology.

414
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:29,366
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

415
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,218
- Surprise.
- What?

416
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,504
- Mm.
- Ooh.

417
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,007
Mmm.

418
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,322
Ooh.

419
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,191
Hold on, hold on.
Someone might come in.

420
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:45,032
Oh, so let them.
It's Valentine's Day,

421
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,901
- and I'm getting some sugar.
- Wait, wait, wait.

422
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,353
Do you want to meet on
the on-call rooms on three?

423
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,557
Huh? I could sneak up there
and meet you in a few minutes.

424
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,992
Or we could walk
up there together.

425
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,695
Jess, come on. We're at work.

426
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,748
- And?
- And it's not professional.

427
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,262
So what? Other people

428
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,269
have relationships at work.

429
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,188
It's complicated, that's all.

430
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,175
I don't think it's
complicated at all.

431
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,171
You come to my
apartment, you make pasta,

432
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:16,497
we watch movies, and you
rub my feet, and you like it.

433
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:18,193
- Can you...
-

434
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,778
just a little less?

435
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,802
No, I cannot!

436
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,423
What, are you ashamed of me?

437
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,510
That's... No, of course not.

438
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,845
That's a crazy thing to say.

439
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,431
Okay. Well, then
let's go, right now.

440
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:39,069
Take my hand and walk
down the hall with me.

441
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,677
Hmm.

442
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,902
You know, no one thought

443
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,154
you were any great
prize either, Irving...

444
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,158
but I did.

445
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:15,906
Hey! How's it going?

446
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,458
<i>Oh, you know, ball of fun.</i>

447
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,910
Yeah, I bet. You doing okay?

448
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,729
Oh, sure.

449
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:24,414
Turns out, trust fall
thing... Not a joke.

450
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,901
<i>- Oh. Anyone get dropped?</i>
- No, but I thought about it.

451
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,138
You know what Family Day is?

452
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,918
<i>It's a day for addicts
to blame their families</i>

453
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:34,002
<i>for their addictions.</i>

454
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,704
<i>I'm about to kick a
few people in the shins.</i>

455
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,177
Well, that sounds about right.

456
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,945
There's more.

457
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,792
There's a group
thing in the morning.

458
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:42,700
I have to stay
overnight. I can't

459
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,319
come to the restaurant with
you, Conrad. I'm so sorry.

460
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:46,998
<i>That's okay. We'll
do it some other time.</i>

461
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:49,523
Oh, but you called eight
months ago to book a table.

462
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,169
<i>I'll just give it to
somebody else.</i>

463
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,771
Nic, really, it's just a
day on the calendar.

464
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:55,440
- Of course you need
to be there with Jessie.
<i>- It sucks.</i>

465
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,714
I know.

466
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,750
Door three closing.

467
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:03,687
I got to go. Another
session's starting.

468
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:06,556
- Don't kick anyone.
<i>- I'll try.</i>

469
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,659
<i>Happy Valentine's
Day. I love you.</i>

470
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,534
Happy Valen...

471
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,875
What in heaven's name? Chet!

472
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,877
Chet, are you okay?
Unlock the door!

473
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,530
Ow, she broke me again.

474
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,999
Bella, I assume.

475
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:34,134
Sorry. He said
he was good to go.

476
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,503
I said you had to be gentle.

477
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,104
It was nice to meet you.

478
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,854
Biopsy results are back.

479
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,572
He has an autoimmune disorder.

480
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,825
It's attacking his blood vessels

481
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,771
and it's what caused the
anemia and the kidney failure.

482
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,423
Polyarteritis nodosa.

483
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,859
It's treatable with medication.
Once we've got it under control,

484
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,866
you can go back
to your normal life.

485
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:07,200
Right.

486
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,470
Our normal life.

487
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,243
Andre, this is good news.

488
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,128
Otto will recover.

489
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:20,131
I know.

490
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,115
But...

491
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,202
that's not the only
thing going on here, is it?

492
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,771
He's talking about a
cruise we never went on.

493
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:32,226
And about Tijuana and
this casino in Vegas.

494
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:35,896
All things we said we'll do
someday, but we haven't yet.

495
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:39,466
Now, at first, I thought
he was joking or confused,

496
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:43,403
but then I called to cancel
the Italian place near our house.

497
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,717
It turns out, he never
had a reservation there.

498
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:48,442
It was a lie.

499
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,610
Or he forgot.

500
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,314
Or he was drunk.

501
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,502
His drinking...

502
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,622
That's why he didn't
finish med school.

503
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:05,904
I was young; I thought I'd
scored with this hot doctor.

504
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:08,979
Then he started lying
about where he'd been,

505
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,613
what he was doing.

506
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,483
Took me years to figure it out.

507
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,153
Then years for him to get sober.

508
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:20,624
And it was worth it because...
God, I love that man.

509
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:24,611
But now here we are.

510
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:30,167
I can't do this again.

511
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,602
Andre...

512
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,088
I don't think Otto is drinking.

513
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:37,875
Nothing indicating that
came up in his blood tests.

514
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,771
Then why is he doing this?

515
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:42,496
Tell me more about what he says.

516
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:47,217
How would you like to do
something epic and romantic

517
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,302
for Valentine's Day?

518
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:51,304
What do you have in mind?

519
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,458
Cut into my dead neighbor
lady to find out what killed her.

520
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,154
You're asking me to
perform an autopsy?

521
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:57,872
Since we technically
don't have permission,

522
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,858
we'll say it's for
your anatomy class.

523
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:02,582
So you want me to help
you steal an autopsy.

524
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:07,270
Sexy. I'm in.

525
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,554
Gather around the table.
Don't get in their way.

526
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,601
You know, I forgot how
easy it is to maneuver

527
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,704
when you're not trying
to keep someone alive.

528
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,873
And when you don't have to stop
to suction blood out of the way.

529
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:32,495
Are we late or something?

530
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,014
Did class already start?

531
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,677
Yeah, why wasn't this
field trip in the syllabus?

532
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,602
Shh. Let the
surgeons concentrate.

533

Look, they skipped the lungs.

534
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:42,267
In honor of the holiday,
we decided to start

535

My parents pay a lot of
money for my education.

537

Well, you tell your
parents congratulations.

538
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:55,786
Today, they got a deal.

539
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,899
Most students at your
level have never seen

540
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,973
a fresh cadaver dissection.

541
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,098
You, coupon cutter,

542
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,861
if this cadaver had
atherosclerosis,

543
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:12,019
what would the
arteries look like?

544
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:13,803
They'd be hard and narrow.

545
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,056
Correct. Now look
at these babies.

546
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,709
They are as wide
and free-flowing

547
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,696
as summer water
on a mountain range.

548
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:24,765
There's no plaque at all.

549
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,150
Explain, student.

550
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,586
This person did not
die of heart disease.

551
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,940
If atherosclerosis
didn't kill her, what did?

552
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,976
I intend to find out.

Hello?

554
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,818
Those candy hearts were
extremely inappropriate.

555
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,250
They gave me an
inappropriate idea.

556
00:27:05,274 --> 00:27:08,420
See, this day is all about
couples, which, let's face it,

557
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:10,460
can be hell for the rest of us.

558
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,696
Now, I'm not
looking to couple up,

559
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,849
but I could use a distraction.

560
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,751
A distraction?

561
00:27:17,787 --> 00:27:20,487
Mm-hmm. I'm not
in a thing right now.

562
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:22,456
I've never seen you in a thing.

563
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:24,657
You do like sex
with women, right?

564
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:27,627
Great.

565
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:30,330
Then my place, your
place, I don't really care.

566
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:32,644
Just be freshly showered,
bring your own birth control,

567
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:34,613
and no cuddling after.

568
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:38,989
It's a onetime offer, and I
will deny it ever happened.

569
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,874
So?

570
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:45,729
Congratulations.

571
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,365
You just sexed yourself
into a Galeazzi fracture,

572
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,168
and now I have to
operate on your arm.

573
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,220
I'm sorry.

00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:56,055
Who does their
business in a hospital?

575
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,009
Do you have any idea how many
bacteria are festering in here?

care-associated infection.

What were you thinking?

579
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:07,233
Bella texted to see
if I was all right, so...

580
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,253
I thought that maybe we
could be a thing, after all.

581
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,856
The time for her to
ask if you were okay

582
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,903
was when you were
removed from her vagina

583
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,509
and put into the ambulance.

584
00:28:16,544 --> 00:28:18,361
She didn't do that,

585
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:22,199
which means she is not
looking for a relationship with you.

586
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:25,602
But she said she never
had sex in a hospital.

587
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,072
There are love matches,

588
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,541
and there are sex matches.

589
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:34,172
You're saying that this
is only a sex match?

590
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:37,414
I'm saying this is neither.

Why did she have an aneurysm?

- Any guesses?
- She was born with it?

00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,470
Ah. The vessel
walls are so thin.

691
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:13,189
They are.

692
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,219
The patient's lucky you
caught this when you did.

693
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,493
It was about to burst.

694
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:20,396
Look, here's a second aneurysm.

695
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,782
That one is smaller. Less risky.

696
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:24,951
You know the surgical adage,

697
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:27,237
"See one, do one, teach one"?

698
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,300
I do.

699
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,307
Well, you just saw one.

700
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,210
Care to try doing one?

701
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:35,328
I would.

702
00:33:35,364 --> 00:33:36,579
Hmm.

703
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,016
Isolating the vessel.

704
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,068
The surgery was a success, Nora.

705
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:50,409
You had two aneurysms,
and they've both been fixed.

706
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,512
And I won't get any more?

707
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:54,548
And now that you're
aware of your PKD,

708
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:56,760
you can go in for regular
screenings to minimize risk.

709
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,070
And it's all because you
donated Gertie's body to science.

710
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,706
No.

711
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,209
It was because of Aunt Gertie.

712
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:14,433
She was a good woman.

713
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,464
I will miss seeing her
in the building and...

714
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:18,871
Anyway, did you get
that death certificate?

715
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,951
I'm gonna need her money
to pay for this operation

716
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,808
and move to Portland.

717
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,765
It's called "confabulation."

718
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,383
He's getting things confused,

719
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:32,430
so his brain makes
up the reality for him.

720
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:34,137
But why is it happening?

721
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:36,116
We think it's a result
of brain damage

722
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,958
due to his past alcoholism.

723
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:43,196
Sometimes the damage
shows up years later.

724
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:45,564
He's having a hard time
differentiating between

725
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,234
what did happen and
what could happen.

726
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:51,037

733
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,440
I know. But if you

Micah? Someone call 911!
He's had a heart transplant!

867
00:42:42,911 --> 00:42:45,477
Wait, Mina. Wait, wait, wait.

868
00:42:46,414 --> 00:42:48,798
Okay, so my pulse
may be racing a little,

869
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,617
and it is my heart, but it's
not because of my transplant.

870
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:05,798
Dr. Mina Okafor...

871
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,449
will you marry me?

872
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,447
