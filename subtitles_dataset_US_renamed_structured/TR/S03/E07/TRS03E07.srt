1
00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:04,046
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- Hey, Cindy.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,348
- You're exhausted.
- Red Rock can

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,300
schedule more operations
and make more money.

4
00:00:07,324 --> 00:00:09,336
I'm pulling rank. Go home.
There's got to be someone

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,354
- who can swap with you.
- Me. I got you covered.

6
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,206
<i>You just finished
back-to-back surgeries, too.</i>

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,131
<i>Well, then I'll be in
back-to-back-to-back surgeries.</i>

8
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,701
They are still working

9
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:22,503
on my request for
Hemopleatin data.

10
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,084
The more time, the
more patients could die.

11
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:26,253
We need help with something.
We're doing a little research

12
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:29,678
- on a drug.
- An exclusive with
DiaCure renal services

13
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:30,945
would help us all out.

14
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,433
Chastain uses the drug

15
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,267
Hemopleatin to treat anemia.

16
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,515
Nic's sister, Jessie...
she was on it.

17
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,433
She died of a massive
pulmonary embolism,

18
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,775
just like five more of our
patients on Hemopleatin.

19
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:46,612
I think this drug is causing
these fatal blood clots.

20
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,541
Get to the point. I
have a busy day.

21
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:50,543
Well, you're familiar with
the company DiaCure?

22
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,396
The biggest dialysis
provider in the country. Yeah.

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,397
Yeah. I-I met their
CEO at their annual

24
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,283
shareholders'
meeting last night.

25
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:59,107
He agreed to give us access
to all their patient records...

26
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:02,727
in exchange for an
exclusive deal with Chastain.

27
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,741
Since when did you start
doing business deals?

28
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,059
I didn't agree to
anything, obviously.

29
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,811
- Well...
- Yeah, it's your call.

30
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:10,201
But bottom line, if
Hemopleatin is killing people,

31
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,871
and Chastain can prove
it, we're saving lives.

32
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,590
I'm, uh... I'm not gonna go
into business with anyone

33
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,743
on the basis of
your wild hunches.

34
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,256
Take my wild hunch
out of the equation.

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,714
DiaCure is still an excellent
partner for Chastain,

36
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,950
regardless.

37
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:31,306
It's Jessica.

38
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,219
Car versus tree.
GCS 7 on arrival.

39
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:35,994
Head trauma with
positive seat belt sign.

40
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,124
- BP 60 over palp.
- Okay. How long
was she out there?

41
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:39,842
Took an hour to extricate
her. Not sure how long

42
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,917
Jessica was waiting
before she was found.

43
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:44,786
Oh, my God. Jess. Jess!

44
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,982
- Oh, my God.
- You're home now, sweetie.

45
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,273
Jess!

46
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:50,970
- How is she?
- We don't know yet,

47
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:52,326
but we got her.

48
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,014
Unhook her. Let's move her.

49
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,799
And on my count, let's go.

50
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,718
One, two, three.

51
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:04,784
- What happened?
- Don't know. Nobody around,
no skid marks.

52
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:06,803
Might have fallen
asleep at the wheel.

53
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,321
Oh, my God.

54
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:11,947
What's her access?
She needs volume now.

55
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:14,499
One 22-gauge in her
thumb. We're trying

56
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,974
to get a bigger peripheral,
but her veins are all collapsed.

57
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,971
She was tired. She was
coming off a double shift.

58
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,289
You need to leave, Dr. Feldman.

59
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:23,625
Give me an introducer.
I will get access.

60
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,960
Nurse, hold her C-spine.

61
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,463
Abdomen's soft. I got the FAST.

62
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,126
I'll do it. I have
to do something.

63
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,293
You need to let
us take care of her.

64
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,051
- What?
- You need to let us

65
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,547
take care of her. We got this.

66
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,656
We got it.

67
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,290
No.

68
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,053
- Pravesh,
Pravesh. Pravesh!
- No!

69
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,304
- Whoa, whoa.
- Pravesh, get him out of here!

70
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,157
- Get him out of here now!
- No! Get off of me!

71
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:46,125
- Go.
- No! Get your hands off of me!

72
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:49,117
- Wait. Wait.
- Let me stay! I want to stay in the room.

73
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,296
I've got to stay in the room.

74
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,497
Now anything?

75
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,413
♪ ♪

76
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:20,231
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- She's been down too long.

77
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,734
- How much more time?!
- Another 20 seconds.

78
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,697
- Where's
that introducer?
- Happening as fast

79
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:26,599
- as superhumanly possible.
- Ah.

80
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,389
Come on.

81
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:33,595
All right, and we... are... in.

82
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,064
Get that blood in her now
and add an amp of bicarb.

83
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,087
Two minutes. Pulse check.

84
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,470
I got a pulse. We got a
pulse. All right. All right.

85
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,711
All right. All right.

86
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:52,125
- It's thready,
but it's there. Jess?
- Okay. All right.

87
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,809
- It's thready, but it's there.
- Here we go.

88
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,116
Jess. Jess, welcome back.

89
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,902
Now stay with me. Stay with me!

90
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,620
Okay, come on. All right.

91
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,774
Abdomen's not so soft now.

92
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:07,145
Come on.

93
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:13,068
It's full of blood.
It's full of blood.

94
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:15,215
We got to find the
bleeding and stop it now.

95
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,138
Hundley, call the OR.

96
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:20,042
Hundley!

97
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:22,911
- Page Neuro.
- How are the pupils?

98
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:24,245
They're reactive, but...

99
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,227
We need Neuro.
Let's go. Come on.

100
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:30,301
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

101
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,721
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

102
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:34,222
How is she?

103
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:36,424
Massive intra-abdominal
hemorrhage.

104
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,893
- She's in good hands now.
- I got the page.

105
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:40,762
What's with the audience?

106
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:43,432
She's one of your scrub
nurses... Jessica Moore.

107
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,734
She's been in nearly
half of your surgeries.

108
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:48,102
- She needs a head CT.
- No time. She'll bleed out

109
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,632
on the CT table. We do this now.

110
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,618
I'll just put in an
extraventricular drain

111
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:53,086
to measure pressure
and control the swelling.

112
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,442
I can do that blind.

113
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:55,844
Well, that's quite reassuring.

114
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,328
My job isn't to reassure you.

115
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,012
So, that's where we are.
Thanks for checking in.

116
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,831
- I'll keep you posted.
- Dr. Bell?

117
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:07,005
- Yeah?
- How is she?

118
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,545
They're taking her for
an emergency ex-lap.

119
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,446
This is on Red Rock.

120
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,113
- I...
- They cut staff,

121
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,366
overscheduled the OR, and
now Jessica's paying for it.

122
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,018
- We need more nurses.
- Can we just talk
about this later?

123
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,143
No!

124
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:30,623
We lost some of our
best due to the hours

125
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:33,031
and salary cuts that
Red Rock instituted.

126
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,211
- Uh...
- I have people working
a double shift right now.

127
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,147
- Do you want more Jessicas?
- No, of course not.

128
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,964
I'm devastated by this. I...
You have... you have any idea

129
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:41,456
how many hours I've
spent in an OR with Jessica?

130
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:43,991
How many times she's had
my back in a tough surgery?

131
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:47,028
Don't suggest that I don't
care what's happening to her.

132
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,315
She's not just a
member of my team.

133
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,334
She's like...
She's family to me.

134
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,574
Look...

135
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,988
I have one nurse today,
and she's a student.

136
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,879
Even if she was fully trained,
that's not nearly enough.

137
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,433
We can't keep doing
this. We need help.

138
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:12,104
I'll see what I can do
about getting more nurses.

139
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,121
Okay.

140
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,012
Hey.

141
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,031
Hey, how is she?

142
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,286
Cain and Raptor are
just getting started.

143
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,375
Did you get ahold
of her parents?

144
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,944
They're on their way.

145
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,463
From Europe.

146
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:42,133
They go twice a year...
Bordeaux and Tuscany.

147
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,719
This is their, uh,
Bordeaux trip.

148
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,372
Apparently, they're
really into wine.

149
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,308
She was going to introduce
me to them at Thanksgiving.

150
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:58,099
Um... they're getting
on a plane right now.

151
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,201
No contact for several hours.

152
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:03,789
Have they designated a health
care proxy until they get here?

153
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,442
Yes. Me.

154
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,138
Good. Good choice.
You're a doctor.

155
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,640
Let me help you start
that paperwork, okay?

156
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,298
No. No, no, no, no.

157
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,316
I'm not leaving her.

158
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:19,421
Irving, I know that
you are scared.

159
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:21,173
Scared?

160
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,275
Scared does not cover it.

161
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,776
This is all my fault.

162
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,728
How is this your fault?

163
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:30,232
She's been pulling
doubles for days.

164
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,651
And then, we had
that game night.

165
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,403
I knew she was exhausted.

166
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:38,406
And... yesterday,

167
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:40,475
she was heading out, and I...

168
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,803
Okay. Five seconds of
action, and then I'm on the road.

169
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,268
Oh. Mmm.

170
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,493
Usually, it's at least

171
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,511
- ten seconds.
- Well...

172
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,264
- You look tired.
- Thank you.

173
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,228
It's totally what a
girl wants to hear

174
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,113
from a guy whose scrubs
she wants to get into.

175
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:09,165
No, no, no. You know I
always think you're beautiful.

176
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,050
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm just wondering
if you need a ride home.

177
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,791
Okay, least sexy
supply closet time ever.

178
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,187
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:17,945
- Okay. Much better?
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:20,315
I let her go.

181
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,367
No. No.

182
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,535
You did not let her do anything.

183
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,804
This is not on you or her.

184
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,859
If you want to blame
someone, blame Red Rock.

185
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:33,177
Assigning blame
doesn't help Jessica.

186
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,143
Focus on what you can do now.

187
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:39,384
Okay?

188
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,652
I will stay on the OR floor.

189
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:48,376
I will be right here
to get updates.

190
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:53,314
I will let you know as
soon as I hear anything.

191
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,401
I will meet up with
you in the ICU.

192
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,289
Go.

193
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,615
Before we begin,
a quick gut check.

194
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,284
One of our own is on the table.

195
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,268
Anyone too tired... physically

196
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,620
or emotionally...
Should step out now.

197
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,556
Should I step out?

198
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,624
I worked two 30-hour
shifts this week.

199
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,095
Oh, wait. I'm the brain
surgeon. I should probably stay.

200
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,598
It's important that we are all
in tip-top shape for Jessica.

201
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,117
So again, are we good?

202
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,688
Nurse,

203
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,551
how many shifts have
you had this week?

204
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,942
Not as many as Jessica.

205
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,477
She, um...

206
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,598
She covered for me yesterday.

207
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,602
Then I'm going to have
to ask you to step out.

208
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:49,620
For Jessica.

209
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,073
Okay.

210
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:58,780
That's a nice plan. Now
we're down a scrub nurse

211
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,276
without enough
time to replace her.

212
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,784
- I'll do it.
- Aren't you a resident?

213
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,386
I'm a surgeon. Surely I can
handle scrub nurse duties.

214
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:07,555
Well, then it's settled.

215
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,976
Nurse/Doctor Mina Okafor
is on the case. Let's go.

216
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:21,419
How long have you
been in nursing school?

217
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,915
Uh, two years. I'm so excited

218
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:24,800
to finally be here
in a real hospital.

219
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,124
Can't wait to get into
the trenches, you know.

220
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,243
Really start
practicing medicine.

221
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,513
Good, 'cause you're about
to hit the ground running.

222
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,349
We're working general
medicine and the ICU today.

223
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,628
Wow. Is that, is that normal?

224
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:38,469
No. It's a disaster.

225
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,923
We're shorthanded, and we're
down one very important woman.

226
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,308
I heard about the scrub nurse

227
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,359
while I was filling
out my paperwork.

228
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,129
- I'm sorry. I hope she's okay.
- Me, too.

229
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:49,792
I'll be going between
our patients and checking

230
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,433
on Jessica today, so... I
need you to keep up with me.

231
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:54,002
Oh, yeah. I'll try.

232
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:56,704
- Oh, my God.
- Dad.

233
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,772
Ah. Oh, I heard
there was an accident,

234
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:01,159
a Chastain nurse.
I was terrified.

235
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,626
Well, I'm fine.

236
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,290
Okay, you can let go now.

237
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:05,646
All right.

238
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:07,460
I'm okay. Uh, this is,

239
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:09,212
uh, Clara. She's
our student nurse.

240
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,329
- Hi.
- That's my dad, Kyle Nevin.

241
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:11,680
I will update you
on Jessica later,

242
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,020
but right now I got to go.

243
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:15,306
Hey, hey, hey. I can help.

244
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,958
Uh...

245
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:18,821
Isn't it pretty great?

246
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,995
First day on the
job as a volunteer.

247
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,632
Well, I guess I will be training
you both simultaneously.

248
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,684
Go Team Nevin.

249
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,696
Thank you. Thank you.

250
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,799
Hi.

251
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,353
How is she?

252
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,706
Um...

253
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,109
she had massive internal
injuries from the accident.

254
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,594
But Austin and Mina were
able to repair everything

255
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,429
- in her abdomen.
- It's her brain
that's the issue.

256
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,779
She was showing
signs of increased

257
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,952
intracranial pressure, so...

258
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,888
Cain put a drain in.

259
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:07,892
Have they done a post-op CT?

260
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,094
Yeah, and there was no bleed.

261
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,679
That's good news.

262
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,754
But there are signs of swelling.

263
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,788
Keeping an eye on her.

264
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,640
And being positive.

265
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:28,062
Here, let me do that.

266
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,781
I'm her health care
proxy and a doctor, so...

267
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,433
I'm responsible.

268
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,585
We're all here for you.

269
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,637
So we're all responsible.

270
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,106
No matter how busy it
gets, Jessica is the priority.

271
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:44,112
Right. Good.

272
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:45,580
The post-op labs.

273
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:47,343
- I got to check to see
if they're back. Yep.

274
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,666
I'm on them.

275
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,151
You stay here with Jessica.

276
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,403
We'll all be here
as much as we can.

277
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,772
You're gonna be sick
of seeing our faces.

278
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,208
Thank you.

279
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,011
Both of you.

280
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:17,528
Can I help you?

281
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,015
You must be Dr. Bell.

282
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,452
Yeah, that's the
name on the door.

283
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,803
You are?

284
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,790
Logan Kim. Exec VP of Red Rock.

285
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,319
You left a message
with my office.

286
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,988
I left a message
with Emma O'Neil.

287
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:34,311
Emma is head of Red
Rock's transition team.

288
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:35,830
Transition's over.

289
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:38,266
I'll be overseeing the
day-to-day operations

290
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:40,702
of the hospital now.

291
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,770
I oversee the day-to-day.

292
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,617
It's a partnership.

293
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,491
No.

294
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,992
We have distinct duties.

295
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,896
You make payroll. I'm CEO.

296
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:56,417
Let-Let's avoid a-a
pissing contest, shall we?

297
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:00,838
Sorry. Yeah.

298
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,240
Um... we've had a rough morning.

299
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,560
One of our best nurses
fell asleep at the wheel,

300
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,745
and her life is hanging
by a thread. She's...

301
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,298
she's working double shifts
due to our nursing shortage.

302
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:14,035
Let's-let's walk that
back, uh, immediately.

303
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,054
A single car accident doesn't
mean that she was asleep

304
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,868
at the wheel. Could have
been a suicide attempt.

305
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,842
Maybe she was texting.

306
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,710
Well, when she
wakes up, we'll...

307
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,407
Well,<i> if</i> she wakes
up. If she doesn't,

308
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,181
we may never know for sure.

309
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:29,416
Did PR feed you that?

310
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,686
I know exactly what happened.

311
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,339
She was overworked.
She was exhausted.

312
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,607
She had a long drive home,

313
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,087
and she fell
asleep at the wheel.

314
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,529
You could spin it that way,
which might lead the press

315
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:43,241
to investigate other
overworked employees,

316
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:47,068
like a resident who fell
through a skylight on your watch.

317
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:49,432
I-I'm not pointing any fingers,
and I hope no one else will,

318
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:53,624
but one CEO could easily be
made a scapegoat for both incidents.

319
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,842
Are you threatening me?

320
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:56,427
Absolutely not.

321
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,879
But I'm trying to make you see

322
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,357
how much smoother
things will run

323
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:02,616
if we're both playing
for the same team:

324
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:06,153
the shareholders of Red
Rock Mountain Medical.

325
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,243
Anything?

326
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,407
Post-op blood
tests aren't back yet.

327
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:18,148
Yeah. Come on.

328
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,144
I take it all that optimism
was for Irving's sake.

329
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,215
I'm scared to death.

330
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,933
For both of them.

331
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,813
If something happens to her...

332
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,470
Don't even say it.

333
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:45,943
If it had been
you, I would be...

334
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:50,631
- I have no idea what I'd be.
- Hey.

335
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,660
I'm fine. Okay?

336
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,481
But we have to do something.

337
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:08,165
This is on Red Rock.

338
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,684
Jessica was overworked.

339
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,669
We're all overworked.

340
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,381
It's this system.
It's not right.

341
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,706
What do you want to do?

342
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,793
Today,

343
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:20,644
we focus on Jessica.

344
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,146
We make sure she's okay.

345
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,465
We make sure Irving's
okay. But tomorrow?

346
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,966
Tomorrow we keep fighting.

347
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,849
Oh, sorry.

348
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:33,474
I was just looking
for an extra pillow.

349
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:35,192
Jessica.

350
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,344
Top shelf, Dad.

351
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:39,030
Yeah. Sorry.

352
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,957
<i>Why don't you</i>

353
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:52,710
- figure this out. Look at the...
- I-I'm sorry, sir.

354
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,990
- I don't know anything
about the TV.
- I'm gonna take this to 921.

355
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,630
Hey.

356
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,967
Hey! Hey, how do you... how
do you change the channel?

357
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:01,480
Because the-the TV's
just showing birds.

358
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:03,654
Well, that's a nature
channel. I think

359
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,317
- it's meant to keep you calm.
- Yeah, well-well,

360
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,675
I hate birds, and
it's driving me crazy.

361
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,897
Uh, see, I'll just, uh...

362
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,915
I'll just...

363
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,934
I'll get a new one.

364
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,970
Thank you.

365
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,668
Her ICP

366
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:24,253
has been increasing
over the last few hours.

367
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,994
We need to get her back into
surgery to control the swelling.

368
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,008
Well, she's still recovering
from the last surgery.

369
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:30,559
I'd advise we go forward
with nonsurgical care

370
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,294
- while she's still fragile.
- We've already been doing that.

371
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,752
Medical management
is not cutting it.

372
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,949
We need to move on to surgical
options. Now, you want her

373
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,068
- to have irreversible
brain damage? Hey.

374
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,119
- A little sensitivity.
- The next step is

375
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,010
a decompressive hemicraniectomy.

376
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:45,179
Temporarily pop off
a piece of her skull

377
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,181
and allow her brain
room to expand.

378
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:49,233
She's febrile.

379
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,634
In renal failure.

380
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,970
And have you seen
her post-op CBC?

381
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,800
Her platelets
are critically low,

382
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,941
which makes a
craniectomy far riskier.

383
00:17:56,976 --> 00:18:00,227
I think we still have time left
to optimize her the best we can

384
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:01,924
before going back
in for another surgery.

385
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,449
All right, so, everyone listen
to the third-year resident

386
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,067
and follow him anywhere.

387
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:08,735
- I'm the attending.
- I'm also the attending,

388
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:10,800
and Irving asked
Conrad to coordinate care.

389
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,291
All right, so why don't we
just go find the nursing student

390
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,470
who's been bumbling
around the floor somewhere?

391
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,637
Maybe she would
like a say, as well.

392
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,144
Conrad has the last word.

393
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,247
Right, Irving? He's
making the call.

394
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:20,342
Let's get this straight.

395
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,748
I'm a neurosurgeon.

396
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,001
This woman is in
need of neurosurgery.

397
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,755
If her brain continues to
swell, she's gonna herniate.

398
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,091
She's either gonna die
or have zero chances

399
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:32,643
of waking up tomorrow
as anything more than...

400
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,573
Why don't we all say
this one together...

401
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,764
A vegetable.

402
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,934
We can place her
in a barbiturate coma.

403
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,135
That'll give us a chance

404
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,304
to control the swelling
while she recovers

405
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,467
from the trauma of the
surgery she just went through.

406
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,319
Look, we've all been
here before in medicine

407
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:48,971
where there is no
clear-cut answer.

408
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:52,579
- We need to work together...
- Now an intern speaks. Really?

409
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:54,632
Why don't we just
poll all of Atlanta.

410
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,428
Maybe everyone should
have a voice at Chastain.

411
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:57,762
Jessica's only in this
situation because you

412
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,148
- overworked her for weeks.
- Oh, right.

413
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,615
So now I'm
responsible for a nurse

414
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,773
who didn't know
enough to call an Uber.

415
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,142
No. But you will be responsible

416
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,712
if she arrests on the table
because her body can't handle

417
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,180
another invasive surgery.

418
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,185
Conrad makes this call.

419
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:17,788
Some medical proxy you are.

420
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,190
When she dies,

421
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,027
it's gonna be on you.

422
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,009
Look, I didn't want to
contradict you in front of Cain,

423
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:46,984
but I'm not 100%
about waiting to address

424
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,368
Jessica's intracranial pressure.

425
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:49,803
I know. I feel the same way.

426
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,817
But it is a judgment call,
and I don't want to send her

427
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:54,091
back to the OR with a
dropping platelet count

428
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,937
that we can't explain when
there are other medical options.

429
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,856
Are you sure that continuing

430
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,107
with conservative management
is gonna help her ICP?

431
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,110
It's worth a try,
particularly in this case.

432
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,594
If she doesn't clot
in surgery, she dies.

433
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,884
Okay, I'm on board.

434
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,753
But a word of caution.

435
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,840
You know Cain has the
juice with Red Rock, right?

436
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,937
You know he is their
cash register, Hawkins.

437
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,695
I am well aware.
Since he came here,

438
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:17,381
invasive brain and spine
surgeries are up 49%.

439
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,128
Now, you ask yourself, how
many of those are necessary?

440
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,835
Cain cuts when
no one else would.

441
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:24,938
So, you think he might be
doing it again with Jessica?

442
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,058
I think he's a cowboy.

443
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,943
I love surgeons with attitude

444
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,896
- and even a healthy ego.
- Hmm.

445
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,781
If they put patients
first, like you do.

446
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,645
Well, I don't mind
residents with cojones.

447
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,435
But you tread lightly.

448
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,055
You just made a dangerous enemy.

449
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,715
<i>How-how about bald</i>

450
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,278
but still banging
with the best of them.

451
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:54,463
Hey, Nic.

452
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,103
Hi. Uh, this is my daughter.

453
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,705
She's a nurse practitioner
here. Nic, this is Jackie,

454
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:00,435
a 70-year-old woman
with congestive heart failure

455
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,459
here for IV diuretics,

456
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,572
which requires monitoring
throughout the day.

457
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,414
Well done, Dad, but I
know. Jackie's my patient.

458
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:08,799
Did you know that Jackie

459
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,113
and her daughter Leslie
here have a business together?

460
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:14,054
They cross-stitch pillows
with risqué phrases on them.

461
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,985
- Mm, I did not.
- Did you know that?

462
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,475
- I did not. I need one of those.
- Oh.

463
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,594
- Um, did you get Jackie's lunch?
- Uh...

464
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,729
I came to take her
order. We got to talking.

465
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:24,443
I'm-I'm on it.

466
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,069
Uh, does he like older women?

467
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:30,265
Mom.

468
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,134
What? He's adorable.

469
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:34,841
Okay, this isn't the bar.

470
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,561
This is Clara. She'll be
starting your IV today.

471
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:40,581
Have you ever done this before?

472
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:42,282
On a, uh, mannequin.

473
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:44,868
But I always won when
we did IV races in class.

474
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,715
- Clara's in training.
- Ow.

475
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,021
Nic, she's gonna kill me.

476
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,100
She's not gonna kill you.

477
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:50,090
Listen to your patient.

478
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:51,742
The band's too tight.

479
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:02,986
Got it.

480
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,287
Oh, pro tip, girlie.

481
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,956
Real people feel more pain

482
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,224
than mannequins.

483
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,796
She's stable.

484
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,864
She's resting.

485
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,477
Buddy, you need
to eat something.

486
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,679
- I'm not leaving her.
- You need
to take care of yourself

487
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,631
- in order
to take care of Jessica.
- Come to the cafeteria.

488
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:21,138
We're gonna get you some food.

489
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,801
Conrad ordered more labs.
I'm waiting until they come back.

490
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,052
They're not gonna be
back for another hour.

491
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,126
Come on. It's
tri-tip sandwich day.

492
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,339
You love tri-tip sandwich day.

493
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:29,346
I'm not hungry.

494
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,725
You need to eat anyway.

495
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,199
Don't make us drag you.

496
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:35,352
Dr. Feldman.

497
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,848
I'd like to spend a few
minutes with Jessica,

498
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:37,971
if that's all right.

499
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:39,389
See?

500
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,007
She's not gonna be alone.

501
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:43,343
Everyone loves her.

502
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,108
I think she'd be
honored, Dr. Bell.

503
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:48,012
I know how much
she respects you.

504
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,287
All right.

505
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:10,821
Hey.

506
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,452
What can I get you, Dr. Feldman?

507
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,107
Uh, his usual.

508
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,492
Tri-tip sandwich coming up.

509
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:34,644
You don't look so good.

510
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,645
Go sit.

511
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,065
Grab that free table, okay?

512
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:43,270
We may need to get a social
worker to come talk to him.

513
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,790
Get him something
for his anxiety.

514
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,559
He needs to keep a clear head.

515
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,811
Let's get some food in him.

516
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,396
We're out of tri-tip.

517
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,131
Tuna salad?

518
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,983
It's tri-tip day.

519
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,771
The man needs
a tri-tip sandwich.

520
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,423
He doesn't like tuna salad.

521
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,791
Do you understand?

522
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,693
So go back there
and get some tri-tip!

523
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,267
We're all having a bad day.

524
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:17,654
That was uncalled for.

525
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,822
I'm sorry.

526
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,302
It's okay.

527
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,743
I heard about Jessica.

528
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:23,943
I understand.

529
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,830
We're all in it together.

530
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,274
What's going on?

531
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,460
Got more labs back.

532
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:41,311
Platelets are still falling,

533
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:42,774
and now she's anemic,
so I paged Austin.

534
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,015
That doesn't make any sense.

535
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,613
She's gotten over
20 units PRBCs,

536
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:49,498
15 FFPs, ten
units of platelets...

537
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,400
Yeah, well, you better
keep 'em coming.

538
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:52,451
You think she's still bleeding?

539
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:53,719
I don't see anything
in her chest.

540
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:54,802
Her belly's nice and soft.

541
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,706
Well, where's all
the blood going?

542
00:24:58,147 --> 00:24:59,947
We're working on that.

543
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:02,115
You're sure you didn't
miss a bleed somewhere?

544
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:04,045
Maybe the retroperitoneum
or pleural cavities?

545
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,452
No, I didn't miss anything.

546
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:08,071
You can't know
that. Maybe, this time,

547
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,684
you missed something and
that's why Jessica's still too sick

548
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,637
for surgery. And now
she's running out of time.

549
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:14,210
Hey. Remember, we
are on the same side.

550
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,064
I'll take her for another CT,

551
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,094
just to make sure we're
not missing anything.

552
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:22,052
I didn't miss anything.

553
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,838
But let's get another
CT, so we can be certain.

554
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:26,707
I'm sorry I left you, babe.

555
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,792
I'm sorry.

556
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:43,357
What's going on?

557
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,076
She's still anemic

558
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,256
and thrombocytopenic
despite multiple transfusions.

559
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,846
Why?

560
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,264
I'm working on it.

561
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,769
Honestly, I don't know.

562
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,237
There's nothing on the CT?

563
00:25:57,272 --> 00:25:58,672
No.

564
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,463
I called the CEO of DiaCure.

565
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:07,781
We made a deal.

566
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:11,301
We're gonna use their
dialysis equipment exclusively.

567
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:16,640
You can get the data you need.

568
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:19,276
I-I just, uh...

569
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,245
just felt like I had to
do something positive.

570
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:28,101
J-Jessica's...

571
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:33,072
She's my favorite
of the OR nurses.

572
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,302
You know, she's
a... She's a pistol.

573
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,744
You know. And...

574
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:40,630
sweet.

575
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,916
And a lady.

576
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:49,423
So this one's for her.

577
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:56,079
Wish it were more.

578
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,515
It's all I got.

579
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,486
Thank you.

580
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:09,826
Your dressing
needs to be changed.

581
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,628
Get me a real nurse.

582
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,174
He's been picking
at his cellulitis.

583
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,177
Yeah, bec... I can't
help it, because it itches.

584
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:16,812
All right? So why don't... Why
don't you give me something

585
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:18,146
in-instead of
getting in my face?

586
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,370
That sounds like drug
seeking to me, and...

587
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,351
- Sir, you can't-can't do that.
- Steve.

588
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:25,303
Sir. Sir...
- You need to get back in bed. Hey, hey.

589
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:27,356
Steve, come on. You
got to get back in bed.

590
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,863
Nic!

591
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,893
The meth head is
trying to kill your father!

592
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,695
The meth head is
trying to kill your father!

593
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,819
Help! Hey, hey, hey!

594
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:40,624
Code gray!

595
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:46,613
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

596
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:48,682
- Ow! Oh!
- Hey! Hey!

597
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:50,483
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow!

598
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:52,169
Hold him down!

599
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:53,632
Let go of me!

600
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:59,220
- Dad, are you okay?
- Yeah. He bit me.

601
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,627
Is that bad?

602
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:02,307
He didn't break the skin,
but we'll take a look at it,

603
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:05,549
just in case.

604
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,896
- It's okay.
- Oh, it's a good... it was a good thing I was here.

605
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,420
Right place at the right time.

606
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:12,506
He could've hurt... uh, Clara.

607
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:14,007
Clara, I'm sorry.

608
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,186
I shouldn't have left you alone.

609
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,192
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

610
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,193
Yeah, I'm fine.

611
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,606
Ooh, ooh.

612
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,380
He s-spit on me.

613
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:23,032
Oh, God.

614
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:34,778
You okay?

615
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,947
Yeah, it's fine. I'm fine.

616
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,599
It's okay not to be fine.

617
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,846
Nursing school doesn't
prepare you for a day like this.

618
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:42,935
I quit.

619
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,547
You can't.

620
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:55,098
I'm sorry.

621
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,602
I'm short of nurses, and I
need everybody that I can get.

622
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,240
Plus...

623
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,791
you can do this.

624
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,809
I don't want to.

625
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,596
I mean...

626
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:12,766
it was one thing
when it was on paper.

627
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:15,786
What are the warning
signs of heart failure?

628
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,988
How many milliliters?

629
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,607
I liked studying medicine.

630
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:22,126
But when it comes to this...

631
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:26,329
Look, you've had a
seriously difficult first day.

632
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,981
But, hey, at least no
one threw up on you.

633
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,146
No one pulled a chunk
of hair out of your head.

634
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,635
That happened to you?

635
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,120
First day.

636
00:29:34,156 --> 00:29:37,090
God, why do you do this?

637
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,294
Look, we don't have
to like all of our patients.

638
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,513
But we do have to
take care of them.

639
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:45,748
Because, whoever they are,

640
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,435
they're sick and in pain.

641
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,954
And it's our job
to deal with it.

642
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,307
And sometimes,
yes, it is so hard.

643
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:56,326
But...

644
00:29:56,362 --> 00:30:00,914
not many people get a
chance to make a difference.

645
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,250
A good nurse can.

646
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:08,305
You've invested...

647
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,457
two years in this?

648
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:13,092
Student debt, I imagine?

649
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:16,296
You can always quit
on your second day.

650
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,766
Come on.

651
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:21,168
You got this. Let's go.

652
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,168
You figure out what's going
on with her blood counts?

653
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,458
No.

654
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,442
Her ICP keeps going up.

655
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:31,060
We don't have any more time.

656
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,057
You delayed this surgery
for no good reason.

657
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,047
You failed.

658
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,566
Self-important neophyte,

659
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,561
you don't even know
how much you don't know.

660
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,414
I'm gonna remove the
pressure from her brain

661
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,416
and hope it's not too
late. So, congratulations.

662
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,424
Your narcissism almost
killed your patient.

663
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,702
Saw to me.

664
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:07,008
Are you sure you're
okay to be here?

665
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,577
This is the last place
on earth I want to be,

666
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:09,883
and I won't be anywhere else.

667
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,800
Scalpel.

668
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:35,375
Lap pads. Cautery.

669
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,610
- There's too much blood.
- Get suction in, damn it.

670
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,796
Suction.

671
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,849
Oh, my God. No.

672
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:45,852
This is exactly what
Conrad said would happen.

673
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:47,353
Why isn't she clotting?

674
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:48,955
Hey, man,

675
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,907
we didn't have a choice anymore.

676
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,737
When you wait too
long, her brain swells

677
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:54,895
and she dies. You
go back in there

678
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,147
without correcting her
coagulopathy, she bleeds out.

679
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,716
It was my job to figure it out.

680
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,484
Maybe we still can.

681
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:04,871
Let's work on the differential.

682
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:06,489
Together.

683
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:08,720
Okay.

684
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:11,210
All right, she's
bleeding. It won't stop.

685
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:12,879
Why?

686
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:14,309
- And where does the blood go?
- Into the body

687
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,643
- or onto the floor.
- In this case, neither.

688
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,284
Jessica's not losing platelets.

689
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,463
Her body is destroying them.

690
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:22,722
Hemolysis, low platelets,

691
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:24,224
renal dysfunction, fever.

692
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:26,460
- It's got to be TTP.
- Oh, God.

693
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:28,907
If she has TTP, her platelet
count will just keep dropping.

694
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:30,397
She'll never clot.

695
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:31,859
This surgery is
going to kill her,

696
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,510
and I gave the okay
to go ahead with it.

697
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,501
Now that we know what it is,

698
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,853
we can treat it.

699
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,855
So you're gonna
start plasmapheresis

700
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:40,290
while she's in surgery?

701
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,395
Hell yeah, he is.

702
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,478
<i>Move faster. Get that bleeder.</i>

703
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,869
I'm moving as fast as I
can. It's oozing everywhere.

704
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:54,105
Keep hanging those platelets.

705
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,123
Get out of my OR! Now!

706
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:01,127
<i>I'm chief of surgery.</i>

707
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,313
<i>Every OR in Chastain is my OR.</i>

708
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,798
<i>Hawkins stays.</i>

709
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,695
- What's happening?
- Jessica has TTP.

710
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,531
- Giving her more platelets
won't help.
- Scrub nurse, ignore him.

711
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:12,656
- I need you with me
on this cautery.
- All you.

712
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,518
- Conrad, I'll get access.
- Thank you.

713
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:16,709
You can do that
plasmapheresis when I'm done.

714
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:21,126
You have no idea
even if you're right,

715
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,166
let alone if it's gonna help.

716
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,679
Okay, now we can cauterize.

717
00:33:39,668 --> 00:33:41,184
Now she has a chance.

718
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:53,179
Dr. Bell, just wanted
to congratulate you.

719
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:54,681
What for?

720
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:57,266
Heard you made a
very lucrative deal today.

721
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:58,779
- DiaCure Dialysis Centers.
- Yeah.

722
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,104
They gave us a great
price for exclusivity.

723
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,874
That deserves an
"attaboy" from the new veep.

724
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,221
What kind of kickback did
they offer us for the contract?

725
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:09,662
Some data we required
for patient safety,

726
00:34:09,697 --> 00:34:12,010
and they committed to help
us with the money we need

727
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:13,677
- to fill out our nursing staff.
- Whoa.

728
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:15,613
Punching above
your weight there.

729
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,265
I'll make the call on
where the money goes.

730
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,721
I'm thinking Neuro.

731
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,007
Barrett's got a laundry
list of line items.

732
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,525
Barrett?

733
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,288
You on a first-name
basis with Dr. Cain?

734
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,946
We go way back. He's
the one who got me this job.

735
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,799
Lured me away from a
hedge fund on the West Coast.

736
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,532
You have no
background in health care.

737
00:34:34,556 --> 00:34:38,074
I have a
background... in profits.

738
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:41,956
Well, this profit
goes for more nurses.

739
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,774
It's... it's part of
the agreement.

740
00:34:43,798 --> 00:34:45,164
It can't be undone.

741
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,635
No more deals like this
again without my input.

742
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,094
Hey. I'm just gonna
change the dressing.

743
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:09,839
All right, let's see
what we have.

744
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:23,286
There isn't very much
blood around the incision.

745
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,804
It's starting to clot.

746
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,124
We'll get another CBC.

747
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,980
Yeah, well, we can send
it in, but this is good news.

748
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:35,966
The plasmapheresis is working.

749
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,685
She still might not wake up.

750
00:35:40,022 --> 00:35:42,288
And if she does,

751
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:44,468
we have no idea what
kind of shape she'll be in.

752
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:47,510
We'll know more in 24 hours.

753
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:00,490
- Hey, Dad, wait.
- Oh, Nic.

754
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,225
I just finished my shift.

755
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:05,328
- You need something?
- Look, um...

756
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,323
Thanks for being here today.

757
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,516
I love volunteering.

758
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:17,390
I know you were scared
that it was me when you heard

759
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,375
about the accident this morning.

760
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,827
I brushed you off.

761
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,880
I'm sorry I did that.

762
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,753
You're all I got, kid.

763
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,031
We're Team Nevin now.

764
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:06,923
Still no change in Jessica.

765
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,428
What's this?

766
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,299
DiaCure records.

767
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:18,969
You got them.

768
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:20,436
Yeah.

769
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,573
It's worse than we thought.

770
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,776
20% higher complication
rate with Hemopleatin.

771
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:30,029
Look at all these PEs.

772
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,267
This drug is probably
what killed Jessie.

773
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:35,952
I think so.

774
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:40,807
What do you think
the next step is?

775
00:37:42,411 --> 00:37:44,238
Tomorrow I go in to
see Bell and Red Rock,

776
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,302
and get this drug
pulled off the shelves.

777
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,397
Permanently.

778
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,134
You know how
dangerous that is, Conrad?

779
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,119
Big Pharma is ruthless.

780
00:37:53,154 --> 00:37:54,804
They could go after you.

781
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,440
They always like to
discredit the messenger.

782
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,758
The numbers don't lie.

783
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,154
We'll make sure what
happened to Jessie

784
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,161
doesn't happen to anyone else.

785
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,017
Her death could save lives.

786
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,681
As awful as this is, I
learned something today.

787
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,820
I really love her.

788
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,517
I don't think I
realized how much

789
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,421
until I thought I
might lose her.

790
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:40,183
If she comes back
to me, I'll tell her.

791
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:46,239
Please come back to me.

792
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,960
We all see how much
you guys love each other.

793
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,695
You know, I beat myself up

794
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,964
about leaving
Priya at the altar.

795
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,518
But now I know it was right.

796
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:03,123
Because what we
had... it wasn't this.

797
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:06,075
Don't make this
about you, Pravesh.

798
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:08,744
Hey.

799
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:13,416
Thank you.

800
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,002
Oh!

801
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:17,854
- Um, okay.
- It's happening.

802
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,339
Give into it.

803
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:21,391
- Oh, that's tight. But...
- Yeah.

804
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:23,592
Come on. There you go.

805
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:25,011
Oh, buddy.

806
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,218
Hmm, you're certain you
have enough patient information

807
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,672
to prove that Hemopleatin
is causing sudden death

808
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,552
in a significant
number of patients?

809
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,109
Yes.

810
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,162
We need to pull it
immediately and warn the FDA.

811
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:45,359
No, I've looked over the
data; Dr. Hawkins is right.

812
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,179
The complication
rate is off the charts.

813
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:50,920
I'll-I'll have my people
go over the figures,

814
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,555
and if this checks out,

815
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,391
we'll use it to
make a PR splash.

816
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:59,228
Chastain catches a deadly drug

817
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,375
- and saves patients.
- And in the meantime,

818
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,417
we can go back to using an
older drug that we know to be safe.

819
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,080
And, more good news,
it's actually cheaper.

820
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:09,538
Well, that's a huge
win on all fronts.

821
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,241
- Really nice work.
- All right.

822
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:13,676
Thank you.

823
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,312
That info...

824
00:40:16,348 --> 00:40:19,883
was part of the DiaCure deal.

825
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,734
So you helped him?

826
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,269
Yeah. Yeah.

827
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:26,956
But I'm happy to let the
hospital take the credit.

828
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,811
Okay.

829
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,885
Wake up.

830
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:00,756
Me or her?

831
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:01,991
Both, I think.

832
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,243
- Mm.
- Jess? Honey?

833
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:05,828
- Jess?
- Mm.

834
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,114
Can you hear me?

835
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,461
- Mm.
- Can you hear me? Hey. Hey.

836
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:12,630
- Hey. Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Careful, careful.

837
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:13,797
Shh, shh. No, don't do that.

838
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:15,332
- You're okay. Hey.
- Hey, Jess.

839
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:16,789
Honey.

840
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:18,007
Hey. You're okay.

841
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,825
You're fine. You're fine.

842
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:25,815
It's a long story, but
everything's gonna be just fine.

843
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:34,490
Okay. Here we go. Here we go.

844
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,120
You could use
some vittles in ya.

845
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:37,488
All right. I'll eat now.

846
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:39,978
- This is a mess.
- Do the honors.

847
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,792
- This looks good.
- Yeah, this is not
from the cafeteria.

848
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,460
Okay, I want the little
baby one over here.

849
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:45,568
I heard the good news.

850
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,670
- Dr. Hawkins, a word?
- Yeah, sure thing.

851
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:57,646
I just want to say, I, uh,
appreciate what you did,

852
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,676
and I actually regret
that we had words.

853
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,696
It-it was an emotional
day for all of us.

854
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,253
No doubt. No doubt.

855
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,939
But don't ever question
my decision again.

856
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,644
Well, when I'm wrong,

857
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,374
I've learned to listen
to my colleagues.

858
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:14,764
You're not a colleague.

859
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,394
You're a subordinate
and I don't give a damn

860
00:42:16,418 --> 00:42:17,717
what your process is.

861
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:19,869
You're not invincible, you know.

862
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:23,973
No one is.

863
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:27,126
You sure about that?

864
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,744
We on the same page?

865
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,047
You tell me.

866
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:50,916
Hawkins is a whistleblower.

867
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:55,388
My concern is him deciding
in his self-righteous way

868
00:42:55,423 --> 00:42:58,891
that Red Rock is doing
something he doesn't like.

869
00:42:58,926 --> 00:43:01,644
That's not something
I can live with.

870
00:43:02,964 --> 00:43:04,647
Then there's our answer.

871
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:08,934
He's a threat to the hospital.

872
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:13,239
I'll handle it.
