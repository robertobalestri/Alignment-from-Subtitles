00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,846
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- Our relationship,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,271
it is perfect just like this.

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,168
He'll be a vegetable. It's
the compassionate choice

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,558
at this point.

5
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,087
Are you suggesting
we let him die?

6
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,611
Nobody, and I mean<i>
nobody,</i> dies in my OR!

7
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,191
<i>This is Dawn Long.</i>

8
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:15,964
<i>She's been in LTACH
this whole time?</i>

9
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,250
Dawn Long had<i> Candida auris.</i>

10
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,834
<i>Anybody who'd come into contat</i>

11
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,032
<i>with Ms. Long will have to
take extreme precautions.</i>

12
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,166
If it gets out now that
we have a deadly fungus,

13
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,657
this hospital goes bankrupt.

14
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,819
<i>Has this vent been
used in the last 24 hours?</i>

15
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:27,971
<i>It's been down here</i>

16
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,156
for the decontamination process.

17
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,147
- Clean it now.
- Lunch. Half hour.

18
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:34,549
Daddy's still very sick?

19
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:36,596
He's fighting to get
better. They want to put you

20
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,248
on a ventilator to
help you breathe.

21
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,032
Sleep tight, Daddy.

22
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,528
- Thank you.
- There you go.

23
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,531
Hey. How was that?

24
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:51,061
Intrusive.

25
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:53,552
They're swabbing
armpit and groin.

26
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,537
Humiliating but necessary.

27
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,255
You don't need a mask, Zorro.

28
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,558
This is<i> Candida
auris,</i> not coronavirus.

29
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,354
It travels on skin
and equipment.

30
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:03,211
It isn't airborne.

31
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:05,413
And you're scaring people.

32
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,881
Shouldn't they be scared?

33
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,194
No. We've contacted

34
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,735
the health department, and it
is all being handled properly.

35
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,338
And why are you here, anyway?

36
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,167
Only people who
have been in contact

37
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:17,271
with infected patients
need to be swabbed.

38
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,661
Can never be too safe.

39
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:21,196
Excuse me.

40
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,427
<i>Transition team to OR Four.</i>

41
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,684
<i>Transition team to OR Four.</i>

42
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,135
Where are we?

43
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,721
We think the fungus
has been contained.

44
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,617
<i>Think</i> but don't
know for certain.

45
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,074
Randolph, do you think

46
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:34,771
we should have Derek
transferred to Atlanta General?

47
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,072
- I really don't think
that that's necessary.
- Well,

48
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,479
all his doctors are at
Chastain. His chemo protocol

49
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,092
is here. And, Kit, we're
taking every precaution.

50
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:43,085
Plus, Derek had zero crosses
with the infected patients.

51
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:46,255
Okay, but if there's any
sign that this is spreading...

52
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:50,441
- I want him out.
- Agreed.

53
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,106
So, you fell while
salsa dancing?

54
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,908
- Yeah.
- And took down a table
full of mojitos.

55
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:57,610
- Ouch. I wanted to bring him in

56
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:00,118
last night, but he
swore he was fine.

57
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,937
I<i> am</i> fine.

58
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:04,422
I just lost my balance
during that final spin.

59
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,152
- Follow my finger.
- Mm-hmm.

60
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,037
You don't lose your
balance, Miguel.

61
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,145
He's the 2003 Salsa
Planet champion.

62
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,590
- Did you know that?
- And 2002.

63
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:13,309
- Back-to-back, baby.
- Impressive.

64
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,799
You still compete?

65
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,169
Now I teach. Oh.

66
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,188
First lesson is
free at my studio.

67
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,524
I love salsa. Thank you.

68
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,109
Uh, Miguel, will you
unbutton your shirt for me?

69
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,128
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

70
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,901
Is that a pacemaker?

71
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:37,138
No, it's a, uh,
it's a defibrillator.

72
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,424
What's that for, hon?

73
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,638
It's nothing to worry about,
<i>corazón.</i> It's probably broken,

74
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,489
- anyway.
- Is that why you fell?

75
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:44,746
Because it shocked you?

76
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,065
Maybe.

77
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,111
Okay. So it sounds
like either your heart

78
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,403
or your defibrillator
needs some attention.

79
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,145
Am I allowed to be happy?

80
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,280
- Chemo's working.
- The tumor's

81
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,182
- shrinking, Kit.
- Thank you.

82
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,701
We waited for you, Mom.

83
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:08,202
We're ready to extubate.

84
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,690
I love your dress.

85
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,025
Daddy gave it to me.

86
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,156
Well, your daddy's
recovery is amazing.

87
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,100
Well, he's got
a lot to live for.

88
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:36,514
- Hi, honey.
- Do you like my dress, Daddy?

89
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,318
Oh, it's gonna take him a minute
for him to wake up, sweetie.

90
00:03:41,338 --> 00:03:44,039
I've got so many
things to tell you.

91
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,523
Sarah's dog is having puppies,

92
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,925
and Mom said we
could adopt one, maybe.

93
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,814
Hi, there.

94
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,784
Welcome back.

95
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,303
You don't have to answer the
thing about the puppy right now.

96
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,822
How do you feel?

97
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:02,975
I can't see.

98
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,095
Molly, I can't see. I can't see.

99
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,730
- What's going on, Mom?
- I don't know.

100
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,584
Can you see anything at all?

101
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,385
Nope. Nothing.

102
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,800
What's happening?

103
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,173
Could it be the cancer?

104
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,760
A-a brain bleed
while he was sedated?

105
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,679
We're gonna get him
a head CT immediately,

106
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:26,180
and figure out what this is.

107
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,333
It's okay.

108
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,320
♪ ♪

109
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,047
Here's what's dumb.

110
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,450
I don't even
really like popcorn.

111
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,247
Well, who doesn't
love butter and salt?

112
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:49,954
Truth. Which is why,
when I was starving

113
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,784
and my options
were vending machine

114
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:54,275
or a dumpster
dive, I bought a bag.

115
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,046
Basically inhaled it and somehow
got a kernel stuck in my molar.

116
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,115
And you tried to remove it

117
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,761
- with a paper clip?
- I mean, that wasn't
my first play.

118
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:04,447
I did try a toothpick
like a human.

119
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,438
Uh, brushing, flossing,

120
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,823
and then my fingernails
when I got desperate.

121
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,959
But then I guess I just...

122
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,360
got used to it.

123
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,424
I figured it would eventually
come out on its own.

124
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,882
Well, let's make sure
it's nothing serious.

125
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,084
How long have you been
experiencing jaw pain?

126
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,735
A few weeks.

127
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,738
I know, I know. I should've
gone to the dentist.

128
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:26,141
But I'm only working
with basic health insurance

129
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:29,544
and a public radio salary here.

130
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,830
And I have my
son's tuition to pay.

131
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,331
So, when I woke up this morning,

132
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,044
it was like I was
being stabbed in the...

133
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,951
Justine?

134
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:37,964
I need some help over here.

135
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,354
Grab her legs.

136
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,075
Tilt your head toward me.

137
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,210
Going in slowly.

138
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,047
You see that?

139
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,250
White lesions.

140
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,020
So I didn't have a stroke?

141
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,666
No. The CT confirmed that.

142
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,773
And it doesn't look
like cancer, either.

143
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:00,107
Then why can't I see?

144
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:04,829
You have an
infection in your eyes.

145
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,650
Okay. So we can fix this,
right? And he'll see again.

146
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:16,140
I'll be right back.

147
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,842
We can talk more

148
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,545
after the eye doctor
finishes his exam.

149
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,530
Hang in there.

150
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,133
Okay...

151
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:28,030
so all the tests from
the hospital staff

152
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,115
and the patients have come back;
no one else has been colonized.

153
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,156
So it can't be<i> Candida auris.</i>

154
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,020
The labs will confirm
that one way or another,

155
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:36,678
but let's get him on contact
precautions just in case.

156
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:38,574
Gowns and gloves for
anyone who enters his room.

157
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,176
And if he does
have it, what's next?

158
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,734
Fevers. His blood
pressure drops...

159
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,019
Sophia died within a
day of being diagnosed.

160
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:48,055
Be straight with me. Is
that what we're looking at?

161
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,826
It is a pan-resistant
strain of<i> candida.</i>

162
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,189
And we don't have
the medicine to treat it.

163
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,946
Let's focus on what we can do.

164
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,359
Yeah, let's start him on GCSF.

165
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:59,150
Jump-start his immune system,
trend his labs every six hours,

166
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,369
and watch his blood
pressure like a hawk.

167
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,703
Did you learn something?

168
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:05,740
Molly...

169
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:07,119
until we know what
we're dealing with here,

170
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,193
it's best Josie
doesn't go in the room.

171
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,596
- Grandma?
- Okay, what's going on?

172
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,151
- Grandma.
- Yes?

173
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,582
Do you have any more of these?

174
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:16,401
They're really pretty.

175
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,088
Hey...

176
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,776
- Oh, my God.
- What?

177
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,894
This is Dawn Long's vent.

178
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,741
Her daughter put
that sticker on it.

179
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:31,900
You mean, if it wasn't
properly cleaned...

180
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:33,712
Kit, if that's true,
Derek probably

181
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:35,820
got<i> Candida auris</i>
from that vent.

182
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,406
And now Michelle has a
cold, so I have an extra ticket

183
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,963
to my friend's show at The Loft.

184
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,615
Be my plus-one.

185
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:51,802
Oh, I'd love to, but it's
my folks' 45th anniversary.

186
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,150
- Mm.
- I'm sure Torres would
love to roll.

187
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,207
Eh, pass.

188
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,620
Really?

189
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,044
He showed so much promise.

190
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,330
Fleeting attraction.
You know how it is.

191
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:08,970
45 years of marriage. Wow.

192
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:10,889
Yeah. You know what?

193
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,975
They still love each other
like it was the first day.

194
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,861
Huh. Something to aspire to.

195
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,813
Hmm.

196
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:19,958
I didn't want it in
me in the first place.

197
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:21,699
I feel strong as an ox.

198
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,018
For God's sake, I'm only 55.

199
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:28,106
Mr. Espinoza, I am Dr. Austin.

200
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,458
This is Dr. Okafor.

201
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,204
We're gonna see what's
going on with this ICD, okay?

202
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:34,929
Probably shocked me by mistake.

203
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:37,649
I went in for a physical,
three, four months ago.

204
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,651
My doctor saw my swollen feet.

205
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,187
Of course they swell. I dance.

206
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,173
But he told me I
had heart failure.

207
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,958
I still don't believe it.

208
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,009
My heart has never failed.

209
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,913
Except it did.

210
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,994
Are you sure?

211
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,868
Yeah, we are.

212
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,104
Would you like
us to get your wife

213
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,572
before we talk more?

214
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,274
- I don't have a wife.
- Your girlfriend?

215
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,170
The woman who was
with you in the ER?

216
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:06,434
Probably home with her husband.

217
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,814
Just tell me what
I need to know.

218
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:14,101
Oh, Miguel,

219
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,505
your device worked
exactly as it should have.

220
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,202
Your heart went
into a deadly rhythm

221
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,392
while you were dancing,

222
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,676
and your ICD shocked
you back to life.

223
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:26,514
You're saying without it...

224
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:27,999
I might have died?

225
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,083
Yes.

226
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,854
Well, will this happen again?

227
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,684
Well, your heart is
functioning at 25%,

228
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,353
so it's very likely
it will happen

229
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,776
when you exert yourself.

230
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,780
Like when I'm dancing.

231
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:47,185
Salsa is my life.

232
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,169
My livelihood.

233
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,541
I don't know how
to do anything else.

234
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,696
Tell you what.

235
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,198
When we get your tests back,

236
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,153
Dr. Okafor and I
will review them

237
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,720
and see if there's
anything more we can do.

238
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,571
How's Josie?

239
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:25,290
She didn't want to leave.

240
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,692
But the sitter took her
to the children's museum,

241
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,362
so that will help.

242
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,446
Any news?

243
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:33,397
The cultures came back,

244
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,967
and Derek has what we suspected.

245
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,930
A<i> Candida auris</i>
bloodstream infection

246
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:40,066
that traveled to his eyes.

247
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,607
- So we're starting him
on antifungals?
- Yes.

248
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,145
But it's a drug-resistant
strain, Molly.

249
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,398
Our existing medications
are likely impotent against it.

250
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:53,451
- And his immune system
is so weak...
- No.

251
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,963
No, he can't get
better one minute

252
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,754
and have no hope the next.

253
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,157
There's got to be something
we're not thinking of.

254
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,753
Conrad is working with
our infectious disease team

255
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:02,438
to see if there's
anything we can try.

256
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,312
I'm...

257
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:05,797
really hot.

258
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,632
I don't feel right at all.

259
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,968
Your fever's spiking.

260
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,503
We'll get you some
acetaminophen.

261
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,826
He's getting worse.

262
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:20,845
That's Conrad now.

263
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,665
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

264
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:28,803
Christy, he needs
some acetaminophen.

265
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:30,855
Right away.

266
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,187
How do you feel?

267
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,990
Excuse me?

268
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:52,794
My son-in-law is blind
because of<i> Candida auris,</i>

269
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:54,962
and it's probably
going to kill him.

270
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:57,765
So, again, how do you feel?

271
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,117
I had nothing to do with that.

272
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,170
You had everything
to do with it.

273
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:04,149
You knew your patient
had a deadly fungus,

274
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,068
and you covered it up
to save your own skin.

275
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,542
But not well enough.

276
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,221
Dawn's vent wasn't
properly cleaned

277
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,545
and that vent went to Derek.

278
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,726
I gave specific instructions
to sterilize her room

279
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,082
and all the equipment.

280
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,884
Well, you failed.

281
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,119
And now my daughter
will lose her husband,

282
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,406
my grandchild her
father and Derek his life.

283
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:26,844
And you better hope that
doesn't happen, because if it does,

284
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,113
I will destroy you.

285
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,851
I'm sorry, Kit.

286
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,364
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

287
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,137
Of course you can't.

288
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,374
Because you've likely
never loved anyone.

289
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,081
- What is all this?
- Derek's best hope.

290
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,657
It's a modified
drug-testing bioprinter.

291
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,143
Translation, please?

292
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,522
We know that Derek's<i>
candida</i> is resistant

293
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,329
to all individual drugs,

294
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,582
but how about a
combination of those drugs?

295
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,713
Yes, it would take
days to test them all...

296
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,431
He barely has hours, Conrad.

297
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,950
That's where this
printer comes in.

298
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:14,225
We're testing 96
different combinations

299
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,721
- at the same time.
- No hits yet,

300
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:17,078
but it's early.

301
00:13:17,113 --> 00:13:19,175
Well, let's just hope
they don't come too late.

302
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,451
Derek's started to spike fevers,
and we all know what comes next.

303
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:29,724
I can't have a brain
infection. It was popcorn.

304
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,553
Children eat it
in movie theaters.

305
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,312
Come on, there's no way
this is a real thing that happens.

306
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:38,065
It's... it's extremely
unusual, but it does happen.

307
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,985
I brought in Dr. Pravesh
to review your CT scan.

308
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,939
So, your infection traveled
through your sinuses

309
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:46,540
and into your brain here.

310
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,276
Which would explain the seizure.

311
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:51,123
So, what now?

312
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:53,748
Antibiotics that most
certainly constipate?

313
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:57,368
Justine, you may need surgery.

314
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,183
And we called in a
neurosurgery consult

315
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,956
to find out, okay?

316
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,824
Neurosurgery?

317
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,070
Dr. Reynolds should
be here shortly...

318
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,023
Dr. Reynolds is
stuck in surgery,

319
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:10,081
I'll be doing the...

320
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,199
the operation.

321
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:15,135
Barrett.

322
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:17,171
Justine.

323
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,610
I-I didn't recognize your name
when I reviewed your chart.

324
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:25,979
Oh, I got a baby, wedding,
divorce. In that order.

325
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,816
Haven't switched my name
back yet because it is a pain.

326
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,836
Ryan was a bad choice.

327
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,790
But I got the best part
of him: my awesome kid.

328
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:38,025
So, how about you? Married?

329
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,827
Only to my work.

330
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,166
And, uh, how's
Katie? And your mom?

331
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:52,039
Dr. Pravesh, Nurse Nevin,

332
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,374
I'll take it from here.

333
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,876
- Yeah, sure. Cool.
- Yeah.

334
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,832
Man, that was just
starting to get interesting.

335
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,001
Wait, do you think she's an ex?

336
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,988
Of course. Who do
you think Katie is?

337
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:08,539
Sister?

338
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,169
I don't know, child?

339
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:11,971
Huh. And he has a mom.

340
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,956
Well, he didn't just
spring fully formed

341
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,180
from Satan's head.

342
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:21,052
Well, luckily she's my
patient and a talker.

343
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,872
Maybe we'll finally
learn something

344
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:26,990
about old Barrett Cain.

345
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,576
Hmm.

346
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:34,977
- So, where are we?
- The surgery will

347
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,568
happen today, once
we've done a full workup.

348
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,397
After you're sedated,
the oral surgeon

349
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,183
will pull out the
infected tooth.

350
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,708
And then Dr. Cain will
remove a part of your skull

351
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,705
to access the infection.

352
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:49,864
Part of my skull. Okay,
that freaks me out.

353
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:52,750
Be straight with me. How much
danger are we talking here?

354
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,554
Uh, listen...

355
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,790
Surgery to the
brain is always risky.

356
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,776
But there's no other option,
and you're in great hands.

357
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:04,462
Dr. Cain is an
excellent neurosurgeon.

358
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,447
Well, some things never change.

359
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:10,468
He was always the
best at everything he did.

360
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,486
You were close, I take it?

361
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,056
College.

362
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:18,792
I was the girl with
her nose in a book.

363
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:21,395
He was the guy who
flirted me out of the library.

364
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:25,216
All my friends were like,
"What? A football player?"

365
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,295
But he had better
grades than most of them

366
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,248
and he was the star quarterback.

367
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:31,016
So Dr. Cain was
a football player.

368
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,857
He was on his way to the NFL.

369
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,053
Scouts were all
over him until...

370
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,661
- Injury?
- ACL.

371
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,129
Burnt his sports
career to the ground.

372
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,365
And by the time he
rose from the ashes

373
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,318
and started figuring out
what to do with his life,

374
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:46,637
it was over between us.

375
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:49,435
He'd changed.

376
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:51,771
He had always
been so in control,

377
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:56,080
and suddenly there was
something that he couldn't fix.

378
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,101
And he got bitter. Angry.

379
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:04,154
It wasn't what I signed
up for, so I got out.

380
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,092
Maybe I shouldn't have.

381
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,728
Maybe there's still time.

382
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,466
No.

383
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,969
I left him, and I lost him.

384
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:23,841
And now here he is
when I need him the most.

385
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:28,512
Barrett Cain is the
one who got away.

386
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,868
I'll be back.

387
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:39,524
You look like you have news.

388
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:41,993
We have a hit.

389
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,708
That's great.

390
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,506
But what works in the
lab can be starkly different

391
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,024
to what works in a person.

392
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,111
True. But it's a chance, Kit.

393
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,015
Yes.

394
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,816
Yes, it is.

395
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,056
Nice.

396
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:15,676
Excuse me?

397
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,195
He can't give up.

398
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,182
- The man has a gift.
- Mm-hmm.

399
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:23,200
Wow.

400
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:31,075
Oh...

401
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,193
What'd you find?

402
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:35,090
See? Just before he degenerates

403
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,331
- into V fib...
- The rhythm started at V tach.

404
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,934
Which means we could ablate
it. Do you think it would work?

405
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,714
In the right hands.

406
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:43,748
And luckily, the man's
prowess on the dance floor

407
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,740
is second only to my
own dexterity and grace.

408
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:50,194
I assume that means I should
get him on the cath lab schedule.

409
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,030
Yes. Now let's go give
him the good news.

410
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,998
Thanks.

411
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,601
How are you feeling, Derek?

412
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,304
Weak. Really hot.

413
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,106
My back hurts a bit.

414
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,476
- What's going on?
- You have a high fever,

415
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,055
and your blood
pressure's a little low,

416
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,796
but we're working on it.

417
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:11,209
We have a plan, but
it is gonna be tough.

418
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,734
Instead of using one
drug to fight the fungus,

419
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:15,302
we're using a combination.

420
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,266
"Voriconazole,

421
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,957
amphotericin."

422
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,920
His kidneys are just
starting to recover.

423
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:23,305
I know.

424
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,713
And I can't promise you
these drugs will work.

425
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,360
They could even make you
feel worse in the short-term.

426
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:32,269
I've been through
chemo. I can handle this.

427
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,105
Okay.

428
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:40,110
There is one more not
particularly fun thing.

429
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,246
W-We want to attack
the fungus directly.

430
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:47,001
So... we're gonna inject
the meds into your eyes.

431
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:48,464
Wait, what?

432
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,421
It won't hurt. Not with this.

433
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,672
It's numbing medicine.

434
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:53,757
It's okay.

435
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,560
I'm ready. Do it.

436
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,894
<i>Now, you're gonna want to</i>

437
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,997
<i>- chop those mushrooms...</i>
- Miguel.

438
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:07,071
We come with hope.

439
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,107
Dr. Okafor and I have
familiarized ourselves

440
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,443
with the intimate
details of your heart,

441
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,694
and we'd like to
suggest a viable option

442
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,809
to return you back to
your dancing shoes.

443
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,200
It's a procedure
called ablation.

444
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:20,713
We'll thread catheters
through the main artery

445
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:22,002
and vein in your groin

446
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:24,805
and then burn away
the part of your heart

447
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,218
that's been causing
the abnormal rhythm.

448
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:28,225
You tell me my heart is weak.

449
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:31,062
And you want to fix it
by burning bits away.

450
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,846
Miguel,

451
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,676
if this goes as
well as expected,

452
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,683
it means no more
lethal arrhythmias.

453
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:38,719
No more collapsing.

454
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,807
We saw a video of you dancing.

455
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,693
2004 championship.

456
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:47,078
The year I came in second?

457
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,616
I was cheated, you know.

458
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:55,503
Second place, first place,
you are a true master.

459
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:59,518
And if this procedure works, it
means you can continue dancing,

460
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:02,626
without shocks and without fear.

461
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,083
Doctors...

462
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:15,155
my heart is in your hands.

463
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:21,206
I need the least
incompetent scrub nurses.

464
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,880
Not Stacey, she drops
things. Not the crier.

465
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,677
Get me Candace.
I don't mind her.

466
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,185
And someone else.
Who doesn't suck?

467
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,270
Ajax is excellent.

468
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:30,771
He's passable. Get him.

469
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:33,140
Tell Chu I'll need some
extra blood on hand

470
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:35,276
and send off another
set of CBC and coags.

471
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:36,744
I don't want any surprises.

472
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,390
What's with the manic
quality control over there?

473
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:39,891
Think he cares
more about this one.

474
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:41,259
OR Four is not
gonna work for me.

475
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:43,984
I need my case in OR Five in
the new neurosurgery building.

476
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:48,972
Mm, looks like OR Five is taken.

477
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,508
Not anymore.

478
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:04,137
Justine seems pretty great.

479
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,489
She still means a lot
to you, doesn't she?

480
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,197
Few people have meant more.

481
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:31,998
So... the drugs aren't working.

482
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,984
Norepi is up to 12 mics.

483
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,197
His urine output
is trailing off.

484
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,687
The fluid has gone in already?

485
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,299
- All four liters.
- Anything on the labs?

486
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:42,109
Worsening acidosis.
Increased lactate.

487
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:43,872
- He's in septic shock.
- Yeah.

488
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,846
Derek...

489
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:47,831
it's Dr. Hawkins.
Can you hear me?

490
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,800
What is... going on?

491
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:53,036
His delirium is worsening.

492
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,472
We may need to re-intubate him.

493
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,195
Thanks.

494
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:12,039
I can't stop thinking, if Cain
had never come to Chastain,

495
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:13,885
Derek wouldn't
be in this situation.

496
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:18,061
Red Rock is destroying
everything I love.

497
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,057
I would burn it
all down, if I could.

498
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:24,117
Take a break, Kit. Get some air.

499
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,936
I'm gonna stay with Derek.

500
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,134
Mapping complete.

501
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,536
Rapid pace to induce.

502
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:48,570
- Charge the defibrillator.
- No, stop.

503
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,355
He's in V tach with
an unstable pressure.

504
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:52,240
We want him in V
tach while we ablate.

505
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,541
I know, but his pressure's
50 and dropping.

506
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,082
- How long can he tolerate this?
- Until I say so.

507
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:58,502
Now is not the time to
lose your cool, Okafor.

508
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,905
Hmm. My cool is intact.

509
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,773
Excellent.

510
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,557
Ablation current on.

511
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,584
Off.

512
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:17,838
Pressure's down to 40.

513
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,026
Current on.

514
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:28,315
And...

515
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,566
off.

516
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,409
We're back.

517
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,819
And our salsa king returns.

518
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,109
Derek, let me
know if this hurts.

519
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:02,750
Oh.

520
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,620
Oh!

521
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,275
How you holding up?

522
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,427
I had to leave the
room for a minute.

523
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:14,795
Thought I should get food.

524
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,096
As if I can stand to eat.

525
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:17,680
How is he doing?

526
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:21,084
Not good.

527
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,903
The meds haven't done a thing.

528
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:26,284
I was the one who brought
Derek to this hospital.

529
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:27,952
- It's, it's not your fault.
- I thought he would be safe.

530
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,771
I thought he'd
be safe here, too.

531
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:33,213
And as far as the blame goes,
we know where that belongs.

532
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:35,582
He's dying, Randolph.

533
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,067
Let's go!

534
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,119
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

535
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:40,120
What's happening?

536
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:41,554
We're going to MRI.

537
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,750
- What's going on?
- Come with me, I'll explain.

538
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,391
What are we looking for?

539
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:51,632
That.

540
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,133
An abscess on his spine.

541
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:54,179
Which usually isn't
good news, but...

542
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:57,203
But in this case
it is, in a way.

543
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:58,733
It explains why
he's getting sicker.

544
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,058
That abscess is
continuously releasing fungus

545
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,160
into Derek's bloodstream.

546
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:06,012
So, our drugs might
actually be working.

547
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:08,382
But they just can't reach
that walled-off abscess.

548
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:09,383
What tipped you off?

549
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:11,368
His back hurt,

550
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,887
<i>so I examined his spine...
Exquisite tenderness</i>

551
00:26:13,923 --> 00:26:15,516
at the exact spot
of the abscess.

552
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,552
So he'll need spinal surgery
to remove the abscess

553
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,893
or he'll never be able
to clear the infection.

554
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:21,995
Well, it won't be a simple case.

555
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,115
The infection has eroded
into the vertebral body.

556
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,867
We'll have to take out the bone.

557
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:28,918
And we're dealing
with the cord here.

558
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,815
If we so much as touch
it while we're in there,

559
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,722
Derek wakes up paralyzed.

560
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,825
He needs a neurosurgeon.

561
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:39,380
Cain is the best.

562
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:42,166
That cannot be the answer.

563
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,134
It's the only answer.

564
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,905
I've booked your case in
our new neurosurgery building

565

- New. I like new.

These aren't the
best circumstances,

569
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,990

to see you again.

576
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,207
Okay.

577
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:33,800
A nasty spinal
abscess. Unfortunate.

578
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:35,486

00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:38,190
But no one dies,
right? In your OR.

705
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:41,027
We can still save her?

706
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,731
There's not a
person here to save.

707
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:47,717
Time of death...

708
00:34:49,738 --> 00:34:51,988
18:47.

709
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,054
Mommy!

710
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:12,208
Mm. Hi, sweetie.

711
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,426
How was the museum?

712
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:16,179
I thought he was getting better.

713
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,181
The tubes and wires are back on.

714
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,667
Hopefully not for long.

715
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,619
His fever's down.

716
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:25,388
Now that the abscess is
gone, the drugs are working.

717
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:28,758
Look what I made for Daddy.
Do you think he'll like it?

718
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,995
Ah, let me guess. One
of Sarah's puppies?

719
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,330
I already named her Penny.

720
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,667
Do you want to sit with Daddy?

721
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,204
Daddy, you're
going to like Penny.

722
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,640
She won't bark, like
Uncle Steve's dog.

723
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:46,926
I'm afraid to ask,

724
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:49,128
but do you think he'll
be able to see again?

725
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:52,498
Honestly, I don't know.

726
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:55,134
I hope so.

Don't you think
she's gonna be fluffy?

732
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,783
This is Grandma Kit.

738
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,939
Yeah, that's supposed
to be good news.

739
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:35,891
And my trumpet metaphor
was a pretty clever one.

740
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,711
