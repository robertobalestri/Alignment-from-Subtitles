1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,163
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
<i>- Today is the day</i>

2
00:00:04,187 --> 00:00:05,632
<i>we introduce 3B Life
to the American public.</i>

3
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:07,067
<i>It's only a matter of time</i>

4
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,518
before the board
realizes that you

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,803
swiped an opportunity
from underneath them.

6
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:11,904
- What do you want?
- A healthy percentage of our

7
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,128
growing supplement business.

8
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:14,796
I loved my sister very much.

9
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:16,982
<i>The grief and guilt consumed me.</i>

10
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,512
<i>Emotions can enrich our lives,
but they can also destroy us.</i>

11
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:21,832
<i>I want you to be my
baby's godmother.</i>

12
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:24,584
<i>There was only one person
I wanted to hear me speak,</i>

13
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,092
<i>so I imagined that
person was there.</i>

14
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,661
Dr. Pravesh, have you ever
saved a princess before?

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,941
<i>You're fired. I don't
know who I am right now.</i>

16
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,325
I don't know who I'll be if I
can't be a doctor anymore.

17
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:48,947
Mina, these intervals
look good to me.

18
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,349
- Second opinion?
- Agree. QT isn't prolonged.

19
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,785
Great. Azithromycin it is.

20
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,288
I am writing you a prescription
for five days of an antibiotic.

21
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,691
You can pick it up at the
mobile pharmacy outside.

22
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,427
- How many people have you seen?
- 18 or 19.

23
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,307
We have to see them
faster. I just looked outside...

24
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,942
The line's even longer
than when we got here.

25
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,465
Where are they all coming from?

26
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,918
Mountains, remote farms, towns.

27
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:11,464
It's a medical
dead zone for miles.

28
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,021
No hospital anywhere nearby.

29
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:15,873
It's hard to believe we're only
three hours outside of Atlanta.

30
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,726
But here we are.

31
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,395
I wheeze all the time.

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,310
Show us how you
use your inhaler.

33
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,484
Let me teach you how
to do that the right way.

34
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,134
No more spinning.
Thank you, that...

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,827
is that like some kind of yoga

36
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,573
or tai chi or something?

37
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,281
You're like some sort of guru.

38
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:41,816
Yeah.

39
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,571
They were able to
make your glasses.

40
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,973
I can read the sign.

41
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,009
- How do I look?
- Perfect.

42
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:55,314
That baby took a three-hour nap?

43
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,359
You have to tell me

44
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,433
how to make her
do that at night.

45
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,913
- Thank you.
- I'm going to propose
to my new nanny.

46
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:03,438
- Not what I expected.
- Um, why isn't Conrad here?

47
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:06,007
Do not tell him
I said this, but...

48
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,870
I miss seeing his
face at Chastain.

49
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:08,944
I know. Me too.

50
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,346
But Search &
Rescue just called him

51
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:14,282
for a last-minute mission. So...

52
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,979
Oh.

53
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,775
Search & Rescue,
that's very funny.

54
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:31,933
It's not for you.

55
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,197
- We found a lost kid
up in Sweetwater.
- Oh,

56
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,204
right. Your volunteer work.

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,034
Nic's volunteer work.
My volunteer work.

58
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,098
We're all volunteers.

59
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,362
Uh...

60
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,958
Look, I'm sorry about all this.

61
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:47,849
I-I just... I didn't see
the "no parking" sign,

62
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:50,902
it's-it's stupid, and I got a
ride share app on my phone,

63
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,149
but now my credit card
doesn't work, I... Well...

64
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,541
Family, no apologies.
Come on. I'll get you home.

65
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,510
Ah, this is my patient. Hold on.

66
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,642
Hello?

67
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,828
<i>Dr. Hawkins, it's
Archer Loggins.</i>

68
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,217
I wanted to thank you.

69
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,721
You've helped me and Adelaide
so much these past couple years.

70
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,573
Well, that's my job, Archer.

71
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,819
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

72
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:15,827
You'll stay on as
Adelaide's doctor, right?

73
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,590
- Keep an eye on her?
<i>- Of course.</i>

74
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,814
- Why you asking me that?
<i>- Oh,</i>

75
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,684
uh, no reason. No reason at all.

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,436
Just take care of her.

77
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,688
<i>I know she's in good hands.</i>

78
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:30,208
Thank you for all you've done.

79
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,777
<i>Archer, what's going on?</i>

80
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:32,961
Where are you right now?

81
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,950
<i>This is Archer Loggins.</i>

82
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,490
<i>Leave a message.</i>

83
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,111
Is everything all right?

84
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,239
I think my patient
might hurt himself.

85
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,223
We have to go check
on him. Let's go.

86
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:08,625
Oh. Well, look at
that. I didn't know

87
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,114
doctors still made house calls.

88
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,962
I got your address from a
friend in medical records.

89
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,051
I hope that's okay.

90
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,936
- Oh, sure.
- Archer called me,

91
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:15,954
he didn't sound like
himself, Adelaide.

92
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:16,955
Can I come in and
speak with him?

93
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,067
I want to make sure he's okay.

94
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,402
Of course. He's
taking a little nap.

95
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,959
The MS makes him tired.

96
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,122
- Hi, Kyle Nevin. Chastain angel.
- Come on in.

97
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:24,529
Pleasure to meet you.

98
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:30,168
Archer, hon? I have
Dr. Hawkins here.

99
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:32,370
He wants to say hello.

100
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,739
Why is this door locked?

101
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,642
Archer, open the door.

102
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,078
We've never locked that
door. Archer, answer me.

103
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,964
We need to break in
and check on him, okay?

104
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:46,634
- No. No, no, no, no...
- It's okay. It's okay, Archer. What did you take?

105
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,255
Call 911. Tell them we have
attempted suicide by overdose.

106
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,909
- The pills, Archer. I see oxycodone.
- I didn't take any yet.

107
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:55,994
- I swear.
- Archer...

108
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,650
♪ ♪

109
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,164
I got sneezed on. Twice.

110
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,133
And I'm 70% certain

111
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,330
that the puddle I just
stepped in was not water.

112
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:23,137
Oh, it's the ER. The
puddle is never water.

113
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:26,607
Embrace the gross.

114
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:28,476
Dr. Pravesh.

115
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,947
Nadine.

116
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,132
It's good to see
you again. Wh...

117
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,051
- What happened here?
- I'm, like,

118
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,454
the third Emory DJ
with one of these.

119
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:41,455
Someone set up a
new overhead shelf

120
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:43,007
in the sound booth.

121
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:46,578
I stood up too fast,
forgot it was there. Bonk.

122
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,012
Did you lose consciousness?

123
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,131
Any, uh, changes
in vision, confusion?

124
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,132
Mm-mmm.

125
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,869
A head bonk brought
you to the ER?

126
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,905
With your medical history, it
was smart of you to come in.

127
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,491
Nadine was recently
diagnosed with moyamoya

128
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,326
and had a cerebral bypass.

129
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,242
Okay. Look straight
ahead for me.

130
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,182
Pupils equal,
round and reactive.

131
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:09,184
Follow my finger.

132
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:11,202
So far everything looks fine.

133
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,305
She doesn't even need stitches.

134
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:16,775
Nadine, does your head hurt?

135
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,543
No, but could you
admit me overnight?

136
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,212
To be safe?

137
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,698
Why don't we start by letting
Dr. Dreyfuss finish your exam,

138
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,902
and you staying in the ER
a little while for observation?

139
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:28,536
Great.

140
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:31,039
Then I can spend
the day observing you.

141
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:35,743
Um... okay, but
there might not be

142
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:37,757
anything interesting
to observe. I'm just...

143
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,780
Well, I mean, there's that guy.

144
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,290
- Andrea.
- Hey.

145
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,277
- So, what do you got there?
- Samples of our new supplement.

146
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,212
And since Chastain is a partner,

147
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,230
they're letting me
set up a display.

148
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,915
- Andrea.
- Hey.

149
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,963
I didn't think we were setting
up the 3B displays today.

150
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,114
I know. The supplements
came in earlier than I thought,

151
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:03,704
so... surprise.

152
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,875
Sweet Mother of God. Y'all were

153
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,393
on that STV program.

154
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,280
And you are more
dashing in person,

155
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:14,282
if it's even possible.

156
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,618
I swear, I saw
that handsome face

157
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:19,754
come across my TV,
and the next thing I know,

158
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:22,057
$30 disappeared right
out of my checkbook.

159
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,276
- Can I get a picture?
- Oh, sure.

160
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,295
You don't mind, do you, hon?

161
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:29,948
'Course not.

162
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,301
The ladies at the book
club are gonna flip.

163
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:36,437
Cheese.

164
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,007
<i>The ambulance is</i>

165
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,088
- on its way.
- I-I don't need an ambulance.

166
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,596
- I didn't take any of the pills.
- Archer, this is

167
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,947
an interrupted suicide attempt.

168
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:47,693
Legally, you need a
full psych evaluation.

169
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,311
I never should have
had the surgery.

170
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,354
You have MS. You fell
and fractured your spine.

171
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,469
You were in pain. You
needed the operation.

172
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,818
But the bills.

173
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,877
The cost... It...
it's catastrophic.

174
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,461
Too young for Medicare,

175
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:02,997
too much money for Medicaid,
and our insurance deductible

176
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,216
is... so high.

177
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,180
We're already maxed
out on what we can pay.

178
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:08,769
And then, after the surgery,

179
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,554
this arrived.

180
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:17,011
Chastain used an
out-of-network anesthesiologist

181
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,197
who charged $15,000?

182
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,149
Did Chastain make you aware
of the out-of-network cost?

183
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:25,136
No. But we thought
that it was a mistake.

184
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,139
We couldn't pay that,
so Red Rock sued us.

185
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,843
What now? W-We go
bankrupt? And now my wife

186
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,706
- is going to be homeless
because of me.
- Shh.

187
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,679
- No, no. Come on, Arch.
- Don't...

188
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,161
You are not ending
up on the street.

189
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,634
I have life insurance.

190
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,682
- Archer...
- Enough to cover all of this.

191
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:45,673
I would rather live in a shack

192
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,759
with you by my side.

193
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,928
Uh, the ambulance is here.

194
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,147
No, I'm not gonna go.

195
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:54,777
Who's gonna pay
for that ambulance?

196
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,345
We've known each other
a long time... you know

197
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,180
I'll do everything
in my power to help.

198
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,072
But right now we need
to get you to the hospital,

199
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,892
and that is
nonnegotiable, my friend.

200
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,113
Hey. Keep an eye him.

201
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,104
Hey, Jen.

202
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,434
No meds. No restraints.

203
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,403
He'll come out
willingly. You just...

204
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,607
- What happened? He
had a gun in the drawer.

205
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,975
He pulled it out. He
pointed it at his head.

206
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,877
I tried to grab it from
him, and it went off,

207
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,312
- and it hit him in the stomach.
- Adelaide, put pressure here.

208
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,747
- Kyle, grab his legs.
- What?

209
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,048
- Grab his legs.
- Where are the paramedics?

210
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,717
After gunfire, they can't
come in until the police

211
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,061
get here... that's the law,
so we go to them. Let's go.

212
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,085
Let me guess,

213
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,604
you've been taking unregulated
colloidal silver supplements.

214
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,422
For how long?

215
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,608
Uh, over a year.

216
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,726
Well, that's why you're blue.

217
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,994
It's called argyria.

218
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,413
It's rare but it happens.

219
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:00,259
When did your
skin start to change?

220
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:01,561
Uh, it was a while ago.

221
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:03,162
It started off a
little light gray,

222
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,980
but then it just kept
going from there.

223
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,622
You know, I read an article
that said it would cure everything.

224
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:09,441
What needed to be cured?

225
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,626
Exhaustion. Sore joints.

226
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,144
The silver was supposed to scrub

227
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,139
all the toxins from
my blood, but...

228
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:17,565
this morning I could
barely crawl out of bed.

229
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,595
Well, we'll start by
running some tests, okay?

230
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,286
Just curious: when you
first went from gray to blue,

231
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:26,040
you didn't think, "I might
have a bit of a problem here"?

232
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,544
No. I thought it was cool.

233
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,974
Andrea Braydon.

234
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,443
Uh, Dr. AJ Austin.

235
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,612
Cardio-thoracic surgery.

236
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,175
Why do doctors always
name-check their specialty...

237
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,466
Is it so people will know
how important you are?

238
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,369
Well, this job is an extension

239
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,988
of our personality, so it just

240
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,356
seems natural to mention it.

241
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:01,776
And yes, it's so

242
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:04,946
people will know
how important we are.

243
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:06,964
What you got there?

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,618
Uh, 3B Life. It is a
revolutionary dietary herbal

245
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,219
and energy supplement.

246
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,639
Of course. So you are
Bell and Cain's new partner.

247
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,975
They're the new
partners. I'm the founder.

248
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,488
So now who needs
to feel important?

249
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,180
You want a sample?

250
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,632
My supplement can decrease
your risk of heart attack.

251
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,317
Oh, my heart is a specimen.

252
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,652
Improve your mental acuity.

253
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,165
My mind is at the
top of its game.

254
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,638
Increase your stamina.

255
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:32,807
Please.

256
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:34,859
Okay, right.

257
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,095
Tell you what, if you
change your mind,

258
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,280
give me a call,
I'll hook you up.

259
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,770
And if you don't
change your mind...

260
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,105
you should still call me.

261
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:50,424
Okay.

262
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,477
Unless you're spoken for.

263
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,464
Thanks.

264
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,083
- Oh, my God. I don't want to be here.
- Come on.

265
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:07,553
- You know what,
I said I didn't want to go.
- Come on, come on. We're coming.

266
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,457
- And besides...
- Come on. Joyce!

267
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:13,030
<i>Last ones. You two are lucky</i>

268
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,694
- you made it in time.
- Mm.

269
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:17,051
Four hours of back roads,
and with that one driving,

270
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,947
we're lucky we didn't
fly off the mountain.

271
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,606
- Stop it.
- So, which one of you is Joyce?

272
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,091
That one. I'm Bianca,
but this isn't about me.

273
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,361
My sister hasn't
seen a doctor in years.

274
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:28,541
- If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
- All right.

275
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:30,398
Well, let's check you out.

276
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:31,649
Deep breath in.

277
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,253
Lungs sound clear.

278
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,720
Mm-hmm. Told you.

279
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,458
What's that?

280
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,211
That is a ventricular
assist device.

281
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:45,947
Yeah. That's my VAD right there.

282
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:48,666
When my own heart went to crap
five years ago, they cut me open

283
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,401
and put it in.

284
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,920
This powers the machine
inside me so it can pump blood.

285
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,573
You know, like hearts
do when they're not crap.

286
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,425
I'm basically a
battery-operated woman.

287
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,394
Saved my life.

288
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:01,763
Why is it beeping?

289
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:03,414
Oh, must need a battery change.

290
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,166
Hold tight. I'll find 'em.

291
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,657
No, you won't.

292
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,477
They're on the counter at home.

293
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,925
I...

294
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,133
told you to put 'em in the bag.

295
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,185
Wh-Where's your hand pump?

296
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,003
That's at home, too.

297
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,633
Where's the nearest drugstore?

298
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:30,152
I can run out and
grab batteries.

299
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,770
A drugstore won't
carry that kind of battery.

300
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:34,212
We need a hospital or
the device manufacturer.

301
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,780
I'll call Life Flight, see if
they can arrange a chopper.

302
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,143
Maybe a local VAD
patient has an extra.

303
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,167
What-what if Bianca's
battery runs out?

304
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,320
Then I die.

305
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:47,286
Two VAD patients in the
area... Neither are answering

306
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,539
their phone, and Life Flight
doesn't have a free chopper.

307
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,240
The manufacturer has
batteries, but they're not local

308
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,880
and can't get them here in time.

309
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,477
The nearest
hospital is Chastain,

310
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,195
- three hours away.
- So this woman

311
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:58,652
will die because we're too
far from a friggin' battery?

312
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,172
Don't forget the
portable ultrasound.

313
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,303
<i>Already in with
the VAD batteries.</i>

314
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:05,988
Go. I'll text you
the coordinates

315
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,189
of the clinic van...
With any luck,

316
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,691
- you'll meet them there halfway.
<i>- So if we</i>

317
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,148
- don't hit any red lights...
<i>- You'll have a chance</i>

318
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,979
to get the new
batteries into your patient

319
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:14,313
before she dies. And, Mina...

320
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,537
- Ready?
- Okay, we're leaving. Thank you.

321
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,690
Drive safely.

322
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:22,826
Whoa, whoa. Uh, you ever
get any speeding tickets?

323
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,729
- No.
- Then I'm driving.

324
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,086
Gunshot wound in the abdomen.

325
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,188
80/50. Heartrate: 140.

326
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:36,273
We got to get him to the O.R.

327
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,509
You know we have to
take this from here, right?

328
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,261
Hey. We got him.

329
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,531
I promise.

330
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:46,351
Dr. Hawkins, please go
with him. You're his doctor.

331
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,735
I can't.

332
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,559
Wow, look who's back.

333
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,473
- Oh, you look great.
- Oh, thank you.

334
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,129
Oh.

335
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:02,767
My hair's still growing
back, so hence the wig.

336
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,285
- Oh.
- Yeah,

337
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,787
but at least I'm clear
for work, in theory.

338
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,856
Well, Chastain's
made a few changes.

339
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,426
There are two new scrub
nurses. We're looking for a third.

340
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:13,795
So you won't be working
any more double shifts.

341
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,230
Yeah. Doesn't look
like I'll be working at all.

342
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:18,549
I'm not on any
surgeon's schedule.

343
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,903
Well, word probably hasn't
gotten around that you're back.

344
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:23,270
Mm-hmm.

345
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:24,989
Or...

346
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,492
your colleagues just
want to ease you in.

347
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,094
Or... no one trusts me
in an operating room,

348
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,763
because my brain is, um...

349
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,100
Oh, like in a-a skillet,

350
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,584
a-an egg...

351
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,403
Your brain is not fried.

352
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,117
- Yeah.
- That's normal.

353
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,151
You're gonna have trouble
finding words for a while.

354
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,135
You're recovering
from major surgery.

355
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,005
Do you have any
trouble understanding

356
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,173
words that are spoken to you?

357
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,515
No.

358
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,466
Then you are ready.

359
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:55,019
And you'll be with me
today. Put her in six.

360
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,638
No. No, no, no. You don't
have to do that just to be nice.

361
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,624
Ask around.

362
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,093
Nobody's ever accused
me of being nice.

363
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,447
I'll see you in the O.R.

364
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,789
Bowel is torn to shreds.

365
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:17,353
Mm, close-range bullet.
No surprises there.

366
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,637
Lap pad.

367
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:20,778
At least no major
vessels were hit.

368
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,824
Lucky guy.

369
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,459
So you thinking
colostomy here, or...

370
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,977
Oh, I hope not.
That'd be a disaster

371
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,283
for this man.

372
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,147
He already has MS.
That's enough to deal with

373
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:29,470
without a colostomy bag.

374
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:30,671
Do you need the...

375
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:34,775
Retractor.

376
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,243
Yes. Perfect.

377
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,018
Why couldn't Dr. Hawkins
go with Archer?

378
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,389
Because he doesn't
work here anymore.

379
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,474
He doesn't? Why not?

380
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,293
The hospital let him go.

381
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,345
People are very upset.

382
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,282
They've got to be insane.

383
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:03,482
When do we hear
from the surgeon?

384
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:05,426
As soon as the
operation is over.

385
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,425
I don't understand...

386
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,444
how this happened.

387
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:15,733
How could I not see
that he was planning this?

388
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,121
What kind of wife am I?

389
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,891
Adelaide, I...

390
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:26,426
I-I don't know your husband.

391
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,529
But I do know one thing.

392
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:31,365
You didn't see any of this

393
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,379
because Archer didn't
want you to see it.

394
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:36,048
We always told
each other everything.

395
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,188
He was protecting you

396
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,107
because he loves you.

397
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,127
And he blames himself

398
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,297
for all this trouble that
you're both in, and...

399
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,851
So he feels ashamed.

400
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,936
I'm sure that he's
been racking his brain

401
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,355
trying to find any
way out of this,

402
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:58,943
any way to live out
his life with you and...

403
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:02,129
still make sure
that you're safe.

404
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:06,633
But he just couldn't
find any other answer.

405
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,956
Any way to save the
person that he loves...

406
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,941
and stop being a burden.

407
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,614
If someone is
desperate enough...

408
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:22,116
the worst solution in the world

409
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:25,002
starts to look like a
pretty damn good thing.

410
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,795
Says take a left here. Now.

411
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,269
I-It's louder. Wh-Why
is it doing that?

412
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,783
That's the VAD system telling
us that more battery has drained.

413
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:46,023
How much longer do I have?

414
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,108
15 minutes.

415
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:48,442
Maybe half an hour.

416
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:50,138
Then it will go to
the backup battery,

417
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,362
- and another 15 minutes.
- Where's the ambulance?

418
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:55,282
It's saying we're
still 52 minutes apart.

419
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,595
If we both go faster,

420
00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:57,946
we can still make
it together in time.

421
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,603
This is my fault.

422
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,705
I didn't need to see a doctor.

423
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,485
Stop that. They're my batteries.

424
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,959
They're my responsibility.

425
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,643
I forgot 'em, and...

426
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,362
here we are.

427
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,318
Pay attention, Joyce.

428
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,637
Social security numbers.

429
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:19,156
Bank account passwords.

430
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,109
Um, the combo for
the lock on my bike.

431
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:24,628
I know nobody rides
it, but just in case.

432
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,780
In the left-hand drawer
in the laundry room

433
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:29,500
are the appliance warranties
and also the instructions

434
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,652
for the remote control.

435
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:32,998
I guess you get to
watch your game shows

436
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:34,538
every night after all.

437
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:38,792
Joyce.

438
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:41,311
All this time...

439
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,047
Your heart,

440
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,366
the batteries.

441
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:48,480
I thought I was
taking care of you.

442
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:51,338
But you've been
taking care of me.

443
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:55,676
We've been taking
care of each other.

444
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,998
All right, here's
where I keep the gold.

445
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,584
Wha... Gold?

446
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,438
I'm kidding. But I do have
that jar of pennies in the pantry.

447
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,324
The ambulance that's meeting us

448
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,876
better have its sirens on.

449
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,082
Can I have a word?

450
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,669
Absolutely.

451
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:24,287
I need to tell you something.
It's a little awkward.

452
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,939
Randolph Bell.

453
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,008
Used to be CEO, now he's not.

454
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:30,861
Used to be chief of
surgery. That's all done.

455
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,191
The guy can get
his hands on the ball,

456
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:33,391
but he can't keep it in the air.

457
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:34,798
That hasn't been my impression.

458
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,544
- What's your point?
- Don't get me wrong,

459
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,053
Bell's a decent salesman,
and the company will be fine,

460
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:41,505
but... it could be
more than fine.

461
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,369
I can help increase
revenues exponentially

462
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:45,926
through better marketing.

463
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,889
You shouldn't have to
waste your valuable time

464
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,279
with that penny-ante stuff.

465
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,433
I'm having dinner
tonight with an investor

466
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:53,818
from a major advertising firm.

467
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,137
You should join us.

468
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,673
Sounds promising. Count me in.

469
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,259
I'll do that.

470
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,438
Adelaide said you were out here.

471
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,267
The surgery was a
success. We repaired enough

472
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,308
of the bowel, he
won't need an ostomy.

473
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,945
So he will recover.

474
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,664
Well, there's no
cure for the MS.

475
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,085
And he'll need treatment
for his suicidal depression.

476
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,270
He won't be able
to pay for any of that.

477
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:32,957
Do you know why he shot himself?

478
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:37,094
- No, I don't.
- Mm.

479
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,464
Chastain billed him for an
out-of-network anesthesiologist

480
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,251
and then added on over
100,000 in unspecified charges

481
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:46,804
that his insurance can't pay.

482
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,040
And then, just to kick
him while he's down,

483
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,824
Red Rock sued him.

484
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,167
I won't bill for my
surgery today, and...

485
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:02,147
- Thank you. That's a start.
- And as for

486
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:04,338
the rest of it, I'll
see what I can do.

487
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:07,619
You know, what Red Rock
did to you was not right.

488
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:10,310
Well, they haven't
treated you so well, either.

489
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,781
What can I do for you?

490
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:18,134
Archer's my patient, and I'm
not even allowed to see him.

491
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,370
Nothing's filling that void.

492
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:36,253
<i>Where's the ambulance now?</i>

493
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,666
It's been in the same place for
three minutes. Traffic, maybe?

494
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,158
We're still 30 minutes away.

495
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,660
It says "backup battery mode."

496
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,512
- No! No, no, no.
- It's okay.

497
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:47,831
- That means 15 minutes left. Keep driving.
- Joyce...

498
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,100
- Drive faster.
- Joyce!

499
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,719
I got five years
out of this machine.

500
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:55,255
Bonus years I wouldn't have
had if it hadn't been for you

501
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,268
taking care of me
through the operation,

502
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,759
and after.

503
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,078
They were good years.

504
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,299
Thank you.

505
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,007
Pull over.

506
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:16,910
We still might be able
to reach them in time.

507
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:19,130
Math says we won't. Pull over.

508
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,726
Bianca, we are not
giving up on you.

509
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,267
Everyone in this van knows
the same thing: it's over.

510
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:27,054
You know where I
don't want to die?

511
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,339
The back seat of a van.

512
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,394
When I go out of this world,

513
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:36,897
it's gonna be under the blue sky

514
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:40,100
with the sun on my face.

515
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:41,952
With my sister.

516
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,883
Clara's down the road.

517
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:59,453
She'll wave down the ambulance
that's carrying the battery.

518
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,256
Be straight with me. This is it.

519
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,085
We all know it can't
get here in time.

520
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,776
There's still a chance.

521
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,295
Nic, listen.

522
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,165
I don't want any heroics.

523
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,435
No CPR that could break my ribs.

524
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,344
I promise.

525
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,828
Thank you.

526
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:35,756
What'll it be like

527
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,474
when it happens?

528
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,294
Uh...

529
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,880
well, the...

530
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,482
the battery will stop,

531
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:48,752
and, um, you might
feel a little dizzy.

532
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,972
And then you'll
close your eyes and...

533
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,509
it will feel like
falling asleep.

534
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,878
That's good.

535
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,964
Peaceful.

536
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,199
That's how I want it.

537
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,168
We know

538
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,204
you did everything you could.

539
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,174
Now, shoo.

540
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,844
I want to do my dying alone...

541
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,328
with my sister.

542
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,382
I love you so much.

543
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,655
The battery's less
than ten miles away.

544
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,056
- That's too far.
- So we keep her alive
until it comes.

545
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,676
- We can't do that.
- We can. If she's
not down for long...

546
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,817
Mina, stop.

547
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:38,852
She doesn't want
a violent death.

548
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:42,522
Jessie.

549
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,100
That moment outside her room...

550
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:57,037
When it was happening and
there was nothing I could do.

551
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,959
At least this...

552
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,646
We can let Bianca
go the way she wants.

553
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,983
That we can do.

554
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,524
It's slowing down.

555
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,559
Battery's running out.

556
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:23,496
I'm glad it's sunny today.

557
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:28,067
It's pretty.

558
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:29,953
Quiet.

559
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,456
She gets to hold
her sister's hand...

560
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,491
while she dies.

561
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,779
At least they have that.

562
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:04,989
Uh...

563
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:07,957
I'm actually not dead at all.

564
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,993
She's alive!

565
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,659
- Oh...
- Oh, my God.

566
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:16,933
My heart's beating.

567
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,469
- What?
- Well, that's different.

568
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,655
I'm definitely not dead.

569
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,641
Well, unless this is...

570
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:26,637
No, this can't be Heaven.

571
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,978
I mean, it's nice here,

572
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,814
but there should be,
like, a river of ice cream

573
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,115
and a field of roses

574
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,333
and Chris Pine.

575
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:35,685
Her pulse is strong and regular.

576
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,104
The VAD must have given
her heart time to repair.

577
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:41,675
Now that the VAD stopped,
her heart is working again.

578
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:52,619
How you feeling?

579
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:55,338
Let me guess: method actor

580
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,740
prepping for his Blue
Man Group audition.

581
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,310
Ooh! Smurf superfan.

582
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,129
Patient information is private.

583
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:05,181
I'm so tired of rules.

584
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,421
Nadine, what's really going on?

585
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:15,541
I hit my head. That was real.

586
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:19,196
But when I got here, I
was happy to see you.

587
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,766
You probably think
this is silly, but...

588
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,602
most people act all weird
because I'm a princess.

589
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,337
With a guard always around,

590
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,323
I'm never alone, but...

591
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:32,875
But you're always lonely.

592
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,729
You understand me.

593
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:37,764
I still can't keep
you here overnight.

594
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:41,768
But...

595
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,287
maybe there's
something we can do.

596
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:50,594
To be clear, now that
I'm not dead, I take back

597
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,407
that thing I said about
your game shows.

598
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,664
I can live with that.

599
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,400
Cardiac function is sufficient.

600
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,414
Did I even need the
VAD in the first place?

601
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:00,754
Yeah. The VAD saved your life.

602
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:02,572
And then once it was in you,

603
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,469
it gave your heart
enough time to heal.

604
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,244
If that battery hadn't run out,
we never would have known.

605
00:29:11,132 --> 00:29:12,716
Now that there's no blood

606
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,791
running through
the VAD, it's clotting.

607
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,465
We need to get
her to Chastain now.

608
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,801
- Get the gurney.
- I'm gonna call ahead
to book an O.R.

609
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:22,125
- What's wrong?
- We need to get the VAD out.

610
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,627
There's a clot,
and if it dislodges,

611
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,129
it could be bad.

612
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,832
You mean my sister could die?

613
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,602
This time for real.

614
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,290
The gunshot guy
was exciting, sure,

615
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:39,726
but five people with sniffles,

616
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:41,478
a princess looking for love,

617
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,607
and a blue guy who
caused his own problems...

618
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:45,815
I mean, come on.

619
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,467
Wait, why are we out here?

620
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:50,436
Seems like you need
a break from the E.R.

621
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:53,757
Tell me, Ezra, why do you
want to go into anesthesiology

622
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,275
after intern year?

623
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,111
Fascinating
physiology. High stakes.

624
00:29:58,147 --> 00:29:59,997
Life and death every day.

625
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:03,933
What else?

626
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,269
To be honest, great hours.

627
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,689
And I like patients
who can't talk

628
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,691
because they're asleep.

629
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,193
Do you have OCD, Ezra?

630
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,795
What? No, I do not.

631
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,464
That's absurd.

632
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:18,660
I've seen you pick
at your buttons,

633
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:21,284
double-check your
stethoscope's in your pocket,

634
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,496
check your phone
a billion times.

635
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,290
Fine, I-I'm... I'm a
control freak, okay?

636
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,708
I also check the lock on my door

637
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,344
ten times before bed.

638
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:32,795
I buy pillowcases in bulk

639
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,948
because I need a
fresh one every day.

640
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,477
I get up in the
middle of the night

641
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,712
to make sure the
stove is really off.

642
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:41,021
But that's because
I'm super careful.

643
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:43,289
If you're an anesthesiologist,
that's a virtue,

644
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:46,142
because you can't
make a single mistake.

645
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,161
I respect super careful.

646
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:56,169
So why don't you take another
look at Blue Billy's scans.

647
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:01,340
Fusion of the vertebral bodies.

648
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,992
Bamboo spine.

649
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,309
Mix with long-term chronic
aches and pains, you get?

650
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,865
Ankylosing spondylitis.

651
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,184
An autoimmune
disease. Very treatable.

652
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,268
Ezra...

653
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,087
the desire for perfection,

654
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,773
checking things
again and again...

655
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,709
All your patients need that.

656
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,400
Let's go give Blue
Billy the news.

657
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,951
It's a manageable condition.

658
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,530
We'll get you set
up with a specialist,

659
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,232
and your pain will be
under control in no time.

660
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,284
And everyone said the
pain was in my head.

661
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,507
It's why I took the silver.

662
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:37,727
Hey. How long before
the blue fades away?

663
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,349
Um...

664
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:44,968
never.

665
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,736
I'm sorry.

666
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,124
Awesome.

667
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,477
Eh.

668
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,491
I've put in hundreds of VADs,

669
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:58,660
but I've never taken
one out for this reason.

670
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,124
Hmm.

671
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,303
Bianca's ventricle is clear.

672
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,305
Now I will repair it.

673
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,373
Pledgeted Prolene.

674
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,326
It's funny.

675
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,128
The liver is the only organ
that can regenerate itself,

676
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:15,131
but the heart...

677
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,467
It can repair.

678
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,286
Evolve.

679
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:21,821
Adapt to meet its circumstances.

680
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:25,625
You're poetic today.

681
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:28,278
Yeah.

682
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,279
I guess I am.

683
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,850
Ready to take her off bypass.

684
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:36,036
Let's see how she does
on her own, shall we?

685
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,780
Hmm.

686
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,622
Her heart is strong and healthy.

687
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:58,575
All on her own.

688
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:05,298
And yet another Hollywood ending

689
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:08,017
to an Austin-Okafor
medical story.

690
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:11,605
It almost wasn't.

691
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,157
I really thought Bianca
was gonna die on that road.

692
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:18,144
She said everything she
needed to say to her sister.

693
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,347
She was at peace.

694
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,118
Also, it's an...

695
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:28,554
Okafor-Austin medical story.

696
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:31,741
Second billing.

697
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,293
I'll take it.

698
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:34,361
This time.

699
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,149
What would you say?

700
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:43,520
You know, if you knew
it was your last hour?

701
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,473
I don't know what I would say.

702
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,309
But I do know

703
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:52,323
the person I would say it to...

704
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:54,196
is you.

705
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,528
Our relationship

706
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:12,131
is one of the most
important ones in my life.

707
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,985
It is perfect.

708
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,923
Just like this.

709
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:30,100
Well, like I said in there,

710
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:32,953
the heart can adapt.

711
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,924
So you have a good night,

712
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,676
Mina Okafor.

713
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:56,737
Hold on, where
are you taking her?

714
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,894
For a quick scan.

715
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,130
No visitors allowed.

716
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,431
We're not really going
for scans, are we?

717
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,450
Nope.

718
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,985
Is your car ready?

719
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:13,309
I can take you to pick it up.

720
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,472
Oh! No, I think I'm gonna
walk out to the impound lot.

721
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:17,980
It's not too far away.

722
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,100
I need the exercise.

723
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:22,095
A little time alone
with my thoughts.

724
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,241
That was one hell of a day, hmm?

725
00:35:28,276 --> 00:35:30,410
You're a hero, you know?

726
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:31,956
If you hadn't jumped
in to stop Archer

727
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,458
from shooting
himself, he'd be dead.

728
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:35,126
No, man, I was supposed
to keep an eye on him.

729
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,294
He should never have gotten
to the gun in the first place.

730
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:38,862
- That's on me.
- I think you should give

731
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,169
yourself a break.

732
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,373
Hey,

733
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,791
why don't you come
over to our place later?

734
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,795
I'm tired.

735
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,796
- Thanks, though.
- Come on,

736
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:52,393
we'll order some pizza
with Nic. It'll be fun.

737
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,201
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

738
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,402
I think you could use it.

739
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,223
My ass just got fired, so...

740
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,675
I know I could use it.

741
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:06,512
Uh, not tonight.

742
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,016
Thank you.

743
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,481
This is the best
scan I've ever tasted.

744
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:32,505
I guess I just had a case of...

745
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,323
trapped-with-a-guard-itis.

746
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,353
They didn't teach
me that in med school.

747
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:37,827
Mm.

748
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,313
You know, I wanted
to be a doctor.

749
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:41,481
Really?

750
00:36:41,516 --> 00:36:43,032
Yeah.

751
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,851
I really liked the idea
of helping people.

752
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:49,255
But my parents put
the kibosh on that.

753
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,742
Not a life for a princess.

754
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,179
My life is very controlled.

755
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,614
Look.

756
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,294
This is the front
of my apartment.

757
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:00,833
What do you see?

758
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:02,068
That's a camera.

759
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:04,170
Over there, an alarm.

760
00:37:04,206 --> 00:37:06,255
And this one,

761
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,757
another camera.

762
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,959
The whole place is like that...

763
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:13,395
Alarms and cameras everywhere.

764
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,633
They look like they're
there to keep enemies out,

765
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,051
but, really,

766
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:20,953
they're keeping
princesses caged in.

767
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:25,875
Well...

768
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,044
you're free-range now.

769
00:37:29,063 --> 00:37:30,913

770
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,583
