3

- You can't be a musician.

the heart back in the chest.

155

five percent success rate.

168
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:57,282
No, it's got to be done by
a pediatric cardiac surgeon,

169
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,061
who has experience
in this procedure.

170
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,620
They want to take Baby Farhad
to Boston Children's immediately.

171
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,706
He won't survive
the transport, Nadine.

172

But we are not
fully prepared here.

173
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:08,943

cardiac center

175
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,164
and doctors who are trained

176
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,177
- in this particular procedure.
- He's too unstable for transfer,

177
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,386
- even there.
- I know, I know.

178
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:19,554
Torres.

179
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,400
You worked at
Atlanta General, right?

180
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:24,141
- Yeah.
- Is there a world-class

181
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,139
pediatric cardiac
surgeon we could call in?

182
00:07:26,163 --> 00:07:27,595
I know just the person.

183
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,447
Dr. Judith Brown.

184
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,632
Call her.

185
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,667
You got it.

186
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:38,572
Hey there, pretty lady. Look,
I know everybody's real busy,

187
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,125
but would y'all mind
taking a look at my fiancée?

188
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,628
We've been here for a long
time; she's in a lot of pain.

189
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,313
Technically, it's my day off.

190
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:48,834
I have an incoming
trauma, could... you?

191
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,115
- Sure.
- Thanks.

192
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,349
- I'll take a look.
- Thank you.

193
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,640
You're the best.

194
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,143
Yvette, hi. I'm Nic.

195
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,594
I'm a nurse practitioner here.

196
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:01,124
Um, it says here
you're 23 years old.

197
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,930
- Is that true?
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:05,934
And, uh, and you're
experiencing some stomach pain.

199
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,664
- When did that start?
- Just today.

200
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,653
It wasn't too bad before.

201
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,957
On a scale from one to ten,
how would you rate your pain?

202
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,226
It's pretty bad...
I'd say a ten.

203
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,645
I'm gonna...

204
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,247
I'm gonna need Yvette to answer.

205
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,286
It really hurts.

206
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:28,122
I don't know, maybe...

207
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:30,124
maybe a ten.

208
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,744
Do you have any other symptoms?

209
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,663
A little bleeding.

210
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,147
Down there.

211
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,799
You didn't... tell me that.

212
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:41,419
All right, I'm gonna
have to do a pelvic exam.

213
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,266
- Do you mind stepping out?
- Oh, uh...

214
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,773
I'll stay.

215
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,044
I'd like him to stay.

216
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,963
There you go.

217
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,995
I can't leave Rupa and
Salman alone for too long.

218
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,504
I know, the NICU will let us
know when they need you back.

219
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,417
How are you doing?
You must be exhausted.

220
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,424
It was a long night.

221
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,588
Well, a trip to the
hospital is not the best way

222
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,790
to end a birthday party,
and in the middle of all of this,

223
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,797
you have a big decision to make.

224
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,383
Devon?

225
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:16,204
My father wants me to...

226
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:19,207
leave Atlanta and
return home tomorrow.

227
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:22,009
He's not just my
father, he's... my king.

228
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,112
There is no decision to be made.

229
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,231
Well... is this what you want?

230
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,434
It doesn't matter what I want.

231
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,436
I can't put my own wishes

232
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,572
before my obligation
to my people.

233
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,958
And with everything that
Rupa and Salman are facing,

234
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,795
it seems selfish to even
think about it right now.

235
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:45,967
Wow.

236
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,786
So... this is our
last day together.

237
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,923
I guess it is.

238
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:03,918
Dr. Brown is here.

239
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,900
How long did you two work
together at Atlanta General?

240
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,591
Throughout fellowship.

241
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,292
She's excellent...
she's mastered

242
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,238
techniques used for
operating on neonatal hearts.

243
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:15,163
And since we worked together,

244
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,781
she's asked me to assist.

245
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,736
His murmur has gotten
softer in the last hour.

246
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:25,089
He's also gotten more cyanotic.

247
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,269
Dr. Brown's gonna have
to create a shunt surgically.

248
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:29,760
I know we tolerate

249
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,412
lower O2 sats in infants,

250
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,091
but his have
dropped into the 50s.

251
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,750
He's not getting enough
oxygen in his blood.

252
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:38,169
This baby needs surgery now.

253
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,104
Pravesh, you seen Dr. Brown?

254
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,505
She's not answering her page.

255
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,935
- No.
- I thought she was with you.

256
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,336
Rupa and Salman
want to meet her.

257
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,605
Maybe later.

258
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,106
We need to find her
and have her scrub in

259
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,146
immediately.

260
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,448
Looking for Dr. Brown?

261
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,767
She's in the lab.

262
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:53,784
I'll get her.

263
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,303
You guys prep Farhad for the OR.

264
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,521
Take Salman and
Rupa back to L&D.

265
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,677
♪ ♪

266
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,069
Dr. Brown?

267
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,636
Mm, yes?

268
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,805
You're needed in
OR Two immediately.

269
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,140
Feel a bit of a cold coming on.

270
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,793
This isn't a day
to call in sick,

271
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:22,013
so I am just giving myself
some hydration and O2.

272
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,982
You can tell 'em
I'll be right there.

273
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,503
- You doctors are
miracle workers.
- Ah, all we did was

274
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,438
run some tests and give
you fluids and pain meds.

275
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,507
The real miracle is how
you somehow managed

276
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,409
to grab your makeup bag
and bring it in the ambulance.

277
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,443
Well, when a girl
feels her worst,

278
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,511
that's when she
must look her best.

279
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,335
Spoken like a true icon.

280
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,654
- Indeed.
- So I'm free to leave?

281
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:48,155
No, not yet.

282
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,769
We need to figure out
why your calcium is so high,

283
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,260
and then treat it.
Want to explain further?

284
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,080
Hypercalcemia could be
causing all your symptoms.

285
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,667
- Belly pain, weak muscles,
even kidney stones.
- High calcium.

286
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,564
My uncle and my
daddy both had that.

287
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,505
- Did their doctors know why?
- No.

288
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,924
They both got pancreatic cancer.

289
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,959
Passed away when
I was in high school.

290
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,764
Excuse me.

291
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,282
I heard that Dolly Parton had

292
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,729
collapsed onstage,
and I just thought...

293
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,852
The next best thing
is right here, honey.

294
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:20,750
She's the person I
always wanted to be.

295
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,774
You know what Dolly always said.

296
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,459
"Don't rent it, don't
lease it, own it."

297
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,395
I'm... sorry for intruding.

298
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,991
I see you're in very
good hands, so...

299
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,648
Hold on, handsome.

300
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,545
I will serenade
you with Dolly's hit,

301
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,489
"Kiss It And
Make It All Better."

302
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,189
Um... maybe later.

303
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:42,738
- We're gonna order some more
tests, and we'll be right back.
- Okay.

304
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,346
Dr. Bell, a moment, please?

305
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,727
I need to do genetic
tests and scans,

306
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:51,603
but I suspect Joseph
may have MEN 1.

307
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,271
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia.

308
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,834
Would that explain
his family history

309
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,786
of high levels of calcium
and pancreatic tumors?

310
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,138
- Yes.
- If he has MEN 1,
he could have a tumor

311
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:00,594
in any of his endocrine glands.

312
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,812
I'm thinking parathyroids.

313
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,465
Which is where you
would come in, because...

314
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,096
- if I'm right,
he would need surgery.
- Yeah, okay.

315
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,302
Let me know what you find.

316
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:11,422
All right, go ahead
and put in the orders.

317
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,008
Hey.

318
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,128
Everything okay?

319
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,629
See the couple in Bay Four?

320
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,776
She has pelvic inflammatory
disease from gonorrhea.

321
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Says she's 23, but I'm
not even sure she's 18.

322
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,003
We've been here all day.

323
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,437
And he hovers.

324
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,116
Doesn't leave her
side for a second.

325
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,451
He says they're
from out of town,

326
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,992
but she's already been in our ER

327
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,593
for an STD a few months ago.

328
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:34,457
- Listen to me. Listen...
- Just stop.

329
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,941
You think she's
being trafficked.

330
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:38,282
I need your help
getting her alone

331
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,145
so that I can find
out if she's safe.

332
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,802
Okay.

333
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,774
Yvette, Marcus,
this is Dr. Hawkins.

334
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,804
I brought him in to
consult. He also agrees

335
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,162
that a round of antibiotics
should clear your symptoms.

336
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,242
Great. We'll swing by the
pharmacy on our way out.

337
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,643
- Call in a prescription?
- Nic did.

338
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,311
But before you go, I'll
need to give you an exam.

339
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,680
Can't you just write
me a prescription, too?

340
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,732
Not without an
examination. Nic, why don't

341
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,456
you take Yvette to the
pharmacy while I give Marcus...

342
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:03,669
No, no, no, you ain't
treating me, okay?

343
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,794
You're treating her, and
we're taking off. Let's go.

344
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,507
But before you do any of
that, there's something else

345
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,581
I wanted to take a look at.

346
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:13,551
Do you mind if Dr. Hawkins
listens to your heart?

347
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,086
I heard a little abnormality

348
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,766
when I was
listening to it earlier.

349
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,950
This'll just take a second.

350
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,313
Yeah, I hear it, too. She
could have endocarditis.

351
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:28,232
It's a life-threatening
condition and result of her STD.

352
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,667
And can cause sudden death.

353
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,730
Bacteria travels
through the bloodstream

354
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,498
and enters into your
heart. We absolutely have to

355
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,073
- do a cardiac ultrasound.
- No.

356
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,237
Doctors make up stuff all
the time to get more tests.

357
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:40,611
- Come on, Yvette, let's go.
- Endocarditis is very real,

358
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:41,846
I promise you.

359
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,263
We can do the echo right now.

360
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,744
If it's negative,
you go on your way.

361
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:49,587
I just... know you
want Yvette to be safe.

362
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,105
I'll do it.

363
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,459
I don't want to die.

364
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,929
Then we'll go right
now. Thank you.

365
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,283
How long is this gonna take?

366
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,929
It won't take long at all.
We'll just be right back.

367
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:05,285
I'm going with her.

368
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,782
Only patients are
allowed in the echo suite.

369
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,223
Sorry about that. It's just
hospital rules, not mine.

370
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:22,987
- Dr. Brown, we are ready for
the Blalock-Taussig shunt.
- Great.

371
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,338
Let's have that graft on hand.

372
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,276
Time to dissect out the...

373
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:31,429
uh... uh...

374
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,164
The pulmonary artery?

375
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,283
Cautery, please.

376
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:38,636
<i>Is it me, or is
she a little off?</i>

377
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,722
This is not the surgical
star Torres led us to expect.

378
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:43,624
I saw her hooked to IVs earlier,

379
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,403
giving herself
supplemental oxygen.

380
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:47,261
She said she had a cold.

381
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,251
Laps.

382
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,069
<i>Suction. Clamps to Dr. Brown.</i>

383
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,145
She just lacerated
the pulmonary artery.

384
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:03,260
Dr. Brown.

385
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,412
- Judith!
- She's definitely swaying.

386
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:09,767
Dude, she may be intoxicated.

387
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,085
Dr. Brown, I'm tagging you out.

388
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,288
- No, you aren't. This is under control.
- You are impaired.

389
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:17,457
- Torres, talk to me.
- He's exsanguinating.

390
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,473
- I need help stopping
the bleeding.
- I will stop the bleed.

391
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:21,941
You've only made it worse.
His artery is turning further.

392
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:23,642
My patient, my surgery.

393
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,494
You are not fit to operate.

394
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:29,636
Clamps to me... now.

395
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:38,657
- Everything okay?
<i>- Yeah, we stabilized the baby.</i>

396
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:42,716
You commandeered my surgery.

397
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,786
Never, in all of my
years of operating,

398
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:48,889
have I had something so out...

399
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,975
so outrageous happen.

400
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,504
You should be stripped
of your privileges.

401
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:54,745
You tore this baby's
pulmonary artery.

402
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,313
You been drinking?

403
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,859
That was a typical
perioperative complication.

404
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,911
- Then submit to a blood test.
- Absolutely not.

405
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,553
You can't refuse, Dr. Brown.
It's in every surgeon's contract

406
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:03,637
<i>at Chastain.</i>

407
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:06,540
If you say no, we will alert

408
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:09,726
the hospital admin and
medical board that you refused.

409
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,429
What are you hiding, Dr. Brown?

410
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,317
Nothing.

411
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,986
Then prove it.
Do the blood draw.

412
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:21,322
Right here, right now,

413
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:23,357
so everybody can see it.

414
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,126
So Conrad's
hypothesis was correct.

415
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,746
This is likely MEN
1-related abnormal growth

416
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:48,749
of Doll E.'s... or should I
say Joseph's parathyroids.

417
00:17:48,784 --> 00:17:50,129
That's why his
calcium is so high.

418
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,198
Yeah, it looks like
four-gland hyperplasia

419
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:54,688
causing the elevated calcium,
so they'll need to be removed.

420
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:57,908
This is a delicate
surgery just to avoid

421
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,272
- the critical nerves
in that region.
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

422
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:03,764
but damaging those nerves
could destroy Joseph's voice.

423
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,661
Yes. But I'll do
everything possible

424
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,262
to make sure that
doesn't happen.

425
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,404
And we'll monitor nerve
function throughout the case.

426
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:13,241
"We"? So I can assist?

427
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,392
I start on surgery tomorrow.

428
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,756
- I've been practicing
my two-handed ties.
- It was more of a...

429
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,814
it was a royal "we."

430
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,665
Oh.

431
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,044
But sure, you can scrub in.

432
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,237
My very existence

433
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:45,305
as Doll E. Wood
depends on my voice.

434
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,324
Well, you could still lip-synch.

435
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,810
Of course, but that's
not all that's involved.

436
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:51,812
Dolly Parton talks, a lot.

437
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,792
She has an intimate
rapport with her audience.

438
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,116
Doll E. Wood has
to have a voice.

439
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:59,619
She must talk to her
audience. She must.

440
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:03,424
Keeping your abnormal
parathyroids in place

441
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:05,476
could cause a
hypercalcemic crisis.

442
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,638
That's what happened today.

443
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:08,145
Next time you could die.

444
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,931
You said "could"

445
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,667
cause a fatal
"hyperhoozamajiggy" crisis.

446
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,987
- So it's not certain.
- No.

447
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,089
But it's a risk that
you shouldn't take.

448
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,296
When I found my inner Doll,

449
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,966
my whole life went
from black and white

450
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,452
to all the colors
of the rainbow.

451
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,301
"If-if you want the
rainbow, you got

452
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:37,658
"to put up with the rain.

453
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:40,644
Storms make trees
take deeper roots."

454
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,797
Oh, this boy's a gem.
He's quoting Dolly.

455
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:44,994
"If you don't like the
road you're walking,

456
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,650
"start paving another one.

457
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,637
We cannot direct the wind,
but we can adjust the sails."

458
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:52,651
Okay, I-I think we get the gist.

459
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:56,961
Everything possible
to preserve your voice.

460
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,948
Shall we schedule the surgery?

461
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,855
No.

462
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:19,966
Okay.

463
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,761
What about the ultrasound?

464
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,212
You don't actually need it.

465
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:34,615
There's nothing
wrong with your heart.

466
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,712
We just wanted to have a
private conversation with you.

467
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,636
What did I do?

468
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,221
Oh, nothing. You didn't...
You didn't do anything.

469
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,223
You tricked me.

470
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:45,137
Marcus was right.
I can't trust you.

471
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,077
You know, sometimes, um,

472
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,529
in the hospital, we see
people who we think

473
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,698
might be in a
situation that isn't safe.

474
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:54,251
So, um...

475
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,049
we just wanted to make sure
that you're not one of them.

476
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:58,823
I'm fine.

477
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,775
Marcus is my fiancé. We're in
love and we're getting married.

478
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,610
I want to go now.

479
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:06,146
Look, Marcus doesn't need
to know about any of this.

480
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,993
It's your choice. I mean,
we're not gonna force you

481
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,937
to do or say
anything. We just...

482
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:13,621
We want you to
know that you can.

483
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:26,934
Yvette?

484
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,737
You're safe, okay?

485
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:33,524
You're totally in control here.

486
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:36,994
Okay?

487
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,657
Okay.

488
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:53,594
Okay. We understand now.

489
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:56,497
It's okay. It's okay.

490
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:59,766
You're safe. You're
safe. We're here for you.

491
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,652
♪ ♪

492
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,545
- They're all coming out
to see you, Doll.
- Oh, stop it.

493
00:22:13,983 --> 00:22:15,949
I wish you'd reconsider.

494
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,468
You're a dear.

495
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,465
But I will take
whatever time I have left

496
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:21,822
as the full and complete Doll E.

497
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:25,109
If I die young like my
daddy, well, so be it.

498
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,928
Can I have... just
have a minute?

499
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,636
You know, my dad raised
me on the Queen of Country.

500
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:37,488
- Get out.
- Yeah.

501
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,656
My daddy took me
straight to Dollywood

502
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,586
the minute I could
hold up my head.

503
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,405
I was practically
baptized there.

504
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,197
So, were the two of you close?

505
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:50,484
We were.

506
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,502
My daddy was a pastor.

507
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,333
I was supposed
to be next in line,

508
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:56,656
till he realized what was what.

509
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:59,827
He knew I wasn't
the son he expected.

510
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:02,413
I believe that broke his heart.

511
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,948
He talked for a while
about conversion therapy,

512
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:08,501
but he saw how I felt
about that and he gave it up.

513
00:23:08,537 --> 00:23:09,870
When I was bullied or attacked,

514
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:11,633
he was the first one
in line to defend me.

515
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,074
'Cause he was a good
man, a loving man,

516
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,094
who walked the
walk of a Christian.

517
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,663
Judge not lest ye be judged.

518
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:24,084
He gave me the best gift of all.

519
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,071
Acceptance.

520
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:32,392
You know, I'm thinking that
maybe you're a lot like him.

521
00:23:32,427 --> 00:23:36,296
Too much, as it turns out.

522
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,416
Well...

523
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,903
if your dad could
have had the surgery,

524
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:47,440
and it cost him his voice,
so he couldn't preach,

525
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:49,709
but you still had your dad,

526
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:55,049
would that have
been better than...

527
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:57,834
I see where you're
headed. Very clever.

528
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,587
You don't have to share
the same fate as your father.

529
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:03,974
We found this in
time to save you.

530
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,460
And you may wake up
with your voice intact.

531
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,262
There's a decent chance.

532
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:12,632
But if not...

533
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:16,253
"I can see the light of
a clear blue morning..."

534
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,423
"I can see the light
of a brand-new day."

535
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,441
You know.

536
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,313
"Everything's gonna be okay."

537
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:28,815
Oh...

538
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,968
You better give me some sugar.

539
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:43,814
So we'll schedule the surgery?

540
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,883
Okay.

541
00:24:49,472 --> 00:24:52,773
How did you meet Marcus?

542
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:55,792
I was 16 and fighting
with my mom a lot.

543
00:24:55,827 --> 00:25:01,631
So I started to text with a man
named Luis that I met on an app.

544
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,135
He told me that he'd
help me run away.

545
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,905
And after a while, I
began to like that idea.

546
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,668
So, one day I climbed
out my bedroom window.

547
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:13,661
He had a car waiting.

548
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,645
There was another
man in the car.

549
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,298
They blindfolded me
and they drove away.

550
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:21,284
They drove for a long time.

551
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,637
Most likely across state lines.

552
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:27,207
Uh, they took me to a motel.

553
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:28,992
Marcus was there.

554
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:33,264
He said he had a
client waiting for me.

555
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:37,000
I had no idea what
he meant, but...

556
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:42,000
But then he took
me to a motel room

557
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:45,675
and he left me with that man
and he did what he wanted to me.

558
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,062
My old life ended right there.

559
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:53,183
After that, Marcus said
that I was now ruined,

560
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:56,720
and that I belonged to him.

561
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,121
I could never go home again.

562
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:01,308
He said that no one would
ever love me except him.

563
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,563
You know that none
of that is true, right?

564
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,732
And you are not ruined.

565
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,134
And you're safe now. You
don't have to do that anymore.

566
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,613
I hate it.

567
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,049
I hate all of it, but he
said that he'd kill me.

568
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,923
He'd kill my whole family
if I ever told anyone.

569
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:19,118
We're gonna make sure
that doesn't happen. Nic?

570
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,639
We'll be back in
two seconds, okay?

571
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,813
Okay.

572
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,982
I've notified social services.

573
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,935
They'll take over, find
her a safe place to stay.

574
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,554
I'll go check on him.

575
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,604
I'll stay with her.

576
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,906
Where the hell is she?

577
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,597
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

578
00:26:57,632 --> 00:26:59,144
It's okay, we're
safe. They've got him.

579
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:01,501
It's okay.

580
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,320
It's okay.

581
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,590
My work is my life.

582
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,259
I've performed the
most complex surgeries.

583
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,621
The Norwood, the
Glenn, the Bentall.

584
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:11,978
Sometimes back-to-back.

585
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:13,508
Patients came from
all over the world.

586
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:17,250
Dr. Brown, you have
an alcohol problem.

587
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:18,752
You almost killed a baby today.

588
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:20,587
That baby still needs surgery.

589
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:22,601
He needs it right
now, and fortunately,

590
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:25,825
I am the only one capable
of doing it, so let's just

591
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,472
- go back to the OR...
- We are taking

592
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:29,858
Baby Farhad back to the OR,
but Torres and I will operate.

593
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:32,683
- No, I can do it.
- No, you cannot.

594
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,738
That's not because I'm
drunk. I'm in withdrawal.

595
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,943
Just get me a drink.

596
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:44,778
I'll be ready to go.

597
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:46,841
We'll treat you with benzos
and you can guide us.

598
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,627
But you are not
cutting. That is final.

599
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:51,968
With benzos, I would be
too drowsy to guide you.

600
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,815
Without a drink, my
symptoms will only escalate.

601
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,900
You've seen what happens.
These shakes will get worse,

602
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,474
I'll vomit, maybe hallucinate.

603
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,187
Even seize... I know
what you're thinking.

604
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,806
You're thinking that I'm just
an addict making up a line

605
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,406
to get her fix,
but you also know

606
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,550
that what I'm saying
is medically accurate.

607
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:09,536
The fact is, unless
you let me drink,

608
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:12,589
I will not be able to
help you with the surgery.

609
00:28:19,348 --> 00:28:21,314
We got to get her a drink.

610
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:24,367
- No way.
- There is no other option,
Pravesh.

611
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:34,611
Can you count
backwards from ten?

612
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:39,700
I'd rather sing, since it
might be for the last time.

613
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:47,875
♪ <i>It's been a long, dark night</i> ♪

614
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:53,763
♪ <i>And I've been
waitin' for the morning</i> ♪

615
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:57,768
♪ <i>It's been a long, hard fight</i> ♪

616
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:01,221
♪ <i>But I see a brand-new day</i> ♪

617
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:03,490
♪ <i>A dawning</i> ♪

618
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,610
♪ <i>And I can't s...</i> ♪

619
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:14,400
Okay.

620
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,273
Time to scrub in.

621
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,842
One more shot.

622
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,278
Last one, right?

623
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,613
Mm-hmm.

624
00:29:53,142 --> 00:29:55,241
Ready.

625
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:57,677
All right. Let's make it happen.

626
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,770
Baby Farhad's
parents want updates.

627
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,766
Are you gonna tell
them about Dr. Brown?

628
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,601
We usually don't if there are no
adverse outcomes to the patient.

629
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:12,593
This is unacceptable.

630
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:15,011
You know my dad would
never approve of this.

631
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,848
How can giving
Dr. Brown a drink be okay?

632
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,433
It's not right.

633
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:24,555
And I know that alcohol is
considered haram, and forbidden.

634
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,624
But we've exhausted all options.

635
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,303
This is the only
possible solution.

636
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,379
Farhad needs surgery,
and he needs it now.

637
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,165
What if she gets drunk?

638
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,178
She knows how much
to drink to function

639
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,785
and not get drunk.

640
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,106
I promise you, she will
never touch Farhad again.

641
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,810
Let's start by freeing
the skin from the heart

642
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,645
by tracing along
the transition zone.

643
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:55,263
Scalpel to me.

644
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,837
Retractors to Torres.

645
00:31:03,578 --> 00:31:06,096
All right, be careful
not to pinch the P.A.

646
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:11,751
- Chest is open. Let's
rotate the heart in.

647
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:16,089
Hmm, it won't fit.

648
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,852
The heart is too big.

649
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,336
What if we take
down the diaphragm?

650
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,744
Still not enough space.

651
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,525
You have to do a
partial lung resection.

652
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,249
Removing the right lower lobe
should give us enough room.

653
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:29,064
That would compromise
his lung function.

654
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,898
He could end up
in respiratory failure.

655
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,623
Well, partial lung
resection is our only option.

656
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,725
We have to take the risk.

657
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,361
This is the first parathyroid.

658
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:46,264
Normally the size
of a grain of rice,

659
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:49,022
and here, it is enlarged.

660
00:31:49,057 --> 00:31:53,376
And right next to it is the
recurrent laryngeal nerve.

661
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,723
Incredible. This morning
I heard him perform,

662
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,681
and now I see
what lets him sing.

663
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:04,787
So we are gonna save
half this parathyroid.

664
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,289
And reimplant it into his arm.

665
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,992
That way he has enough
remaining gland function

666
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,744
so his calcium doesn't plummet.

667
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,578
You came prepared.

668
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,963
Would you like to assist
me in removing the next one?

669
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,925
I have to admit, I
am a bit nervous.

670
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,789
We're working so
close to the nerve.

671
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,357
Well, he has very
challenging anatomy,

672
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,730
but if we're careful...

673
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,617
We lost the nerve signal.

674
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:35,797
- What the hell did you do?
- Nothing. I didn't
touch anything.

675
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:38,789
Give me that. Steady.

676
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:42,759
The nerve may have been damaged.

677
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,938
Dr. Bell, if he
loses his voice...

678
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,344
Stop talking.

679
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,751
Where's Marcus?

680
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:53,586
He's been arrested, Yvette.

681
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:55,755
We don't want him
to hurt other women.

682
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,602
You'll be safe,
where you're going.

683
00:32:57,626 --> 00:32:59,141
They have plenty of resources.

684
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,127
They'll take care of you.

685
00:33:02,664 --> 00:33:05,649
For a while.

686
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,950
Then what?

687
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,637
I never finished high school. I
have no way to make a living.

688
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:15,124
I can't undo the
mistakes I've made.

689
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,621
You were a child,
and you are blameless

690
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:19,496
for what happened to you.

691
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:22,715
Go take your life back.

692
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,662
It's not gonna be
easy, but I promise

693
00:33:24,686 --> 00:33:26,886
you can do it.

694
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:30,791
I've been in and out of
hospitals a bunch of times.

695
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:33,392
And no one has
ever taken the time

696
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,812
