1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,498
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- I'm gonna retire.

2
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:07,022
I'd like to float your
name to the network

3
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:09,636
<i>- for a possible trial run.</i>
- This is Bill Laundry,
owner of Georgia FC.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,020
Well, you guys seem to
know what you're doing.

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,506
Guess it's good
that Dax landed here.

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,663
We only employ
the best at Chastain.

7
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:16,826
Dawn is a single
mom of seven kids

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,928
that she adopted through
the Foster Care program.

9
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,069
Will you let me fight
this cancer with you?

10
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,249
There is only a slim hope
this will buy you more time.

11
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,592
I will do anything
against any odds

12
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,844
<i>to stay with my
kids as long as I can.</i>

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,479
Good news. Your mother
is ready to leave the ICU

14
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:33,109
and go to a great
rehab facility.

15
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,227
Don't give up
before the miracle.

16
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,028
- Wondering about the timing.
- Meaning?

17
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:38,202
If you keep her
alive, you can claim

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,478
your patient survived
the mother of all surgeries.

19
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:55,871
Does it ever get to you?

20
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:58,206
These patients, kept
alive by machines.

21
00:00:58,241 --> 00:01:02,177
They don't talk. We have
no idea what they want,

22
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:05,681
or even if they're still capable
of wanting anything at all.

23
00:01:05,716 --> 00:01:09,100
First time moonlighting
at a vent farm?

24
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,136
Med school debt is no joke,

25
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,055
but I'm chipping away at it.

26
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,090
Well, we try not to get too
philosophical around here.

27
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:18,137
It's a job. Leave it at that.

28
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,061
Her BP's low. She's febrile.

29
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:22,147
Nothing new for this one.

30
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,099
Likely another pneumonia.

31
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,962
We'll have to put
her on a travel vent.

32
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,114
- You're gonna transfer her?
- Attending's orders.

33
00:01:28,138 --> 00:01:31,718
If she stays hypotensive
and spikes a temp over 102,

34
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:34,787
- we send her back to Chastain
for treatment.
- Is that reasonable?

35
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:36,778
She has no meaningful
brain function.

36
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,317
This is Dawn Long.

37
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,468
The one from TV.

38
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,264
The Mother of All
Surgeries patient.

39
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:46,438
The one and only.

40
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,928
- When was she last conscious?
- Right before she went
into surgery.

41
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:55,147
She's practically a corpse.

42
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,977
We should be
planning end-of-life care,

43
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,501
- not an ICU transfer.
- Like I said,

44
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,352
we try not to overthink.

45
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,005
But if you really want to
make a thing out of this,

46
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,974
take it up with Dr. Cain.

47
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,028
I don't want Derek to
minimize his symptoms.

48
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,880
Doctors could use
that to dismiss him.

49
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,183
He will be seen by
the best of the best.

50
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,857
- You have to calm down.
- They'll send a resident.

51
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,888
- They're just barely
real doctors.
- This is a teaching hospital,

52
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,557
the residents
are very qualified.

53
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,648
Good morning. I'm
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

54
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,449
Real doctor, by the way.

55
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,963
Conrad, thank God. This
is my son-in-law, Derek.

56
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,021
I've been trying to get him to
see a doctor for a month now.

57
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,202
- He's been complaining of
shortness of breath.
- Mom.

58
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,541
Let Derek speak for himself.

59
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,143
And my daughter, Molly.

60
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:44,062
Uh, it started a few weeks ago.

61
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,341
It's probably
just a little cough.

62
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,849
Uh, he's had night
sweats and fatigue.

63
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:49,951
What if he has
eosinophilic granulomatosis

64
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:52,132
- with polyangiitis?
- Molly's in her second year
of med school.

65
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:55,007
Oh, doctors raising
doctors. I love it.

66
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,042
Now, how about I
take a look at Derek

67
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,177
and everyone else
heads to the cafeteria.

68
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,413
And for this one, insider tip:

69
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,182
order the hot chocolate,
extra marshmallows.

70
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,667
Hot chocolate?

71
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:07,202
Fantastic idea.

72
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:09,021
Cocoa on me. Come on, you.

73
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,391
Smooth move, doc.

74
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,048
Deep breath.

75
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,505
They always like that together?

76
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,859
Uh, well, Molly can
get a little nervous.

77
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:32,405
And you're the eye
of the hurricane?

78
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:33,395
I try.

79
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,414
But I'm-I'm pulling double duty,

80
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,699
what with Molly in
med school and all.

81
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,901
Working and taking
care of the kid.

82
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,881
I'm even coaching her
softball team this year.

83
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:43,689
I get it, you're super dad.

84
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,708
That kind of stress
can take its toll.

85
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:48,705
Molly stayed home
when Josie was a baby,

86
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,679
so I figure it's my turn now.

87
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:51,696
Okay.

88
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,182
Well, my job is to focus on you.

89
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,017
So, let's get a chest X-ray

90
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:58,636
and find out what's
going on, okay?

91
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,422
Okay, yeah.

92
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:01,973
I guess that's why I'm here.

93
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,209
You're in the right place.

94
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,543
Randolph, you've done really
well with these guest spots.

95
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,100
I'm happy. Producers are happy.

96
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:14,403
So now it's time to
knock it out of the park.

97
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:16,904
Got any last minute pointers?

98
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,573
Make the show your own.

99
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:23,595
Not an ounce of sugar
goes into my body.

100
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:27,132
I-I've been tired all the
time, uh, muscle ache.

101
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,978
Now my gums have
started bleeding.

102
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,153
- Would you mind
if I have a look?
- Sure.

103
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,344
Well...

104
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,131
Albert, have you ever
heard of Dr. James Lind?

105
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:47,102
- No.
- Lind was an 18th-century
surgeon's mate

106
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:48,503
in the British Royal Navy.

107
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:52,006
And at sea, they had
a diet a lot like yours.

108
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,609
And that was back in the day
when more sailors were lost

109
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:58,112
to a mysterious illness
than to any enemy.

110
00:04:58,148 --> 00:05:02,100
And ships' captains were
prescribing vinegar and cider,

111
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,820
and even sea water, until

112
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:10,625
James Lind discovered that...

113
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:18,016
with just a little bit

114
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,368
- of Vitamin C...
- Ooh...

115
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:24,005
he could cure thousands of
what I'm about to cure you of...

116
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,062
Scurvy.

117
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,827
So, save your money, throw
away your home remedies,

118
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,818
put a little citrus
in your diet,

119
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:38,820
or buy a peg
leg. It's up to you.

120
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,217
Need a doctor?

121
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:44,158
Ring the Bell.

122
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:47,462
Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell!

123
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:51,032
Ring the Bell! Ring the Bell!

124
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:55,153
Ring the Bell! Ring
the Bell! Ring the Bell!

125
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,172
♪ ♪

126
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,250
Hey, I got your page, what's up?

127
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,754
Remember Dr. Cain's patient who
was on<i> The Montel Williams Show?</i>

128
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,350
Yeah. I thought
she was in rehab.

129
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,275
According to her chart, she is.

130
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,044
- She's been at an LTACH
this whole time?
- Yes.

131
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,041
And what's worse, she's
been hauled back to Chastain

132
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:25,901
for treatment five times.
Strokes, pneumonias, infections.

133
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,118
She's not getting better,

134
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,387
but Cain wants her
diagnosed, treated,

135
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:30,956
and sent back to the LTACH.

136
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,052
What I want is for
Dawn Long to get better,

137
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,910
so her children can
have their mother back.

138
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,796
- How's she doing?
- Not good.

139
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,765
Fever. Increased
sputum. Hypoxia.

140
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,895
All signs point to lower
respiratory tract infection.

141
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,902
She's such a good woman.

142
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,921
And her family...

143
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,250
- so wonderful.
- Dr. Cain,

144
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,292
are her children aware that
she's not gonna be waking up?

145
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,112
Absolutely not. Because we
don't know that for sure yet.

146
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,364
The brain is an enigma.
Anything can happen.

147
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,366
Of course, but...

148
00:06:58,401 --> 00:06:59,934
I mean, it's been six months.

149
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,998
Doesn't look like it's
heading in the right direction.

150
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,988
Has it really been six months?

151
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,427
You want your
patient to wake up,

152
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,762
you want it so badly,

153
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,165
you just hold out hope.

154
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,815
Maybe you're right.

155
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,652
Maybe I haven't been
completely honest with myself

156
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,037
or with her family.

157
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:24,742
It's time we let this poor
woman pass peacefully.

158
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,439
In the meantime,
I need you two to

159
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,091
do everything you
can to keep her alive

160
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,148
until I can get
her family in here.

161
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,117
Those children deserve one
last moment with their mother.

162
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,169
Can you do that for me, please?

163
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,855
Sure thing, Dr. Cain.

164
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,656
Thank you.

165
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,097
I did not expect that.

166
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,160
Let's hope we don't
have to put her through

167
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,001
any more than we already have.

168
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,772
Wow, honey, nice.

169
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,442
Okay, Derek, your X-rays are up.

170
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,807
- We're gonna take a look at
what's going on in your lungs.
- Oh, I thought maybe

171
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:03,192
we should put mesothelioma
at the top of Derek's differential.

172
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,265
His office is old.

173
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,984

I know you originally scheduled
this with Dr. Bell, Mr. Landry,

that appendectomy back in '09,

249
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:15,373

post-op infection.

250
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,069
Which led to recurrent
bowel obstruction

251
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,910

261
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,913
Just do your best to
make it the last time.

262
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,820

You see how wound

277
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,081
It's not a schtick.

278
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,550
It's medicine, only on TV.

279
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:51,753
Right.

280
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,972
Now if you'll excuse me,

281
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,906
I have a gallbladder removal.

282
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,519
Oh, uh, we-we weren't sure if
you were coming back today,

283
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,138
so they moved
that up the schedule

284
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:00,322
and I covered that for you.

285
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,076
We... You were
off doing your thing.

286
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,018

Why is Dawn Long

293
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,041
- She's sick.
- Is that supposed to be a joke?

294
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,644
She's been back here five
times since her operation.

295
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,641
Her treatment costs
are beginning to add up.

296
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:37,999
You're supposed to be making
us money, not costing us.

297
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:42,020
The woman is comatose.
Why are we not letting her die?

298
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,004
We will. Tomorrow.

299
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,375
Care to elaborate?

After six months, Dawn
Long's survival statistics

301
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,463
will no longer be
tracked, and our famous

302
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,150
Mother of all Surgeries

303
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:57,952
It's one for the record books.

304
00:13:57,987 --> 00:14:00,872
- And that six month mark...
- Is tomorrow.

305
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,086
She lives through the

306
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,221

will not go to waste.

307
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,696
We just need to keep her
breathing until the morning.

308
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,092
And the family is
on board for that?

309
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,916
They will be.

310
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:15,169
Okay.

311
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:18,105
One more day, then
end this charade.

312
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:23,026
Question.

313
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,212
Why is she so sick?

314
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:28,533
She's bedridden, on a vent,
decrease in swallowing function.

315
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:31,068
All adds up to
pneumonia. Very common.

316
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,419
Are you sure?

317
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,255
It's pneumonia. Trust me.

318
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,336
A mass?

319
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:51,605
- What kind of mass?
- We're not sure yet.

320
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,875
Is there a chance he'll
have to stay overnight?

321
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,437
We've got softball
tomorrow, Dad.

322
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,872
I know, honey. Don't worry.

323
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,128
We're just gonna do a biopsy.

324
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,875
It's a quick
procedure in the OR.

325
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,115
But you must have some
idea what the mass is.

326
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,051
There's no point in speculating.

327
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,217
Yeah, let's just wait
for the biopsy results

328
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,121
before jumping to
any conclusions.

329
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,310
A nurse will prep
you in a few minutes.

330
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:19,016
I'll be watching
the entire time.

331
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,406
Mom.

332
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:27,107
What are you hiding?

333
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:28,804
- Pardon?
- I saw how you stopped

334
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,556
Dr. Hawkins from
talking earlier.

335
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,958
You're not fooling me. I know
how you get when you're worried.

336
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:34,777
My husband has
a mass in his chest.

337
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,167
It's perfectly rational for
me to look for answers.

338
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,164
Why don't you take
Josie and grab a bite?

339
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,722
- The biopsy won't take long.
- Josie's coloring. She's fine.

340
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:44,908
Mom, quit sidelining
me. I'm not 18 anymore.

341
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,178
I can handle whatever
it is you're worried about.

342
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:50,097
I'm not worried about anything.

343
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:52,933
Everything is gonna be okay.

344
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,392
Retractor.

345
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,029
Molly's nerves are sky high,

346
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,019
and mine are catching up.

347
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:15,989
We need something
to go smoothly today.

348
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,992
Thank you for
being here, Conrad.

349
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:21,462
Well, you're family. Of course.

350
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:24,148
Thank you for taking this, AJ.

351
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,684
Anything for you, Dr. V.

352
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:31,022
Dissecting down
to the mediastinum.

353
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:35,025
Scope to me.

354
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,562
Passing the scope anterior

355
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,047
to the trachea.

356
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,484
Identifying my landmarks.

357
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,819
Uh...

358
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,390
All good down there?

359
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,639
I'm flush against
the pulmonary artery.

360
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:55,145
How close is it?

361
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,165
Biopsy forceps.

362
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,021
Oh, please, don't
nick that artery.

363
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,056
He won't.

364
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,372
And...

365
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,528
<i>- fin.</i>
- He didn't.

366
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,995
Let's get this little nugget

367
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:17,601
to the lab, shall we?

368
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,072
And now we wait for
the pathology report.

369
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:26,143
I hate this part.

370
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,013
Mr. Kim.

371
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:36,020
Welcome back, Dr. Bell.

372
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,039
Can I help you?

373
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,541
I'm just gonna take a
wild guess and assume

374
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:43,961
you're behind my removal
from the surgical schedule.

375
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,465
That's what you wanted, right?

376
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,134
Why would that be what I wanted?

377
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,753
From what I hear, you've
been AWOL for weeks,

378
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,555
working your second job.

379
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:57,942
My second job? I'm on a TV
show bringing publicity to Chastain.

380
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,139
And if a surgery has to be
handed off to an alternate

381
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,646
once in a blue moon,
it's a small price

382
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,132
- to keep a top surgeon around.
- Is that what you are?

383
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,435
We all pass our prime,

384
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,389
but we don't all retire
into fame and fortune.

385
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,442
Maybe don't look a
gift horse in the mouth.

386
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:18,412
I see you're having trouble
understanding. I'll simplify.

387
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,998
You lose me, you lose
more than a surgeon.

388
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,434
I know you'd love any reason
to get rid of me, but trust me,

389
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,953
you want me cutting
and you want me happy.

390
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:28,139
Don't be dramatic, Dr. Bell.

391
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,607
I don't want you gone.

392
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,344
I just don't care
if you're here.

393
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:37,865
Feldman.

394
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,301
- Got your page.
- Dr. Bell.

395
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,165
I didn't expect it to
be you. I just asked

396
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,033
for any available
general surgeon.

397
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,458
Well, I'm between
patients at the moment.

398
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,992
What's the problem?

399
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:51,979
Well, uh... follow me.

400
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,981
Uh...

401
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,671
Perirectal abscess.

402
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,143
You expect me to lance
a boil on a patient's ass?

403
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,140
It's too close to the rectal
muscle for me to do it.

404
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:11,215
Rules dictate a general
surgeon drains it.

405
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,751
Sorry.

406
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,652
Good afternoon, Nurse.

407
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:33,548
Have Pravesh and Nevin
learned anything about Ms. Long?

408
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,056
Uh, not yet.

409
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,074
Her prelim cultures
are negative,

410
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,060
but her BP has hardly improved.

411
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,627
Okay, let's open up the box.

412
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:43,030
Order fungal markers,
MALDI-TOF, the whole gamut.

413
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:46,033
Uh, what are we testing for?

414
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:48,013
Everything. Uh, you know,
I just want to be thorough.

415
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:50,721
Okay. I'll have Dr. Pravesh
put in those orders.

416
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,673
Nurse...

417
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:56,910
this case is deeply
personal to me.

418
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,379
I brought Dawn
Long into Chastain.

419
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:00,981
I was her surgeon.

420
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:02,845
I held her children's
hands through the post-op.

421
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,820
I am gonna be the last
person to leave her funeral.

422
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:09,323
I put her care entirely
on my shoulders,

423
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:11,892
and I'm gonna continue
to do so moving forward,

424
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:13,610
because...

425
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,946
I am her doctor.

426
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:19,266
Nobody else. Am I
making myself clear?

427
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:21,764
- Absolutely.
- You're gonna order

428
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,265
that fungal culture
under my name.

429
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,100
And who are you gonna
send the results to?

430
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,108
- You, Dr. Cain.
- Anybody else?

431
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,125
No.

432
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:30,160
Attagirl.

433
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,061
Dr. Bell.

434
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:48,596
To what do I owe this pleasure?

435
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:51,031
I heard you're operating
on Bill Landry today.

436
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,816
I am. 5:00 p.m. sharp.

437
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,352
Don't you love punctuality?

438
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:58,072
- Need an extra hand?
- I do not.

439
00:20:58,107 --> 00:21:00,090
I'm free at 5:00 p.m.

440
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,053
Excellent. I've got some
book recommendations.

441
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:04,962
- I've done a lot
of bowel resections.
- As have I.

442
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,491
AJ, come on, man.
I'm going stir-crazy.

443
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,942
My whole schedule's
been cleared for the day.

444
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,000
Right, so you could
be on television.

445
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:13,153
- Wow. You, too. Okay.
- I'll tell you what.

446
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,300
I will keep you in mind
for surgery. All right?

447
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:17,458
And if I do need you,

448
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:20,493
- I will make sure to ring the...
- Don't.

449
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,369
- Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding.
- Don't...

450
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,169
Derek has an aggressive
B-cell lymphoma.

451
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:55,762
I'm so sorry, Kit.

452
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:57,714
From here on in,

453
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,701
there are two parts
to a patient's life.

454
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,004
Before you know you have
cancer and after you know.

455
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,973
Right now, they're
in Derek's room

456
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:09,125
living in the before.

457
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,212
I heard them planning
tomorrow's dinner.

458
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,014
Brainstorming vacations

459
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:17,117
for after Molly's
school is finished.

460
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:18,485
But you and I...

461
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:21,021
We're already
living in the after,

462
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,573
where you don't plan vacations,
where you know everything

463
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,192
is not gonna be okay

464
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:27,962
for a very long time, if ever.

465
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:30,197
And we must drag them
into the after with us,

466
00:22:30,232 --> 00:22:33,217
and that is a terrible,
terrible thing to do.

467
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,218
I could tell them for you.

468
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,721
No. No.

469
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,390
This is my family.

470
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,087
They're gonna remember
these words forever,

471
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,745
and they must come from me.

472
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,982
Cancer?

473
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:50,233
Mommy, what's the matter?

474
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,703
- Daddy?
- It's all right, honey.

475
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,622
It's okay. Everything's okay.

476
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:57,758
Kit, can you

477
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,842
please have someone

478
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,677
take Josie to the play area?

479
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,095
Of course.

480
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,026
- I don't want to go.
- I know, sweetie.

481
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,501
It's just, it's, uh, it's
grown-up time right now.

482
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:09,536
It's fine.

483
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,946
Oh.

484
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,565
Thank you, honey.

485
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,457
What's next?

486
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:36,563
The oncologist, Dr. Jones,
will be in to talk to you soon.

487
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,067
He's a specialist in
this type of lymphoma.

488
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:41,963
What are the chances of
me getting out of this alive?

489
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,988
It's survivable.

490
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:47,107
How survivable?

491
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:51,879
Dr. Hawkins.

492
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:54,247
I have a daughter...

493
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:56,127
and I have a wife
to think about.

494
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:57,579
I need to know if we
should start making plans,

495
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,921
so please, just
lay it out for me.

496
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:02,267
There's still a lot
we don't know.

497
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,925
The chemo is called
R-CHOP, and it is not easy.

498
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:07,410
It'll make you feel
tired, nauseous.

499
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,630
Your white blood
cell counts will drop,

500
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:10,930
it could cause an infection.

501
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,828
But when you make
it through that...

502
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:15,469
Please. What are my chances?

503
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:19,122
You have a 50%
chance at being cured.

504
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,394
Molly.

505
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,030
It's okay. Just...

506
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,900
just give her a minute.

507
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,331
I asked you to
let me handle this.

508
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:47,000
Molly had ten seconds to
process her husband's lymphoma,

509
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:48,730
and you're discussing
survival rates.

510
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,705
I know. But he was
desperate and he asked me,

511
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,107
so I had to honor that.

512
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:01,865
We had a deal.

513
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,745
You said you would funnel
everything through me,

514
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,136
that I would tell them, I
would soften the blow.

515
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,887
But you didn't.

516
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,141
And now look what happened.
You told them he could die.

517
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,744
You made it worse, Conrad.
You made it so much worse.

518
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,512
I understand.

519
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,715
You're not mad at me.
You're mad at cancer.

520
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,000
You're scared for Derek.

521
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:22,986
You're scared Molly will
fall apart, or that you will.

522
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,506
I know. I'm sorry.

523
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:29,076
But that poor man.
That poor, darling man,

524
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,039
- he doesn't deserve this.
- No, he doesn't.

525
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:34,014
No one does.

526
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,833
But you and I...

527
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,036
We're gonna do
everything we can.

528
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:42,055
And when we're done, I
know you will be strong enough

529
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,375
to put yourself and
everyone else back together.

530
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,196
Okay.

531
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,064
Thank you.

532
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:53,483
- I'm fine.
- I know you are.

533
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:57,838
And for the record,

534
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:01,124
I absolutely can be
mad at cancer and you.

535
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:21,194
I gave her 0.5 of
lorazepam, but it didn't work.

536
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:22,373
And I-I didn't know what to do.

537
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:23,908
She's been seizing
for nearly a minute.

538
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:25,043
All right, give her
another two milligrams.

539
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:26,182
Turn her up to 100% O2.

540
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:34,140
Okay. She's settling.

541
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:39,112
- She's in V tach.
- Get the crash cart,
pull up 300 of amio.

542
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:41,843
We're gonna save
this woman's life

543
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:42,978
just so she can die again

544
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,179
when the family pulls the plug.

545
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:46,231
If they pull the plug. She's
not DNR. We have to save her.

546
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:48,566
- It's not right.
- I know, Devon,
but we don't have a choice.

547
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,390
We're torturing her.

548
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,197
She's coding. We
have to bag her.

549
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,886
All right.

550
00:27:13,516 --> 00:27:15,698
- I'm sorry.
- No, Molly...

551
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,969
I ran out of the room just
when Derek needed me most.

552
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,987
I was thinking of myself.

553
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:23,257
I fell apart when I
should have been strong.

554
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:25,275
That's all I ever do.

555
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,259
And that's why
you're telling doctors

556
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:27,610
not to talk in front of me.

557
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,113
Letting my sick husband
hear about his condition,

558
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,999
but not his totally
healthy, medically trained,

559
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:34,679
"should be able
to handle it" wife.

560
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:37,054
I'm proud of you.

561
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,656
I know sometimes
I try to protect you

562
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:43,059
like you're still a kid,
but that's my mistake.

563
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,095
Look at you.

564
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,627
You're in your second year of
med school, top of your class.

565
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:50,868
You have a wonderful
child, a strong marriage

566
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,670
and I am endlessly proud of you.

567
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,442
Sometimes I think, without
him, I couldn't breathe.

568
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,063
He's my rock.

569
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,399
You may not see this,
but you're his rock, too.

570
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:18,156
All right, Chu. We're
looking at an hour or less

571
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,547
- with Mr. Landry here.
- Roger that.

572
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:22,110
10 blade to me.

573
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:24,667
All right. Let's give
this team owner

574
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,787
a new lease on life, shall we?

575
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:34,093
Uh, all right, Chu, let's
make it 90 minutes.

576
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,164
There's a country mile of
scar tissue in this bad boy.

577
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,879
90 minutes. Got it.

578
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,302
Retractor.

579
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,374
Make that two hours.

580
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,078
Uh, in fact, you know
what? Make it four.

581
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:54,565
It's like tissue paper in here.

582
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,211
You know, I'm gonna
need another set of hands.

583
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,450
I'll page Dr. Singh.

584
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,471
Actually... make it Dr. Bell.

585
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,984
Bell? Is he still
full-time here?

586
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,776
Check the cafeteria. And
when you find him, tell him

587
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,144
not to let it get to his head,

588
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,812
but I need him in my OR, stat.

589
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,467
Hey.

590
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:19,155
You okay?

591
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,958
Well, I just saved a
woman's life. A woman who,

592
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,545
by all rights, should
be long dead, so...

593
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,980
Anyway, you paged. What's up?

594
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,549
Told Dr. Voss that you
used to be a chemo nurse,

595
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:31,068
and that you were great at it.

596
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,680
The best, is what
I actually said.

597
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,056
We fill the patient with toxins

598
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:37,785
and hope it only
kills the bad stuff.

599
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,726
- It's hell on them.
- I know.

600
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:41,773
And it can take its
toll on you, as well.

601
00:29:41,797 --> 00:29:43,525
Yeah, I mean, the oncologists,
they just give the orders.

602
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,116
The nurses stay with the
patients, watch them struggle.

603
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,335
It's... it's heartbreaking.

604
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,021
You don't have to do it.

605
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,006
No, it's okay.

606
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,860
For Kit, her family, anything.

607
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:59,136
How about we get a family
member to sit with you,

608
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,347
track how you feel?

609
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:02,994
That way you don't have
to spend extra energy

610
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,000
communicating with the nurses.

611
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,968
That would be me.

612
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,989
Sorry I'm late. The vending
machine line was crazy.

613
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:12,643
I read snacks are important
during chemo sessions.

614
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:16,480
Sweet or salty? Sweet.

615
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:19,766
Are you comfortable?

616
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:22,201
I-I ordered pillows.

617
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,454
I'm good. Really.

618
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,988
I know you are.

619
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,642
You're always good.

620
00:30:28,677 --> 00:30:31,194
In fact, you're the bravest
person I've ever met.

621
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,614
But today, you focus
on getting better,

622
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,483
and I'll handle the rest.

623
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:45,625
Come here. It's okay.

624
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,910
It's okay.

625
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,167
It's okay.

626
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:56,636
Come here. I know.

627
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:58,432
- I'm so sorry.
- I know...

628
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,142
We got this, okay?

629
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:04,944
I promise.

630
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,276
I love unicorns.

631
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,830
What's going on with Mom?

632
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,598
Do you mind if, um,

633
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:29,252
- just you and I talk?
- Of course, yeah.

634
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,005
I'll meet you guys in
the waiting room, okay?

635
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,273
Waiting room, okay?

636
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,513
I don't know exactly how
to say this to you, but...

637
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:43,050
your mother, she's...

638
00:31:43,085 --> 00:31:45,919
she's not really there anymore.

639
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:48,071
What do you mean?

640
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:50,251
We haven't measured any type

641
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,958
of meaningful brain activity,

642
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,944
and we haven't
for some time now.

643
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,730
Now, I know that we were
holding out hope for a miracle.

644
00:31:57,766 --> 00:32:00,784
I truly, truly believed
that it was gonna happen.

645
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,297
But the chances are
getting slimmer by the day.

646
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:10,109
You think we should let her go?

647
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:12,412
Your mother's
fought a good fight.

648
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,731
And we all love her.

649
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,767
We did our best
to heal her, but...

650
00:32:18,753 --> 00:32:20,837
yes, it's time.

651
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,157
Um...

652
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,593
How would it happen?

653
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:28,010
Would you just...

654
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,130
turn off all her machines?

655
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:32,415
Yes, we'd make sure
she's comfortable.

656
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,585
We'll give her some morphine,
so she doesn't feel any pain.

657
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,198
You can have a ceremony
right here in the room.

658
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,172
Just the family.

659
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,176
Can I arrange that for you?

660
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:56,823
Okay.

661
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,145
Done and done.

662
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,019
What made you change your mind?

663
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:13,806
Multiple previous
abdominal surgeries.

664
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:15,670
There's scar tissue
everywhere, man.

665
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,177
I can barely lyse the adhesions

666
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:20,330
without tearing
into the intestines.

667
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,867
This is a mess.

668
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:24,985
Tell me about it.

669
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:29,238
This could take till
daybreak, you know?

670
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,026
You got someplace to be?

671
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:34,627
I'm a surgeon.

672
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:35,946
Where would I have to be?

673
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:39,416
Retractor to me.

674
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:44,704
Uh, Nic, I think he's shivering.

675
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:47,039
Well, that's normal
with chemo. Here.

676
00:33:48,844 --> 00:33:50,493
Are his Ts peaking?

677
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,062
Let me print an EKG.

678
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:53,613
And get Conrad in here.

679
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,994
We're just checking
with the doctor.

680
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:58,058
I'm sure you're fine.

681
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,869
You're right... good catch.

682
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,339
Let's get a crash
cart in here, come on!

683
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,101
Push one gram of
calcium gluconate.

684
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,576
Derek, honey, it's gonna
be fine... I'm right here.

685
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,945
Derek wasn't
shivering, he's twitching.

686
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,191
He must be hypocalcemic.

687
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,348
And with his high
potassium, he's in danger

688
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,078
of cardiac arrest. He's in TLS.

689
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:15,763
Let's get the pacer
pads on him now!

690
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,371
Give him ten units of
insulin, an amp of D-50

691
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:21,675
- and an amp of bicarb.
- Derek has Tumor Lysis Syndrome.

692
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,060
As the chemo kills
his cancer cells...

693
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,124
Dying cells release toxins

694
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,747
In other words,

695
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,115
the cure could kill him.

696
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:32,235
So we have a
catch-22. Before his first

697
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,048
round of chemo's complete,
we need to give him

698
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,372
fluids in order to prevent
his kidneys from failing.

699
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,641
But doing that puts his lungs

700
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,238
in danger of filling
with fluid again.

701
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:42,378

touch-and-go till sunrise.

overnight surgery.

762
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:42,952
The patient had a
dozen bowel obstructions
