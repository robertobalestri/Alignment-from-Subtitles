1
00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:02,534
<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,447
<i>Does she know you're in
love with her? I'm her mentor.</i>

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:07,089
To be anything else would cross
a line that I would never cross.

4
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:08,340
That must be hard on you.

5
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,519
You might be a
genius at medicine,

6
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,687
<i>but when it comes to love,</i>

7
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,440
<i>these unexpected Raptor feelings</i>

8
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:14,957
<i>- is too much.
- He's my mentor.</i>

9
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,048
<i>Nothing more.</i>

10
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,978
- Turn off all his morphine.
- You can't be serious.

11
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:20,636
Then we add a dose of Narcan.

12
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:22,199
What you're talking
about is torture.

13
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,983
What I'm talking
about is this man,

14
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,624
who'll die unless Rob Spiro

15
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,287
<i>tells us where he's being held.</i>

16
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:29,351
- I want no part of it.
- It has to be done.

17
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,130
<i>C-Could you slow down?</i>

18
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:50,477
I'd like to make it to the
conference in one piece.

19
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:53,135
We will. But riddle me this.

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,954
Why is there an illicit bag

21
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,806
of trail mix on my
leather upholstery?

22
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,008
Okay, first, you wouldn't
let me choose the music.

23
00:01:00,044 --> 00:01:01,838
The driver picks.
Everybody knows that.

24
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:02,888
And now you're
saying I can't eat.

25
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:03,990
What part of
"leather upholstery"

26
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:05,430
does not compute?

27
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,633
For the record, you
could've stayed at Chastain.

28
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,551
Oh, and miss your presentation?

29
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:12,721
Over somebody else's dead body.

30
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:14,806
Look, as your mentor,

31
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,693
it's a privilege to
ensure that your debut

32
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:19,878
at the Society of
Georgia Surgeons

33
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,896
is filled with all the pomp

34
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,433
and circumstance it deserves.

35
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,035
This weekend's
gonna change your life.

36
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:35,460
The hell?

37
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,081
I told you to slow down.

38
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,377
What happened to this kid?

39
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,112
Unclear.

40
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:56,242
Someone said he collapsed
while walking at the mall.

41
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:58,266
Hold compressions.
Let's check for a pulse.

42
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,448
No cardiac activity.

43
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,700
Been over 30 minutes, no pulse.

44
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:22,341
Time of death, 14:20.

45
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:38,806
You know, there's
nothing but brush out here.

46
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:42,410
You keep pacing like that,
you're liable to start a fire.

47
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,779
Wow.

48
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:47,199
Looks like somebody's
got the Halloween spirit.

49
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,552
That's up year-round.

50
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,467
Giant homemade voodoo
doll to ward off evil spirits.

51
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,741
Some folks think we're
cursed around here.

52
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,426
All right, lay it on me, my man.

53
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:00,128
What's wrong with my baby?

54
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:02,047
Your radiator hose burst.

55
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,145
Ooh! Hello. Um, we have

56
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:07,649
a medical conference to get to.
How long is that going to take?

57
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,388
Good mechanic
can fix it in a day.

58
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,158
You got a guy?

59
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,844
Aren't you our guy?

60
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,959
Best I can do is find you a
shop in the city, come get you.

61
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:20,493
That's three hours away.

62
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:21,933
We don't have that kind of time.

63
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,312
So, since he can't
get the job done,

64
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,332
let's call Chastain
and have Bell send

65
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:27,638
- the Red Rock chopper.
- That's a solid backup plan,

66
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,741
but it shouldn't be necessary.

67
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,159
I got this.

68
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,496
- Okay.
- Look,

69
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:36,030
we're here. You're here.

70
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,866
Why can't you
just do the repair?

71
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:40,468
I don't work on cars like this.

72
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:42,182
Really?

73
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:44,972
Your customer reviews
online say differently.

74
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:49,961
Well...

75
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,598
it ain't gonna be cheap.

76
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,066
Well...

77
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,385
it's good that
money isn't an object.

78
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:01,006
So I'm assuming
you can give us a ride

79
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,792
in that big old rusty,
sexy truck of yours.

80
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,954
- He's weird.
- Mm.

81
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,686
I usually avoid weird people,
especially on Halloween.

82
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,221
So you want to stay
here till it gets dark?

83
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:23,395
I'm sure it gets real
fun out here after dark.

84
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:27,769
- Good point.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,427
A morgue assistant
dressed as a ghost?

86
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:40,874
Is that good thinking?

87
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:42,242
Boo.

88
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,749
Are you gonna
finish the paperwork

89
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,768
or... what?

90
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:49,571
Sure thing.

91
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,091
- It's a terrible idea.
- It's a great idea
and you're gonna love it.

92
00:04:58,115 --> 00:04:59,364
Okay, can someone

93
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,810
please tell Conrad that
leaving a bowl of candy out

94
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,244
for the trick-or-treaters
was a bad idea?

95
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,013
Yeah, well, the first
kid's just gonna steal it all.

96
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,448
Thank you.

97
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,966
I don't want to come
home to a TP'd house.

98
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,758
Kids are unforgiving if they
think you're not into Halloween.

99
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:10,937
Why do I get the
impression that you were

100
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:12,105
one of those unforgiving kids?

101
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:13,294
You just got to show people

102
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:14,941
that you're in the spirit.

103
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,252
Wow. Tough crowd.

104
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,655
You guys are no fun.

105
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:27,442
Hey, Pravesh, could
you please tell me why

106
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:29,238
your dead patient
is currently sitting up

107
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,563
in his body bag?

108
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,293
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Bring in the crash cart. Let's get him up

109
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:36,429
- on the monitors.
- I'll bag him.

110
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:38,403
Hang a liter of saline wide open

111
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,038
and draw a trauma panel.

112
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,301
I'd say this dude
looks like he's alive.

113
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:42,325
He had no pulse,

114
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,775
asystole in both leads

115
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,605
and an ultrasound
with no cardiac activity.

116
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,039
Well, there's
definitely activity now.

117
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:48,863
Your patient just came
back from the dead.

118
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:53,451
Happy Halloween.

119
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,956
♪ ♪

120
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:08,517
Tell me you understand

121
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:11,352
pronouncing a live
patient dead is a big deal.

122
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,325
Remy had no pulse,
no heart sounds,

123
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:16,407
no spontaneous breaths
or pupillary light reflex.

124
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,826
I followed protocol.

125
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:19,778
Clearly, your protocol was off.

126
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,413
And what about your protocol?

127
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,881
You tortured a patient.

128
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,051
What we're gonna
talk about right now...

129
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,919
is your screwup.

130
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,005
Are we good here?

131
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,473
Yeah.

132
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:33,002
Just trying to figure
out what happened.

133
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,522
They're taking Remy to the ICU.

134
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:38,530
- I think it's Lazarus syndrome.
- It fits the profile.

135
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,743
Spontaneous
return of circulation

136
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,644
- after CPR fails?
- It does happen

137
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,779
once in a blue
moon when pressure

138
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,247
builds up in the
chest during CPR.

139
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,533
Yeah. There's no explanation
for it. I've seen it one time,

140
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:47,733
and it looked just like this.

141
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:48,956
So I didn't screw up.

142
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,908
No. You still screwed up.

143
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,705
- You put the guy in a damn
body bag. Just dial it back

144
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,529
a little bit. It's a
mistake, all right?

145
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,567
Okay. You know what, you
guys? Just have fun with this.

146
00:06:58,619 --> 00:06:59,851
Good luck.

147
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:03,321
But now that he's alive,
you get a second chance.

148
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,572
So, what caused him

149
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,208
to nearly die to begin with?

150
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,610
Do you idiots want me dead?

151
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,524
I don't want the black doctor
on the billboard out there.

152
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:12,892
Trauma bay 11.

153
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,060
Or the Indian kid.

154
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:16,044
30-year-old male.
Sudden onset headache.

155
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,435
BP 210/90.

156
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,304
History of a arteriovenous
malformation.

157
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,421
Okay, BP is high.

158
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,140
One, two, three.

159
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:24,092
Okay. Good luck.

160
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:30,098
Perhaps you don't know who I am?

161
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,432
We know who you are, Hades.

162
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:33,635
You're hard to miss
on social media.

163
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,264
Good, then I shouldn't
have to reiterate

164
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,248
that I don't want the
brown guy touching me.

165
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,589
"Feldman"? I don't think
you'll be touching me,

166
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,073
- either.
- Hmm.

167
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,441
Hold on there, cupcake.

168
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,477
- What're you doing?
- I'm starting an IV.

169
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,928
Then I'm going to
put leads on your body

170
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:50,252
for the cardiac monitor.

171
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:51,967
And I'm going to
attach a pulse ox.

172
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:53,872
All right. You know what?

173
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,408
You don't want to be
treated, that's fine by us.

174
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,009
Let's go.

175
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,077
I wouldn't mess with
them if I were you.

176
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:06,151
Look, I was diagnosed

177
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,802
with the AVM when I was a kid.

178
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,421
Doc said I should
call an ambulance

179
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,257
if I ever got a severe headache.

180
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,493
- We'll be back.
- Just you and the girl will do.

181
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:19,096
More proof

182
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,628
that evil doesn't always come
in a mask on a movie screen.

183
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:23,801
Guys like him spew
hate on a regular basis,

184
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,271
- and ignorant people eat it up.
- Despite that,

185
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,538
we have to do our jobs

186
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,507
and treat him like
any other patient.

187
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,959
- Or not.
- No, you're right.

188
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:34,023
And that being said, a
headache in someone

189
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,464
with an AVM could
indicate a sentinel bleed.

190
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,378
But he needs an MRI
to confirm because he's...

191
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:41,119
First, we need to get
his BP under control.

192
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,170
Hypertension could
cause his AVM to rupture.

193
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,807
Which is what I was just about
to say if you'd let me finish.

194
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,992
I'll start a nicardipine drip.

195
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,789
And I will schedule an MRI

196
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:50,990
and get him sent to the ICU.

197
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:52,909
I'm gonna go check
on my Lazarus patient.

198
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,933
And I'll come with.

199
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,402
Make sure he doesn't
die on us again.

200
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:03,274
Um... it's Halloween.

201
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,609
Where is everyone?

202
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,728
Shouldn't there be little
kids in annoying costumes

203
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,313
asking for wrapped sugar?

204
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,948
Well, look at all the businesses
that have closed down.

205
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,533
You can't trick-or-treat

206
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:14,903
if there's nobody to
give out the candy.

207
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,310
All right, looks like we're
definitely getting a room.

208
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,863
- Get something to eat?
- Yeah.

209
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,450
Uh, excuse me?

210
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,620
Okay. Well, service needs work.

211
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,110
Go at it. You just have to

212
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,594
tug down.

213
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,115
♪ ♪

214
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,677
Side-eye alert.

215
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:34,449
Where are we?

216
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:36,250
Hey.

217
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,936
You need to order and leave.

218
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,603
Why?

219
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:45,242
And what happened to your arm?

220
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,909
I'll order you two specials.

221
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:52,317
To go.

222
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:06,231
- We need to see Hades right now.
- Visiting hours just ended.

223
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,609
You'll have to come
back tomorrow.

224
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,568
I don't care. Like it or
not, we're gonna see him.

225
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,903
Why don't you go

226
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,966
- make that happen.
- That won't be necessary.

227
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,840
Dr. Randolph Bell,

228
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,875
CEO, Chief of Surgery
here at Chastain.

229
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,343
Zeke Metcalfe.

230
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,995
As I was telling these folks,

231
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,871
- we need to see Hades.
- I understand,

232
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,750
but we can't have
people visiting at all hours.

233
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,463
Our patients need
their rest... It's my job

234
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,198
to make sure they
get what they need.

235
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,621
And Hades needs me.

236
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,807
His health is complicated.

237
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:35,476
If anything comes up, our
staff is capable of handling it.

238
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:38,463
Yeah? You mean like the
black guy on the billboard?

239
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,516
'Cause if that's the case...

240
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,129
can't say I trust
your judgment, Doc.

241
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:45,153
My judgment is not the issue.

242
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,605
Your compliance is. I
don't like to call the police,

243
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,923
but when a situation
warrants, I do.

244
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,976
You tell me.

245
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,412
Does this situation
warrant a call?

246
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,265
Okay.

247
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,267
We'll play ball for now.

248
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:03,320
We'll be back first thing, hmm?

249
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,740
Without the guns.

250
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,676
Georgia might be open carry.

251
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:12,063
Chastain is not.

252
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,198
You think you're something, huh?

253
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,601
You got that fancy suit.

254
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,470
You got these
walls to protect you.

255
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,522
But let me give
you the brass tacks.

256
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:24,609
If anything happens to Hades,

257
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,512
I'm gonna hold you
personally responsible,

258
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,663
and there won't be anyone...

259
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:33,334
or anything that'll stop
me from getting to you.

260
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:10,455
- I see Hades has landed.
- He has an AVM,

261
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,934
which may or may
not become emergent.

262
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,474
If he dies at Chastain,

263
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,304
there's no telling what
his followers will do.

264
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,694
Yeah, they're a violent bunch.

265
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,391
Sounds like you need
a surgeon to perform

266
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:21,165
- a flawless AVM resection.
- Preferably before it ruptures.

267
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,651
I'll do it.

268
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,089
He's a racist who
incites violence

269
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:30,102
against people
who look like you.

270
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:32,109
- Why volunteer?
- Because my heart can find

271
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,755
the compassion in
all human beings,

272
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,796
no matter our differences.

273
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,761
Just get him out
of this hospital...

274
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,352
alive.

275
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,993
Well, if it isn't
the poster boy.

276
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,929
Am I supposed to be impressed?

277
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,097
Hey.

278
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,748
Tell me, how does it feel

279
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:57,151
knowing that you're
only filling a quota?

280
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,453
Chances are your
AVM is bleeding.

281
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:02,306
Without surgery, you
can die at any time.

282
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,253
Might want to be nice to a
man that could save your life.

283
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,527
I will be, once I meet
the real American

284
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,346
who should have your job.

285
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,702
I've met my share
of people like you.

286
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,834
Weak, ignorant, false
sense of superiority.

287
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,170
Many of them tried
to take me down,

288
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,306
but all their efforts
ended up the same.

289
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,725
- Yeah? How's that?
- The look.

290
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,344
A pained expression when
they realized I was smarter

291
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:25,846
and more talented
than they ever would be.

292
00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:29,850
Hey, I know my rights.
I want another surgeon.

293
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,870
Cool. I have no problems

294
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,835
learning about your
death on the news.

295
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:38,725
Wait, please!

296
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,963
Don't listen to him.

297
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:43,342
To who?

298
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,216
To Hades.

299
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:49,587
Listen to me. Douglas Atwater.

300
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,706
I-I-I'm begging you.

301
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,708
Help me, please.

302
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,209
We were able to
get you off the vent,

303
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,934
but you have what we
call dilated cardiomyopathy.

304
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,187
This puts you at
risk for arrhythmias...

305
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:08,222
which can be fatal.

306
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,785
And if you had
one earlier today,

307
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,537
that could explain why
you lost consciousness.

308
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:14,561
The tests also revealed
that you have liver damage.

309
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,698
He wants to be discharged.

310
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:20,801
Well...

311
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,848
that would be a mistake.

312
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:24,884
Okay, we know our rights.
You can't keep him here.

313
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:26,924
Isn't that right, Remy?

314
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,359
Uh...

315
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,644
Bro, i-if you won't
discharge me,

316
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,546
I'll just leave on my own.

317
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,766
Hey.

318
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,897
You are very sick, Remy.

319
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:40,538
Technically, you
already died once today.

320
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,808
You leave this hospital,
and you could actually die.

321
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,021
Remy, we already
ran some basic tests.

322
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,906
Why not just stick around for
all the results to come back?

323
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,447
You have to pay for them anyway.

324
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:54,135
Okay, fine. But after that,
then we're out of here.

325
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,207
Did you see the track marks

326
00:16:00,243 --> 00:16:02,259
on their arms?

327
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,912
I think they're addicts.

328
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:07,447
We need to see what drugs he's
taking before we move forward.

329
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,528
Wait, you're speculating.
He needs a cardiac cath

330
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,935
to figure out what caused
his cardiomyopathy.

331
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,349
Might even need
a liver biopsy, too.

332
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,101
Did you hear them?
They want to leave.

333
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,502
It's hard enough to get them
to wait for Remy's test results,

334
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,577
you want to recommend
invasive procedures?

335
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,962
In this situation,
it's called for.

336
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,382
He has life-threatening
conditions

337
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,850
that need to be worked up.

338
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,393
Remy doesn't want to be
bombarded with tests right now,

339
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,329
so we build up some trust
first, and then we go from there.

340
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:40,848
Understood?

341
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:47,404
I was diagnosed with multiple
personality disorder as a kid.

342
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,925
Hades... the man
you've been speaking to...

343
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,689
- he takes over my body.
- You lost me at multiple
personality disorder.

344
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,596
- It's-it's a real thing.
- It's not.

345
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,393
It is. A do-doctor in
Oregon diagnosed us.

346
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,784
- I can get you his number.
- A doctor in California says

347
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,303
that yogurt treats brain
tumors. Doesn't make it so.

348
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:05,590
You-you have no idea of the
hell that Hades puts me through.

349
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,191
He makes all of our decisions.

350
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,871
He insults me. He suppresses me.

351
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,961
I lose control every
day, but right here,

352
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,546
right now I am winning.

353
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,614
I have an opportunity
to get what I want,

354
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,851
and I want you to operate.

355
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,186
And you're willing to sign
a consent for surgery?

356
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,405
Yes.

357
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:25,376
Okay.

358
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,412
The car won't be finished today,

359
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,476
but we can still make it
to the conference on time

360
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,868
if we leave early tomorrow.

361
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,888
♪ <i>What's the use</i> ♪

362
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,019
♪ <i>Of my crying</i> ♪

363
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:42,354
♪ <i>If you don't care anymore?</i> ♪

364
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:44,545
Here's your food.

365
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:48,065
I suggest you check into your
hotel room and eat upstairs.

366
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,466
Hey, let's-let's hit pause

367
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,130
on the dramatic
heads-up for a minute.

368
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,421
- Let's talk about that arm.
- It looks inflamed,

369
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:56,535
and has grown past the
bandage. Have you seen a doctor?

370
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,487
We don't have
doctors in this town,

371
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,155
so I drove three
hours to Atlanta

372
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,341
and got a prescription for
penicillin that isn't working.

373
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:05,282
There must be some reason
why the antibiotic isn't working.

374
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,486
Sonya.

375
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,271
Everything okay over here?

376
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:11,605
We're okay, Phil.

377
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,040
Hey, listen,

378
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:14,492
Phil, we are okay.

379
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,804
All right? We don't
want any problems.

380
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,196
You don't like black
people. We get it.

381
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,349
They're not racist.

382
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:24,318
That's not why
you're not welcome.

383
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,854
We want you to leave
because you're doctors.

384
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:30,291
Boone spread the word
you're from Chastain.

385
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,827
Which means you work for
Red Rock Mountain Medical.

386
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,824
The company that
bought our hospital

387
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,708
and shut it down
because no one here

388
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:38,093
could afford
their inflated bills.

389
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,545
I was a nurse anesthetist.

390
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:41,385
Best damn job I ever had.

391
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,216
I took care of their
electrical, top to bottom.

392
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,918
Did it for 30 years.

393
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:48,387
I used to make good
money at my pharmacy.

394
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:50,628
Now there's no one
here to write prescriptions.

395
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,763
All the doctors left
when the hospital closed.

396
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,416
Leaving us to
care for our elderly

397
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:57,618
and mentally ill on our own.

398
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,236
We had nothing to do with that,

399
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,205
so if there's any
way we can help...

400
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,958
- Like looking at the arm.
- Look, eat here if you want,

401
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:05,426
but please, just leave me alone.

402
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:35,622
He's in V-tach. Move.

403
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,138
Get a crash cart in here now!

404
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:41,190
- Wait, what's happening?
- His heart
stopped beating again.

405
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,213
I need one of epi
and charge to 200.

406
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,730
Charge.

407
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:50,755
- Clear.
- None of that is gonna work.

408
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,110
Bella, please, we are trying
to save Remy's life. Okay.

409
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:54,108
Charge again.

410
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:55,621
Clear.

411
00:19:55,645 --> 00:19:58,496
Stop! You can't
save him, but I can.

412
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:02,433
Remy needs some of my blood.

413
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,684
Because he's a
vampire and so am I.

414
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,142
Let's start him on 300
milligrams of amiodarone.

415
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,639
- And get another EKG.
- Right away.

416
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:14,862
He doesn't need that.

417
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:16,213
He needs blood.

418
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,982
You guys don't
get it. This is why

419
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,349
we didn't tell you how we live.

420
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,829
The media just
spouts so many lies.

421
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,330
We're not here to judge you.

422
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,956
- We just want to help.
- In order to treat

423
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,657
and diagnose you correctly...

424
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:30,328
Remy, tell us about
your vampirism lifestyle.

425
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:34,314
We...

426
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,834
feed on a limited amount

427
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,936
of one another's blood.

428
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,189
Al-Always safely.

429
00:20:42,224 --> 00:20:44,325
Okay. So...

430
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,026
what does that do for you?

431
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:48,007
It gives us energy.

432
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:49,346
Vitality.

433
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,615
Imagine the most
alive you've ever felt

434
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,534
and multiply it by ten.

435
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,235
And since we share blood,

436
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,571
it's like we share one essence.

437
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,573
Our connection...

438
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,592
is both physical and spiritual.

439
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,005
Remy, we still don't know

440
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,439
what caused you
to collapse earlier.

441
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,330
The answer could
be in your blood.

442
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,694
- You need more extensive tests.
- No, he doesn't.

443
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:10,896
- We've been safe.
- You love Remy.

444
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,936
We can see that.

445
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:15,923
Regardless of how safe
you are, you're sharing blood,

446
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,359
which means you're both at
risk for blood-borne illnesses.

447
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,532
If Bella's in danger,
there's no question.

448
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,050
Do the test.

449
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,571
I won't let you take any risks.

450
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:37,945
I hear you met Hades

451
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,430
and Doug.

452
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,082
Word travels fast.

453
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:43,583
Don't often see DID
patients around here...

454
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:46,203
Dissociative identity disorder...
Whatever they're calling

455
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,772
multiple personality
disorder these days.

456
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,602
Why bother renaming
something that's pure fiction?

457
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:53,694
I don't believe that... I mean,
I've seen a handful of cases

458
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,707
- during my career.
- Well, if it does exist,

459
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,315
it's not because of anyone's
childhood or their mommy.

460
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,601
I think it's a cagey
form of manipulation.

461
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,397
How can you say that
with so much certainty?

462
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,798
I mean, don't you
think we should look

463
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,056
at our patient's
psychiatric records to see

464
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,592
what a doctor who has a
degree in that area has to say?

465
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,595
I heard the words
"we" and "our."

466
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,131
Are you tagging
yourself on to my case?

467
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,794
Who do you think
scheduled the MRI

468
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:17,401
that's currently in progress?

469
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,963
Well, now we have confirmation

470
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:31,777
that the AVM
needs to be excised.

471
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:33,278
It's hemorrhaging
into the temporal lobe

472
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:34,613
and the surrounding tissue.

473
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:37,671
What's this, next to the AVM?

474
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:39,651
Looks like mesial
temporal lobe sclerosis,

475
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:42,192
inflammatory scarring.

476
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,862
People with sclerotic tissue
are more prone to seizures,

477
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,948
but in this area of the brain,

478
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:50,329
it presents as
personality changes.

479
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:53,637
Doug is having seizures that
are manifesting as Hades?

480
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,190
Yes. It's not DID.

481
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:58,876
It's temporal lobe epilepsy
as a result of sclerotic tissue.

482
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:03,664
Which means I can
literally cut out Hades.

483
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,845
I can get him into
the OR tonight.

484
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:08,964
You're talking about removing
a portion of this man's brain.

485
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,254
You know as well as I do

486
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,883
there could be serious
consequences to this.

487
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:14,341
We need a second
opinion, a neurology consult,

488
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:16,855
and more than anything, we
need to see his psych records.

489
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:20,359
Nevin, I like you
most of the time.

490
00:23:20,383 --> 00:23:22,800
But you're a nurse practitioner.

491
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,869
Don't ever question me.

492
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,592
And with one delicate
stroke of the scalpel,

493
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,661
I can and will, single-handedly,

494
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:36,313
free you from the evil
that has hijacked your life.

495
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,466
Thank you, Dr. Cain. Thank you.

496
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,702
It's my pleasure.

497
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:43,253
Oh, you're so pathetic.

498
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,102
Did you really
think I wouldn't fight

499
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,592
my way back to the surface?

500
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,611
You need consent to operate.

501
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,024
I already got the
consent from Doug.

502
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:53,547
Oh, yeah, that shadow of a man?

503
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,194
I'm revoking it.

504
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:57,935
I'll go to another hospital.

505
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,953
Get my discharge papers.

506
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,531
Hi, Remy.

507
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:14,067
All of your hepatitis
panels and the HIV test

508
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:15,798
- came back negative.
- So we added on

509
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:19,084
some additional studies
looking at your iron levels.

510
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,291
You have hemochromatosis.
It's a condition

511
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,055
where the body
stores too much iron.

512
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:26,914
Excess iron poisons
organs, which, for you,

513
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:28,982
- caused heart and liver disease.
- Okay.

514
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:32,064
Is it treatable? Tell
me it's treatable.

515
00:24:32,088 --> 00:24:34,705
It is. We reduce the
iron levels in your body

516
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,318
and, because
blood is rich in iron,

517
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,475
the best course of action is...

518
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,075
bloodletting.

519
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:45,883
We'll need to do a
phlebotomy tonight.

520
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,418
And every week
for the next month.

521
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,604
It will give your body the
best chance to recover.

522
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,275
Wait. You're-you're
talking just a little.

523
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,975
Like, drops, right?

524
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,078
Remy will need to give a pint

525
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:00,092
each time. And in order

526
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:02,282
to maintain control
over your disease...

527
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:06,570
you can't take in
any excess iron.

528
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,121
It's not their call.

529
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:10,037
We need to discuss
this. Leave us alone.

530
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:33,196
Uh, my bad.

531
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,248
Look, even the
Raptor is a little rattled

532
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,494
this Halloween evening, right?

533
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:38,463
Yeah. It's okay.

534
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:40,098
But we'll get a
good night's rest.

535
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,656
Tomorrow, this town
will be far behind.

536
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:44,691
And the next phase
of your career begins

537
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:46,593
with this speech.

538
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,212
You sound so sure.

539
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,530
Let me break it down
to you, Miss Cleo style.

540
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,651
Your speech is going to be fire.

541
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:56,737
You're going to receive
countless fellowship offers,

542
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,590
and in five years you will
no longer need a mentor,

543
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,075
and we will be...

544
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,663
something else.

545
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,502
Something more.

546
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,423
But I will still consider
myself the better.

547
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:18,541
And you would be wrong.

548
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,928
Oh, we'll see.

549
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,101
Okay.

550
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:30,704
Um, thanks for everything.

551
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,576
- Night.
- Good night.

552
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,069
I don't see discharge papers.

553
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:03,748
That's because you're
not going anywhere.

554
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:05,922
At least not till I say so.

555
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,442
Yeah. See, no one... Let
alone someone like you...

556
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,628
Is gonna keep me
here against my will.

557
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,698
I agree.

558
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,566
You know what?

559
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,138
Which is why your will

560
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,374
- needs to be taken.
- What is that?

561
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:24,808
Little dose of ketamine.

562
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:31,765
What the hell did you just do?

563
00:27:36,005 --> 00:27:38,138
What people like
you do to others.

564
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:39,956
I'm taking away your right

565
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,008
to be treated like
a human being.

566
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:47,164
Is this it?

567
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,332
That does it for the day.

568
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,566
Do you need anything else?

569
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,868
No. You're free to go.

570
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:20,830
I told you if anything
happened to Hades

571
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,316
you'd see me again.

572
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:26,653
That black doc... He
took him into surgery

573
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:28,121
against Hades' will.

574
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:30,039
If he dies

575
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,325
or he wakes up

576
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,411
as anything other than himself,

577
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,046
you and that doc

578
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,565
will pay dearly.

579
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,320
Dr. Cain.

580
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:49,809
<i>Dr. Cain.</i>

581
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:51,544
Don't worry, I've got consent.

582
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:54,047
- There's my AVM.
<i>- From what I understand,</i>

583
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,483
you<i> had</i> consent.
Put the scissors down.

584
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,034
Now it's time to cut out Hades.

585
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,950
Are you removing
the sclerotic tissue?

586
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,974
Think about what you're doing.

587
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,527
You're better than him.
You're better than this.

588
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,751
I'm better because
I can do this.

589
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:33,754
What are you doing?

590
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:41,144
Let me go.

591
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:44,242
Let me go.

592
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:45,916
Somebody! Help!

593
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,768
She's missing something crucial.

594
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:51,738
Go ahead and cut.

595
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,778
Here we go.

596
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:02,632
No. No! No!

597
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,844
Mina. Mina!

598
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,564

605
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,940
What?

606
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,408
Wh-What?

607
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:37,527
What?

608
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,911
Mina! Mina, are you okay?

609
00:31:58,534 --> 00:32:00,484
I do have a heart.

610
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,436
Of course you do.

611
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:42,693
Your actions not only
put Chastain in jeopardy,

612
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,828
you put my life at risk as well.

613
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,297
I did what I had to do.

614
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,227
And I live and breathe
for risks like this.

615
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:51,234
No one has to break the law.

616
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,981
And just to be clear,
that's what's happened.

617
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,816
Chastain's not going
down for what you did.

618
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,123
You're on your own.

619
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:58,691
Actually, I'm not.

620
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,573
Excuse me?

621
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:03,780
In case you hadn't
noticed, I can do...

622
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,281
whatever the hell I want.

623
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,635
I'm a cash cow for Red Rock,

624
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,721
which means when you
sold Chastain to them,

625
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:14,023
providing cover for me
became your number-one job.

626
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,360
So, if and when the time
comes for you to explain

627
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,962
what happened here
today, I have no doubt

628
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,898
that you will find
the right spin.

629
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:25,380
Because without me,
there is no Red Rock.

630
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,070
There's no Chastain.

631
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,622
Or you.

632
00:33:43,972 --> 00:33:45,955
All right.

633
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,124
How we doing?

634
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,109
Have you made a decision?

635
00:33:50,145 --> 00:33:53,112
Yes. Remy doesn't
want treatment.

636
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:54,975
We're leaving now.
We are who we are,

637
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,365
and you'll never understand it.

638
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:58,284
Remy, I know
that it is difficult,

639
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,298
but you have to
face the fact that

640
00:34:00,322 --> 00:34:01,766
vampirism will
cost you your life.

641
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,284
- We don't believe that.
- Actually, Bella,

642
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,291
I-I do believe it.

643
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:10,480
I've always known
I'm not a vampire.

644
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,782
Wait, what are you saying?

645
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,667
You've been lying all this time?

646
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:17,470
To-to make you
happy, to keep you.

647
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:19,522
Uh, fake fangs? No problem.

648
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,541
A night in a
coffin? No big deal.

649
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:24,844
I drank blood because I would
do anything to make you happy.

650
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,331
I know I'll never get
another woman like you.

651
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,166
I'm-I'm "swipe
left." I know that.

652
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:32,052
I can't believe it.

653
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,521
You're a liar.

654
00:34:34,556 --> 00:34:36,506
I-I know. I'm-I'm sorry.

655
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,157
I... I don't want to lose you,

656
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,987
but I have a life-threatening
condition now.

657
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,278
I have to stop being a vampire.

658
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:45,331
Many couples have different
belief systems and are happy.

659
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:46,899
No.

660
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:48,985
I could never be
with this man again.

661
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,231
Two people this
fundamentally different

662
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,604
cannot remain together.

663
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:53,823
No way.

664
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,848
I'm sorry, man.

665
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:08,755
Coming. Coming!

666
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:13,309
Hey. We got a medical emergency.

667
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:17,096
Sonya. Looks like they
need our help after all.

668
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,400
Who are you? What are you doing?

669
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:22,380
Get off of me!
Someone help, please!

670
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:24,754
What's wrong with her?

671
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:29,053
Based on the mixed
delirium, the blisters and ulcers

672
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:31,628
on her arm, Sonya
has necrotizing fasciitis.

673
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,307
- What the hell is that?
- It's a flesh-eating

674
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,248
disease caused by
the same bacteria

675
00:35:35,284 --> 00:35:36,616
that causes strep throat.

676
00:35:36,652 --> 00:35:39,135
We need to surgically
remove the infected tissue now.

677
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,100
Surgery? Just where do
you plan on doing that?

678
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:43,956
At a hospital. You
got one sitting there

679
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,353
- across the street.
- It's been closed for months.

680
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,771
Then we open it.

681
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:48,361
Nec fas spreads within hours,

682
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,140
leading to sepsis,
amputation and then death.

683
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:53,077
Look, you feel betrayed
by doctors, right?

684
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:55,385
Fine. We get it. But
you need to get over it

685
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,938
and trust us, or Sonya
here is going to die tonight.

686
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:03,360
We're with you.

687
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,461
All right, let's get moving.

688
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:16,139
So how'd you sleep?

689
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,157
- Blissfully.
- Like a baby.

690
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:20,126
Hmm. Some people,

691
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:22,495
when they come to this
town, have strange dreams.

692
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,182
Well, I have them, too.

693
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,501
I think it has to do with
Red Rock Mountain Medical.

694
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:32,171
When they left, they disposed
of all kinds of medications

695
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:34,107
by putting them down the drain.

696
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:36,125
Each year, the EPA finds

697
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,705
pharmaceutical-grade
chemicals in the groundwater.

698
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,139
The drugs could eventually

699
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,658
contaminate the
drinking water, too.

700
00:36:40,682 --> 00:36:42,092
Low doses of antibiotics

701
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,661
in the water supply
can make superbugs

702
00:36:43,685 --> 00:36:45,518
resistant to all antibiotics.

703
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,834
Which may be why penicillin
did nothing for Sonya.

to cause strange dreams.

Mina, are you sure
you slept okay?

707
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,527
We should focus on the work.

708
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:19,685
You sure this is necessary?

709
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:21,098
We hate the idea of
her going to Chastain.

710
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,139
I know, but Sonya
needs to be hospitalized.

711
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,874
I'll go back with her.

712
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,143
I'll make sure she gets
the best care, okay?

713
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,073
I don't know what we'd
have done without you.

714
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:30,780
Hey, all of you chipped in.

715
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,599
This is a hell of a town.

716

medical emergency...

718
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,520
Get your water checked.

719
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,505
And then you sue the
hell out of Red Rock

720
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,518
- when you get the results.
- You're suggesting

721
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,203

that employs you.

722

- Yeah.
