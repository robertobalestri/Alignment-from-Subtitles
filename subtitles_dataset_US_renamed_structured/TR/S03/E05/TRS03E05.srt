179
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,118
How you doing? I'm Dr. Cain.

180
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,434
Can you wiggle your fingers
and give me the okay sign?

181
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,707
- Perfect.
- I can't feel

182
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:20,603
- distal pulses. I need the Doppler.
- How about thumbs-up...

183
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,742
Can you do that?

184
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,297
Radial nerve injury.

185
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,525
- I need to get him to the OR.
- He needs

186
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,616
a pan-scan and
angios of his extremities

187
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,745
before he goes to the OR.

188
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,252
Ellen.

189
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,937
That's his wife.

190
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,389
Don't worry.

191
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:35,801
- We'll get her here.
- Dr. B.

192
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,276
Dr. B, you're
alive. I never pray,

193
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,028
- but when I saw the crash
on the news, I prayed hard.
- Okay.

194
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:44,065
- Thank you, Grayson.
- Are you all right?

195
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,118
- Yeah. I'm just a little stiff.
- We should get you checked out.

196
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,473
Or we can focus on the people
here who are actually hurt.

197
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,502
Ms. Mitchka.

198
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,870
Dr. Hawkins.

199
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,224
Where's my phone?

200
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,559
Oh, sorry. I know-I know
you don't allow these in here.

201
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:12,855
I saw the signs. I-I just...

202
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,829
I have to try to
reschedule a meeting

203
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,276
- in New York and get there ASAP.
- You've had a pretty rough day.

204
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,195
- I'll make an exception.
- Thanks.

205
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,618
Any past medical problems?

206
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,004
Oh, just strangers waking
me up in weird places,

207
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,674
like car washes, drive-throughs.

208
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,693
But a hospital's a new one.

209
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,028
I can fall asleep anywhere,
whether I want to or not.

210
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,425
Narcolepsy?

211
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:34,465
Since I was nine.

212
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,633
Sorry.

213
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,452
Sorry, I... This is
so rude, I know.

214
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,371
I just... I have to
e-mail my boss.

215
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,484
They don't give you the day
off after being in a plane crash?

216
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,209
I just... I can't
risk losing this job.

217
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,960
Most employers aren't so patient

218
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:47,323
about the whole
falling asleep thing.

219
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,679
What do you do?

220
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,698
I sell accounting software.

221
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:54,485
Yeah.

222
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,620
I don't love it,
but I get to travel.

223
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,606
And on, uh... on planes,

224
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:00,725
no one judges you
for falling asleep,

225
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,528
so... oh... that...
so that's a perk.

226
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,874
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

227
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,197
Oh.

228
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,066
Your blood pressure's high.

229
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,407
Says here you're on
three medications for it.

230
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,909
Sometimes I forget.

231
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:21,663
Honestly, it never
seems to help anyway.

232
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,965
- Are we done?
- High BP is a tricky one.

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,051
It's called the silent
killer for a reason.

234
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,719
You don't feel the damage
it's doing on a daily basis.

235
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,171
Okay.

236
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:32,673
So, before you go back to work,

237
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:35,009
I'd like to keep you
here, run some tests,

238
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:36,710
get your BP under control.

239
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,424
I'll have someone come
back and suture that up.

240
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,847
And I'll write your boss

241
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:41,883
the best doctor's
note you've ever seen.

242
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,038
How's the eye?

243
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,384
She'll be fine.

244
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,241
No foreign bodies.

245
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,193
Just a pterygium.

246
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:55,563
Pterygium. P-T-E-R-Y-G-I-U-M.

247
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,915
Nice.

248
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,511
Oh, come on. That was too easy.

249
00:11:58,535 --> 00:11:59,962
They were headed
to a spelling bee.

250
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,387
- Ah.
- And Rufus here

251
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:06,207
suffered quite the
scare, but his tachycardia

252
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:08,176
was resolved
with a bit of juice.

253
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:10,562
Tachycardia. T-A-K...

254
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:14,799
C-H, not K.

255
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,886
Tachys from the Greek
"tachys," meaning "quick, rapid."

256
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,637
Cardia from the
Latinized "kardia"

257
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,640
- meaning... "heart."
- Mm.

258
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,377
Dr. Hawkins won the
Chatham County Spelling Bee

259
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,490
when he was your
age. Loves to bring it up.

260
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,732
Ah, it's the biggest
bee in the Southeast.

261
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,151
I've never heard of it.

262
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,516
You're early.

263
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,971
I saw the news.

264
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,506
Time of death, 10:13.

265
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,059
You all right?

266
00:12:58,094 --> 00:12:59,906
That pilot I
treated last night...

267
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,362
He'd fly between New York
and Atlanta for the same airline.

268
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,551
I thought I'd convinced
him to get help.

269
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:11,005
You didn't report him?

270
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,893
You think he was
flying this plane?

271
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,164
I could've stopped him.

272
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,452
It's a great drug.

273
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:26,921
So much so, we made hemopleatin

274
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,506
the standard of care

275
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,369
for anemic patients
six months ago.

276
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,693
- Any adverse side effects?
- None.

277
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,106
- In fact, quite the opposite.
- Uh, six patients

278
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,796
recently died of a P.E.

279
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,360
Would you say that
hemopleatin patients

280
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,800
are more likely
to get blood clots?

281
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:41,630
My colleagues and I do
weekly case conferences.

282
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,115
If a drug were
killing our patients,

283
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,733
- we'd notice.
- How many patients

284
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,335
- are on it currently?
- Let's see.

285
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,809
Uh, some are on chemo.

286
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,811
Others have blood
disorders or on dialysis.

287
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:52,814
I'd say 200.

288
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:55,449
We'd like to see their records.

289
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:56,912
For that you need
to submit a request

290
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,514
to the Institutional
Review Board.

291
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,487
The IRB takes weeks.

292
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,801
Months, with Red Rock in charge.

293
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:03,502
Any way you can
help us get it faster?

294
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:05,421
Hospitals don't
like to share data.

295
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,461
Not even with their own staff.

296
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:10,215
Last year, I put in a request
to find out the infection rates

297
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,860
- in my department.
- And how long did it take

298
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,836
- for you to hear back?
- I'm still waiting.

299
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,541
I swear, I'm not
trying to be bossy.

300
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,710
I just want to help
you with your birth plan.

301
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:23,911
That's why I'm here.

302
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,408
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

303
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,731
Everyone, listen up.

304
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,349
You must be Adaku.

305
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:29,895
I hear you're quite
the world traveler.

306
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,386
- I prepped them.
- Of course you did.

307
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,421
This is from all of us.

308
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,445
This is incredible.

309
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,114
I'm gonna cry.

310
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,083
Does everyone
get this treatment?

311
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,867
You're not everyone.

312
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:49,420
- Just remember, I'm in charge.
- Of course.

313
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,705
And you have many
choices to make today.

314
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,958
Thank you.

315
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,943
Thanks, guys.

316
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,046
Okay, so where are we going now?

317
00:14:58,081 --> 00:15:00,559
- Okay, so this is where
you're gonna have the baby.
- Okay.

318
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:06,053
What did the fish say
when he swam into the wall?

319
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,357
Dam!

320
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:12,038
Help your old man out, son.

321
00:15:12,062 --> 00:15:13,778
Could have laughed just once.

322
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,446
I could, but it
would be fake, Dad.

323
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,449
But in my heart, I
would receive it as real.

324
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:22,737
Yee... look at him.

325
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:24,906
- Something is not right.
- I know.

326
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:27,208
My kung pao shrimp has
made grown men weep,

327
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:28,904
and he hasn't touched a bite.

328
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,212
All right, come
clean, son. Did you

329
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,581
get a girl pregnant?

330
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:37,918
I found my birth parents.

331
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:45,426
How? The records were closed.

332
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:48,662
They didn't tell us anything
about who they were.

333
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,009
- If we'd have known,
we would've told you.
- I know.

334
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,317
But they came looking for me.

335
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,319
At least, my
biological father did.

336
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,116
Dude just showed
up at the hospital.

337
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,741
Tell us everything.
What was he like?

338
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:00,952
No sense of humor, like you?

339
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:02,694
Well, he's stubborn.

340
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,529
He's melodramatic,
and he's opinionated.

341
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,365
So, no, he's nothing like me.

342
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,611
Hey. Any word on the pilot?

343
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,596
NTSB isn't releasing any names.

344
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:24,966
We don't know for sure your
patient crashed the plane.

345
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:27,185
Same airline, same route.

346
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,970
Too much of a coincidence.

347
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:30,338
Hey, you didn't crash the plane.

348
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,306
If he did cause
this, it's on him.

349
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:34,892
One man is dead. Maybe more.

350
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:38,980
Every doctor has a
patient in their past

351
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:41,899
they want to go back to
and treat in a different way.

352
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,952
Focus on the ones
who need you right now.

353
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:53,193
So I took him into surgery.

354
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,423
You operated on
your birth father?

355
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,413
I saved the dude's life.

356
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,081
Ah.

357
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,133
That must've really
impressed the man.

358
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:00,896
He must really want
to get to know you now.

359
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,470
Well, that's not gonna happen.

360
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:03,983
But what about
your birth mother?

361
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:05,973
I didn't meet her.

362
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:08,008
And I don't plan to.

363
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,981
Look, you are the only
parents that I know.

364
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:17,568
Everything that I am,
everything that I've accomplished,

365
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,586
I owe to both of you.

366
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,501
Ah.

367
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:36,036
Here we go.

368
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:42,025
"I cannot help you,
for I am just a cookie"?

369
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:46,464
Oh, th-this you laugh at.

370
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,633
It's true.

371
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:49,851
This is not even a fortune.

372
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:50,852
Well, take it up with the owner.

373
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,603
- Oh, I will.
- Mm.

374
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,107
You okay, Ma?

375
00:17:58,644 --> 00:17:59,977
I'm okay.

376
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,216
Grayson, do you believe in fate?

377
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,292
I do believe I was
born to do this job, sir.

378
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,889
Passengers at the
front of the plane

379
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,807
didn't fare so well
when it crashed.

380
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,593
Had I been seated in first class

381
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,172
instead of coach, I
might've been hurt.

382
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,829
It's because of your mistake

383
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,998
that I was able to
help people to safety.

384
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,334
People are saying
you're the Sully of Atlanta.

385
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:28,005
Now, we both got lucky.

386
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,073
Because if you ever
seat me in coach again,

387
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,425
you're fired.

388
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,993
This poor guy was seated
next to me. I've called his wife,

389
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,216
but she's not here yet.

390
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:42,614
Cervical spinal
damage and nerve injury.

391
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,856
Yeah. We got to
stop the bleeding first.

392
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,407
By stabilizing the bones?

393
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:48,976
Yeah, and removing the
spleen. The nerve repair can wait.

394
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,140
It can, if you want him to
lose all neurological function.

395
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,113
Look at these injuries.

396
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:55,260
- He's far too unstable to
fix everything. Well, yeah.

397
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:56,924
So we prioritize.

398
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,287
You good?

399
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:00,799
Yeah. You should start

400
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:02,757
on the nerves that
are most at risk,

401
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,593
and then I'll control the
hemorrhage from his spleen.

402
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,389
I'll stabilize the
pelvic fractures

403
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,162
and ex fix arms and legs.

404
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:10,775
Yeah. We'll just get
him back to the ICU

405
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,000
until he's stable
enough for another go.

406
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:15,169
Oh!

407
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,971
Randolph!

408
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,139
Are you all right?

409
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,142
No.

410
00:19:26,182 --> 00:19:28,165
♪ ♪

411
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,889
I think filling out
that IRB application

412
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,208
gave me carpal tunnel.

413
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,327
Red Rock hopes people tire out.

414
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:43,214
Well, it's in, so now we wait.

415
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,883
Patients are on
hemopleatin right now.

416
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:48,419
One click

417
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,555
is all it takes to cut
through the red tape.

418
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:55,843
If I break the glass,

419
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:57,155
we get immediate
access to the records

420
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,323
of any patient on the drug.

421
00:19:58,347 --> 00:19:59,930
Conrad, if you break the glass,

422
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,166
your name is recorded on
those charts permanently.

423
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,728
You could be fired for
accessing medical records

424
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,197
for patients that aren't yours.

425
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:07,572
If anyone notices.

426
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,423
Well, maybe they
don't now, but someday.

427
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,053
Do you really want
that hanging over you

428
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,577
the rest of your career?

429
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,429
And if we can't get the
answers any other way?

430
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:17,449
Then I'll break it.

431
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,387
- I won't let you.
- Well, I won't let you.

432
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,348
But we're not
there yet. Come on,

433
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:24,621
let's explore all of
our other options first.

434
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,840
All right.

435
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,041
Come on.

436
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:30,189
Yeah. I knew we'd
feel something.

437
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:31,733
- Here?
- No. No.

438
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,141
- What about here?
- Yeah. Yep. Felt it.

439
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,399
Left paralumbar
tenderness right there.

440
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,884
You're seeing what I'm seeing.

441
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,314
Yeah, I wish I wasn't.

442
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,223
- Care to share?
- You have a herniated disc.

443
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,943
A disc is bulging out from...

444
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,128
Yeah. No. I know
what a herniated disc is.

445
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,449
It may be pressuring
the L5 nerve root,

446
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:54,452
and causing nerve impingement
and radicular symptoms.

447
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,081
We can give you some
anti-inflammatories

448
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,332
to help get you through the day.

449
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,573
And something
stronger if you need it.

450
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,208
I think our next step is clear.

451
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:02,304
- You need physical therapy.
- I'll perform a discectomy.

452
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,144
Surgery? You're not serious.

453
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,779
With a discectomy and fusion,

454
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:07,492
you have a better
chance at a quick recovery.

455
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,916
And you can avoid nerve injury.

456
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,268
Head-to-head trials show
that spinal fusion surgery

457
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,065
has a success
rate of barely 35%.

458
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:15,840
Even successful
patients often end up

459
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,486
- on pain killers for years.
- Well, those stats

460
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,260
are national averages.

461
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:21,762
I'm above average. In fact,
my success rate is phenomenal.

462
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:23,230
That's an easy claim to make

463
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:25,149
when most hospitals
aren't required

464
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,934
to publish their
surgical outcomes.

465
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,246
Okay, well, talk to my patients.

466
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,647
You can find them
on golf courses,

467
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:31,282
running marathons,
not popping pills.

468
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:32,773
Surgery seems aggressive.

469
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:34,136
After all, the injury
was only today.

470
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,793
I have no perceptible nerve...

471
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,145
- perceptible nerve damage.
- Yeah, well, even without

472
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,147
the nerve damage,
PT takes a long time.

473
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:43,016
We're talking no
sailing, no golfing...

474
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,051
no sex.

475
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:47,554
Yeah, and how long?

476
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,225
What do you want
to do, Randolph?

477
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,211
<i>So...</i>

478
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,196
do you want music for the labor?

479
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,215
I want to start off
with some Lizzo.

480
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,229
- Mm-hmm.
- Talking Heads
for the big finish.

481
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,302
I like it.

482
00:22:01,337 --> 00:22:02,937
What about, um...

483
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:04,354
birthing positions?

484
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,440
We can have an exercise ball,

485
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:09,526
a sling or a birthing stool.

486
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,962
- Yes.
- Oh, we'll have all three
on the day.

487
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,176
- You're doing great so far.
- You know, there's, um...

488
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,816
there's another decision

489
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,868
I already gave a
lot of thought to.

490
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:20,821
Mina Okafor,

491
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:23,491
I want you to be my
baby's godmother.

492
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:25,692
- Godmother?
- I'm cancer-free now,

493
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:28,395
but we both know
that that could change.

494
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,632
If anything happens to me, I
want my baby to have a strong,

495
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,467
brilliant Nigerian woman

496
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:35,719
to show them the way.

497
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,983
Okay, how can I help?

498
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:50,018
Leave.

499
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,761
Your blood work shows your
kidneys are severely damaged.

500
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,698
And with your abnormal
EKG, we're seeing signs

501
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,199
of cardiac injury.

502
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:07,918
All from the crash?

503
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,903
Your kidney damage is from years

504
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:12,206
of untreated high
blood pressure,

505
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:13,540
but the stress of the crash

506
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:15,220
raised your blood
pressure even more,

507
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:16,677
and now...

508
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:19,563
you are at risk for
further organ damage.

509
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,865
It's a hypertensive
emergency, Susan.

510
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,101
We need to transfer
you to the ICU.

511
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,631
The ICU? For how long?

512
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,448
We'll know more
in a couple days.

513
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,940
But we need to get your
blood pressure under control.

514
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,059
No. I have to get back
to work. I have lived

515
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:33,989
with high blood pressure
my entire adult life.

516
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,863
- This is...
- This is much more complicated

517
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:37,565
than just high blood pressure.

518
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,583
We need to prevent
irreversible damage

519
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,601
to your organs.

520
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,622
So what?

521
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,825
I'm sleeping my
life away anyway.

522
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,626
And there is no cure.

523
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:52,213
You can't change that.

524
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:53,813
My life is what it is.

525
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,949
So... I might as well
at least make sure

526
00:23:55,984 --> 00:23:57,417
that I don't lose my job.

527
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,036
Excuse me.

528
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,422
Susan.

529
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:03,240
I don't think you understand.

530
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,309
If you leave, you could die.

531
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,099
Now do we understand each other?

532
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:19,156
Call security. We
can't let Susan Mitchka

533
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,274
in bay three leave.

534
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:21,608
What are you doing?

535
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:23,371
I'm putting Susan
on a medical hold.

536
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,345
I think she has
hypertensive encephalopathy,

537
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,342
and she lacks the
capacity to make decisions.

538
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,599
Hang on a minute.

539
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,011
She can make
decisions just fine.

540
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,735
She's not in the
right state of mind.

541
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,455
This isn't about her.

542
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,340
It's about the pilot.

543
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,492
This is not the same thing.

544
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:40,660
His drinking put
other people in danger.

545
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:42,712
- She needs treatment.
- Yes.

546
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:46,449
But the decision
only affects her.

547
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,668
She wants to leave
against medical advice,

548
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:51,222
it's her choice, not ours.

549
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,926
- Prepare her paperwork.
- Yes, Doctor.

550
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:02,465
I'm signing myself out
against medical advice.

551
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,585
This is all very dramatic.

552
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,156
After we get your BP
sorted out, we can try to get

553
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,325
- your narcolepsy under control.
- You don't get it.

554
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,709
I've seen every specialist.

555
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,211
I've tried every medicine.

556
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,829
Nothing works for me.

557
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:18,849
So save your effort for
someone you can actually help.

558
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,208
You seeing what I'm seeing?

559
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:29,909
You don't think it could be?

560
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,039
Only one way to find out.

561
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,429
Hey, Susan.

562
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,492
Anyone ever tell you
you walk kind of funny?

563
00:25:34,516 --> 00:25:36,694
Insult patients who leave.
What kind of hospital is this?

564
00:25:36,718 --> 00:25:38,235
Your CT was normal,

565
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,948
but I think all your
doctors missed something.

566
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,556
I'd like to do an MRI of
your brain before you go.

567
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:45,008
- You're kidding.
- Hey, I get it.

568
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,027
You don't think things
will ever change.

569
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,213
You've spent your whole
life just trying to get by.

570
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,783
I can't.

571
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:54,918
I can't hope anymore.

572
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:58,104
I am fresh out.

573
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,707
We're not.

574
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,911
I think we can help you,
but you got to trust us.

575
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:12,769
- We just need two minutes.
- I don't have two seconds.

576
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,805
We've got a female patient, 30s,

577
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,873
diagnosed with
narcolepsy as a teenager.

578
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,803
Hypertensive emergency
we thought was due

579
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,612
to med-noncompliance
and the crash.

580
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:25,199
She has a wide, staggering
gait indicative of cerebellar ataxia.

581
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,878
Because she doesn't
actually have narcolepsy.

582
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:29,948
- She was misdiagnosed.
- What she really has
is central sleep apnea,

583
00:26:29,972 --> 00:26:32,606
caused by a Chiari malformation.

584
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:34,258
She needs you to operate.

585
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,809
I'm booked five weeks out.

586
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,861
She's got gold-plated insurance.

587
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,916
Okay, I get it.

588
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:45,052
So you guys think I'm
some Red Rock tool

589
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:47,104
who only cares about the money.

590
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,101
I could have gone
to any hospital

591
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,775
in the country, gentlemen.

592
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,077
I chose Chastain because
I saw the opportunity

593
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,995
to help as many
people as possible,

594
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,298
with a staff who
would support me,

595
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,918
or at least stay out of my way.

596
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,620
Coming at me like
this is not how it's done.

597
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,138
Your patient needs my help,

598
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:07,524
I will operate on
her because I care,

599
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,542
not because she can pay.

600
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,482
Maybe we misjudged him.

601
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,908
Check her insurance.

602
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:28,511
I'm a surgical resident,

603
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,781
which means I work
80 hours a week,

604
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,866
but it's more like 120 with
all the studying and prep.

605
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,616
I arrive by 4:30 a.m.,
leave no earlier than 7:00.

606
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,690
I'm on call every three days.

607
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:42,225
Work Saturday or Sunday or both.

608
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,961
And I have two more
years left of residency,

609
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,313
followed by at least another
few years of fellowship,

610
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,850
during which my schedule
will only get worse.

611
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,518
- Uh...
- Do you know what the salary

612
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:52,970
for a surgical resident is?

613
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,571
- Ah, there's more.
- Yes.

614
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,289
$55,000 a year.

615
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:59,293
Even if I had time, I
can't afford childcare.

616
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:00,877
Is that all?

617
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,747
And I only like children
that belong to other people.

618
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,811
Okay, so...

619
00:28:05,835 --> 00:28:07,333
what you're saying is, you...

620
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:09,386
don't want to be my
baby's godmother.

621
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:11,922
I'm saying I'm the wrong choice.

622
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,585
I will hold your
hand at ultrasounds,

623
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,009
shop for baby clothes, be
with you every step of the way.

624
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:19,312
- Unless I die.
- I will do everything in
my power to make sure you don't.

625
00:28:19,348 --> 00:28:20,714
Got it.

626
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:23,750
So I have four
choices for pain relief,

627
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,485
two for fetal monitoring.

628
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,833
I can choose between
membrane stripping

629
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:31,274
or Pitocin or
artificial rupture.

630
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,060
But who will take care
of my baby if I'm gone?

631
00:28:34,095 --> 00:28:36,580
That choice I do
not get to make.

632
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,248
I'll help you find someone else.

633
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:41,902
Adaku, I don't understand
why this is so upsetting to you.

634
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:44,388
Because it's the only thing
that we've talked about today

635
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,206
that actually matters to me.

636
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,799
Pelvic fixation complete.

637
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,435
- Rongeur.
- Rongeur.

638
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,236
I'll be quick.

639
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,882
I can insert the
pins while I wait.

640
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:01,906
Drill.

641
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,201
Watch your alignment, Dr. Voss,

642
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:15,881
or your radial shaft
will be gapped.

643
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:17,603
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

644
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:20,657
Bleeding controlled.

645
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,721
Applying the abdominal vacuum

646
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:24,778
so I can get him
back up to the ICU.

647
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,997
I'm right behind you.

648
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,395
Starting the graft now.

649
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:32,886
Oh? Already?

650
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:34,916
- Got someplace to be?
- Speed and performance

651
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,474
can go hand in hand.

652
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,509
What do you drive?

653
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,511
Jerry is a person, not a car.

654
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:41,823
If I didn't move this fast,

655
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:42,796
this person would lose

656
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:44,130
all nerve function in his arm.

657
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,400
Jerry can't move his
arms if he has no arms.

658
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:47,684
Get height restoration

659
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,253
and page me if
there's any surprises.

660
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,772
Wait, you're not leaving

661
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,807
this man's nerve
function to a third-year.

662
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,170
Of course. Hanna's
extraordinary.

663
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:57,861
She may be, but that's
not how we do things here.

664
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,697
Now, get back there
and do your job.

665
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,603
Uh... his pelvis is
filling with blood.

666
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,300
I thought we were about
to close. No, the packing

667
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:10,969
must have stretched the
vessels. I also repaired

668
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:12,437
- a partial tear up here earlier.
- Corona mortis.

669
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:14,795
- It's the crown of death.
- Bleeding from the connection

670
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,147
between the obturator
and iliac arteries.

671
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:18,994
- It's usually
fatal. Bovie. Lap.

672
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:21,898
- Retractors to me. We need to control this now.
- Lap suction.

673
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,239
Lap. Lap.

674
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:35,348
- You must be Jerry's wife.
- Yes.

675
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,033
I'm Dr. Bell.

676
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,836
During the surgery, your
husband had significant bleeding.

677
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,721
Our surgeons managed to stop it,

678
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,890
but his blood pressure
dropped for a long time.

679
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,137
- Is he okay?
- Well, he's being moved
to the ICU now.

680
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:47,327
He's alive.

681
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:48,728
But, uh...

682
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,081
we just don't know if
he's gonna wake up.

683
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,350
What?

684
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,669
You know, actually, I was...

685
00:30:56,705 --> 00:30:59,422
I was sitting beside your
husband on the flight.

686
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,843
He wouldn't stop
talking about you.

687
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:09,032
I hit "ignore."

688
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:11,517
He called me.

689
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,721
I was at the store
and I hit "ignore."

690
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:17,356
Because once Jerry gets going...

691
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:21,611
I hit "ignore."

692
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,216
Well, I'll let you know as
soon as you can see him.

693
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:29,119
Thank you.

694
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,276
- Hey.
- Hi.

695
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,596
How long before
your next surgery?

696
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,075
- About 20 minutes.
- Oh, good.

697
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,883
Come, please sit with me.

698
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:48,521
What's up?

699
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:51,407
You know, your dad
always wanted to adopt a kid.

700
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,644
I took a little more convincing.

701
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,311
I was scared.

702
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,763
That's funny, I...

703
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:58,598
You?

704
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:01,534
I can't imagine you
being scared of anything.

705
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,804
Yeah. I was worried that
we wouldn't be enough,

706
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,422
that we were being selfish.

707
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:10,576
Taking a child who might
be better off with people

708
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:12,796
who would give them
everything they needed.

709
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:16,800
Okay, something tells me
you didn't drive from Buckhead

710
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,820
- to tell me that.
- I came here to tell you
that I don't think

711
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,305
you're being honest
with us or yourself.

712
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:25,070
- Come on, Ma.
- No, you come on, AJ.

713
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:27,243
You are my son, and I know you.

714
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,312
And I also know that one day,

715
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,682
you will want to meet
your biological mother.

716
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:34,150
That woman is a stranger
who threw me away.

717
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,119
I do not want to meet her.

718
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,656
Because you're scared.

719
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:41,741
That she won't
be enough for you,

720
00:32:41,776 --> 00:32:43,910
or that you won't
be enough for her.

721
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:46,896
And you're also scared
that she might hurt you again.

722
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,966
Listen.

723
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,869
You won't know what you'll find

724
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:55,121
when you walk
through their door,

725
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:57,974
but you will know
exactly what you'll find

726
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,843
when you walk back through ours.

727
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,863
No matter what, we will
always be here for you.

728
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,882
So when you're ready...

729
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:09,386
you go see her, my son.

730
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,741
But I got a few ground rules.

731
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,513
Birthdays and holidays are mine.

732
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:23,716
You got it.

733
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:27,037
And every other day in between.

734
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,042
You got it.

735
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:44,187
How did it go with the parents?

736
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,068
Better than I could
have imagined.

737
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:50,210
You know, my mother
actually encouraged me

738
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:51,895
to meet my biological mother.

739
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:53,913
Will you?

740
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,932
I don't know.

741
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,868
But now I know I can.

742
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:01,520
They're great people.

743
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:04,324
Mina, they are amazing people.

744
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:06,926
Even when they don't know
what they're saying yes to,

745
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,113
they still put me
first, even if it hurts.

746
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,282
That's family.

747
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:17,153
The ones who sacrifice
for you out of love.

748
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,951
Who make the
difficult decisions.

749
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,259
Even if they have every
reason to run away.

750
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,596
I hope I can be the
kind of parent they are.

751
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,290
How'd it go with Adaku?

752
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,544
It didn't.

753
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,580
And now I think I
understand why.

754
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,889
How's Susan?

755
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,876
Dr. Cain is retrieving
the patch now.

756
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:57,259
She should be okay.

757
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:02,498
And what about you?

758
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,585
- Long day.
- Ah.

759
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,888
Every doctor has them.

760
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:09,989
And we go home,

761
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,025
we learn from our mistakes.

762
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:15,661
The thing is... I
didn't make one.

763
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:19,410
I was right not to
report that pilot.

764
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:21,451
Wrong.

765
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,502
Drunk pilots
should not be flying.

766
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,055
Period.

767
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,310
62 injured.

768
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,195
14 critical.

769
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,180
Do I feel bad about
what happened?

770
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:35,865
Of course I do.

771
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,200
But patients need to know
that when they come to us,

772
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,197
we will keep their
medical information private,

773
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,038
good or bad.

774
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,540
Once we lose that trust,

775
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,625
we can't help anyone,
and people will die.

776
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,271
People did die
because of your choice.

777
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:49,513
- How do you not see that?
- I took an oath.

778
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,476
I get that you would have
made a different choice.

779
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,945
- The right one.
- For you.

780
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:56,469
But I don't want to be
the kind of doctor you are.

781
00:35:57,505 --> 00:35:59,188
Well...

782
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,490
clearly, I've been
wasting your time.

783
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:13,820
- Hi.
- Hi.

784
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,655
Uh... what happened?

785
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,158
- They fixed you.
- Well, not yet.

786
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,854
In a few days, we'll
complete your reconstruction,

787
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,878
but we will get you there.

788
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,715
I've never seen
a hospital like this.

789
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,800
Where exactly are we?

790
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,636
Welcome to First Class.

791
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:31,137
Oh.

792
00:36:31,173 --> 00:36:33,823
How long can we stay?

793
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,559
Oh.

794
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:38,990
You really need to deal
with that back, Dr. Bell.

795
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:41,731
I threw my back out
pole dancing last year,

796
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:44,033
and it was no fun.

797
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,319
- Mm.
- For you.

798
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:52,208
Hey.

799
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,172
How do you feel?

800
00:36:54,196 --> 00:36:56,947
Awake.

801
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:59,031
- Oh.
- Well, let's have a look.

802
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:04,103
Dr. Cain enlarged the covering
over the back of your brain.

803
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,017
This will relieve the pressure

804
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,024
that was causing
your sleep apnea.

805
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,627
- Just like that, huh?
- Just like that.

806
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,879
Just like that.

807
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:15,014
And the surgery cured
your blood pressure.

808
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,101
This means I don't have
to work in sales anymore.

809
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,119
I've never quit a job before.

810
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:24,441
But it's up to you now.

811
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,578
You got choices.

812
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,283
Choices.

813
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:36,619
Oh, I like the sound of that.

814
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:39,606
Thank you.

815
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,223
So dramatic, Randolph.

816
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:59,893
This is me taking your advice.

817
00:37:59,928 --> 00:38:01,394
Yeah, it's a good look on you.

818
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,840
Well, if it doesn't
work in a few weeks...

819
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,743
You won't need surgery if you
do your exercises every day.

820
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,817
Don't be one of those
patients who forgets.

821
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,130
Yeah, well, I have a feel...

822
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:10,248
feeling you'll remind me.

823
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:11,821
Just doing my job.

824
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:15,586
Is this a job you've
decided to stay in?

825
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,977
'Cause you set up
meetings with other hospitals.

826
00:38:18,013 --> 00:38:19,446
I did.

827
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:22,698
But I care about the
people here too much.

828
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:26,169
And I'm not giving
up on any of you.

829
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,588
Oh.

830
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:31,441
Work him hard.

831
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,626
Oh.

832
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,705
So I guess you're
the Bell whisperer.

833
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,974
Hardly.

834
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,609
I don't think anyone's quite
figured out that man yet.

835
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:52,239
You talked an
educated doctor out

836
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,564
of a proven
medical intervention.

837
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,900
Well, if Bell's mastered one
thing, it's self-preservation.

838
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,986
Yes, and he also
plays well with others,

839
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:02,388
which is more than
I can say for you.

840
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:06,525
Don't ever speak to me
that way in the OR again.

841
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:08,728
I should say the same to you.

842
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,663
I can say whatever I want.

843
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:12,526
That's the difference
between a surgeon

844
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,094
who bills $80
million a year like me,

845
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:17,770
and one that bills... two.

846
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:37,373
It's a good one.

847
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:40,492
I'm reading the
chapter on episiotomies.

848
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:42,244
Yikes.

849
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:47,678
I threw this whole godmother
thing at you fast, huh?

850
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:50,202
I understand if you're
not comfortable with it.

851
00:39:51,406 --> 00:39:52,756
I thought about it.

852
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:56,259
And?

853
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:59,796
It's been... a long time

854
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:03,049
since someone asked
me to sacrifice for family.

855
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,019
I don't really have any left.

856
00:40:06,054 --> 00:40:07,720
We've both lost so much.

857
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,891
But you became my
family a long time ago.

858
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:15,127
And if my sister has a child,

859
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,914
then that child
becomes my family, too.

860
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,750
No matter what.

861
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:23,436
Are you saying you'll
be my baby's godmother?

862
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,886
<i>You said yes?</i>

863
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,309
I didn't have a choice.

864
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,089
Women who've had triple
negative breast cancer

865
00:40:32,113 --> 00:40:34,964
have the highest recurrence
rates in the first three years.

866
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,834
Not to mention the risk of
developing ovarian cancer.

867
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,302
All right, so, what's your plan

868
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:41,688
if Adaku's baby becomes
your responsibility?

869
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,774
I don't have one.

870
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,628
Good night, guys.

871
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,481
Good night.

872
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:53,961
Busy day?

873
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,001
Yeah.

874
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:59,706
Yeah, um...

875
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,861
I thought about going
to AA like you said,

876
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,757
but I ended up
back at the hotel.

877
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:09,749
There's a bar.

878
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:12,618
And it was late, so,
when I got to the airport

879
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,620
the next day, I was...

880
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:16,672
I was still pretty buzzed.

881
00:41:20,295 --> 00:41:22,345
<i>I was about to board</i>

882
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,330
<i>when I heard the noise.</i>

883
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,739
<i>This crash wasn't my fault.</i>

884
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,859
But the next one...

885
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,062
it could be.

886
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:42,047
I need help.

887
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:46,069
I lost the pamphlet.

888
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,670
We got hundreds. Come on.

889
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,877
Spoke to Andrews.

890
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:56,963
No more P.E. deaths today.

891
00:41:56,998 --> 00:41:59,015
Great.

892
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,833
What about tomorrow?

893
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:04,537
Making sure a drug is
safe shouldn't be this hard.

894
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:08,424
If it is harming patients,
it's only gonna get harder.

895
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:11,394
Red Rock, the
pharmaceutical company...

896
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,595
You ready to take these guys on?

897
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:20,202
I keep thinking, what
would Jessie want me to do?

898
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,155
♪ <i>Overdrive...</i> ♪

899
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:25,541
She made a lot of
bad choices, but...

900
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,226
she was fearless.

901
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:30,579
She always wanted the truth.

902
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,667
We don't stop until we get it.

903
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,256
My shift ends in a few hours.

904
00:42:42,377 --> 00:42:43,776
See you at home?

905
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,828
I like the sound of that.
