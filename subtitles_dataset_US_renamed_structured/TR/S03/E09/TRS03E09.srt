<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

2
00:00:03,554 --> 00:00:04,814
What you're talking
about is torture.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,082
All I'm talking about
is this man, who will die

4
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:08,990
unless Rob Spiro tells
us where he's being held.

5
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:10,736
- I want no part of it.
- It has to be done.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,154
There's a way we can keep an eye

7
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,890
on each other's
surgical practices.

8
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:17,716
An Ortho-Spine Surgery Center

Logan Kim. Exec VP of Red Rock.

10
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,815
I'll be overseeing the
day-to-day operations

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,650
- of the hospital now.
- I took an oath.

12
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:25,351
I get that you would've
made a different choice.

13
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,586
- The right one.
- For you.

14
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,044
But I don't want to be
the kind of doctor you are.

15
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:31,391
Hawkins is a whistle-blower.
He's a threat to the hospital.

16
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:32,914
I'll handle it.

17
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,329
Last night I took my date

18
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:38,081
to that new five-star
place on Peachtree.

19
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,382
You went to Manny's?

20
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,766
Oh, I hear it's so good.

21
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,841
Well, it was... until my ex

22
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,088
- and her girlfriends
got seated next to us.
- No.

23
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,528
Those ladies had words for me.

24
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,726
Rongeur.

25
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,883
- BP is dropping.
- I'm almost done.

26
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,253
Just give her
another liter of LR.

27
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,521
She's moving. I'm
gonna bolus the propofol.

28
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,617
No, that'll drop her pressures.

29
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,561
Just hang on, I'm
almost finished.

30
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,222
- Damn. Tube's out.
- Uh, reintubate.

31
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:04,713
There's no time. I'll bag her.

32
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:07,527
- Her pressure is falling fast.
She's gonna code, what do we do?

33
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:08,551
Uh...

34
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:14,918
<i>- 911, what is your emergency?</i>
- My patient.

35
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,759
We need to get her
to a hospital right now.

36
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:19,811
♪ ♪

37
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:33,641
What the hell happened?

38
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,293
A 53-year-old female.

39
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,896
Lost her airway midway
through operation

40
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,843
in an outpatient
spine surgery center.

41
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,310
- Did they send operative notes?
- Yes.

42
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,634
Her name is Lynette Hughes.

43
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,264
She went in for
a spinal fracture.

44
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:45,454
That's minor.

45
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,272
Let's take a peek.

46
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,291
Okay. One, two, three.

47
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,178
There we go.

48
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,929
Okay, very gently now...

49
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:57,882
One, two, three.

50
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,331
Bloody hell.

51
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,317
Whatever they started
to fix, they didn't finish.

52
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:06,169
All right, start her on
IV vanc and cefepime.

53
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,993
Let's get her to CT now.

54
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,779
And my client will stay outside

55
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:12,642
until you can
assure they will have

56
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,200
absolute privacy and security.

57
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,980
I can't clear half the
ER for one patient.

58
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,031
- No matter who they are.
- Everything all right?

59
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,090
No. I need to speak to
his supervisor immediately.

60
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:24,042
- That'd be me.
- And Dr. Feldman

61
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,845
will tell you the same
thing that I told you.

62
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,163
What he said.

63
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,349
Phoenix on the move.

64
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,567
But... who's the patient?

65
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:42,126
Can you direct me to "Phoenix"?

66
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,462
ER bay four.

67
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,998
I'm on my way, too.

68
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,949
They called you?

69
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:50,463
I am the admitting
resident. Yes.

70
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:51,965
Any idea who the patient is?

71
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,850
No. Sounds like
they're a big deal.

72
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,857
Not to me. I've been operating

73
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,470
on big shots since
I was a resident.

74
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:59,775
Athletes, celebs, heads
of state... it's all the same.

75
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:06,668
Gentlemen, allow
me to introduce you

76
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:09,054
to Princess Nadine.

77
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,473
Your Highness.

78
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:13,225
Just Nadine's fine.

79
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,094
My mom's Pakistani but she
married a king while abroad.

80
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,007
Pretty sure they sent me to
the States when I was a kid

81
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,364
so they could have "alone time."

82
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,517
Nadine fainted while
jogging a few hours ago.

83
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,497
No past medical history.

84
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,022
I forgot my water bottle.
Probably just dehydrated.

85
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,591
But Amir's my head of security

86
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,909
and he said we had to come in.

87
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,556
Her head has been
hurting for weeks.

88
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,746
It comes and goes.

89
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,006
- You speak Urdu?
- Some.

90
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:46,635
Yeah, there's
overlap with Hindi.

91
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,960
Anything you tell us would help.

92
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,456
Yeah, we'll keep
it confidential.

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,433
Well, I was running
through Piedmont Park,

94
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,769
and then... I don't
know, it was like...

95
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:01,639
the ground beneath
my feet just disappeared.

96
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,957
<i>She's lost
sensation in her feet.</i>

97
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,099
And she's had recent
headaches, dizziness, fevers.

98
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:12,963
- More than just dehydration.
- No question.

99
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:14,047
My money's on a stroke or bleed.

100
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:15,369
Eh, it could be cardiogenic.

101
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:16,487
Or vascular.

102
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,123
Get a noncontrast head CT stat.

103
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,803
- I'll ultrasound her carotids.
- We should also do

104
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,137
a spinal tap...
Rule out meningitis

105
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,305
and encephalitis.

106
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,209
Page me when
the results come in.

107
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:27,782
Let's get her settled
in one of our VIP suites.

108
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:31,119
Thank you. And the princess
has requested that Dr. Pravesh stay

109
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:33,388
on her medical team
while she's at Chastain.

110
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:34,673
Thank you.

111
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,725
We good?

112
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:40,111
You tell me.

113
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,825
You've already established
a connection with the patient.

114
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,009
I think you should stay on.

115
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:47,781
<i>Incredible.</i>

116
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,254
We can see her perfectly.

117
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,689
And... she looks just like you.

118
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,088
Is she sucking her thumb?

119
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,488
Yes.

120
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:57,757
Movement is a very good sign.

121
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:02,033
Mm. Your last
trimester has begun.

122
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,454
Soon that little blob will
be crying in your arms.

123
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,340
Have you decided on a name?

124
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,525
Not yet.

125
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,627
For now, let's just
call her Michelle.

126
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:15,297
- Obama?
- You know it.

127
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,434
Oh, all right.

128
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,297
Let's have you sit up.

129
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,440
Lost my breath
there for a second.

130
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:27,003
That's common
during pregnancies.

131
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,404
Why don't I give a
listen to your heart

132
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,572
and lungs while you're here?

133
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,895
Have you felt like this before?

134
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,798
Sometimes when I'm lying down,

135
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,066
my chest gets a little tight.

136
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:41,572
I did hear some atypical sounds.

137
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,886
It's probably
nothing, but I'd like

138
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,387
to order some more
tests just to be safe.

139
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,727
We'll order a few
labs, get a chest X-ray,

140
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,331
and an echo to make sure you
and your little queen are okay.

141
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,301
She does look like
me, doesn't she?

142
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:55,837
Yeah.

143
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:02,194
We suggest branding this
product by branding you.

144
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:06,431
That face says strength,
confidence, compassion.

145
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,732
Which one's your favorite?

146
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,235
It's a tough
choice. I like 'em all.

147
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,739
We think the third one
shows more... authority.

148
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,940
- In the eyes.
- Exactly.

149
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,909
Am I interrupting?

150
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,611
Yes.

151
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:23,098
I've been looking for a
new post-workout shake.

152
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,500
This one come in mocha?

153
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:26,679
Uh, we want you and the product

154
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:28,598
to be camera ready
for the press ASAP.

155
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,922
Yeah, okay, I'll-I'll get
back to you guys later.

156
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,717
That was... That was good.

157
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,761
Thanks, that looks great.

158
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,766
Why are you here?

159
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,084
For the meeting.

160
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,386
For... what meeting?

161
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,087
This one.

162
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,089
Dr. Bell, we have a problem.

163
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,084
A former patient
is suing Chastain.

164
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,579
Hospitals get sued all the time.

165
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,913
That's why we have lawyers.

166
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,127
This is different. The
patient has named

167
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,800
Dr. Hawkins in the suit.

168
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,654
And he just walked in our door.

169
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,972
<i>Rob Spiro was
admitted one month ago</i>

170
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,329
<i>after he was injured
during a failed robbery.</i>

171
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,631
And we saved his life.

172
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,999
That's not what he says.

173
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,395
I can't believe
they let him out.

174
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,804
Once the depositions are over,

175
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,306
he goes back to
prison to await trial.

176
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:24,008
It's just for the day.

177
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,340
<i>Spiro claims that
after his surgery,</i>

178
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,492
Hawkins withheld
pain medication.

179
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,000
He tortured Spiro
to extract the location

180
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,435
of a man he abducted.

181
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,764
And you believe
that kind of criminal

182
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,832
over our top resident?

183
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,533
- A judge might.
- Judges...

184
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,859
almost always side with the
doctors in malpractice suits.

185
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,922
And that's if the
patient isn't a murderer.

186
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:45,296
I can assure you, this suit

187
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,642
is not gonna cost
Chastain a dime.

188
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,661
Any judge would
throw it out in a second.

189
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:51,035
We've worked too hard to
improve Chastain's image

190
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,370
to let anything threaten it.

191
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,756
Any association with Spiro

192
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,591
is bad for this hospital.

193
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:58,170
You'll be in the
deposition, naturally,

194
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:59,628
and I'll be joining you today.

195
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,463
Well, be my guest.

196
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,448
Bell has no idea this gives us

197
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:10,032
the perfect way to
get rid of Hawkins.

198
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,940
Spiro's out for blood.

199
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:14,159
And we're gonna give it to him.

200
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,673
♪ ♪

201
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:32,893
Hawkins...

202
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,513
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

203
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,176
Red Rock's lawyers
will be here soon.

204
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,095
You haven't always
been on my side.

205
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,502
I am this time.

206
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,222
Gentlemen, we're
ready for you now.

207
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,907
- Where's Levin and Sutton?
- Levin is sick.

208
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,397
Sutton was unavailable.

209
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,593
We're familiar with the case.

210
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,750
Shoot, I forgot my pen.

211
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,779
Dr. Hawkins, Mr. Spiro
was in a lot of pain

212
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,508
when he came out of
surgery, is that correct?

213
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,833
Yes, that's normal
for a major operation.

214
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:14,296
According to his
electronic medical record,

215
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,239
Mr. Spiro's morphine
was stopped at 8:32 p.m.

216
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:19,719
Yeah, it's typical for
morphine to be withdrawn

217
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:21,804
if it's depressing a
patient's respiratory drive.

218
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,139
That's not the case here.

219
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,707
You stopped the
morphine to coerce

220
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,464
a confession out of my client.

221
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:30,635
Gonna perjure
yourself, you little bitch?

222
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,604
What did you tell them?

223
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,590
I said Mr. Spiro was lying.

224
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,665
That I provided him
the standard of care.

225
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,594
Is that true?

226
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,147
The less I tell you the better.

227
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,901
He confessed the
location of a hostage.

228
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,552
If you hadn't done what you did,

229
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,717
another one of Rob's
victims would be dead.

230
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:53,274
But if they find out,

231
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:55,071
you'll never practice
at Chastain again.

232
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,244
Or anywhere else.

233
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,314
Does anyone else know?

234
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,168
Conrad, who else knows?

235
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,808
Just Devon.

236
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,120
Nadine, once the
lidocaine takes effect,

237
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,194
you shouldn't
feel a thing. Okay?

238
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:21,235
Amir. Give the man some space.

239
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,327
How are we doing?

240
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,111
Prepping the lumbar puncture.

241
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,181
So, just a few more questions.

242
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,343
There's a chance your
symptoms may be caused

243
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,428
by an infectious disease.

244
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,802
Any travel outside
the U.S. recently?

245
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,531
- A trip back to the Middle East?
- No travel.

246
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,806
I haven't been back
home since I was six.

247
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,809
I spend most of my time in a
campus practice room anyway.

248
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,456
- You're a college student?
- At Emory, yeah.

249
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,812
I'm a music major.

250
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,182
Mom and Dad
insisted I go to college,

251
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,661
even though what
I really wanna do

252
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,619
is be a professional deejay.

253
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,787
Sweet.

254
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,989
- Do you make your own mixes?
- Yeah.

255
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,976
I love taking old
songs, classics,

256
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,011
adding new beats, loops, hooks.

257
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,047
Totally reinventing them.

258
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,181
Making them my own.

259
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,294
Okay, Nadine.

260
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:10,017
All set. You ready?

261
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,836
As I'll ever be.

262
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,337
All right.

263
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,993
Hmm. You see that?

264
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,327
Your heart is enlarged.

265
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:23,147
It's not pumping as
vigorously as we would expect.

266
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,166
You have a condition called
dilated cardiomyopathy.

267
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,064
It explains the
shortness of breath.

268
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,498
Most likely brought
on by the chemo

269
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,071
that treated your breast cancer.

270
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,640
But my baby's okay?

271
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:34,342
Yeah.

272
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,644
But pregnancy is
hard on the heart.

273
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,913
The longer you're
pregnant, the greater the risk

274
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,776
that you develop
congestive heart failure.

275
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,383
There is another option.

276
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:44,035
Induce an early delivery.

277
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,388
My baby's only 28 weeks.
How early are we talking?

278
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:49,901
Ideally, we would want to wait
as long as possible to induce.

279
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:52,693
The sooner we do it,
the more risk to the baby.

280
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,245
What kind of risk?

281
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,758
Like underdeveloped
lungs with increased risk

282
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,267
of respiratory distress and
some serious infections.

283
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:06,257
So what's best for my
baby could harm me,

284
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,859
and what's best for me could...

285
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,461
It's not an easy choice.

286
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,913
The health of my
baby comes first.

287
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,266
I'm carrying her to term.

288
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,617
We've got a problem.

289
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,586
I'm not getting a signal
from the right L5 nerve root.

290
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,371
Must be a screw
abutting the nerve.

291
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:26,610
Retractors?

292
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:31,933
Whoever started putting in
this hardware blew out pedicles

293
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:34,785
and left her with a
spinal pseudarthrosis.

294
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,583
I see the screw, right
there, but it's deep.

295
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,268
Poor woman should never

296
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:42,076
have been operated on
at a spine surgery center.

297
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,823
They thought she only
had a spinal fracture,

298
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,775
but once they opened
her up, they found

299
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,665
spinopelvic disassociation.

300
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,450
Got it.

301
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,314
Those centers aren't
prepared for things to go wrong.

302
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,165
And when they do,
patients can be hours

303
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,017
from a hospital
and die as a result.

304
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,102
She's one of the lucky ones.

305
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,594
- Nerve signal is back.
- Okay.

306
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,946
Great. We can start to repair

307
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,599
and fix the spine to the pelvis.

308
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:07,268
It was awful.

309
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:10,605
My own doctor,
trying to hurt me.

310
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,919
I swear to God, I...

311
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:15,326
I've never felt pain like that.

312
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:20,247
Thank you,
Mr. Spiro. That's all.

313
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:22,533
Don't you have
any more questions?

314
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,618
We're good.

315
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,203
All right. I'll begin
deposing staff.

316
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,258
What the hell was that?

317
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:33,778
I thought it went well.

318
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,763
Those Red Rock lawyers

319
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,765
are barely a day
out of law school.

320
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,661
They didn't ask one
substantive question.

321
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,869
Conrad deserves
an actual defense.

322
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,381
I'm bringing in
our old legal team,

323
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,889
wherever the hell they are.

324
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,693
No, you're not.

325
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,735
You want Conrad to go down.

326
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,465
Every year,
whistle-blowers like Hawkins

327
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,122
cost hospitals millions.

328
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:04,637
He discovered that a
drug was killing patients.

329
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:06,861
And good for him, but
what about next time?

330
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:09,797
He won't hesitate to
take sides against us.

331
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:11,476
He is our number
one diagnostician.

332
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,312
He's about to
become chief resident.

333
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,720
Long-term, I guarantee a
whistle-blower is a liability.

334
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,433
Well, then, why
not just fire him?

335
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,151
Why go through all that?

336
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:21,487
We both know his
father's a powerful man.

337
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,494
Former chairman of the board.

338
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,078
I want Hawkins gone,

339
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,415
but we can't get rid of
him without good cause.

340
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,161
I want it done clean
without any blowback

341
00:14:29,185 --> 00:14:30,228
from Marshall Winthrop.

342
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:32,220
So you're using Spiro's lawsuit.

343
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:34,221
A criminal.

344
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,608
I won't support this.

345
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,878
You clearly still
don't understand

346
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,530
how things work around here.

347
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,193
You seem confused,
so let me help.

348
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,385
Red Rock gave me authority
to do whatever's necessary

349
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,781
to protect Chastain's
bottom line.

350
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,800
So if Hawkins isn't
gone by end of business,

351
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:53,519
then today will be
your last as CEO.

352
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:56,810
It's him or you.

353
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,396
This is a new low
even for Red Rock.

354
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,448
- You think they'll really do it?
- Of course they'll fire me.

355
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,772
Have you met these people?

356
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,590
The only way I stay on as CEO

357
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:11,692
is if I let them end
Conrad's career.

358
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,556
You can't let them
get away with this.

359
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,407
What am I... What
am I supposed to do?

360
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,565
Report Red Rock
to the state board.

361
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,495
- Take it to the press.
- Yeah, but then say what?

362
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,302
I have no proof. I'd
be out of my office

363
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,832
before anybody even
returned my calls,

364
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,100
and then I'd be
the whistle-blower,

365
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,164
and then they'd move
to destroy me, too.

366
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,409
Then what now?

367
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:32,296
I don't know.

368
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,549
I-I make Red Rock
think I'm on their side.

369
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,969
Show I'm being
cooperative. I, uh...

370
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,182
I don't know, best-case
scenario is I can figure out a way

371
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,173
to save both of us.

372
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,593
How's your pain level, Lynette?

373
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:48,445
If I say zero, can I
pack a bag to Vegas?

374
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,798
Push, push, push.

375
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,517
I have Nelly tickets and a
date with the penny slots.

376
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,637
You just went through a
grueling spinal repair and fixation.

377
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:58,316
I think you're stuck
hanging with us

378
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,868
for a few weeks.
Squeeze my fingers.

379
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,609
W-Weeks?

380
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:04,696
The surgery center people
said I could be home by tonight.

381
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,281
Well, they were wrong.
And the surgeons

382
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:10,418
who actually fixed you
want you to stay fixed.

383
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:11,786
Somebody order an angel?

384
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:13,588
Lynette, this is my dad, Kyle.

385
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:15,551
- He's a volunteer here at
Chastain. Yeah, we have

386
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,102
angels like him to
keep patients company

387
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:19,888
- during their stay.
- Anything you need,
I'm your man.

388
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,752
How about a cigarette?

389
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,648
No can do.

390
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,684
Smoking constricts
your blood vessels,

391
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,814
which keeps your surgical
wounds from healing.

392
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:31,022
And means you'd
be here even longer.

393
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,807
Well, buckle up, honey.

394
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,509
If I don't get my nicotine,

395
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,011
I'm more than a handful.

396
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,668
Still going, huh?

397
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:47,505
Yeah, they're... about
to depose the staff.

398
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,802
That is where I'm gonna
build the tennis court,

399
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:52,626
and this what I'm thinking of

400
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,328
for the interior.

401
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:56,580
Are you gonna stay in there?

402
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,865
Yeah, I cleared my schedule.

403
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:01,836
Thanks for having my back.

404
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,827
How would you
describe Dr. Hawkins?

405
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,896
Caring.

406
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,065
- Smart.
- Handsome.

407
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,768
We heard he can be a
rule breaker. Is that true?

408
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,764
- Never seen it.
- Define "rule breaker."

409
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,739
Well, I saw him cut in
line in the cafeteria once.

410
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,075
At any time, did
you see Dr. Hawkins

411
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,093
go into Mr. Spiro's room alone?

412
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,589
- Nope.
<i>- No.</i>

413
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,163
I was in the OR all day...

414
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,332
Where I should be right now.

415
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:33,445
Mr. Spiro wasn't even
one of my patients.

416
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,302
Can I please go?

417
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,541
We got nothing.

418
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:44,277
Conrad is well-liked
and respected.

419
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,931
Nobody is liked by everyone,
especially doctors like Hawkins.

420
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,448
What do you expect me to do?

421
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,985
If I were you, I'd
think of something.

422
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,195
Hurry, please!

423
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,247
Help her! Please, hurry! Hurry!

424
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,620
Nadine, try to relax.

425
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,906
We're gonna check
your heart and lungs.

426
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:13,658
BP 210/140. Sats in the 80s.

427
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,173
Okay.

428
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,506
Crackles two-thirds
of the way up.

429
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,714
Override a nitro spray bottle.

430
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,844
Then call Radiology
for a portable X-ray stat.

431
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,133
What's happening to her?

432
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,969
She's got fluid in her lungs.

433
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,171
It's making it hard
for her to breathe.

434
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:31,642
Give her 40 of furosemide IV.

435
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,095
Okay. All right, Nadine.

436
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,730
Open wide.

437
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,181
Okay. This will help you breathe

438
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,994
while we figure out
what's going on, okay?

439
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,444
I don't get it. Her
head CT was benign.

440
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:52,346
CSF is clear. Cultures negative.

441
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,364
No pulmonary or cardiac issues.

442
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,467
Is it renal?

443
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,968
Her creatinine was normal.

444
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,815
Besides, that wouldn't
explain her syncope.

445
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,456
So what are we missing?

446
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,542
I got to go.

447
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:05,625
We're not done here.

448
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,055
We still don't know
what's wrong with her.

449
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,874
She could decompensate
at any point.

450
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,149
You will figure this out.

451
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,551
Keep me updated.

452
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,836
It's not my fault.

453
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,791
- What?
- Rob Spiro.

454
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,226
I tried to stop you.

455
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,796
What does that have
to do with anything?

456
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,316
Because you're
taking it out on me,

457
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:30,418
and Nadine will
suffer because of it.

458
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,806
I have other patients,

459
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,692
including ones in the ICU.

460
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:41,412
And you were the one who
didn't want to work with me.

461
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,080
Because you tortured a man.

462
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:49,637
Rob Spiro is a murderer.

463
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:50,971
And we're doctors.

464
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:53,319
We're supposed to be the
ones who are helping people.

465
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:56,071
- And I did.
- You break rules,
ignore protocol.

466
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,739
That is who you
are, and it is wrong.

467
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,863
We have been over and over this.

468
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,249
A man is alive
because of what I did.

469
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,279
Oh, you didn't do it for
him. You did it for you.

470
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,303
You're damn right I did.

471
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:09,852
Had to make a
choice I could live with.

472
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,280
I got to go.

473
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,135
<i>So, we'll start you</i>

474
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,219
on a cardiac
regimen, oral diuretic

475
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:29,760
and a beta-blocker.

476
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,423
And then we'll see
you every few days

477
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:32,575
to monitor you and the baby.

478
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,930
Sounds like a plan.

479
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,101
And I have faith that
God's watching over us.

480
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,287
Adaku, we want

481
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,550
to make sure that you
understand what all this means.

482
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,870
If the strain on your
heart becomes too great,

483
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:46,788
we may need to perform an
emergency cesarean delivery.

484
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,441
But even that might
not be enough. I've seen

485
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:52,432
women your age end up
with a device implanted

486
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:53,879
to take over the
function of their heart.

487
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:56,270
Tethered to a battery pack.
Waiting for a transplant.

488
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:57,704
But I feel fine now.

489
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:00,741
Cardiac issues can escalate
quickly for pregnant women.

490
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:03,244
Worsening heart failure...

491
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,663
could kill both
you and the baby.

492
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:15,256
We're here to support
whatever you choose

493
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,307
if you are sure

494
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,677
that you want to try
carrying this baby to term.

495
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:25,882
Maybe I should take a minute.

496
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:31,938
Add a thyroid panel,
ABG and BMP.

497
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:33,257
You ran those two hours ago.

498
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,953
Two hours ago, she
wasn't on oxygen.

499
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:37,844
- Run it again.
- Yes, Doctor.

500
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:47,470
You all right?

501
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,004
I got to make sure
you finish school

502
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:54,211
so you can start deejaying

503
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,390
sold-out clubs around
the world, right?

504
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,359
I like the sound of that.

505
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,810
And you can have a disguise,

506
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,329
like that guy with
the mouse mask.

507
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:01,730
And hey, you already
have a code name.

508
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,449
Phoenix?

509
00:22:03,473 --> 00:22:05,489
Okay, you'll think
of a better one.

510
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,954
All I ask for in return are
backstage passes... for life.

511
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,664
All right, I'm gonna go
check on those tests.

512
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,066
Wait.

513
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,035
Um... before you go,

514
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,020
could you pass me the, um...

515
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:23,135
the... the...

516
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,910
the... the<i> Ras?</i>

517
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,211
Juice?

518
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,646
Yes. Sorry.

519
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,998
I couldn't think of the word.

520
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,900
Thank you.

521
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,752
Has that happened before?

522
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,431
Forgetting English
words for things?

523
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,755
A few times. It's weird, huh?

524
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,224
How long has it been going on?

525
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,510
A couple weeks.

526
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,512
Why?

527
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:59,409
Nadine forgets words in her
primary language, English,

528
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,912
but her secondary language,
Urdu, remains intact.

529
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,592
Could have a number of causes.

530
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,916
But it happened when she sat up.

531
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,436
So you think she's experiencing

532
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:10,966
positional cerebral
hypoperfusion?

533
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,851
That's why I ordered
an angiogram.

534
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,843
Look. The blood vessels
in her brain have narrowed.

535
00:23:15,878 --> 00:23:18,195
- She has Moyamoya.
- Which would explain

536
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,474
why she lost all
sensation in her feet

537
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,942
- while she was jogging.
- And why

538
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,111
her symptoms only occurred
when she exerted herself.

539
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,980
Moyamoya can be
unremitting and progressive.

540
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,865
She could die of strokes
before she turns 30.

541
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:28,849
Unless I perform
a cerebral bypass.

542
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,972
Time to get our
princess to my OR.

543
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:37,543
The first time my dad
busted me, I was 16.

544
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:40,750
But instead of grounding
me, he bought me a pack.

545
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:43,303
Said fathers and daughters
should smoke the same brand.

546
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,972
- He gave you cigarettes?
- He'd smoke 'em with me.

547
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,285
- Oh.
- Playing slapjack

548
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:50,427
on the front porch like a
couple rowdy old drunks.

549
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,509
Till he passed away
a couple years ago.

550
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,799
What did he die of?

551
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,885
Heart attack.

552
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,998
You know, more people
die of heart disease

553
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,139
from smoking than cancer.

554
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,592
- And still, you smoke?
- I know

555
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:07,511
- it doesn't make any sense.
- No.

556
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,430
The right thing to
do is to quit, but...

557
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:12,433
I can't.

558
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,088
You know, that's the
definition of addiction.

559
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,140
It's in my family, too.

560
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:24,944
I, uh...

561
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,947
I was a drinker and, you know,

562
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,166
eh, drugs when I was younger.

563
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,654
My daughters... They
grew up seeing that,

564
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:37,574
and one of 'em became an addict.

565
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:43,547
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

566
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,317
Oh, God.

567
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,269
Can you read that thing?

568
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:51,222
No, but I-I...

569
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:54,191
I-I... I think I can find
someone who can.

570
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,266
Um, I'll be right...
I'll be right back.

571
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,012
Uh, excuse me? My...

572
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,949
Hey, uh, can I just...?

573
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,740
Hello. Hey, could
you just help...?

574
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:09,073
You got to be kidding me.

575
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,125
Uh, hey, I-I need a doctor.

576
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,994
Hey! Angels will not be ignored.

577
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,464
It's my patient.

578
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:19,144
- Y-Your patient?
- Yes, yes.

579
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:20,646
Her mon-monitor
thing... It-it's beeping.

580
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,497
Could you... could
you check on her?

581
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,804
I think you might be
getting a little carried away

582
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,808
- with your role here.
- Okay. I'm a Nevin.

583
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:29,560
- All right?
- A who?

584
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,812
Yeah, th-that's it!
I want your name,

585
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:35,348
Scott, and your badge
number, right now!

586
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,854
- I don't understand.
- I know.

587
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,940
- It is a lot to process, but...
- No. I don't understand

588
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,425
who comes up with these names.

589
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,027
Mora-maya?

590
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,329
- Moyamoya.
- Okay.

591
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:52,399
It means "puff of
smoke" in Japanese,

592
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:54,601
because of the way it
looks on the angiogram.

593
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,537
- Mm.
- Nadine, if we don't operate...

594
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,157
it is fatal.

595
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,965
I've faced a lot of
threats in my life.

596
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,516
Kidnapping,

597
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:13,053
poisoning, assassination.

598
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:15,839
I'm not gonna let a puff
of smoke take me out.

599
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:19,871
Then we'll prep you for surgery.

600
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:21,227
I want my day in court.

601
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:22,596
I'm sorry, Dr. Feldman.

602
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:24,932
They've decided
not to depose you.

603
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:27,750
But Dr. Hawkins is one of
the best doctors at this hospital.

604
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,836
He...

605
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,669
A patient came in
hypertensive last week.

606
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,454
Hawkins realized it
was pheochromocytoma.

607
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:37,945
Who else makes that call?

608
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,508
And not only is
Conrad a great doctor,

609
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:40,965
he<i> makes</i> great doctors.

610
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,410
Dr. Pravesh used
to train under him.

611
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,801
Total rising star.

612
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,314
Oh, Pravesh isn't
Hawkins' intern anymore?

613
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:47,137
No, he requested a new resident.

614
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:52,342
Why?

615
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:56,847
When did he put in the request?

616
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,149
About a month ago.

617
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,071
Wasn't that around the time
they were both treating Rob Spiro?

618
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:06,023
Yeah.

619
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,808
Why?

620
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:40,657
They say a cerebral bypass
is like landing on the moon.

621
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,976
Cain only gets one shot.

677
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,848
