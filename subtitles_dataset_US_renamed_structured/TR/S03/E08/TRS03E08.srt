using a turkey fryer

- Apparently she's...

183
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,633
in love with somebody else.

184
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,302
Ooh... Sorry, man.

185
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,849
But it sounds like
you dodged a bullet.

186
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:21,155
Could be worse.

187
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,491
Though I can't see how.

188
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,329
Happy Thanksgiving.

189
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,465
- You, too.
- VIP, Bay Ten.

190
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,184
One of you admit him before
the paparazzi shows up.

191
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,486
- What do we have?
<i>- Who</i> do we have?

192
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,006
Oh, my God, that's
Delandre Harris.

193
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:42,944
Mr. Harris, it is a pleasure

194
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,340
- to meet you.
- My man.

195
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,959
Your Sensitive Darth
Vader impression

196
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:47,326
is the funniest
thing I've ever seen.

197
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,617
I would do it for you,

198
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:50,479
but I got something
jamming the pipes, man.

199
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,198
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

200
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,799
Did you swallow
something, Mr. Harris?

201
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:55,507
- Mashed potatoes.
- D...

202
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,824
you're supposed to be eating

203
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:58,993
mashed cauliflower,
not potatoes.

204
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,839
Manage my career,
not my meal plan.

205
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,380
I'm a grown man sneaking out

206
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,681
to the kitchen to inhale

207
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,317
some leftover mashed potatoes.

208
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,651
Don't judge me.

209
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,852
You've been there.

210
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:08,870
We've all have.

211
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,056
- Hey, I'm a stuffing guy.
- I feel you.

212
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,957
Hell, with a little

213
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,504
-bit of gravy on
that thing, -Mmm.

214
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,511
All goes down smooth.

215
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,190
Except it didn't,
'cause something

216
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:19,614
was in them damn potatoes.

217
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:21,949
And now it's all
jammed up in my throat.

218
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:25,020
Damn achalasia, man!

219
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:27,655
When was your esophageal
disease diagnosed?

220
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,006
A few years ago.

221
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,325
Even with a few procedures,

222
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,892
it still worse than ever, Doc.

223
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,377
Let me take a look, okay?

224
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,462
Mm-hmm.

225
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,181
Open up and say ah, please.

226
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,515
Ah!

227
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,133
It looks clear.

228
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,751
Mm-hmm.

229
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,172
I feel crepitus.

230
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,490
Air where it shouldn't
be, so whatever you ate

231
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,260
caused a perforation.

232
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,822
You sure you can't just
butter up what's in there

233
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:51,274
and just yank it
up out of there?

234
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,525
- No! No yanking.
- Come on, man.

235
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:53,764
Delandre needs his voice

236
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,178
- when all this is over.
- All right.

237
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,378
Let's start you with
an X-ray, okay?

238
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,530
- My man.
- All right.

239
00:08:57,554 --> 00:08:59,153
All right.

240
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:02,406
Gobble gobble?

241
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,524
Gobble?

242
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,427
Not funny?

243
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,163
You've done better.

244
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,264
Oh, honey, don't be gloomy.

245
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,668
My family's gone and I always
spend Thanksgiving with them.

246
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:16,003
And here I am, looking like

247
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:17,700
a freakin' lollipop
and getting ready

248
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,468
- to watch football all alone.
- I'll be here.

249
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,353
I promise... my shift
ends in a few hours.

250
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:22,360
You hate football.

251
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,694
Love football.

252
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,413
First and ten, Astroturf,

253
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,131
Peyton Manning, "Da Bears."

254
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,253
You're so cute
when you're clueless.

255
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:35,406
You know, football is
very serious business

256
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,319
in my family... My Uncle
Larry once punched

257
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,261
my dad in the face, 'cause
he forgot his lucky socks,

258
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:41,974
and he ended the
Cowboys' winning streak.

259
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,970
No.

260
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,138
Go. Your patients need you.

261
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,858
Just like my Grandma
Addie needs my family.

262
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,489
I promise I'll
stop feeling sorry

263
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,140
for myself and I'll be grateful.

264
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,148
I'm grateful you're still here.

265
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,167
Me, too.

266
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,319
So grateful.

267
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,456
Even with this sad little
screen to watch football

268
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,425
and this hideous helmet

269
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,277
covering the scars on my head.

270
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,950
I'll be back as soon as I can.

271
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,118
Okay.

272
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,771
Hang in there.

273
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,478
That is an intact

274
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,296
turkey wishbone.

275
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,277
How do you swallow
a wishbone whole?

276
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,168
However it went in,

277
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,015
the only one way it's
coming out is surgery.

278
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,300
And it's not as simple as
repairing the perforation.

279
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:43,102
Might have to remove
the esophagus.

280
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:45,827
You want to break it to
the patient or should I?

281
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:48,123
Looks like Red Rock's latest
golden boy's already at it.

282
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,099
Mr. Harris, I have personally
interceded so you get the best.

283
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:53,534
Dr. Torres here is a
magician in the OR.

284
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,664
A magician, huh? Just
make sure you don't

285
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,567
pull no rabbit out my
throat, you hear me?

286
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,707
That's a good one, man.

287
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:02,010
I have to have Delandre
back on set Monday.

288
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,188
Shouldn't be a problem at all.

289
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:05,146
Mr. Kim,

290
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:06,347
a word.

291
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:07,732
Yeah.

292
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,201
- Mm.
- Excuse me.

293
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,820
So glad you're here.

294
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:12,903
<i>TMZ</i> is outside.

295
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,183
I'm going to introduce
them to Torres,

296
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,556
and it would be a nice touch

297
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,675
to have the chief of
surgery by my side.

298
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,493
Mr. Harris is my patient.

299
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,246
- Not anymore.
- This is

300
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,025
a medical decision.
I'm the chief of surgery.

301
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,834
Ergo, it's my
decision, not yours.

302
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,218
The patient's achalasia

303
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,081
makes the esophageal
repair complicated.

304
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,705
Torres is a brilliant surgeon.

305
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,324
To sign him, we won a
bidding war with five hospitals.

306
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,820
- He's a star.
- I'm well aware.

307
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:37,178
Then you should also
be aware that it's my job

308
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:39,192
to keep him here, and that
means to make him happy.

309
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:41,043
Even with a
reputation for brilliance,

310
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,329
a famous patient
is not appropriate

311
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:44,997
as a trial run for
a new surgeon.

312
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,655
Torres is young,
charismatic and diverse.

313
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,352
He is the story
that we want to tell

314
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,492
to the cameras waiting
outside that door.

315
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:52,993
But if something goes wrong,

316
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:55,580
it's a PR nightmare,
which we can't afford.

317
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,047
Don't tell me how to do my job.

318
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,901
I have been the spine of
this hospital for over a decade.

319
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:03,538
And amply demonstrated
it's too much for one doctor.

320
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:07,841
A top tier of surgeons is going
to lead this hospital forward.

321
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:11,896
I sincerely hope you can
be one of them, Dr. Bell.

322
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,725
<i>- Elf?</i> Really?
- How could you not love<i> Elf?</i>

323
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,905
- How can you not love<i> Die Hard?</i> "Yippee-ki-yay."
- Okay,

324
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,956
<i>- Planes, Trains</i>
<i>and Automobiles.</i>
- Sold.

325
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,725
- I love John Candy.
- All right.

326
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,783
Hey, Nic? Where's
your turkey roaster?

327
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,567
Coming.

328
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:36,236
Put the movie on.

329
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,585
Oh! Hey there, neighbors.

330
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,615
- The boys here to feed
the chickens? Come on in.
- Hey.

331
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,150
I was actually hoping you
wouldn't mind taking a look

332
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,418
- at Tommy.
- Yeah, of course.

333
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,557
Sorry to impose,

334
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:58,588
but Barbara's visiting
her family in Long Island.

335
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,261
Tommy's been coughing, and...

336
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:01,824
- I mean, it's probably nothing.
- No problem, Anthony.

337
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:02,980
I'm happy to take a look.

338
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,282
He's a little warm.

339
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,650
Did you call his cardiologist?

340
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,985
I tried, but he's
away for the holiday

341
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,972
and... isn't returning calls.

342
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:14,342
Now, let's see what
we got going on here.

343
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,010
Dad?

344
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,362
Is Tommy gonna be okay?

345
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,649
Hey. Don't worry, Ryan.

346
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,669
Your little brother's
in good hands.

347
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:35,012
Who pushes someone through
a plate glass window over a toy?

348
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,865
Delusional, selfish,
narcissistic helicopter parents.

349
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:40,335
Sorry.

350
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,471
Just...

351
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:44,806
I'm just worried about Jessica.

352
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:46,490
She's going stir-crazy.

353
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,193
It's not unusual after spending
that much time in the ICU.

354
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,679
It's called post-ICU PTSD.

355
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:53,364
Yeah. I know.

356
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,649
Doesn't help me fix my
woman's crappy Thanksgiving.

357
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,539
Dislocated shoulder. Bay 11.

358
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,324
Backyard football gone wrong.

359
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,892
Mm-hmm.

360
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,222
You were definitely right

361
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,326
about it being the
most dangerous holiday.

362
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,003
Why'd you page me?

363
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,600
Our splenectomy
isn't for another hour.

364
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,384
I'm reassigning
you to assist Torres

365
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:21,387
on Delandre Harris'
esophageal repair.

366
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:23,561
Torres? I thought
you were doing it.

367
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,230
I decided to be a team
player. Torres is taking the lead.

368
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,993
I just want him to have
the best assist he can

369
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:29,650
on such a high-profile case.

370
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:30,829
You want me to spy on him.

371
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,069
Yeah.

372
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:36,356
Just find out if he's as
good as Kim thinks he is.

373
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:38,860
Morally questionable.

374
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:40,361
But it's a cool case,

375
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:42,313
so I'm in.

376
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,700
Bonnie, you see this house?

377
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:48,035
Our boy's done well for himself.

378
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,905
Maybe we should've put
all our kids up for adoption.

379
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,508
AJ's in a different life
stage than our sons.

380
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:57,845
Look, Lamar, I know you
mean well with our sons.

381
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:00,414
Just, please, for today, give
Camron and Marcus less advice

382
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,782
and more praise.

383
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,129
Well, I am desperately
looking for something to praise.

384
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,469
Believe me.

385
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,888
Don't say things
like that, for example.

386
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:10,141
- I was kidding.
- Well, get your kidding out

387
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,987
before Marcus and
Camron get here.

388
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,605
They're meeting their
full biological brother

389
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:14,629
for the first time.

390
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,963
It's a delicate situation.

391
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,067
And remember, they're grown.

392
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,237
They don't have to spend
their holidays with us anymore.

393
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:28,320
Are you kidding me?

394
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,961
A purple man bun?

395
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,313
Just leave it.

396
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,610
They're here.

397
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,296
- We got this, son.
- Don't worry.

398
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:52,266
Your brothers would be fools
not to love you as much as we do.

399
00:15:52,302 --> 00:15:54,318
Everything's gonna be wonderful.

400
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,522
So, um,

401
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,658
Marcus, Camron,

402
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:20,661
are either of you in the
medical field like your mom?

403
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:23,881
Well, Marcus is at Atlanta
Community College.

404
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,635
But he... will be
graduating this year.

405
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,898
Is he really though?

406
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,999
Been giving us that
same line for five years.

407
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,640
You literally dance
on street corners, bruh.

408
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:35,553
'Cause that's where
hip-hop lives,<i> bruh.</i>

409
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,544
Well, how 'bout that turkey?

410
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,646
You need any help, Carol?

411
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:41,359
'Cause I got great
hands. Put 'em to work.

412
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:45,052
Well, uh, Yee is the
chef in our family.

413
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,548
He's incredible.

414
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,938
No turkey. Duck.

415
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,826
That sounds wonderful.

416
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:54,411
Well, that's one way
of doing Thanksgiving.

417
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:58,182
The Austins celebrate
our multicultural heritage

418
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,918
by having my father's
most revered dish.

419
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:03,304
Peking duck. It's
a Chinese delicacy.

420
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:05,739
Bro, you're not Chinese.

421
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:08,687
Genetically
speaking, you're right.

422
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:11,045
But, culturally, my
father raised me

423
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,881
with a deep love of Chinese
heritage and tradition,

424
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,983
so, actually, I'm
about as Chinese

425
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:19,954
as any third-generation
Asian kid with a black mom.

426
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:33,445
With his heart defect, it's
good that you brought him over.

427
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,219
I need to get him to the ER,

428
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,866
where I can give him
a more thorough exam.

429
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,906
Oh, my God. Should we call 911?

430
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:40,685
We're so close.
It's faster if we drive.

431
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,404
I'm going with
you. I'll call ahead,

432
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,922
- so they'll be waiting for us.
- Okay. Come on, Ryan.

433
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:45,246
Okay.

434
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,780
I will be back as soon as I can.

435
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,360
Leave the kitchen
for me to clean.

436
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,401
I'm fine. Go.

437
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,220
That doesn't sound good.

438
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:54,388
I'll deal. Go.

439
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:56,223
Make sure Tommy's okay.

440
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,300
Oh!

441
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,703
Blackwell Award for Science.

442
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:12,890
Glad to know you
inherited my scientific brain.

443
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,820
Which I am grateful for.

444
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,310
He had an early start,
growing up in Yee's kitchen.

445
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,996
Cooking is chemistry.

446
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,981
Which I am also grateful for.

447
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,283
Bonnie, if you don't mind.

448
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,650
We need AJ over here.

449
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,819
- Something's wrong with Yee.
- What's up?

450
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:30,290
I am fine, son.

451
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:31,992
Dude can't stop smiling.

452
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,344
Maybe it's the first signs
of a stroke or something.

453
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,797
I mean, nobody's
this happy all the time.

454
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:39,516
Actually, Pops is, all the time.

455
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,120
Whoa. Oh!

456
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,484
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Here, let-let me help you with that.

457
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:47,519
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad,
man. We're just trying to find

458
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,959
the soundtrack to this circus.

459
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,994
You feeling some '90s hip-hop?

460
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,281
Come on, Cam. Just
pick Dad's favorite R&B.

461
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:55,332
What do you got, AJ?

462
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,533
Hey!

463
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,370
Look, whatever you decide,

464
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,955
let me put the delicate
vinyl on the turntable

465
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:03,802
with my own two
hands, all right?

466
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:05,553
Each of these
records is a work of art,

467
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,944
and they deserve to be
handled appropriately.

468
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,842
What you doing, an
impersonation of Dad?

469
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:12,082
No, man, I think
that's just who he is.

470
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,890
Conrad. What's up?

471
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,526
I'm on my way.

472
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,662
Was that the hospital?

473
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,399
Yeah, I just got called in.
It's urgent. It's an emergency.

474
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,395
Well, looks like the party's
over. We can all go home.

475
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,952
Nice meeting everyone.

476
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:33,287
Sit down, boys.

477
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:35,505
How long do you think you'll be?

478
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,920
It's impossible to say. But I
will be back as soon as I can.

479
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,826
And everyone is welcome to stay.

480
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,089
Well, hopefully,
it's a false alarm

481
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,345
and you can return quickly.

482
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,149
- Hey, you gonna be okay?
- Of course.

483
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,395
Go. Save a life.

484
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,334
- All right.
- Just, uh,

485
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,980
get back here as
quick as you can,

486
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:50,705
okay, son?

487
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,856
I will.

488
00:19:58,214 --> 00:20:00,630
♪ ♪

489
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,029
My college squad and I went
on an ayahuasca vision quest

490
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,219
for Thanksgiving.

491
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,740
I volunteered to
carve the turkey, but...

492
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:29,410
Hallucinogenics
and sharp objects.

493
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:30,928
Not a great combo.

494
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,046
- Can you wiggle your fingers?
- Yeah.

495
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:35,433
- But it hurts real bad. It...
- Mm.

496
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,285
Dude, has anyone ever told you

497
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,621
you have incredible pores?

498
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,756
Clean,

499
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,206
but tight.

500
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,192
But clean.

501
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:46,476
Definitely still hallucinating.

502
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:50,730
Joey, you're gonna need
to ride out your trip, okay?

503
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:54,734
Let's take a look here.

504
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,217
Hustle! Got to
get out right now,

505
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:01,158
- we got additional vics.
- Copy that. Go, go, go. Come on.

506
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,501
Hundley, did Dr. Hawkins
arrive with that boy yet?

507
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:13,136
- They're landing any second.
- All right.

508
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,755
Happy Thanksgiving, Dr. Austin.

509
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:16,990
Hey, back at you.

510
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,642
What are you grateful for?

511
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:22,129
A job where I am in demand
and far away from family.

512
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:24,084
Hey, would you make sure

513
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,583
there's a pediatric crash
cart in Trauma Bay 11?

514
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,851
Already taken care of.

515
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,303
Hey.

516
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,272
I'm grateful for you.

517
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:34,442
I'm grateful for you, too.

518
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,129
Austin, it is good to see you.

519
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,014
- In here.
- What's the update?

520
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,711
Two episodes of
syncope in the car.

521
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:43,862
I'll get him on the monitor.

522
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,636
Get an IV.

523
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,791
Let's get him on oxygen.

524
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:55,045
His heart rate is 150.

525
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,142
I think it's atrial flutter,
but it's hard to tell.

526
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,161
Trial of adenosine?

527
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:03,537
Get the pads.

528
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,355
We need to cardiovert. Now.

529
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,024
Oh, my God.

530
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,678
Let's give them
some space to work.

531
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:13,641
- Did Tommy's heart just stop?
- Come on, Ryan.

532
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,066
- No! No, my brother's dying.
- He's not dying.

533
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:19,252
Dr. Austin is taking very
good care of Tommy.

534
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,056
I promise. Come on.

535
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,393
All right, charge to 17.

536
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,829
- Clear.
- Tommy!

537
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:34,734
All right, let's try it again.
Charge to 33. Clear.

538
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:46,062
It's gonna be okay.

539
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,183
Did something fall?

540
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,785
Yeah. Yeah, your father.

541
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,905
He's terrible at the moonwalk.

542
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,290
She's right, and I
should be able to do this.

543
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:15,543
The '80s was my decade.

544
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:18,423
All right, come on.
Are you okay, Dad?

545
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:21,916
Yes, fine. I'm fine.
Everything except for my pride.

546
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:23,950
I guess I should

547
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,764
give up my dreams of
dancing for Alvin Ailey.

548
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,271
No, no, no, I want to see this.

549
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,539
- No. No.
- You got this. One more time.

550
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,420
- Okay.
- All right. One-one more.

551
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,643
One more. Here we go.

552
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,212
Oh, my God.

553
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,882
Okay, that's walking backward.

554
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,779
- There's no moon involved there.
- You're the one who said

555
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:42,881
- I got this.
- Yeah, well I was trying
to be supportive.

556
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:44,782
- I didn't know it was that bad.
- Oh, what? You can do better?

557
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,973
- Hey, floor's all yours.
- Oh, no, no.

558
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,093
Last time I danced, I
sprained my ankle, remember?

559
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,396
Oh, that's right. Family camp.

560
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,881
- Oh.
- Oh.

561
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,327
That number we did
was so embarrassing.

562
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,168
Oh, for all of us. My
mom choreographed it.

563
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,337
Or at least tried to.

564
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:04,408
Nobody could do her
moves except for Jessie.

565
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,045
Who's Jessie?

566
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:23,576
Precise anastomosis.

567
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:26,913
Your handling of the
gastric conduit is so delicate.

568
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:29,900
At this juncture, it's
all about soft hands.

569
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,304
Do everything possible to
limit trauma to the tissue.

570
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,317
So, how did it go?

571
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:50,304
He's an excellent
surgeon... Skilled, efficient

572
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:51,849
and a great
addition to Chastain.

573
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,690
Well, that's great.

574
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,192
Even better.

575
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,660
A perforated gallbladder.

576
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,346
Too much turkey.
It's ours for the taking.

577
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:01,059
Why does this
holiday turn people

578
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,732
into such gluttonous animals?

579
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:05,001
I'll book us OR Six.

580
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,728
Third call in a row.
Do you need to take it?

581
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,829
Yes, Lamar.

582
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,214
Yes, I'm still busy.

583
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,010
Listen, you will
know as soon as I do

584
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:20,551
when I can get back, all right?

585
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:23,036
Can page another surgeon
if you need to get home.

586
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:25,723
Thank you, but...

587
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:28,608
I'm happy where I am.

588
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,581
His Glenn is unobstructed,
but his tricuspid valve is failing.

589
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,528
Because of his hypoplastic
left heart syndrome?

590
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:39,353
Yeah, and his lungs are already
starting to back up with fluid.

591
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:40,782
Is he strong enough
to survive surgery?

592
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,784
Certainly not in the
hands of a mere mortal.

593
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,676
But I'll be cutting, so
his odds just inched up.

594
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,711
None of this is ideal.

595
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,098
If the Petersons lose Tommy

596
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,951
today on Thanksgiving...

597
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,954
holidays will
haunt them forever.

598
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,206
I know. I've seen it before.

599
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:01,140
Is there a way we stabilize him?

600
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,710
We take the chance tomorrow?

601
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:05,629
Hawkins, I wish there was,

602
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,114
but we don't have a choice.

603
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,799
Without surgery today,

604
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,994
little man will not make
it past Thanksgiving.

605
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:23,863
His pressure's been tanking.

606
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:25,443
Hang two liters of LR
and get a bedside lactate.

607
00:26:25,467 --> 00:26:28,118
And page Dr. Bell.

608
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,270
I know, I know.
Don't try to talk.

609
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:33,039
Okay, hang in there,
Delandre. Hang in there.

610
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,458
Torres said the
surgery went well.

611
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:38,211
His lactate is through
the roof. Temp is 102.

612
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:40,530
He's in septic shock.

613
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,772
- Is he okay?
- Get him on Vanc
and piperacillin.

614
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:55,507
Is this a complication
from surgery?

615
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,125
I'm gonna need imaging
to know that for sure.

616
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,516
- I'll get Dr. Torres.
- I already paged Dr. Bell.

617
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,519
- It's Torres' case.
- Then get him here now.

618
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,705
Linda, let's get
Delandre to CT. Let's go.

619
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,410
It's completely raw.

620
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:12,290
Well, the oven's
not hot. Is it broken?

621
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:14,180
It wasn't even turned on.

622
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,467
- What?
- Is Sadie okay?

623
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:17,851
This isn't her fault.

624
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,647
This was my job. I'm sorry.

625
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,032
I heard you ask
her to handle it.

626
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,439
Why are you covering for her?

627
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,369
Did she just leave?

628
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,321
She probably heard
what you were saying.

629
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,363
Sadie? Sadie,
nobody's mad at you.

630
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,199
- Sadie, get back here!
- Oh, no.

631
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,136
These are my favorite earrings.

632
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,123
Sadie?!

633
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,792
She stole my jewelry.

634
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,362
Don't worry. I'll find her.

635
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,974
- Dad...
- She's gonna pawn your jewelry
to buy drugs.

636
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,393
I got to stop her
before she OD's again.

637
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,233
You'll get your stuff back.

638
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,563
Just let it go. It's not worth
it. You're not gonna save her.

639
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,049
This is a matter
of life and death.

640
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:56,050
The last time Jessie
used, she almost died.

641
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,591
She is not Jessie.

642
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,094
Don't you see what you're doing?

643
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,532
Look...

644
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:08,051
I know that you and Jessie
had a special relationship.

645
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,070
You were extremely close,
and it's Thanksgiving, so,

646
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,007
you find this girl, you
bring her here, and she's...

647
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,243
Same age, same issues, but...

648
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:27,821
Is it a given that

649
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:30,858
one Nevin will always
screw up Thanksgiving?

650
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,029
I'm sorry.

651
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,385
It's okay.

652
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:46,390
Look, at least we
have each other, right?

653
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:49,075
I am sorry.

654
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,057
You need to take care
of this. I understand. I...

655
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,035
Why are you looking
at my patient's scans?

656
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:06,459
I was paged when he
went septic in the ICU.

657
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,707
- I'm going to book an OR.
- N-No. That isn't necessary.

658
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:10,713
Dr. Torres is here.
He'll take over.

659
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,649
Delandre Harris is dying.

660
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,252
His gastric conduit is
ischemic, he's in septic shock.

661
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,869
A rare, known complication.

662
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:20,373
No, agreed. I'm not saying
you did anything wrong.

663
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,559
What's your plan?

664
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,889
I will rebuild his stomach
once I find the best option.

665
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:26,407
Or we could harvest
part of his colon.

666
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,982
Colonic interposition?

667
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,412
- We-we could do that. That would work.
- Great.

668
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,114
Dr. Torres, get him prepped
right away and take care of it.

669
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,083
Of course it's an incredibly
complicated procedure.

670
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,584
It should only be
attempted by a surgeon

671
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,990
who's performed it many times.

672
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,994
- How many have you done?
- It's a rare procedure.

673
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,715
I've witnessed it a few times,
but I've never performed it.

674
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,634
How many have you performed?

675
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:50,687
Well, enough that my
techniques have been published.

676
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:52,767
But that's irrelevant, of
course. I'm a team player.

677
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,191
- It's Dr. Torres' case.
- Dr. Bell, uh,

678
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,944
you're-you're doing
the surgery now.

679
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,546
Ask nicely.

680
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,922
Dr. Bell, please,

681
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:11,491
will you do the surgery?

682
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:13,410
Of course.

683
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,429
I'd love to scrub in and watch.

684
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:18,481
You're welcome to.

685
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:32,145
Last stitch around the
annulus, and it's all yours.

686
00:30:32,181 --> 00:30:33,847
Nice and tight.

687
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:36,549
Stitching a heart the
size of a clementine.

688
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:40,537
Now that is the true
meaning of Thanksgiving.

689
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,673
Yeah, it is.

690
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,675
Reinforce the sutures.

691
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,827
Okay.

692
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:49,196
Time to take him off bypass.

693
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:51,498
All right, if this
works, blood should

694
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:54,250
flow normally through the heart.

695
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:59,233
- His heart's not beating.
- I have eyes to see.

696
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,691
Paddles to me now.

697
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:04,060
Clear.

698
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:08,849
- He's in V tach.
- Give 80 of amio, charge to ten.

699
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:10,617
Clear!

700
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:19,108
Come on, Tommy.

701
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,184
I'm gonna get you
back to your brother.

702
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,459
A happy outcome, when I wasn't
sure we were going to get one,

703
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:38,544
makes the moment of family
reunion so much sweeter.

704
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:39,930
Yeah.

705
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,400
Ryan's always been so
sweet with his little brother.

706
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:48,705
So protective because
Tommy's been sick.

707
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:52,025
Well, you know, they say the
people we love most are the ones

708
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,978
we take care of, not the
ones who take care of us.

709
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,946
- Ah.
- Yeah.

710
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,382
That's why it's been
so hard for Kyle and Nic.

711
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,979
They took care
of Jessie so long,

712
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,636
letting her go... it's...

713
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,672
it's nearly impossible.

714
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:08,207
You have siblings?

715
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:10,227
Only child.

716
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,578
I always wished I wasn't.

717
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:16,833
I'm happy for you.

718
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,329
- Why is that?
- Eh, well,

719
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,836
yesterday you were riding solo,

720
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:21,565
and then, out of
nowhere, you got brothers.

721
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,908
Yeah, but I don't think you
can manufacture the kind

722
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,760
of relationship those two have

723
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,829
with no shared history.

724
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,531
Your history starts today.

725
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,189
Wow. Well, you know what?

726
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,841
With that shared
wisdom, I'm headed home.

727
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,510
Happy Thanksgiving.

728
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,562
To us all, my man.

729
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,868
We're at 12
Thanksgiving-related accidents.

730
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,353
One more and I win.

731
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,689
We have half an
hour left in our shift.

732
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,474
Let's just call this a draw.

733
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,720
And you should probably head
out to watch the game with Jessica.

734
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,878
Not so fast, Pravesh.

735
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,529
Gentlemen, a patient for you.

736
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,031
Bay Seven.

737
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,995
Is it Thanksgiving-related?

738
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,885
I'll let you decide.

739
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
Oh, yeah.

740
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,859
Hi.

741
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,289
I told him it was
bad luck to hang

742
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:20,040
the Christmas decorations
on Thanksgiving.

743
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,182
I fell off the roof. Ten feet.

744
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:24,078
And Rudolph and his
bright nose were waiting.

745
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,068
I win.

746
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:26,965
Oh, no. Christmas-related
doesn't count.

747
00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:28,888
Let's just call this a draw.

748
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,239
There's still time.

749
00:33:33,395 --> 00:33:36,412
Suturing the last piece
of the transverse colon.

750
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:37,713
Is that enough blood supply?

751
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,928
Yes. Textbooks will
tell you that the left colon

752
00:33:39,952 --> 00:33:41,596
has the best blood
supply for the conduit,

753
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,481
but I find the
transverse colon is best,

754
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:45,821
particularly in cases like this.

755
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,691
- Less chance of ischemia.
- Mm-hmm.

756
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,062
Your grafting is impressive.

757
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:55,515
You did nothing wrong, you know.

758
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:57,044
There was no
tension on the conduit.

759
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,353
The-the anastomosis was
excellent, from what I can see.

760
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:03,173
Complications happen.

761
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,724
Welcome to attendinghood.

762
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,996
I'm doing a lap
hemicolectomy tomorrow.

763
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:12,031
Care to join?

764
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,735
I look forward to it.

765
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:26,346
It's the best I could
do on short notice.

766
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:27,864
It's perfect.

767
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,376
- I thought we were going to PT.
- We will.

768
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,080
- First I want to
show you something.
- Oh!

769
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,540
There she is.

770
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,819
Hey, girl. How are you feeling?

771
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,143
Love the Bears helmet.

772
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,262
- Nice touch.
- You did all this for me?

773
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,375
I wanted to get you out of the
room. Have some game day fun.

774
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,916
I don't know what to say.

775
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:50,053
Well, they do. Don't worry. I
vetted everyone in this room.

776
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,217
- Mm-hmm.
- They're fully prepared
to talk all things football.

777
00:34:52,241 --> 00:34:54,658
- Oh!
- Go ahead. Test them.

778
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:55,970
Mm...

779
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:58,594
How many yards
are in a first down?

780
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,780
Ten.

781
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:01,998
Okay.

782
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,761
How many teams
are in the league?

783
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:06,236
- 32.
- Not bad.

784
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,071
Nolan,

785
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,223
how many players are
allowed on the field?

786
00:35:10,259 --> 00:35:13,159
11 per team. Although,
many consider the fans

787
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,661
to be the 12th man.

788
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,341
Okay. All right, guys,
the game -IRVING: Hey.

789
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,193
- Is starting. That's kickoff.
- Oh. Okay, come on.

790
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,333
Yep, she's up.

791
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,889
You did good, babe.

792
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,025
Thank you.

793
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,014
How's the Jell-O?
As good as Mom's?

794
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,349
Absolutely.

795
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,717
You're a terrible liar.

796
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,204
Mmm.

797
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,857
Hers was like magic.

798
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,876
You think she put a
secret ingredient in there?

799
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:49,195
I think<i> she</i> was the
secret ingredient.

800
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:57,820
It's funny, life.
You look right,

801
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,257
and suddenly
everything goes left.

802
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,662
Medical screwup.

803
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:08,732
She got so sick so fast.

804
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,770
I remember sitting at the
table that Thanksgiving.

805
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,474
We were about to say grace.

806
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,044
I felt her hand was so hot.

807
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,045
Suddenly she's shivering.

808
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:26,065
She's back in the
hospital, and she...

809
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:30,520
She never came home.

810
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,177
No wonder we hate Thanksgiving.

811
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,395
I don't know.

812
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,881
Maybe we can turn
this whole thing around.

813
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:44,329
You can, Nicky.

814
00:36:44,353 --> 00:36:45,735
You got Conrad.

815
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,054
So do you.

816
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:49,439
When he gets home, let's just...

817
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,423
Let's go to a restaurant,

818
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,427
eat a nice dinner, hang out.

819
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,231
I think I'm just gonna
walk this whole mess back.

820
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,751
You'd have been
just fine if I hadn't...

821
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,182
barged in here.

822
00:37:04,206 --> 00:37:06,555
- That's not true.
- You're sweet.

823
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,742
But I'm exhausted, and I...

824
00:37:08,777 --> 00:37:11,577
I think I'm gonna turn in early.

825
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,062
Are you sure, Dad?

826
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,680
Yes, I'm sure.

827
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:17,934
Thank you for sharing the
evening with me, sweetheart.

828
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:25,591
I love you.

829
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:42,074
Linda? Up his fentanyl to
75 micrograms per hour.

830
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:44,110
Course, Dr. Bell.

831
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,883
We need to talk.

832
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:53,219
Throughout the day, your tone...

833
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:55,233
I saved a man's life.
I also saved Chastain

834
00:37:55,257 --> 00:37:56,901
the embarrassment
of a bad outcome

835
00:37:56,925 --> 00:37:58,503
with a high-profile
patient. I think the words

836
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,877
you're looking for
are "thank you."

837
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,914
I'm not done talking to you.

838
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,434
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Kim.

839
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:12,833
- Mm-hmm.
- Good night, Pops.

840
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,991
All right.

841
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,609
Hey, yo.

842
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,479
You guys leaving already?

843
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:21,158
Party's just getting started.

844
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:23,115
Sorry, man, Cam's got a show.

845
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:24,445
Yeah. Thanks for
inviting us, though.

846
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,786
Safe drive and
happy Thanksgiving.

847
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:29,122
Wh-What time is the show?

848
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:31,090
- Huh?
- I mean, I just got here.

849
00:38:31,126 --> 00:38:32,642
I w-I was hoping we could,

850
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,488
you know, we could
hang out for a little bit.

851
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,140
You got time for
a beer, don't you?

852
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:37,808
Look, man, no
shade, but the thing is,

853
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:39,693
look, we've been here
for a minute already.

854
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,167
I can have a beer with you, AJ.

855
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:44,554
Look, I got back
as soon as I could.

856
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,106
My patient was a little
kid. He could've died.

857
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,320
Great, so you saved a
life. We ain't mad at you.

858
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,311
Seriously, we
know how this goes.

859
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:53,730
Our mom's a doctor. We
learned to make plans around it.

860
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:56,549
A happy work-life balance
is really what you need.

861
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,883
It's done wonders for Bonnie.

862
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,219
We're not quite at the place

863
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,898
where you get to
criticize me yet, okay?

864
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,906
Criticize? It was advice.

865
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,675
Advice is criticism in
a cashmere sweater.

866
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,244
You can keep both
to yourself indefinitely.

867
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,162
You sound just like your mother.

868
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,814
I was quoting Carol.

869
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,399
She says it all the time.

870
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,967
Bonnie says the same thing, too.

871
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:17,720
- Both wise women, no doubt.
- Hey,

872
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,650
you never back down
that easy with us.

873
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:21,891
I'm raising you. I
have to be the bad guy.

874
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,492
I have to say no.

875
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:24,822
Yeah, you might learn
how to stop saying it.

876
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:26,346
Be the good guy sometimes.

877
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:29,432
Maybe.

878
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:32,402
Well, if you two will come in

879
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:33,730
and have a drink
with your brother,

880
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:35,054
I'll lay off you two.

881
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:36,589
For tonight.

882
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,611
What you think, Cam?

883
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,229
It's your show.

884
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,739
I guess I got time for one beer.

885
00:39:52,774 --> 00:39:56,108
Oh, my boys coming
through for me.

886
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,412
Ah, proud dad right here.
And I'm getting the T-shirt.

887
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,042
You tell your
mother I said that.

888
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,893
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.

889
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,578
All right.

890
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,314
- Camron, thank you, man.
- No problem.

891
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,806
Oh, my. Lookee here.

892
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:18,765
Oh, August Jeremiah Austin,

893
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,316
you were a troublemaker.

894
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:21,879
Your mother's been
showing Bonnie

895
00:40:21,903 --> 00:40:23,486
your wall art phase.

896
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,615
Oh, and you didn't stop her?

897
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,316
Look at this
perfectly pudgy face

898
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,724
spreading peanut butter

899
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,253
- all over my brand-new
wallpaper. Oh!

900
00:40:29,277 --> 00:40:30,960
He looks so proud of his work.

901
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,229
He was even prouder
during his graffiti art phase

902
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,415
- when he was almost arrested.
- Hey.

903
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,562
You show me your tag,
and I'll show you mine.

904
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:39,886
I don't want to see
either of your tags.

905
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:41,098
Bonnie, I think

906
00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:43,066
we dodged a bullet
by not keeping him.

907
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,318
Lamar!

908
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,793
- What? It was a joke.
- Oh, he's right.

909
00:40:46,828 --> 00:40:49,078
- That was funny.
- It kind of was.

910
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,760
- Too soon, people.
- It was.

911
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:56,802
Too soon.

912
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,517
Hey.

913
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,536
Let me. It's been a long day.

914
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,088
- You should relax.
- No, it's good.

915
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:18,123
I'm almost done.

916
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:33,573
First holiday without Jessie.

917
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:40,680
You know, she was
such a slob in the kitchen.

918
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:44,617
Especially at Thanksgiving.

919
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:47,070
I mean, the worst.

920
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,049
And I was always
stuck cleaning up.

921
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,739
- Every time.
- Mm.

922
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:58,280
Maybe a bit too much.

923
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,387
I miss her so much.

924
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,529
I'm so sorry.

925
00:42:14,516 --> 00:42:17,516
I'm really glad you're home now.

926
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,932
<i>Can I help?</i>

927
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,362
- Sure.
- Girl-girls,

928
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,752
come on, be careful.

929
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,866
Nicky, why don't you go
help Mom in the kitchen.

930
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:43,042
- Okay.
- This is the best day, Daddy.

931
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:46,379
I love Thanksgiving,
and I love you.

932
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,938
<i>This is the best day, Daddy.</i>

933
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:58,357
<i>I love Thanksgiving,</i>

934
00:42:58,392 --> 00:43:00,392
<i>and I love you.</i>

935
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,916
I love Thanksgiving,
and I love you.
