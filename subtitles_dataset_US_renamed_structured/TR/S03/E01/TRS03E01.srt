00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,770
- I can't get the door.
- Let me-let me try, let me try.

181
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,505
Oh, it must have been
damaged in the explosion.

182
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,828
It's jammed shut.

183
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,358
Get out of the
building. There's a fire.

184
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,092
- The whole place could go up.
- We're not leaving you.

185
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,500
Is anyone else with you?

186
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,513
A woman and the boy,
both badly injured. Go back,

187
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,648
get somebody to
break down the door

188
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,016
- and then get out of here.
- Go! Go!

189
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,550
Nic, get out of here!

190
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,291
- Go.
- No.

191
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:44,342
Go!

192
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,361
Annie. Annie!

193
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,190
Annie. Can you
crawl to the door?

194
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:06,894
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Go. Go.

195
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:39,013
Conrad?!

196
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,933
Oh, my God.

197
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,687
Wake up.

198
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:49,273
You're okay.

199
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,292
We need some help over here!

200
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,867
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

201
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:02,031
Hey, hey. You're
safe. The fire's out.

202
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,056
There was a gas leak,
but they capped it off.

203
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,075
Where are Annie and Jonah?

204
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,954
They're both alive and
they're being treated now.

205
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,795
Dr. Hawkins, I'll strap you down

206
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,923
if I have to.

207
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:13,025
You were exposed
to a lot of smoke

208
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,043
and the blast may have
caused other injuries.

209
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,235
- You have any pain?
- All over.

210
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,583
He may have a fractured rib.

211
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,419
My left ankle's killing me.

212
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,127
It's really swollen.

213
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,382
Add it to the list of
imaging we need.

214
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,483
Okay.

215
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:40,825
- Pupils equal and reactive.
- Have we scared you off

216
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,628
- your first day?
- Are you kidding? I'm good.

217
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:46,164
Eloise, the ER is no place
for a triple transplant survivor.

218
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm gowned, gloved,
masked, safe as everyone else.

219
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,003
Please, let's focus
on the patient.

220
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:55,340
My neck... it hurts.

221
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,486
- We need to maintain
his C-spine.
- We got you, buddy.

222
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,522
I know it's hard. Try
not to move your head.

223
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,007
Airway intact. Breath
sounds clear bilaterally.

224
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,075
We should put him on high-flow
oxygen in case of possible

225
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,744
- carbon monoxide exposure.
- Good call.

226
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:06,579
Let's get him in a face
mask. Make sure to send

227
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,664
- a carboxyhemoglobin level.
- Eloise, help me out.

228
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,088
- How's he looking?
- Minor injuries and burns.

229
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,191
But I'm concerned
about his C-spine.

230
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:20,848
Jonah, can you
squeeze my finger?

231
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,455
Possible spinal cord injury.

232
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,541
Let's get him to CT now.

233
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,376
All right. Let's go.

234
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:38,850
BP 60/40, tachy in the 140s.

235
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,386
- She's crashing.
- Bolus a liter LR

236
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,532
and get blood
ready for transfusion.

237
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:43,888
No breath sounds on the left.

238
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,952
- Trachea deviated on the right.
- Tension pneumo.

239
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,003
The shrapnel must've
pierced her lung.

240
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,621
- Chest tube kit.
- No time.

241
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:50,995
Scalpel.

242
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,416
Sats are coming up,

243
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,135
but her pressure's
still tanking.

244
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,910
Irving, chest tube.
Okafor, ultrasound.

245
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:15,887
Abdomen is filled with fluid.

246
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,082
- She's hemorrhaging.
- Damn shrapnel.

247
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,556
She's not stable for CT.

248
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,458
Let's take her to OR. Now.

249
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,448
- Where are you taking her?
- OR Two.

250
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,271
Hey, can you finish this?

251
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,690
Thanks.

252
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:38,693
Nic.

253
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:40,339
What the hell...
Are you all right?

254
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,513
- I'm fine.
- What about Conrad?

255
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,199
He's banged up pretty
bad, but he'll be okay.

256
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:46,728
Thank God. The other
two weren't so lucky.

257
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,068
What can I do to help?

258
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,016
Nothing. Just go
home. Take the keys.

259
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,550
- Nic, come on. Hey.
- I'm gonna stay with him.

260
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,908
Nic, Nic. Nic.

261
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,557
Shrapnel everywhere.

262
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:00,564
This woman has
saved a lot of lives.

263
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,266
It's time we save hers.

264
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,251
I'll take the chest.

265
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:05,752
You got the abdomen.

266
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:06,754
Here, sit down.

267
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:09,156
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,898
I did triathlons with Annie.

269
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,785
I saw her once give up the lead
in a race just to help someone

270
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,470
who took a fall.

271
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,385
That's Annie.

272
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:29,309
Does she have any family
that we need to notify?

273
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,311
I'm not sure.

274
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,829
I know she got a divorce.

275
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,263
And then, not long after that,

276
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,633
her son died in a car accident.

277
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,270
God, that's awful.

278
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,235
<i>Just ran the bowel.</i>

279
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,325
No obvious injuries.

280
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,761
Shrapnel by the abdominal wall.

281
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:49,096
Well, I took out three
from the chest wall.

282
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:52,283
The last one I see is there.

283
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,112
Lodged into the aortic arch and
abutting the pulmonary artery.

284
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:55,319
Of course.

285
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,199
We pull this out,
she might blow.

286
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,834
She might blow if
we don't pull it out.

287
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,753
Well, she won't, because
you know what to do, right?

288
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:01,993
Yes, I do.

289
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:05,697
I'll clamp the proximal
and distal aorta

290
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,950
and control the PA with
vessel loop, just in case.

291
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,953
Nice job. And pull on three.

292
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:14,021
One, two,

293
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,924
three.

294
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,556
Pressure's dropping fast.

295
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,108
All right, we got this, Chu.

296
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:23,363
Just buy us some more time.

297
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,932
We're maxed on pressors.

298
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,891
All right.

299
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,527
We are... done.

300
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,198
Look at that.

301
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,462
Pressure's coming back.

302
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,953
Of course it is.

303
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:47,355
I love this game.

304
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,790
Wonder Twins do it again.

305
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:51,369
5-0 Prolene.

306
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,172
Hey, what's going on?

307
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:55,145
I'm, uh...

308
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,226
faking a fainting spell
to get your attention.

309
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,816
Come on, lie down.

310
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,363
Careful.

311
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,481
I told you it was too
soon to get off that gurney.

312
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:03,866
I just...

313
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,806
I just need some fluids.

314
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:07,069
- I'm light-headed.
- Okay.

315
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,260
- I'll get you an IV.
- No, don't.

316
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:13,564
Stay with me.

317
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,534
Okay.

318
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,128
When I saw you lying
on the ground I thought...

319
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,750
I was so scared.

320
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,887
I'm not going anywhere.

321
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,891
You're stuck with me.

322
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:47,515
I love you.

323
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,767
I love you, too.

324
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:59,076
I've only seen this one time
before in my entire career.

325
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,612
Occipital-cervical dislocation.

326
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:02,814
What does that mean?

327
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,710
Internal decapitation.

328
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:08,119
It's when the spinal column is
separated from the skull base.

329
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,832
The blast from the explosion
must have done this.

330
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,340
Well, the patient
you saw before...

331
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,209
did they make it?

332
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:16,443
No.

333
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:17,844
Most don't.

334
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,965
Let's get him to the OR.

335
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,245
SSEPs and MEPs on.

336
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,248
Fusing C1 and C2.

337
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,652
Blast.

338
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,155
<i>Again.</i>

339
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,475
It's the cord.

340
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,828
Gonna have to perform
a laminectomy to give

341
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,330
the cord more room, then fuse.

342
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,082
Doesn't that mean he
could end up a quadriplegic?

343
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:57,367
Not if I can help it. Rongeurs.

344
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,338
What are you still doing here?

345
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,017
You're supposed to
be meeting Dr. Cain.

346
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,175
Two of today's
patients are still critical.

347
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,093
And they're being taken care of.

348
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,544
You're not needed here.

349
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,533
Dr. Cain is not a
man you keep waiting.

350
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,686
Do you know how much he bills?

351
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:16,671
Uh...

352
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:19,356
$80 million a year.

353
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:21,542
80...

354
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,809
million.

355
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,863
I want you to focus
on that number.

356
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,296
Got it. Oh!

357
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,120
Oh.

358
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:36,657
Kit Voss just reattached
that boy's head.

359
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:39,710
If she'd been off by a
fraction of a millimeter,

360
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,706
an eight-year-old would
be paralyzed for life.

361
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,963
Or dead.

362
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:45,533
Dr. Voss bills
two million a year.

363
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:46,700
Cain is our future.

364
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,452
Voss is our past.

365
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:52,389
I can't guarantee her
contract will be renewed.

366
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,210
What we need

367
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:59,262
is more doctors like that.

368
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,483
♪ <i>I pray</i> ♪

369
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,520
♪ <i>I pray it's not too late...</i> ♪

370
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,323
Ah.

371
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:11,258
Thank you.

372
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,952

373
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,836
♪ <i>You know I love it</i> ♪

374
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:24,271
Dr. Cain.

375
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,908
- Call me Barrett.
- Randolph.

376
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:30,678
It's an interesting
hobby you got here.

377
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:33,359
Yeah, it's outsider
art, all from Georgia.

378
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:35,532
Wherever I live, I
try to immerse myself

379
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,029
in the local culture.

380
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,687
Can I get you both
some champagne?

381
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:40,755
No.

382
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,606
That would be lovely.

383
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,425
Yes, please do.

384
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,530
Are we the only ones here?

385
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:52,215
- Show's not open yet.
- Oh.

386
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,112
They offered me a
preview. I don't know...

387
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:55,597
Probably thought I
was more likely to buy

388
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,954
if I had first pick.

389
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,155
They were right.

390
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,808
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

391
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,438
We had a bit of an
emergency this morning.

392
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,139
Yeah, I heard
about that. Is it true

393
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,748
that the proton beam
therapy facility is a total loss?

394
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:09,834
Yeah.

395
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,335
$220 million
investment destroyed.

396
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,770
If I didn't know better,

397
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,451
I'd think Red Rock
blew it up themselves.

398
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,308
I was thinking the
same exact thing.

399
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,312
Proton beam therapy facilities...
They lose millions annually.

400
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,230
Well, when Chastain built it,

401
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:26,578
they had profit projections
way north of reality.

402
00:21:26,602 --> 00:21:28,102
How far north?

403
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:30,416
The arctic circle.

404
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,857
And now Red Rock walks
away with a big insurance payout.

405
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,661
Where I grew up, they
call that insure and burn.

406
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,612
Or a stroke of good luck.

407
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:42,182
Except, of course, for the
two people who nearly died.

408
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:49,840
See anything that
tempts you, Dr. Cain?

409
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,893
Most definitely.

410
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,645
I'll take that one.

411
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,181
Great choice.

412
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,683
I'll get the paperwork going.

413
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,219
This is gonna double
its value in five years.

414
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,556
And if it doesn't,
is it still art?

415
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:08,109
Oh, it will. It will.

416
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:10,477
Lunch at the Provence Grill?

417
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:14,948
- On Red Rock Mountain Medical.
- Oh, well, in that case,

418
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:17,484
I'll have the oysters
and... more champagne.

419
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,612
Thank you.

420
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:34,685
I want to go check on Annie.

421
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,387
Okay, let's go.

422
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:39,723
Uh, Mina wants to talk to you.

423
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,093
I'll be fine. I won't
do anything crazy.

424
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,696
I'll come find you.

425
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:55,356
How's he doing?

426
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:58,275
The ankle's gonna be
an issue for a while, but...

427
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,762
I'm just so glad he's okay.

428
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,781
Mm.

429
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,817
And how are you?

430
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:10,404
We've all been worried.

431
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,391
You're probably the
one person I know

432
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,410
who understands how I feel.

433
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,384
Does it ever get any easier?

434
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:28,238
I wish I could
promise you it would.

435
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,263
Walk with me.

436
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,443
When my sisters died,

437
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:52,612
I could hardly get out
of bed for two years.

438
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,665
I do not want that
to happen to you.

439
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,936
Every day, I wake up,

440
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,132
and the first thing I
think is she's not here.

441
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,460
And she's never
gonna be here again.

442
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,676
It's like there's a
hole in your heart

443
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,098
that you'll never fill.

444
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,940
My whole life, I had one job.

445
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:21,192
Take care of Jessie.

446
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:23,477
Okay, that was
not your only job.

447
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:25,362
You take care of so many people.

448
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,865
I know, I know. My
patients need me.

449
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,349
No, I was not gonna say that.

450
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,102
What I was gonna
say is that you...

451
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,071
you need your patients.

452
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:38,209
Work, Nic,

453
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,744
is the only way out of grief.

454
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:47,801
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

455
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:49,820
See the mother and child?

456
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,558
Think something's wrong.

457
00:24:55,678 --> 00:24:57,372
- Hey.
- I know.

458
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,346
- You okay?
- Um...

459
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:02,399
It's my baby. She's been
sick, coughing and wheezing.

460
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:04,146
Well, let's get her
in to see a doctor.

461
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,797
No. The last time
I went into an ER,

462
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:07,454
it cost me $6,000.

463
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:08,917
The hospital sued
me when I couldn't pay,

464
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,235
and now they're docking
it from my paycheck.

465
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,836
We can't live off
what we have left.

466
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,210
I came here to have her seen

467
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,572
in the free clinic,
but it was closed.

468
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,095
That's horrible.

469
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,701
So I've been waiting out here,
hoping Diana would get better.

470
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,339
She's wheezing badly. We
need to get her in there now.

471
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,974
Oh, it's okay.

472
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:28,729
- Come on.
- Come on.

473
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,764
Surgery was successful.

474
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,233
We're certain we
got all the shrapnel.

475
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,017
How do you feel?

476
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,837
Like I just got split in half.

477
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,221
How are you doing?

478
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:44,107
That's typical Annie Diamonte.

479
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,687
Worried about
everybody but yourself.

480
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,278
I got a few bruises.

481
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:51,398
Small fracture of an ankle bone,
but it won't even need surgery.

482
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,567
We should stop talking.

483
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,203
You need your rest.

484
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:59,206
In the injury Olympics,
you solidly got me beat.

485
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,127
When can I go home,

486
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:06,212
Dr. Hawkins, do you think?

487
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:09,433
I'd rather not stay here
any longer than I have to.

488
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:14,504
What... like, what,
a week or two?

489
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:23,197
Temperature's 102.5.

490
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,395
- Sats are back up in the 90s.
- Is she okay?

491
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,885
She has bilateral wheezes

492
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,066
and is using accessory
muscles. Likely an infection.

493
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,973
Labs are back. Viral
swab is positive for RSV.

494
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,326
Everyone put on a mask and gown.

495
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,723
Eloise,

496
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:39,930
RSV is extremely dangerous

497
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,343
for people who have
had a lung transplant.

498
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,562
I'm aware. I'm gloved.
I'm gowned. I have a mask.

499
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:45,397
Can you all please
stop coddling me

500
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:46,948
and treat me like
any other sub-I?

501
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,500
No, because you
aren't any other sub-I.

502
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,407
This has gone on long enough.

503
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,292
Please leave.

504
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,077
Now.

505
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,624
Dr. Feldman's right.

506
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:57,964
I'll come find you
when I'm done here.

507
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:05,238
Right lower lobe infiltrate,
and her white blood cell count

508
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:06,852
and procalcitonin
are up. I'm afraid

509
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,503
she might have developed
a bacterial pneumonia.

510
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,321
Oh, God, I'm so
sorry. What did I do?

511
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:11,506
Even with continuous nebs,

512
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,174
her respiratory rate
is still in the 40s.

513
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,526
We might need to
intubate. Let's get her

514
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,616
on IV ceftriaxone and azithro,

515
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,313
and let's get her
to the PICU now.

516
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,853
What?

517
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:27,761
So, it looks like RSV plus
a bacterial pneumonia.

518
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:30,180
Probably strep, if I were
to put my money on it.

519
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,110
The most common
bacterial pathogen

520
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:33,445
- in children her age.
- Not bad.

521
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:35,135
You know your stuff.

522
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,654
My expertise in
infection control

523
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,623
is only surpassed by my
encyclopedic knowledge

524
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,876
- of lung disease.
- Cystic fibrosis will do that.

525
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,512
Sure will.

526
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,649
Some of your antirejection
meds will cause that tremor.

527
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,167
Goes away over time.

528
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,237
Shouldn't be a
problem by intern year.

529
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,340
Look, I'm sorry that Dr. Feldman
was harsh back there,

530
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,137
but it is our job
to keep you safe.

531
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:01,344
This is my body and my life.

532
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,414
I'm not anybody's
kid to protect.

533
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:06,033
Safety isn't my main priority.

534
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:08,352
I go white water rafting
every chance I get.

535
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,870
I even go skydiving.

536
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,171
You're not scared?

537
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:12,723
Course I'm scared.

538
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,258
Every time I cough, I
think about rejection.

539
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:18,328
But I want to live,
and that means risk.

540
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,564
What you all need to remember is

541
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,733
I'm a doctor in training
now, not your patient.

542
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,425
I couldn't understand what
was going on in the ER.

543
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,732
What's wrong?

544
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,461
I promise you
she's in great hands.

545
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,346
She has RSV and
bacterial pneumonia.

546
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,704
She needs oxygen, antibiotics

547
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:48,124
- and fluids.
- I can't believe
I let it get this bad.

548
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,038
- If only I...
- It's not your fault.

549
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,929
You were put in an
impossible situation.

550
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,215
The system is broken.

551
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,051
Yeah.

552
00:28:58,086 --> 00:28:59,447
- You the mom?
- Yeah.

553
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,771
You can come in now.

554
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,405
She's doing better.

555
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,140
Thank you.

556
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:13,366
Hmm. If the clinic
were still open,

557
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:14,912
we could have
treated her daughter

558
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:17,270
with antibiotics and
avoided all of this.

559
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:18,872
Red Rock cut the funding.

560
00:29:18,908 --> 00:29:20,502
You can't run a
clinic without money.

561
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:24,177
Mm-hmm. But if you came
back, we could find the money.

562
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:27,246
One way or another.

563
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:29,466
I can't do it alone,

564
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:33,103
but we can together, Nic.

565
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:40,643
Yeah, it's palinopsia.

566
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,306
She's continuing
to see something

567
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,813
after it's no longer there.

568
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,766
Very common after head trauma.

569
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,573
Don't tell me we got
this woman through a fire,

570
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:55,025
an explosion and a
life-threatening injury

571
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,100

has a brain tumor.

Annie has a brain tumor?

575
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:28,642
I'm so sorry.

576
00:30:28,677 --> 00:30:30,109
How bad is it?

577
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:33,813
Well, she has a
posterior cortical lesion,

578
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,116
a small hemorrhagic
component and edema.

579
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:38,335
That accounts for
her new symptoms.

580
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,003
No signs of cancer
anywhere else. Yet.

581
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,406
So it might not be metastatic.

582
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,037
The radiologist
couldn't be certain.

583
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,028
We need to see
the pathology report.

584
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:49,395
Cain is certain he can remove

585
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,393
- all of it.
- What? He can't know that

Send that to
pathology. Close it up.

627
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,304
- Cain did that
in under five minutes.
- Yeah, but

628
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:03,479
can we be sure he got
it all and left her intact?

629
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,249
Haste usually isn't
a virtue in surgery.

630
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,002
Especially on the brain.

631
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,471
He's trusting a resident

632
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:13,539
he's never met to
close, unsupervised.

633
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,176
I wonder if he even cares
about the pathology report.

634
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,878
His job is done, guys.

635
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:33,043
Is that thing in my head?

636
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:35,473
You know none of this would've
happened if you hadn't run away

637
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:37,797
from me in the ER in
the first place, right?

638
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:41,251
You have to promise me you
will never do that again, okay?

639
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,153
This is a bummer.

640
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,490
I know, but the good news
is you'll make a full recovery

641
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,891
and be as good as new.

642
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,710
Thanks to Dr. Voss.

643
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:52,144
Thank you so much.

644
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,514
Oh. You're welcome.

645
00:33:56,218 --> 00:33:57,767
That was fine work.

646
00:33:57,803 --> 00:34:00,498
I fully admit I live
for days like this.

647
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:01,921
It's why I love my job.

648
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:07,276
So Dr. Cain is throwing a
private party this Saturday.

649
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:08,611
I heard.

650
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,363
Just for our top doctors.

651
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:11,715
How lovely for you all.

652
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,027
- You're invited.
- No, I'm not.

653
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,417
I'm inviting you now.

654
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,297
I want you to meet Cain
and get to know him.

655
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,171
Do you like him?

656
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,617
He's impressive by any measure.
So far, I like him very much.

657
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:23,326
I just... I want him beside
me as your advocate.

658
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:26,963
I need an advocate?

659
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,918
Yes.

660
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:33,686
Because I don't bill enough.

661
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:35,700
If... It doesn't matter
what the reason is.

662
00:34:35,724 --> 00:34:38,424
I know your value as a
doctor and as a friend.

663
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,104
And your place at Chastain
will always be secure

664
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:41,744
as long as I'm CEO.

665
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,347
I would just like you to
have this man as an ally.

666
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,671
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

667
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,564
Looking very distinguished
with your cane.

668
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,766
Thank you.

669
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,135
Small consolation
on a rough day.

670
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,972
What did Annie's
pathology report say?

671
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:11,323
It's melanoma.

672
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,074
Which means Annie
probably has Stage IV cancer.

673
00:35:16,098 --> 00:35:17,898
God, I'm so sorry.

674
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:21,818
Not exactly one
for the win column.

675
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,520
Cain already broke the news

676
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,522
that she has a
terminal diagnosis.

677
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,858
I'll at least give the
guy credit for doing that.

678
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,443
Annie.

679
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:34,147
Mm-hmm.

680
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:36,917
It is so good to see you.

681
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:38,595
This is Nic Nevin.
She's been with me,

682
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:40,820
following your case
throughout the day.

683
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:42,683
I just wanted to say
thank you so much

684
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,686
for everything you
did during the fire.

685
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,344
Oh, it's nothing that you
wouldn't have done in my place.

686
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,546
Is there anything that
we can do for you?

687
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:52,382
How are your spirits?
That's what we want to know.

688
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,934
It's crazy, but my
spirits are really good.

689
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:56,970
You know, after
talking to Dr. Cain,

690
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:00,273
I feel like the luckiest
unlucky person ever.

691
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:02,475
- What did he say?
- Well, he said if I hadn't

692
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,660
have been in the
basement and gotten injured,

693
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:08,264
it's possible they might not
have caught my cancer in time.

694
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,519
What did Dr. Cain say
about what's ahead?

695
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:16,889
Well, if this was
a few years ago,

696
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,659
he would've been
arranging hospice care.

697
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:23,046
But today, with all the
drugs for melanoma,

698
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,331
I could be around
for decades to come.

699
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:28,634
That's true. Immunotherapy has
had great success with melanoma,

700
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,231
and they're always
coming out with new things.

701
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:33,173
And Dr. Cain said I
just need to be positive.

702
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,725
- Fight through it, right?
- Right.

703
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,978
I don't want to
think about death

any more than I already have.

705
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,185
Conrad told me
you lost your son.

706
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,403
I'm very sorry.

707
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,521
Yeah.

708
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,545
That's when I stopped racing.

709
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:59,265
I see it was a big mistake now.

710
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,368
Y-You can't stop
living your life

711
00:37:01,403 --> 00:37:04,787
just 'cause someone
you love has lost theirs.

712
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,789
You got to remember
the good times.

713
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,527
Get rid of the bad
times and go on.

714
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,529
I'm gonna compete
again real soon.

715
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,032
I'm just gonna fight to get well

716
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,367
and fight through the chemo.

717
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,564
And you know who's gonna
be with me right through it?

718
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:22,606
My son.

719
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:26,092
Because, you see, he...

720
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:28,778
he never really left me.

721
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,814
He just came to live here,

722
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,150

we'll accommodate when possible,

742
00:38:17,145 --> 00:38:19,412

with it to survive.

I would like you to meet our
very best orthopedic surgeon

745
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:26,703
and my good
friend, Dr. Kit Voss.

746
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,521
I'm glad to finally meet you.

747
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,317
What you pulled
off... Saving a child

748
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,053
who suffered an
internal decapitation...

749
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:35,361
- That was miraculous.
- Oh, thank you.

750
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,630
Flattery will get
you everywhere...

A word, Randolph.

753
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,836
- When you get a minute.
- Absolutely.

754
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,510
Pleasure.

755
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,865
Why'd you do that?

756
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,485
W-What is the point
of alienating the man?

757
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:02,372
What is the point of making
nice when I know who he is?

758
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,051
I am still trying
to wrap my head

759
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,669
around the fact that
you hired someone

760
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:07,721
who so obviously has
an ego the size of Texas.

761
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,507
I... Red Rock Mountain
Medical hired him,

762
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:11,247
and I understand why they did.

763
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,583
Health care is a
business. I'm a realist.

764
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,262
This is what's happening
from coast to coast.

765
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:18,138
They're recruiting guys
like Cain. It's everywhere.

766
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:20,167
And doctors like me,
who put our patients first,

767
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,736
- are collateral damage.
- No.

768
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,655
- I'll start interviewing
elsewhere immediately.
- No. K-Kit.

769
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:26,930
- Please, don't. Don't.
- I'm sorry.

770
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,265
But I don't belong here.

771
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,619
I see your, uh,
your companion left.

772
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:41,444
- Yeah.
- You know what, I don't want you

773
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,229
to spend this evening alone.

774
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:45,365
See that young lady right there?

775
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,338
I can introduce you.

776
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:54,402
I'm telling you,
Randolph, stick with me

777
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:56,209
and we'll rise together.

778
