00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:03,786
<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

2
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:05,965
Facing our new reality, the
Cain Center for Neurosurgery.

3
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:08,135
- There's good news.
- My cancer's in remission.

4
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:10,475
I have a shot at
getting my life back.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,422
<i>Dr. Torres here is a
magician in the OR.</i>

6
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,507
<i>Go be one of those
celebrity TV doctors,</i>

7
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,860
<i>make a lot of money, wear
nice clothes. You'd be great at it.</i>

8
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,028
<i>Three different patients.</i>

9
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,245
<i>All with organophosphate
poisoning,</i>

10
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,636
<i>all on 3B Life.</i>

11
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:22,866
The only link that we do
have is your supplement.

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,402
- We need to call public health
and warn them about it.
- That's ridiculously premature.

13
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,169
But if we wait,
people could die.

14
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,895
- Dr. Hawkins, welcome back.
- Nice to be back.

15
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,408
Leaving me out of
the loop on Hawkins

16
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,243
is a sign of disrespect
to the surgeon

17
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,917
who's made more rain for you
and Red Rock than anyone else.

18
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:39,287
Not as much as you used to.
Everyone has an expiration date.

19
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,109
Good morning, everyone.

20
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,106
Today, we open up
the doors to the most

21
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,781
advanced neurological
institute this country's ever seen.

22
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,403
Or at least the most expensive.

23
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,433
Red Rocks stands to
make $1 million a day

24
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:57,772
on surgeries alone.

25
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,091
No wonder they were so
quick to open this place.

26
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,554
- Hey.
- Hey.

27
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:02,628
You hungry?

28
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,679
I'm not here to eat,
I'm here to work.

29
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:07,281
Red Rock packed in so many
patients, they need more nurses.

30
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,417
I've got a bad feeling
about this place.

31
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,404
I'd like to extend a warm
welcome to all of our donors

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,917
I see out here today.
It's your investment

33
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,975
in the future that's made
this institute possible.

34
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,238
Well, if it makes you feel any
better, today's my admin day,

35
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:22,147
so I'm stuck on desk duty.

36
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,150
- All papers, no patients.
- Well, you know what they say,

37
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,370
"With great power, comes
boring responsibilities."

38
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:29,649
You have an office,

39
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,256
Chief Resident. I have no pity.

40
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,153
You have no idea how
bad I am at scheduling.

41
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,610
Please, come help me.

42
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:36,427
- Nope.
- Out.

43
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,480
The brain is the
new frontier for us.

44
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,399
Treatment and diagnosis...

45
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,396
I feel like I'm sending
you off to the wolves.

46
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,986
I'll be fine.

47
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,122
It's the wolves I'm
worried about, not you.

48
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:50,124
It's gonna be thrilling,

49
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,637
- but most importantly...
- Hey.

50
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,139
It's gonna be groundbreaking.

51
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,595
Go get 'em.

52
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,292
Thank you all for
being here today.

53
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,784
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I have to go scrub in.

54
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,861
Is it me or is it cold in here?

55
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,458
Yeah, I already
called maintenance.

56
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:13,143
They said it should
be warming up soon.

57
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,627
Anyone know where
the butterfly needles are?

58
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:16,479
I think I saw them
in the supply closet.

59
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,087
- Top shelf, far right.
- Ah.

60
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:20,967
Sorry. I'm still getting
the hang of this new

61
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:23,108
EMR software. It hates me.

62
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,093
I gave up and
faxed in a request.

63
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,806
- Faxed?
- Girl's got to do.

64
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,250
Um, I'll be right back.

65
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,670
Annie.

66
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:38,774
Nic. Oh, no, don't worry,

67
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm not a patient. Still
cancer-free, thankfully.

68
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,778
I'm here with Lucy.

69
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,864
Lucy, this is Nurse Nevin.

70
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,710
She helped me
through my own surgery.

71
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,962
- Hi.
- Hi.

72
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:50,702
It's nice to meet you.

73
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,582
I started fostering
a few months ago.

74
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,467
Thought about doing
it for years, but I guess

75
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,536
cancer was the kick in
the pants that I needed.

76
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh, that's amazing.
What brings you in?

77
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:00,695
Headaches, throwing up,

78
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:03,164
tingly feet... Should
I keep going?

79
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,050
The doctors found a brain tumor

80
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,896
a little over a year
before I met Lucy.

81
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,648
Because of the
size and the location,

82
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,867
they said that a watch
and wait approach was best

83
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,074
- until it got worse.
- Which it did.

84
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,587
A few days ago,

85
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,994
Lucy fainted in the cafeteria
at school during lunch.

86
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,765
I took out half of the
salad bar on my way down.

87
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,499
My hair still smells like ranch.

88
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,768
But they did an MRI,
and now we're just waiting

89
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,837
to hear back on
the surgical plan.

90
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,506
Well, it says here, uh,
that she's scheduled

91
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,925
for a tumor resection
this afternoon

92
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,012
with... Dr. Cain.

93
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,392
Of course.

94
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,676
The surgeon who saved
me operating on my little girl

95
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,118
in this amazing new hospital.

96
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,970
I'm really glad
she's in good hands.

97
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,309
Why don't I join
Lucy's team today?

98
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,609
- Yeah, we'd love that.
- Yeah.

99
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,633
Great. Me, too.

100
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:59,620
♪ ♪

101
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,310
I'm looking forward to operating
with you again, Dr. Okafor.

102
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,819
First, we need to get in
and out of this patient's room

103
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,554
- as quickly as possible.
- I prefer to take my time.

104
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,217
Really get to know a
patient before surgery.

105
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,936
Where they're
from, what they do.

106
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,588
- Clearly he hasn't met them yet.
- Nope.

107
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,272
Enough!

108
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,924
The entire hospital
can hear you.

109
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:27,799
Would you give it a rest?

110
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,919
Professor, this is Dr. Torres.
He'll be joining our team.

111
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:32,164
It's a pleasure to meet...

112
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,141
Listen. All day he crunches,

113
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:38,176
piles up his dirty clothes,

114
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,829
orders take-out food at all
hours to stink up my room.

115
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,498
- Our room.
- Oh, now you can hear me?

116
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,944
They both have end
stage heart failure,

117
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:46,684
and they both need a heart.

118
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,272
Same blood type, heart size,
and immune system compatibility.

119
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:51,918
But that's all they
have in common.

120
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:54,642
My side, my rules.

121
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:55,994
Hey, check it out.

122
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,347
I just finished this one.
It's part of my series.

123
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,116
I call it,

124
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:03,001
"Angry Little Man Who

125
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,014
Definitely Needs to Chill."

126
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,339
- Nice.
- I'm an artist.

127
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,135
Yeah, if no one
pays you, it's a hobby.

128
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:10,803
Oh, come on, Professor.

129
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,355
Real artists don't
do it for the cash,

130
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,273
they do it to help
show people the truth.

131
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,931
Hey, that's right. I
make art to move people.

132
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:19,767
Why don't you find yourself
moving to a different room?

133
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:22,603
I swear, if I have to spend
another day in here...

134
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,139
You don't. We're here
because a donor heart

135
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:26,491
is on its way from Savannah.

136
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,887
And since you're
top of the list,

137
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,722
we've got you scheduled
for surgery later today.

138
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,380
Thank God.

139
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,149
I was worried that
if I died in here,

140
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,463
that kid's face would be
the last thing I ever saw.

141
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:38,703
You should be so lucky.

142
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,011
Thank you for having me on.

143
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,413
Don't thank me.

144
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,315
Your publicist called
in a favor at network.

145
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,862
And we're back

146
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:56,421
in five, four, three...

147
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,477
Anyone tired? Want more energy?

148
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:04,195
Yes!

149
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,048
Yes, of course you do.
Well, my next guest says that

150
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,851
his new supplement might
be just the thing for you.

151
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,571
Dr. Bell, there are a lot
of supplements out there.

152
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,274
What makes 3B Life different?

153
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,843
3B Life is a proprietary
blend of nutrients

154
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,163
designed to fortify
your whole body.

155
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:23,615
- I take it myself every day.
- I figured you did,

156
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,251
or you wouldn't have
put your face on the bottle.

157
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,188
Yeah, uh...

158
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,425
You know, I've worked
in hospitals for 40 years,

159
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,276
and I'm sorry to say,

160
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:39,046
we are unhealthier
today than ever before.

161
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:41,516
Half of all Americans
are uninsured.

162
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,612
And, you know, I remember
a young man came in

163
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,465
with liver failure, and
he was uninsured,

164
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,416
and couldn't afford
a doctor's visit,

165
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,808
so there was nobody
there to tell him

166
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,637
that his disease could
be easily managed

167
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,711
with lifestyle and
diet, and by the time

168
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,148
he came in...

169
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,951
It's too late.

170
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,564
Yeah, and I see so
many patients like that.

171
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,922
People that want to take
control of their own health,

172
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,942
but they... they
just don't know how.

173
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:10,545
And they don't know
who to trust. And that's...

174
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,947
that's why my
face is on the bottle.

175
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,608
Hello?

176
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:27,929
You were great.
Very real. Very human.

177
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:31,433
Regina.

178
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,417
You all right?

179
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:39,841
Remember the patients
from Atlanta General

180
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,792
with organophosphate poisoning?

181
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,112
The ones that may
have taken 3B Life?

182
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:46,464
Why?

183
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,202
One of them just died.

184
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,703
- This is not our fault.
- I need you to both relax.

185
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,300
Well, you didn't just
go on national television

186
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:55,690
and tell two million people

187
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,720
that 3B Life is the best
thing since penicillin.

188
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,371
Okay, you don't actually
think that our product

189
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,596
caused a man's death?

190
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:03,693
No. I don't want to believe
that we're responsible

191
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,267
any more than you do.

192
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:07,363
What happened has
nothing to do with our product.

193
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,182
We tested our
facility. It's clean.

194
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,834
- Our ingredients are safe.
- I know.

195
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,189
I know they are.

196
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,859
I'm just gonna see if I can
get the man's records sent over

197
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,289
from Atlanta General
just to confirm

198
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:18,446
whether or not he
was even taking 3B.

199
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:20,376
Social media's blowing up
about your Pierce appearance.

200
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,818
Mentions on Facebook
are strong. Twitter, same.

201
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,453
Even the trolls like you.

202
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:28,306
So you can expect
a surge in sales.

203
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,491
No, no. Let's just
delay shipments...

204
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,472
Stopping shipments could
make people ask questions.

205
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:35,847
Well, that's a chance we have
to take. I... We have to exercise

206
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,299
an overabundance of caution

207
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:38,799
on the small possibility

208
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:40,346
that we may have
injured someone.

209
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,981
I am sorry a man died,

210
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:44,305
but it could've been
an allergic reaction,

211
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,690
or an underlying condition.

212
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,270
Who knows, maybe
it was just his time.

213
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,438
Well, maybe isn't good enough.

214
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,746
I need to check on the others.

215
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,450
- Others?
- Let's just get back
to Chastain.

216
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:04,192
Hey! I saw you
on TV this morning.

217
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,029
You make us proud, Dr. B.

218
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,921
I'll catch up with you
in a couple minutes.

219
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,357
<i>How'd you get his
medical records?</i>

220
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:26,080
A friend at Atlanta General.

221
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,282
The autopsy will
happen later today.

222
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,302
30-year-old male. Diagnosed
with organophosphate poisoning.

223
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,855
Treated with atropine, 2-PAM.

224
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,791
Full recovery,
until this morning.

225
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,305
Yeah, he was about
to be discharged,

226
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,923
they found him
in cardiac arrest.

227
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,447
- And what am I looking for?
- Anything unusual,

228
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,467
an allergic reaction,
some underlying condition

229
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,052
that might've caused his death.

230
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,488
You mean something
other than your supplement?

231
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,274
Look, I've reviewed
all their files looking for

232
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,309
any another possible cause.

233
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,912
I just, I'd like you to
re-examine all three.

234
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,632
Dr. Pravesh already did
a very thorough workup,

235
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,134
- detailed history...
- You have a way of

236
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,153
seeing what other doctors miss.

237
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,483
Just take another look,
that's all I'm asking you to do.

238
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:11,759
If I found out it's 3B Life,
you know I won't keep quiet.

239
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:14,028
I need to know.

240
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:18,532
Let's just try and make
sure nobody else dies.

241
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,756
I'll be awake for the surgery?

242
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,159
Your brain tumor is
near your speech center.

243
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,011
Being awake allows me to
avoid the brain tissue which is

244
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,458
critical to your
ability to speak.

245
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:35,950
But you'll be able to talk
and see what's going on.

246
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,835
- Will it hurt?
- No.

247
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,287
You won't feel a thing.

248
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:40,933
There are no pain
receptors in your brain.

249
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:42,006
Well, that's good.

250
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,374
What if I have to sneeze?

251
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,559
Then we'll get you a tissue.

252
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:48,624
Now, I'd like to
be there with her.

253
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,549
I'm sorry. There are no
family members allowed.

254
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,201
But you'll be there, right?

255
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,485
Absolutely.

256
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,141
I'm sure we can
arrange something.

257
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,839
I can't believe my new heart
is actually in the building.

258
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,791
Your long wait is over.

259
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:18,303
We've seen your heart,
and it looks perfect.

260
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:20,745
Oh, thank you.

261
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,297
You're a little warm.

262
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:25,549
Ah, I feel fine. It's
probably just excitement.

263
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,985
Yeah. Probably.

264
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,061
We'll check back on
you soon, all right?

265
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,142
<i>The professor's
temp is 100.1 now.</i>

266
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:36,088
If it reaches 100.4,
we'll have to temporarily

267
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,740
take him off the
transplant list.

268
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,746
All right. Get two cultures

269
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,109
and start him on
empiric antibiotics.

270
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,328
- I don't want to take a chance.
- It could just be a bad reaction

271
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:43,901
to one of the medications.

272
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,270
Maybe. But we need to
keep a close eye on him

273
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,056
over the next few hours.

274
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:49,657
Hey.

275
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,520
- Hey.
- Sorry, am I interrupting?

276
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,078
Not at all. We just finished.

277
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,598
Okay, tonight I am
drinking all the drinks.

278
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,002
Oh. What's wrong?

279
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:02,887
What isn't?

280
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,073
<i>I want Chem-7s every four hours.</i>

281
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,598
Strict ins and outs. Page
me with any new symptoms.

282
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,100
If anyone sneezes, I
want to hear about it.

283
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,532
You think I missed something?

284
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:22,474
No. Everything I've
seen indicates you made

285
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,975
the right diagnosis and gave
all three the right treatments.

286
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,460
Then why reevaluate?

287
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:29,781
- Bell.
- Yeah.

288
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,966
He is looking for a way out.

289
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,746
- Mm, maybe.
- I know that he had your back

290
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,948
when you got fired, but
the man has gone from CEO

291
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,456
and chief of surgery
to the basement.

292
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,085
How long until he goes
back to being the guy

293
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:42,710
that would do anything
to save his own skin?

294
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:44,323
I say we give him the
benefit of the doubt.

295
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,398
Right now, people taking
Bell's supplement are in danger

296
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,834
of getting just as
sick as these three.

297
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,763
Once you discovered
they were all taking 3B Life,

298
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,938
how many more
questions did you ask?

299
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,068
- I'd made the connection.
- I get it. I probably wouldn't

300
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:57,653
have asked any
more questions, either.

301
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:00,494
But now someone's dead,
so we have to. You with me?

302
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,134
All right. Let's go fishing.

303
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,918
<i>Wait.</i>

304
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:14,458
It was the supplement?

305
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,138
That's what I get for buying

306
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,924
something from the
shopping channel.

307
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:19,358
I buy stuff from
there all the time.

308
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,693
Just bought the
kids a trampoline.

309
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,449
You think we can get a refund?

310
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,647
We're not positive it was
3B Life that made you sick.

311
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,205
For now, don't take it again.

312
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,456
Oh, I feel fine.

313
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,002
The nurse said I was just
about to be discharged.

314
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:33,594
The food here is
making me retain water.

315
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,347
I can't be puffy
before my next shoot.

316
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,832
My oldest is in the school play.

317
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:40,718
And if I leave now, I
might be able to make it.

318
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,888
A patient at a another hospital
who was on 3B Life, they...

319
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:47,308
they recently passed away.

320
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:49,994
Oh, my God.

321
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,642
Now, this didn't
happen at Chastain,

322
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,366
so we have limited information.

323
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,702
Whoa. So you think
we're in danger?

324
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,798
It is possible. Now, this
man initially recovered

325
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:02,156
after treatment just
like all of you, so that

326
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:05,543
has us concerned that you could
relapse and get very sick again.

327
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,656
Which is why we need
you to stick around,

328
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,130
so we can monitor you.

329
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:10,192
And fill out these
questionnaires

330
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,644
about your last two weeks.

331
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:13,918
I know there's a lot
in there, it's annoying.

332
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,754
But we need you to be as
detailed as humanly possible.

333
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,739
This is vital.

334
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,192
You expect me to remember
what I ate five days ago?

335
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,489
And what kind of pesticides
are used on my neighbor's lawn?

336
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:25,090
Look, I get it. This
seems ridiculous,

337
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,032
but it could save your life.

338
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,852
We need to figure out
what made you sick,

339
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:34,538
and if this has to do
with 3B Life or not.

340
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:38,209
Every detail matters
for you guys right now.

341
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,396
I can't believe I paid
for express shipping.

342
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,463
Please, Dr. Okafor.
Take it again.

343
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,048
- It's not gonna change.
- Try.

344
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:52,423
Sorry, Professor, but
you have a bona fide fever.

345
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,636
Which means that
we're gonna have to put

346
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,204
your transplant
surgery on pause.

347
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,413
But I've been waiting
here for months.

348
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:02,216
My heart has finally
arrived. Please.

349
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,802
If it's an infection, the immune
suppression that you require

350
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,866
after the transplant
might be fatal.

351
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,367
We have to wait for
the fever to go down

352
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,985
and for your blood
culture results.

353
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,777
Okay. Okay, t-then we wait.

354
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:17,098
Yes, but, unfortunately,
the heart can't wait.

355
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,100
By the time we get your results,

356
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:21,095
the heart will no
longer be viable.

357
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,871
We're sorry,
Professor. We really are.

358
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:26,552
The donor heart will
have to go to the next

359
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:29,143
recipient on the list.

360
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,666
Oh, no.

361
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,720
What? Why is
everyone looking at me?

362
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:43,140
Doug, how are those
questions coming?

363
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:53,534
Doug, can you hear me?

364
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:58,823
Call a code blue!
We need help in here!

365
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,959
<i>Code blue, room 5916.</i>

366
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,162
What the hell happened?

367
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,342
I don't know. We
both just saw him.

368
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,566
He was fine five minutes ago.

369
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,669
Okay, pads are on. Pads are on.

370
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,116
V fib. Charge to 200.

371
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,267
And clear. Shock.

372
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,643
All right. Come on.

373
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:29,804
Uh, I'll go check on Cynthia.

374
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,306
I'll see what's
going on with Raj.

375
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:35,125
Thank you.

376
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,128
Update.

377
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,064
We put Mr. Corson back
on atropine and 2-PAM.

378
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,550
This is exactly what happened
to the guy at Atlanta General.

379
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,747
He seemed to be getting
better then, all of a sudden,

380
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,064
- he crashed.
- What about the other two?

381
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,455
Scared, but okay for now.

382
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:51,475
And 3B Life still appears to
be the only possible cause.

383
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,972
We don't know that for sure.

384
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:54,662
The only way to be certain

385
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:58,049
that you're not risking
more lives is to issue a recall.

386
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,578
When patients get the right
diagnosis and treatment,

387
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,430
they don't usually recover
and then get worse.

388
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:05,390
And why is only one of
these three reacting like this?

389
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:06,902
Well, every person
has a different

390
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,909
physiological
response to poison.

391
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,478
Organophosphates are known
to have an intermediate syndrome

392
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:13,497
that show up a day or two later.

393
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,194
I think something
changed between the time

394
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:17,684
Doug finished his treatment
and when he coded.

395
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,214
The answer is in
there somewhere.

396
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,572
I'm gonna give Doug
a trial of diuresis.

397
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,025
Good.

398
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:27,228
You all right?

399
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,880
Well, I just heard that St.
John's brought in two cases

400
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,293
of organophosphate
poisoning this morning.

401
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,033
There's three more at Emory.

402
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,214
And the more hospitals I
call, the more patients I find.

403
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:37,538
And I'm-I'm not positive
they were on 3B Life...

404
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:38,756
This isn't isolated.

405
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,825
I'm gonna order
some send-out labs.

406
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,984
Hey. You're that doc
on the supplement.

407
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,621
What the hell, man?
You made me sick.

408
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,468
Hey, what's in those
supplements, man?

409
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,260
Hey. You're hurting people. Hey!

410
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:07,785
Hey.

411
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:12,623
Look, I know we haven't
exactly become friends, but...

412
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,376
I'm way younger than you. Okay?

413
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,072
- So I-I totally deserve
this heart, all right? Let's go.

414
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,059
- I have a PhD, for crying out
loud. And I'm a late bloomer.

415
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,449
My greatest work
is still ahead of me.

416
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,607
I thought it was supposed
to get warmer, not colder.

417
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,393
I heard Chastain is sending
over more blanket warmers.

418
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:34,995
I just had to substitute
oxacillin for Cefitaxe.

419
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,731
I mean, the amount of money
that Red Rock spent on this place,

420
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:40,029
you'd think they'd be
stocked with critical antibiotics.

421
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,613
How many times do I have
to reboot this new software

422
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:44,071
before it stops freezing
up? Should we place bets?

423
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:47,074
It'll be a miracle if we
make it through the day.

424
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,509
Where's Cain?

425
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,912
Last week, I was
operating on a young father

426
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:52,308
whose seizures
were so devastating,

427
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,282
he couldn't hold his child.

428
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:56,757
- So what I did with that...
- Dr. Cain. Do you have a second?

429
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,433
That's one of our nurses
who I will be with shortly.

430
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:02,673
It's about a patient.

431
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,043
Excuse me.

432
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,444
I think we need to push the
surgeries a day, maybe two.

433
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:14,101
And why would I do that?

434
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,653
Because this place isn't ready.

435
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,315
We're missing
medicine, uh, I mean,

436
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:18,783
the staff doesn't know
how to work the software.

437
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:20,992
We can't even get
the thermostat to work.

438
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,505
Growing pains are
part of the process.

439
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,512
This is different.
Someone could die.

440
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:27,782
Everything seems to be
running smoothly to me.

441
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:29,461
That's because you're
distracted. You're more focused

442
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:31,845
on the donors than you are
on your patients, like Lucy.

443
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,989
I will handle both. And
I will see you in the OR.

444
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,179
Are you ready for one of these?

445
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,895
Ew.

446
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,850
I love it. We'll match.

447
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,652
Yes, we will.

448
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,030
- Love you.
- I love you.

449
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,750
Take good care of him.

450
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,452
I will.

451
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,459
I said no.

452
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,282
When the agency asked me
if I wanted to adopt, I said no.

453
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,451
You know, after my
son passed away,

454
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,887
I never thought I'd ever
leave the house again.

455
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,072
Let alone raise another kid.

456
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:30,778
But fostering one for
a while, I could do that.

457
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,081
Most parents won't consider
a kid with medical problems.

458
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:35,565
It's a lot to take on.

459
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,923
You know, Lucy lost her parents

460
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,777
in a car accident
when she was four.

461
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,481
She was bouncing around
foster homes ever since then.

462
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:56,136
She never had a room of her
own until that first night with me.

463
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,123
Sounds like Lucy
has it pretty good.

464
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,975
Me, too.

465
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,245
I love that little girl.

466
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,049
And now...

467
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:12,035
You can't imagine
life without her.

468
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:16,607
She deserves a
real family again.

469
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,847
I think she found one.

470
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,416
Man, I thought his eighth
album took it to a whole new level.

471
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,360
- Track 14?
- Oh, yes, sir.

472
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,536
- Where the horns come in.
- And that drum solo?

473
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,327
It's heaven.

474
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:38,812
I got to say, it's nice to
finally cut with a surgeon

475
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:41,009
who appreciates
a little hard bop.

476
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,366
Dr. Okafor is not a fan?

477
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,464
Would you believe I agreed
to be her mentor anyway?

478
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:48,355
Just her mentor, huh?

479
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,041
I kind of got the impression
the two of you were maybe more.

480
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,562
No, our relationship
is strictly professional.

481
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,665
Good to know.

482
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:08,558
We need to start
thinking about a recall.

483
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,045
Uh, I, um...

484
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,897
I need to get some air.

485
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,132
- Andrea, let's just talk.
- I-I'll be right back.

486
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,636
So...

487
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,722
this is where we are now.

488
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,969
Do you want my
professional opinion?

489
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:26,793
We're not paying
for your silence.

490
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:28,278
Wait this out.

491
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:30,730
We...

492
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,761
we have one dead;
there's another critical.

493
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,235
- When more get sick...
<i>- If</i> more get sick,

494
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,887
I can help you.

495
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:39,473
- How?
- We spin it.

496
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,725
All the press needs is
a simple blood sacrifice.

497
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,211
Someone who is close to
the top who can take the fall.

498
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:45,274
You're changing the subject.

499
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:47,798
Won't be you who goes broke.

500
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,918
You're suggesting I throw
Andrea under the bus.

501
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,505
She took advantage
of a respected doctor.

502
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,435
You were focused
on your patients.

503
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,109
You trusted her too much.

504
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,288
In case you hadn't noticed,
my face is on the bottle.

505
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,430
Nobody is gonna believe
that I'm not responsible.

506
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,066
The truth is what you make it.

507
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,368
Getting you out of
this mess you're in,

508
00:23:08,403 --> 00:23:10,120
this is why you pay me.

509
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,073
It's why other people who
are in far more trouble than you

510
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,758
have paid me.

511
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,760
Andrea can start over again.

512
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,429
She'll recover.

513
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:19,980
You won't.

514
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,750
Anyone who tried 3B
Life and stubbed their toe

515
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:25,869
is coming after you.

516
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,922
And the public will not be
kind, and they will never forget,

517
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:30,524
unless...

518
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,959
you let me help you.

519
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:46,773
How are you feeling?

520
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:49,443
I'm good.

521
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:50,911
Thanks.

522
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:53,430
- Probes.
- We should wait for Dr. Cain

523
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,476
before moving forward.

524
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,944
He told me to go
ahead and start mapping

525
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,780
- if he got held up.
- I understand, but...

526
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,444
Mind if I join?

527
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,233
Hi, Dr. Cain.

528
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:02,890
Hello, Lucy.

529
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:04,441
I'll take those.

530
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,520
Lucy, before I
remove your tumor,

531
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,450
I'm gonna map out your
brain like we talked about.

532
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:19,968
This is the part
where you keep talking

533
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,086
while I test the tissue, okay?

534
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,193
- Okay.
- Okay.

535
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:26,463
Annie told me that you
sang in your talent show.

536
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,281
Yeah. It was so much fun.

537
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,768
My friend Sam juggles scissors.

538
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,852
- I sang.
- What song?

539
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,783
"Baby Won't You
Please Come Home."

540
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,824
It's my fave.

541
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:39,343
Annie says I sing it almost
as good as Bessie Smith,

542
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,127
but I don't think I come close.

543
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:46,684
How is he?

544
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:50,220
Aaron's transplant went well.

545
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,272
Well, I don't want
to be envious.

546
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:53,891
But I am.

547
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,126
Your cultures came back.

548
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,878
No obvious infection.

549
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,880
Your fever hasn't returned.

550
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,449
- You're back on the list.
- It's too late.

551
00:25:02,485 --> 00:25:04,346
When they admitted
me, the doctors told me

552
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,286
I had maybe six months.

553
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:08,972
And that was six months ago.

554
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,157
I don't have time to wait.

555
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,493
We don't know that.

556
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,796
Doctors aren't fortune-tellers.

557
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:18,582
You and I both know the odds
of another heart coming my way

558
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,950
before I die.

559
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,605
You know why I hate those?

560
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:28,058
I see a lot of reasons.

561
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,095
They remind me that I'm alone.

562
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,914
So now, here I am in my...

563
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,533
little room,

564
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,419
where the only person
who comes to visit...

565
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,622
is just doing her job.

566
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,081
Go.

567
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,896
Well, the press
are on their way in.

568
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:07,642
But I want you
to think carefully

569
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,566
before you make all this noise.

570
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,335
What about my offer?

571
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,987
Come in.

572
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:22,078
The responsibility is mine.

573
00:26:28,571 --> 00:26:31,255
Doug's responding well
to the atropine and 2-PAM.

574
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,667
I'm still waiting
for send-out labs.

575
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,658
Just give me a
little bit more time

576
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:37,160
before I have to give you a
definitive answer on everything.

577
00:26:38,647 --> 00:26:40,397
Do you know...

578
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,083
I only ever had one job...

579
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:45,118
before I became a doctor?

580
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:51,570
I worked the register at
my family's hardware store

581
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:53,544
since I was a kid.

582
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:59,466
And I would watch customers
walk in and out all day.

583
00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:03,904
They came to see my father...

584
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,273
because they knew he
wouldn't overcharge them

585
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:09,109
or try and sell them
something they didn't need.

586
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,129
♪ ♪

587
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:15,965
They knew he was a good man...

588
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,302
worthy of their trust.

589
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,537
I worked so hard

590
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,156
all my life to be
seen like my dad.

591
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,245
But I didn't do
enough to<i> be</i> like him.

592
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,468
Thank you for trying.

593
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,657
Elijah stacks cups.

594
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:47,781
I mean, it's not
really a talent,

595
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:50,167
but they let him do it.

596
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,900
- What's that noise mean?
- Uh, that's your heart rate.

597
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,007
We just don't want
it to get too high.

598
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,461
She just hit the 150s, and her
temperature is rapidly rising.

599
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:02,874
Cooled fluids and
IV acetaminophen.

600
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:04,393
Started that ten minutes ago.

601
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,498
She's not responding.

602
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,884
I think this might be
malignant hyperthermia.

603
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:12,188
- I'm really hot.
- Get the dantrolene.

604
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,985
- What's that mean?
- It's just special meds

605
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:15,892
for this kind of situation.

606
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,995

you sing that song

Yeah, just pretend

The surgery went smoothly.

Your new heart
is functioning well.

665
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,092
The nurse stopped the
propofol an hour ago.

666
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,860
He should be awake by now.

667
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:23,130
Can you open your
eyes for us, bud?

668
00:31:28,603 --> 00:31:30,086
Blown pupil.

669
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,249
Pressure's a little high.
He's relatively bradycardic.

670
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:33,240
Explains hypertension.

671
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:35,036
- Cushing's reflex.
- He's having a stroke.

672
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,426
We need 50 grams of IV mannitol!

673
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,962
And to get him to CT.
Somebody page Dr. Austin now!

674
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:48,772
- Stroke?
- Cardiopulmonary bypass,

675
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:51,708
blood thinners... It
all put Aaron at risk.

676
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,042
Well, is he okay?

677
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,277
No.

678
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:56,112
He's brain-dead.

679
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,815
Stroke is a known complication

680
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,977
of the transplant process.

681
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,451
Aaron was unlucky.

682
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:04,454
We did everything we could,
but the injury was catastrophic.

683
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,610
Sitting in this room...

684
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:14,230
wondering if each
day will be your last,

685
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,416
it's hard in ways that you...

686
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,484
you can't understand

687
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,954
unless you've lived it.

688
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:22,839
Like we did.

689
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,242
Poor kid.

690
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,845
Stuck in here with me.

691
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:30,496
I could have gone easier on him,

692
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,433
and... instead, I made
his last days harder

693
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:35,151
than they needed to be.

694
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:38,021
We think there's something
you should know about Aaron.

00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:21,944
To impress some donors?

877
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,363
Again, nobody died.

878
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,932
Even when we do everything we
can to prepare, things go wrong.

879
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:29,368
What chance do our
patients have if we don't?

880
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,321
They deserve better.

881
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:37,209
There's a reason they don't
name buildings after nurses.

882
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:50,506
Midtown.

883
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,740
Overpriced.

884
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:53,504
- Doll's Head Trail.
- Overrated.

885
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:55,695
- Botanical Garden?
- Boring.

886
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,207
Okay, come on. There's got to be

887
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:58,408
at least one place on my list

888
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,727
that I should
check out in Atlanta.

889
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:00,871
If you want a good time,

890
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:02,518
you want to go to Inman Park.

891
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:04,153
I will check that out.

892
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,038
We could check it out together.

893
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,641
Tomorrow night.

894
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:10,076
You drive.

895
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,362
No open-toed shoes.
