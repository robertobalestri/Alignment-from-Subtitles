Are you sure right now is the
right time to make this move?

3
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:08,874
I've never been so sure.

- Remind me why I hired you.
- Your last assistant quit,

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,210
and my dad is Zip Betournay.

Springs golf club.

7

My ex-husband is
so hard on Grayson,

10

nothing terrible happened,

15

18

19
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:41,006
- Which is amazing.
- Agreed,

20
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,891
but people get on
each other's nerves,

21
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:45,777
which is why I'm proposing
that we both get to pick one thing

22
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,212
that drives the other one crazy.

23
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:48,429

24
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,165
Cute. Yes.

25

to quell the thing

happily ever after.

You have no idea.

- I just like food.
- This is why
I didn't want to do it.

38

All right, fine, yeah.
No, you're right.

39

Any other pain?

171
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,373
No.

172
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:08,993
- Dizziness?
- No, but, Doc...

173
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,395
much as I dig it here,
I think I'd really prefer

174
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,381
something for
this migraine pain.

175
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,301
- Mm-hmm.
- ASAP, so I can get
back to my work site.

176
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,920
My guys got to pull the
extra load if I'm not there, so...

177
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:20,956
Well, I'm gonna
run a test panel,

178
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,485
make sure everything's okay,
and then we'll go from there.

179
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,492
- Good?
- Good.

180
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,114
Make yourself comfortable.

181
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,299
Be careful, Doc.

182
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:33,618
You make things too
nice, I may never leave.

183
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:37,634
This isn't an herbal
or energy supplement.

184
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:40,358
It's not a daily vitamin.

185
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,510
It's all three.

186
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,746
The best nutritional scientists
in the country helped craft

187
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,315
this groundbreaking product.

188
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,767
Six years

189
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:54,155
and every disposable
dime I had is on this table.

190
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,092
Put the Chastain
name on the product,

191
00:07:57,127 --> 00:08:00,694
give me your brand in
marketing, and together

192
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,548
we will sell millions
of units, guaranteed.

193
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,422
I'm sorry, this
isn't real medicine.

194
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,643
I get it.

195
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,644
The supplement
business is littered

196
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,729
with con artists
selling snake oil,

197
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,833
and they are cleaning up
in a $122 billion industry.

198
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,463
It is the Wild, Wild
West out there,

199
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:26,053
and supplements aren't
regulated by the FDA.

200
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,074
Look, I get that this is
outside of your comfort zone,

201
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,127
but you can trust me.

202
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:34,212
My products are the real deal.

203
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:38,382
All I'm asking is for
you to give me a chance.

204
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,904
You know, a
hospital like Chastain

205
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,139
can only associate itself

206
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:48,260
with the highest
standard of medical care.

207
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,228
And we don't take chances.

208
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,580
Thank you.

209
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:06,694
Steady. I want him in
the OR in one piece.

210
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:09,197
How bad is it,
fellas? Talk to me.

211
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:11,166
- Detective, we got this. Relax.
- Not possible.

212
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:12,567
I'm coming with you.

213
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,796
Time to fight the
law and win, Pravesh.

214
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,036
You're not allowed in the OR.

215
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,682
Go back to the
ER for observation.

216
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,372
Hey, I don't need observation!

217
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,609
Detective, if you keep
following us, I will call security.

218
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,622
I have had ICE removed, I
will have you removed, too.

219
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,913
Intern don't play.

220
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,801
He's in V-fib.

221
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:32,520
Okay, I got no pulse. Yeah,
we need to start CPR right now.

222
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:34,033
Get these cuffs
off. We can't roll him

223
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,817
onto his back or
move the impalement.

224
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,538
All right, let's start
compressions from both sides.

225
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:41,562
- Me and you, Pravesh.
- Let's go.

226
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,533
Easy, guys.

227
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:47,802
Better.

228
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,521
Let's go!

229
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:54,542
Remember, Docs, he dies,

230
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:56,294
hostage dies.

231
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,772
- He's crashing again.
- All right, back at it.

232
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,569
Do we have code meds?

233
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:11,225
What he needs is blood.

234
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,356
- He's been down too long.
- Okay, he's coding.

235
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,580
Chu, you know what to do.

236
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,360
- Drape and intubate.
- You got it.

237
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,118
Nurse, take my place.
Nolan, scrub room with me.

238
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,640
I'm in. Hang two units of
O neg and start pressors.

239
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:28,693
All right, let's go. On my
count? One, two, three.

240
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,634
- Get his back. Guy's got a steel
bar rammed through his chest.

241
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,536
Mostly, you don't survive that.

242
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:42,473
Adjust the attitude. It's
my OR, my outcome,

243
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,208
and I say he lives.

244
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,327
Aye, aye.

245
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,008
Come on, Pravesh, I
need a living patient.

246
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:50,831
I cannot operate on dead people.

247
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:54,519
Well, I suppose I
could, but why bother?

248
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,839
Holding compressions.
Pulse check.

249
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,193
Sinus tach. Strong
carotid pulse.

250
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,662
Congratulations, Pravesh.
You just saved the life

251
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,865
of a truly detestable
human being.

252
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,033
Ten blade.

253
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,570
Make this quick, Doc.

254
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:13,882
I'm gonna be at
Rob Spiro's bedside

255
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,173
the moment he
comes out of surgery.

256
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,369
Did you take any
blows to the chest?

257
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:20,728
Did three tours in Afghanistan.

258
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,480
IED blew up my Humvee.

259
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,526
Couldn't hear for a week.

260
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,735
Think I went to see
a doctor? Not once.

261
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,653
It's called strength
of character.

262
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,424
Yeah, I did two tours myself,

263
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,243
and anytime I have health
issues, I still see a doctor.

264
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,012
It's called not being an idiot.

265
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,667
What unit?

266
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,687
Navy corpsman. Third
Battalion Seventh Marines.

267
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:49,056
Battle of Sangin.

268
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:52,359
Heard that was a
hell of a time, brother.

269
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,597
You have any head pain?

270
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,033
You're damn right I do.

271
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,929
He hit me in the head
with a two-by-four.

272
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,420
Squeeze my fingers.

273
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,189
Ah. Doc, not with this one.

274
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,408
He stepped on my
hand twice here.

275
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:10,411
I'm sending you for a CT scan.

276
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:12,529
No. Not a chance.

277
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,383
You may have
life-threatening injuries.

278
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:16,979
In order to do my job, I
need more information

279
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,219
than just a standard exam.

280
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:20,955
Nah.

281
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,591
All right.

282
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,610
How about we start with
an X-ray of your hand?

283
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,778
They're cheap and fast.

284
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,932
And it will help me with
the diagnosis, brother.

285
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,650
Hey.

286
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,236
They're deep into
Spiro's surgery.

287
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,620
He's touch and go.

288
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,773
If I didn't need
information from him,

289
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,253
I'd tell your guys
to let him perish.

290
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:43,477
It doesn't work that
way around here.

291
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,546
Oh, yeah? How's it work?

292
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:48,983
Saints, sinners, and
everything in between.

293
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,434
We treat them all.

294
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,513
It doesn't matter
what they've done

295
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,266
before they come
through our doors.

296
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,456
You don't care about their past.

297
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,141
I have to care about the future.

298
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,559
Another few hours pass,

299
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,490
some bad guys with an
innocent man are gonna realize

300
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,576
they could run a lot
faster without a hostage.

301
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,783
That happens,
they'll put him down

302
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,101
like a dog.

303
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,837
Please, do whatever
you need to do

304
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,822
so I can get what I need.

305
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,175
That way, nobody
else has to die.

306
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:25,453
I'm so sorry.

307
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,822
This is embarrassing. I
don't know why I'm crying.

308
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,857
Because you're human
and you're scared.

309
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,830
I mean... spine surgery.

310
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,464
On my spine.

311
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,983
All those nerves.

312
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,719
It's dangerous and
I don't want to do it.

313
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:44,021
I don't.

314
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,225
But the pain and weakness,

315
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,959
and I miss my life, but...

316
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:52,179
One step at a time, okay? Here.

317
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,902
This is your MRI.

318
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,855
See the narrowing right here.

319
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,357
It's putting pressure
on your spinal cord.

320
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:06,311
It's called spinal stenosis,
and what Dr. Cain wants to do

321
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,506
is a very common procedure

322
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,330
called a laminectomy.

323
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:10,976
That's just gonna
open up some space.

324
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,317
Only takes about an hour,

325
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,179
and I'll be there to make
sure everything runs

326
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:15,283
as smoothly as it can.

327
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,056
Your surgery's at 4:15, so I'll
probably have someone come up

328
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,237
about a half hour before
to take you to the OR.

329
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,361
Thank you for taking
the time to tell me.

330
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,563
Sorry, fog... frog in my throat.

331
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,915
How long have you had that?

332
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,884
Last month or so.

333
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,153
Hmm.

334
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:36,240
Do you have any blurred
vision? Difficulty swallowing?

335
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,577
Yes. Is that a problem?

336
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:40,761
It could be.

337
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,346
Let me talk to Dr. Cain.

338
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,998
You hang in there, okay?

339
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:47,268
I will be with you the
whole way, I promise.

340
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,170
♪ <i>Get busy...</i> ♪

341
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:51,221
Up, down, up, down, up.

342
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,224
All right. To the
right. Come on.

343
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,176
Elbow to knee.
Let's go, guys. Yup.

344
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:58,612
Weight on your heels. Let's go.

345
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,164
Set of eight. Let's go.

346
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,067
All right, you know what?

347
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,780
Let's, um, let's take
a five-minute break.

348
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:08,389
Stretch, hydrate,
and we're back, okay?

349
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,291
Good work.

350
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,859
If you are here to scold me

351
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,739
about fake medicine,
you can save your breath.

352
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:15,062
I'm broke. All right?

353
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:17,125
The business is finished.
I'm dissolving the company.

354
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,632
Your supplements have potential.

355
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,238
You killed my pitch.

356
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:27,219
You said Chastain
doesn't take chances.

357
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:29,810
They don't. I do.

358
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,773
I'm the one who brought you
to the board this afternoon,

359
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:32,963
and they were captivated

360
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,949
by your passion,
your confidence,

361
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,729
your obvious intellect.

362
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:40,054
Your presentation was
flawless. I'm not surprised.

363
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,955
You used me as a test case.

364
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,819
You do not want
to be in business

365
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,110
with Chastain and Red Rock.

366
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,090
They think of profit-sharing
as a chronic disease.

367
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,596
They will shake your hand,

368
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:51,460
then drive a knife in your
back at the same time.

369
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,818
Listen, Andrea, I've
spent the last year

370
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,487
educating myself on
the world of supplements

371
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,505
and, specifically, your company.

372
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,825
I watch its every move,

373
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,594
and unfortunately you've been
walking into the wrong rooms.

374
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,913
There's nowhere left to go.

375
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,498
You're out of gas.

376
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,517
What are you proposing?

377
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,204
The amazing qualities you
already bring to the table

378
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,688
plus my face

379
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,207
and the name Dr. Randolph Bell,

380
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,326
CEO and Chief of Surgery

381
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,512
on the label of
millions of bottles

382
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,980
of our supplements.

383
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,799
♪ <i>You know me, you know me</i> ♪

384
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,967
♪ <i>I'm-a put the fire on
the gasoline, get busy.</i> ♪

385
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,522
Rick.

386
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,502
Hate to kick you out
of this plush room,

387
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,287
but all your tests
came back negative.

388
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:36,677
So, you got, uh,

389
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:39,196
normal electrolytes,
normal blood counts.

390
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,409
You got a history of migraines,

391
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,677
uh, this is presenting
as another one.

392
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,295
I know that's
not fun, but if you

393
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,864
can handle a nail gun to
the ass, you can handle this.

394
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:48,489
Hey, kidding
aside, that's a relief.

395
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:49,690
With my dialysis,

396
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,754
I was starting to think
maybe it was something else,

397
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,561
- but...
- Yeah, well, I'll write you
a prescription,

398
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,058
- should help you out
with your migraines.
- Hey.

399
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,582
- Thanks a bunch, Dr. Hawkins.
- All right, my pleasure.

400
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,705
Rick? Rick?

401
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,758
Code Blue!

402
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,045
<i>AUTOMATED VOICE:
Code Blue, room 5417.</i>

403
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,247
- I need some help in here!
<i>- Code Blue,</i>

404
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,032
<i>room 5417.</i>

405
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,923
Oh, my God.

406
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,560
What happened to my patient?

407
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:29,046
Complaining of migraines,

408
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,199
tests came back
negative, then he coded.

409
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:36,020
- Any new medications?
- Just on all the standard stuff.

410
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,850
Doxazosin, a statin,

411
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:40,268
- an EPO med.
- Could you have
missed something?

412
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,943
Maybe you need to ask
yourself that question.

413
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,256
That's exactly what
I've been doing...

414
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,908
Because he received spotless
care under my supervision.

415
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,577
- Well, something went wrong.
- What are you implying,
Dr. Hawkins?

416
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,618
I just want answers.

417
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,522
We'll get them soon enough.

418
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,419
- Have you seen Dr. Cain?
- Uh-huh.

419
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,626
Are you here just to watch him?

420
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,129
Is that so wrong?

421
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,983
Nurse Sally watched
him yesterday, twice.

422
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,564
Dr. Cain?

423
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:27,838
You haven't sealed
off the aneurysm yet.

424
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,357
Place an 8.6-millimeter coil.

425
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,339
- Yes?
- I need to talk to you

426
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,606
about your pre-op
patient, Mia Danvers.

427
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,996
Okay, go ahead, but hurry.

428
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,849
I think she may have something
other than spinal stenosis.

429
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,263
No, Rodriguez, you
need more stability.

430
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,837
Add an interbody spacer to
the posterior vertebral body.

431
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,857
And you completed seven
years of neurosurgery residency?

432
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,909
I'm a nurse practitioner.

433
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:51,529
Yes, exactly, and why
is a nurse practitioner

434
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,608
trying to re-diagnose
my patient?

435
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,627
Full stop. You recruited
me to work on your unit.

436
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:56,879
Mia Danvers has
atypical symptoms.

437
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,135
I want to run some tests.

438
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,337
This is all healthy brain
tissue. Good margins.

439
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,538
Nice work, Timmons.

440
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,874
You can run as
many tests as you like.

441
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,145
Mia Danvers will be on
my table in OR One at 4:15.

442
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,481
Dr. Cain, do you always
let your residents operate

443
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,099
when you're not in the room?

444
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,135
<i>Dr. Meyer, call Admitting.</i>

445
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:22,276
I am there for the crucial
part of each surgery.

446
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:24,061
Always?

447
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,647
My residents are second to
none. They rarely make mistakes.

448
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:30,034
And if they do, yes, I'm
always there to correct them.

449
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,052
So have no fear, Nurse Nevin.

450
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,221
All is well.

451
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,720
Do I detect notes
of mango and chia?

452
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:52,506
A delightful hint of acai?

453
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,058
They say it increases stamina.

454
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,644
Yeah, but, I mean, is that,
like, scientifically proven?

455
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,063
Proof's not required.

456
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,014
People believe what
they want to believe.

457
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,016
The placebo effect works.

458
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:06,904
If you think that acai will
give you an energy boost,

459
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,088
chances are,

460
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,591
it will.

461
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,092
But why you?

462
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,073
I mean, you're already,
like, a top dog doctor.

463
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:15,937
I mean, you're
Dr. freaking Bell.

464
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,611
You ever heard of
the amazing Dr. Oz?

465
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,685
Yeah, sure.

466
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,203
Dr. Sanjay Gupta?

467
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:25,217
The-the dude on CNN.
Yeah, I love that guy.

468
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:27,508
Before you walked through
the doors of Chastain,

469
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:29,876
had you ever heard
of Dr. Randolph Bell?

470
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,524
No.

471
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:35,566
They're household
names, I'm not.

472
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:41,722
But a $5 million investment
will get me in the game.

473
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:43,941
So we need to find someone close

474
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,126
with very deep pockets.

475
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,529
That's, uh, kind
of steep, Dr. B.

476
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:50,580
I mean, who would
pony up that kind of cash?

477
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,301
I'm gonna give you a
hint. Who do we both know

478
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,937
who's local, wealthy,
and has capital to spare?

479
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:00,223
Who has offices in Buckhead

480
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,927
and made his money
betting on risky ventures?

481
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,598
Who contributed half your DNA?

482
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:10,729
Oh, my-my pops! My dad.

483
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:12,786
- Ah.
- Set up a meeting, stat.

484
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,471
Yeah, you got it, boss.

485
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:23,781
Hey.

486
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,569
- You okay?
- Yeah.

487
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:30,337
You don't look okay.

488
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,105
What's up?

489
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,293
A patient of mine...

490
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,863
everything seemed fine.

491
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,815
Was about to discharge
him, and then he just...

492
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,501
coded.

493
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:47,972
No signs, no symptoms.
Dead before he hit the floor.

494
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,958
- I'm so sorry.
- I keep going over everything
in my head.

495
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:52,993
What did I miss?

496
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:56,630
I have to figure out why.
Why-why did it happen?

497
00:21:56,665 --> 00:22:00,568
You will. Here.

498
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,055
It's okay.

499
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,658
Here you go, sir.

500
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,124
Well, the good news is
your hand isn't broken.

501
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:16,700
- Hallelujah. I'm out of here, man.
- But...

502
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,130
something else must be
wrong, so I'm keeping you

503
00:22:18,154 --> 00:22:20,031
in the hospital a little while
longer, run some more tests.

504
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:22,205
Doc. No. Come on.

505
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,790
You're being ridiculous, man.

506
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:26,293
I'm not discharging you
until I'm a hundred percent

507
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:27,377
positive you're okay.

508
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,713
You should call someone.

509
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,976
Get them to bring you
a change of clothes,

510
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,027
and you'll need a medical proxy.

511
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,245
Is it looking that bad
for me over there?

512
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,869
It's just standard protocol.

513
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:37,521
Aw, shh...

514
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,256
Damn, gonna be honest, man.

515
00:22:39,292 --> 00:22:41,252
Besides an ex-wife and
a few drinking buddies,

516
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,677
nobody's gonna come bring
me a fresh pair of underwear.

517
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:45,340
You know...

518
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,415
or make no medical
decisions for me, man.

519
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,694
I've spent the last five
years thinking about

520
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:51,218
catching bad guys.

521
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:52,847
Especially the one
you got in your OR

522
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,873
right now. Everything

I need some fluids.
He's hypotensive.

531
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:18,729
Hey, Detective.

532
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:19,946
Time to wake up.

533
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,334
Hey.

534
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:27,787
What the hell happened?

535
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,041
You passed out. You can
be mad at me all you want.

536
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,511
Keeping you in the hospital.

537
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,770
You're lucky to
be alive, you know.

538
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,283
The cop said you
once crammed yourself

539
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,007

543
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,522
Yeah. Always.

00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:22,058

00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,448

It is associated with aneurysms.

554
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:48,018
They can burst at any time.

555
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,405
Do you have kids?

556
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,207
A d... a daughter.

557
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,442
Why?

558
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:58,128
Ehlers-Danlos is genetic.

559
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,648
If she has aneurysms, it
can be very dangerous.

560
00:25:01,684 --> 00:25:04,701
She's going to need
aggressive surveillance.

anything so promising.

704
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:28,177

706
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,317

708
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:40,189

709
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,959
30% growth, $100 million.

710
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,956
With my medical reputation
and your business savvy,

711
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,179
we can make a fortune.

712
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,782

hands don't cross

713

714
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:57,674

715

man with a few bad habits

716

718
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,488
Magnificent effort.

719
00:33:12,508 --> 00:33:14,540
The shot or the pitch?

720
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,593
Both.

723
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:28,071

business together.

724
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:30,490

spinal stenosis...

731
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,245
Turns out she has
myasthenia gravis.

732
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,858
That's what's causing
all her symptoms?

733
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:29,348
Yes. And we can treat it
with meds. I just need Cain

734
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:30,911
to cancel the surgery. I
don't want him opening her up

735
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,151

736
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,442
Cain finished early

<i>I don't understand. You
didn't do the surgery?</i>

743

Turns out you have

744
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,635
what's called myasthenia
gravis. It's an autoimmune disease.

745
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:14,427
It can be controlled
through the medication.

746
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:18,248
Oh, thank you so much, Dr. Cain.

747
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,300
Thank Nurse Nevin.
She's the one that caught it.

748
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,191
She seems relieved.

749
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,921
Take one guess how
much your due diligence

750
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:32,261
cost this hospital
today. No, allow me.

751
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,514
Mia's surgery would have
run 75 grand, give or take,

752
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,200
not including the
recovery, so let's just call it

753
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:40,303
$150,000 all-in.

of putting people into
surgery if they don't need it.

Which is exactly
why I handpicked you.

757
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:50,613
It should come as no
surprise that I'd like to offer you

758
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,015
a permanent position
on my neurosurgery staff.

759
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:55,335
Give you more
opportunities to shine,

760
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,470
make a lot more money
than you're making now.

761
00:35:57,506 --> 00:35:59,990
But I'm guessing you
don't care so much

762
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,041
about that last part.

763
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:05,311
Take your time. Think about it.

764
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:07,280
I have another surgery to do,

765
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:09,299
which is no doubt
a necessary one.

766
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,101
Have to make up
for lost revenue.

767
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:23,847
The corporate structure

768
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,710
will be an LLC with
partner ownership

769
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:28,001
vesting in two-year
increments, which is standard,

770
00:36:28,036 --> 00:36:29,885
and starting at ten percent.

771
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:33,256
Except for me. I'll own 65%.

772
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,074
Any advance of money...

773
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,477
He'll own 65%?

774
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:39,362
How much money is he investing?

775
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,081
- Six.
- Six...

776
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,666
Million.

777

owed by the partnership

778
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:48,070
and not an increase
in capital contribution...

779
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:51,524
Why didn't you tell me
that you'd reconciled

780

- It was only three weeks ago.

open this time around.

00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,359
Any questions?

784

To new partners.

785
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,041

790
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:40,089

The son of a bitch
gonna make it?

795
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,790
He should. He's recovering.

796

797
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,730
No witnesses.

798

not gonna happen.

Actually, we don't.

800

It's written all over your face.

802
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:21,197
You do whatever it takes

803
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,033
to save people.

804
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,652
You and me, we
not that different.

805
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:31,023
Spiro's crew has a hostage.

806
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,793
His life is hanging
in the balance.

807
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:39,799
We're his last hope.

808
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:45,154
You tell me I'm wrong.

809
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,994
Turn off Rob's morphine.

810
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,228
You can't be serious.

811
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:55,264
And then we add
a dose of Narcan.

812
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,002
That should wake him up.

813
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:00,519
His pain level would skyrocket.

814
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:02,066
I want to clear his
system of drugs.

815
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,200
I'm worried about his airway.

816
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:04,819
No, you're not. He
would go into shock.

817
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,504
What you're talking
about is torture.

818
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:08,628
What I'm talking
about is this man,

819
00:39:08,663 --> 00:39:11,047
who will die unless
Rob Spiro tells us

820
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,232
where he's being held
and he tells us now.

821
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,862
Conrad, I get that you
are trying to help this man,

822
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,247

- Don't lecture me
on my motivations.

823

Hold on a second. Wait.

824
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,656
The cops said they
found Spiro's daughter.

825
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,653
I can contact her, get her
to come into the hospital,

826
00:39:22,677 --> 00:39:24,355
and when he sees her, he
might have a change of heart.

827
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:25,839
He doesn't give a
damn about his daughter.

828

little bit uncomfortable

over Jessie's death,

881
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:18,217
about how you pushed
for the transplant surgery.

882
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:22,238
What's this about, Conrad?

883
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:25,842
Jessie died of a
pulmonary embolism.

884
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,427
A complication from surgery.

885
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,999
Five other dialysis patients

886
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:36,786
died at Chastain
over the last six weeks.

887
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:40,873
All from pulmonary embolisms.

888
00:42:43,878 --> 00:42:46,462
I think whatever
killed your sister,

889
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,481
it killed them, too.

890
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,321
We need to figure
out what it was.

891
