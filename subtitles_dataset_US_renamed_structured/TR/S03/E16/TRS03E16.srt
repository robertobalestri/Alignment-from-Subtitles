00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:04,227
Respectfully, our
bottom line isn't

179
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,145
the only consideration here.
What about expectant mothers?

180
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:08,836
Those patients will be taken
care of at Atlanta General

181
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:10,316
where they have a
fully-functioning OB.

182
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,017
We have a
fully-functioning OB here.

183
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,542
Not for long.

184
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,645
Hundreds of crucial
staff will lose their jobs.

185
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,565
As for staff, I need you to
give notice to the residents.

186
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,521
Wow.

187
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,660
The chair and
chief resident of OB

188
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,689
are at a conference, so
you don't have a choice.

189
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,896
Neither do those residents.

190
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,909
If you let them go,
they won't get accepted

191
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,411
into another
residency, not this year,

192
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,884
not when they're in the middle

193
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,313
of their training
here at Chastain.

194
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:42,899
And you still want to
set them back like this?

195
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,039
This is a business.

196
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:47,208
You wanted this
"chief resident" title.

197
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:50,144
It's time to earn it.

198
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,931
Give the obstetrics
residents notice.

199
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,173
- Gemma, I'm Dr. Pravesh. I'm here...
- Shh.

200
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:09,007
Trust me. This is why I chose

201
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,343
to dress<i> you</i> for
the Met this year.

202
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,717
You are my only priority.

203
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,086
The dress will be
perfect, I promise.

204
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,033
Ms. Lin, I'm here
to examine you.

205
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,572
Mind taking that call later?

206
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,360
Jen, we'll continue
this conversation later.

207
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,712
Talk soon.

208
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:26,748
Three years, I've been the boss.

209
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,045
Sometimes I forget I don't
call the shots everywhere.

210
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,520
Your chart says that you're
having abdominal pain.

211
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:34,555
Plus some vomiting
and weight loss.

212
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,441
But I like that part.

213
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,879
Is something wrong?

214
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,375
Does it hurt when
I press down here?

215
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,583
A little uncomfortable,
but, no, it doesn't hurt.

216
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,918
I'd like to get a CT

217
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,054
before I let you get
back to work, okay?

218
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,321
No, thanks.

219
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,890
Fashion isn't for the
young or the weak.

220
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,820
Uh, since the deck is stacked
against me at the moment,

221
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,162
I have to get back.

222
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,715
Look, Gemma, you want
to be somewhere else.

223
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,550
Somewhere more important to you.

224
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:04,385
Believe me, I get it.

225
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,722
But you're here because
you're not feeling your best.

226
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:11,075
So let me get some images,
and we'll go from there.

227
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,344
Deal?

228
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,562
You're a little bossy.

229
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:16,931
I like you, so I will stay.

230
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:19,734
But if you make me wear one
of those hideous hospital gowns,

231
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:20,951
we're gonna have a problem.

232
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,171
I'll be right back.

233
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,510
Oh, my God.

234
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,929
You kept our
participation trophy.

235
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,198
Oh, yeah, to punish myself.

236
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,017
Never in the history of medicine

237
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,252
has peds won the
Resident Olympics.

238
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,537
Until that year.

239
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,849
I remember you were so mad,

240
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,668
you punched a hole
in the locker room wall.

241
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:45,370
Hey, they never
proved it was me.

242
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,939
And we both know
that game was rigged.

243
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:49,776
That night, you told me
I should switch into OB.

244
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,350
Now I can't imagine
doing anything else.

245
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,336
So, what'd you
need to talk about?

246
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:57,805
Gabbi...

247
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,592
I hate that I'm the
one telling you this.

248
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,164
Red Rock is shutting
down the OB department.

249
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:10,184
I wanted to let you
know as soon as possible.

250
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:13,688
In six weeks, you won't have
a residency here anymore.

251
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,207
Chastain is my home.

252
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,827
This is the only place
I've... I've ever worked.

253
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,214
I have left word at every
single hospital across the state

254
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,832
to try and get you transferred.

255
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:29,637
I can't make any promises,
but I'll pull every favor I can.

256
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:32,006
But I'll have to start over.

257
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,508
Be an intern again.

258
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:36,327
I-I'm a year away
from a real salary.

259
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,540
I have student loans that
have been in deferment.

260
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,015
This is my career.

261
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,945
I know, and I've spoken
to every department head

262
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,102
to try and keep you here.

263
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,920
There just isn't room.

264
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,972
Oh, my God.

265
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:52,042
I took a year's lease
on my apartment.

266
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,939
I'm gonna have to move
home with my parents.

267
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,114
I'm-I'm sorry. I
need, I need to go.

268
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,064
And just like that,

269
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,749
good doctors sacrificed
for the bottom line.

270
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:05,851
These residents are
still in their training.

271
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,052
It's almost impossible for them

272
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:08,587
to get reassigned
into a new program.

273
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:10,206
Even if they do
find a new hospital,

274
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,847
they might have to start
over from their intern year.

275
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:16,517
I came up with some
of these OB interns

276
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:18,603
from med school.

277
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,872
These are good
doctors, good people.

278
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,524
I can't let them go until I know

279
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,555
I've done everything
I can to stop this.

280
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,072
Mary Lawson's
test results are back.

281
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,913
Thank you.

282
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:30,983
Huh.

283
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,966
Not the news you
were hoping for?

284
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,236
I'm not convinced any
news would be sufficient

285
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:36,737
for this family.

286
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,550
- You need backup?
- Not yet.

287
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:41,041
But if they start trying
to kill each other.

288
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:43,294
I'll stand by.

289
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:49,066
Well, I just reviewed
Mary's test results,

290
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,386
and I'm happy to report
that everything looks normal.

291
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:53,182
So there's nothing
wrong with me?

292
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,940
Well, your symptoms
are real, but the tests show

293
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,087
that nothing is emergent,
so that's good news.

294
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,572
See?

295
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:01,078
I told you.

296
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,848
Here. Drink this.

297
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,232
It helps with your stress.

298
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:07,852
She said Mary's
symptoms are real.

299
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,572
You don't look good,
kiddo. Are you okay?

300
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:12,601
Actually, I'm not
feeling that... that good.

301
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,824
I...

302
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,259
I'm having trouble breathing,

303
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,375
- but I guess it's nothing.
- Let's listen.

304
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,698
Take a deep breath.

305
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,251
And another. Feeling any pain?

306
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,254
My chest hurts. I-I feel hot.

307
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:28,450
- She's having a panic attack!
- That you gave her.

308
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,668
Your sats have dropped.

309
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:31,025
I'm gonna put you on oxygen

310
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,028
- and admit you for observation.
- You're going to admit her?

311
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,429
You just said she was fine.

312
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:37,165
I told you something was wrong.

313
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,560
Okay, I'm gonna need you
guys to leave the room, please.

314
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,856
Thank you.

315
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:48,475
All right.

316
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,538
Introduce me to her.

317
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,974
What?

318
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,243
Gemma Lin is
single-handedly responsible

319
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,306
for bringing avant-garde
to streetwear.

320
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,081
There is no one who
can hold a candle to her.

321
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,983
She's an icon.

322
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,853
But I wouldn't expect you
to know anything about that.

323
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,556
What? 'Cause I'm a guy I
don't know about fashion?

324
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,058
You tell me. What are
you wearing tonight?

325
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,695
It's a royal ball. I have a tux.

326
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,896
You have a tux,
or you rented a tux?

327
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,084
I figured.

328
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,853
Introduce me or don't.

329
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,746
I will find a way.

330
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,722
Well, that explains
the abdominal pain.

331
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,041
A mass in her stomach
extending into her small intestine.

332
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,899
Doesn't have the appearance
of a typical stomach cancer.

333
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:47,952
Regardless, she's gonna need
an endoscopy to biopsy the mass.

334
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,734
Hopefully, I'll have
some answers

335
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,008
for her before I leave.

336
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:55,843
Don't you mean "we"?

337
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:57,544
That's surgical.

338
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,731
Gemma's<i> our</i> patient now.

339
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,049
I told you I'd find a way.

340
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:07,922
How are you feeling?

341
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:09,874
Better.

342
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,861
I know I seem like the girl
who cried wolf, but, uh...

343
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:15,863
something feels... wrong.

344
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:17,414
I believe you.

345
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,228
And we're gonna
figure out what it is.

346
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,219
That's why my dad
doesn't want me in PE.

347
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,049
He says I'm not
like the other kids.

348
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,833
But I want to be. I just...

349
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,721
He means well,

350
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:32,413
but ever since Mom
died, he's been a little...

351
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:33,998
overprotective.

352
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,827
- Susan's your stepmom?
- She just wants me

353
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,885
to be independent, mm?

354
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,388
Move out and... and
stand on my own two feet,

355
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:42,072
and I want that, too.

356
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,175
Could all this just
be my anxiety?

357
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,406
Ah, you'd be surprised

358
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,231
the toll that stress
can take on the body.

359
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:53,250
Are you feeling
anxious right now?

360
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,819
No. I just...

361
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,987
My legs feel, like...

362
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,539
tingly, like Jell-O.

363
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:03,422
How about this?
Do you feel this?

364
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:05,813
I don't feel that at all.

365
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:07,865
What does that mean?

366
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,851
Dr. Bell. I need to
get new assignments

367
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,257
for some obstetrics residents.

368
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:20,294
You have room for,
say, two in gen surgery?

369
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,849
Depends. Why are
they leaving OB?

370
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,885
Red Rock is shutting
down the entire department.

371
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,822
You know, I should've
seen this coming.

372
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,836
OB has the highest premiums
and malpractice claims

373
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,193
- of any department.
- Yeah, and new moms can stay

374
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,207
for days without Red
Rock billing a dime.

375
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,964
It's their nightmare.
Maximum care, minimum profit.

376
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,511
No, I think this new
neurosurgery center

377
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,968
has them overextended,
and this is just the beginning.

378
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,132
- Well, how about we stop it?
- Well, we-we can't.

379
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:49,151
No one can. The only thing
that talks in medicine is money.

380
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,869
So unless you
got a whole lot of it

381
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,355
- lying around...
- I know, I know.

382
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,845
Well, maybe we can't
stop it, but what we can do

383
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,909
is try and help at least
some of these doctors,

384
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,167
who will lose their
careers if we don't.

385
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,669
Two residents?

386
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:04,024
- That's all I'm asking.
- Yeah. I'll see what I can do.

387
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,508
Your doctor is going
to a black-tie event,

388
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:09,343
and I think he needs your help.

389
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:12,046
He's clueless. You're brilliant.

390
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,682
No, seriously, your fall line
was my favorite collection

391
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:16,262
of the year.

392
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,318
- I am such a big fan.
- Thank you.

393
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:19,853
Hey.

394
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,333
Ooh.

395
00:17:21,357 --> 00:17:22,723
No. No, no, no, no, no.

396
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,708
What are you wearing?

397
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,004
What do you mean? It's a tux.

398
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,612
Says who?

399
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,925
Okay, I'm leaving, but I
will be back to check on you

400
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,182
after your endoscopy.

401
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,835
But right now, I have a
princess waiting for me.

402
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:37,516
- Is she blind?
- Uh, seriously, though,

403
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,790
you can't go looking like that.

404
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:41,859
I appreciate all your concern,

405
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,273
- but I really don't have
the time to...
- I do.

406
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,758
And I can't, in good conscience,
send you to a party like this.

407
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:49,783
My team can get you into
something amazing immediately.

408
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,591
Okay. Fine.

409
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,411
What's your chest
measurement? 38?

410
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,880
42, at least.

411
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,916
You're a 38.

412
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,989
Whoa.

413
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,807
Who invited 007?

414
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,921
Well, you better bring your
A game tonight, Hawkins,

415
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,423
'cause I ain't
messing around here.

416
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:18,823
I can see that.

417
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,047
How did this happen?

418
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:23,734
My patient is a famous
fashion designer,

419
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,730
and, as it turns out,
part fairy godmother.

420
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:28,017
And you mix that with Mina's
very aggressive comments

421
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,908
about my rental tux, and voilà.

422
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,892
Yeah.

423
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:33,410
Well, you look good, man.

424
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,201
- What happened?
- Well, she just got back
from an X-ray.

425
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,353
- I came to take her
for the endoscopy.
- Oh, make it stop.

426
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,820
All right, let's get
four of morphine.

427
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:49,988
Does it hurt more
when I push my hand in

428
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:51,924
- or when I take it away?
- When you take it away.

429
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:53,358
Rebound tenderness. Guarding.

430
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,583
Surgical abdomen.
I'll check the X-rays.

431
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,615
- Air under the diaphragm.
- She's perforated.

432
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,822
Wh-What does that mean?

433
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,052
It means we're
skipping the endoscopy.

434
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,042
You need surgery now. Get Nolan.

435
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,439
- No. No, no, no, no. I can't, I can't go alone.
- Shh. Shh.

436
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:09,513
- I have no one.
- Shh.

437
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,149
- I'm gonna die alone.
- You're not gonna die, Gemma.

438
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,212
- I will not let that happen.
- Dr. Pravesh,

439
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,636
please stay with me.

440
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,855
I'm so scared.

441
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,306
I'm not gonna leave you.

442
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:20,841
I promise.

443
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:22,643
All right? I'm right here.

444
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,797
I got your page.
What do you need?

445
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,244
- Her O2 sats are in the 80s. We need to intubate.
- I can't breathe.

446
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,228
Hey. I need meds
and an airway kit.

447
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,120
Please just help her.

448
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:35,522
Her paralysis is
progressing rapidly.

449
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,303
She's not gonna be able to
keep breathing on her own.

450
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:39,487
- What's causing the paralysis?
- We don't know.

451
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,013
Got it.

452
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:42,963
All right, it's gonna
be okay, Mary.

453
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:44,909
This is gonna put
you to sleep, all right?

454
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,867
All good.

455
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,316
- Okay, here we go.
- Ready?

456
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,157
Yep.

457
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,153
- Oh, my God.
- You never believed her.

458
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,011
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

459
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,732
- Got it?
- Got it.

460
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,071
All right, the tube's in.

461
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,067
- She's stable, for now.
- For now?

462
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,902
You-you mean she
could get worse?

463
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:13,077
Not if we can help it.

464
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:19,011
I'll begin with an incision
in the gastric fundus.

465
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:21,018
10-blade.

466
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,365
Got any tips on
crashing a royal ball?

467
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,422
Don't.

468
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,061
Hey. I know. I'm late.

469
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,512
I'm sorry, Nadine.

470
00:20:32,548 --> 00:20:34,715
- My patient needed me.
<i>- I understand.</i>

471
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:35,882
<i>It's just...</i>

472
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,530
<i>people are starting to arrive.</i>

473
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:40,031
<i>Traditionally,
you'd be by my side.</i>

474
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:42,356
I will be there
as soon as I can.

475
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,858
Look, I promise you, this is
a straightforward procedure.

476
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:49,062
- I'll be out of here in no time.
- What the hell?

477
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:52,466
Is that...?

478
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,702
A giant,
stomach-shaped hairball.

479
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:55,920
Nadine, I have to go.

480
00:20:58,908 --> 00:20:59,991
You good?

481
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:02,209
I think I got hair in my mouth.

482
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:04,094
I've heard about this before,

483
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,547
but I've never seen such a
severe case of trichophagia.

484
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:07,914
Gemma's eating her own hair?

485
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,845
That would explain
the no eyebrows.

486
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,829
An obstruction this
big, she's been eating

487
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,603
more than just her eyebrows.

488
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,906
And that's not all of it.

489
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,175
There must be a-a tail.

490
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,912
Extends from the gastric
body, beyond the pylorus,

491
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,730
into the duodenum.

492
00:21:23,766 --> 00:21:26,133
- It's Rapunzel syndrome.
- Yeah, it appears so.

493
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:30,086
We have to untangle the
hair that has wound itself

494
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,666
through the
intestines to extract it.

495
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,759
Yes, repairing whatever
damage we need to along the way.

496
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,411
Sounds complex.

497
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:40,364
You should call your
princess and let her know.

498
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,782
This is gonna take a while.

499
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,173
Sinus bradycardia
with increasing pauses,

500
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,158
up to five seconds.

501
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,604
Labs are pristine.

502
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:54,172
The spinal tap
came back negative.

503
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:55,846
Nothing on imaging.

504
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,098
But her paralysis
is moving so fast.

505
00:21:58,134 --> 00:21:59,817
She could go into sinus arrest.

506
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,386
Let's put the pads
on her, just in case.

507
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,656
Let's keep the crash
cart bedside, ready to go.

508
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,641
This doesn't make any sense.

509
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:10,177
When she came here, her
symptoms were so vague.

510
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:13,680
Respiratory failure and...

511
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,215
and now her heart.

512
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,884
- We're missing something.
- Mm-hmm.

513
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:21,833
It's just the pulse
ox. It's been finicky.

514
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:23,068
Nail polish can sometimes
prevent the pulse ox

515
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,976
from giving an accurate reading.

516
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,011
Wait.

517
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,263
Mees' lines.

518
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,302
Sometimes found in
chemotherapy patients

519
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:37,838
or ones in renal failure.

520
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:40,590
Or when exposed to heavy metals.

521
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,893
Mary's blood levels are back.

522
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:44,889
The heavy metal in
her blood is thallium.

523
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:47,431
- What?
- Good news is,

524
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,044
with some Prussian
blue and dialysis,

525
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,829
- we can treat her.
- The bad news is

526
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:53,203
thallium is not a naturally
occurring element.

527
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,006
Someone could be
giving it to her intentionally.

528
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,008
Someone's poisoning Mary?

529
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,059
Uh, who?

530
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,380
Someone with access and...

531
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,183
proximity.

532
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:09,336
Susan married a man
who's way more invested

533
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,339
in his daughter than he is her.

534
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:15,008
So maybe she couldn't take it?

535
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,044
She does want her
out of the house.

536
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,941
Thallium is illegal
in the United States,

537
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,181
impossible to get.

538
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:23,867
Except for places like China.

539
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,404
Susan just got
back from Beijing.

540
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,075
We need to get
that tea canister.

541
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:36,074
What is it you're giving her?

542
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:37,865
Prussian blue.

543
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,134
It'll help flush any toxic
chemicals in Mary's body.

544
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,037
Toxic chemicals?

545
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:46,090
Does that mean you know
what's been happening to her?

546
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,909
We're getting closer.

547
00:23:48,944 --> 00:23:50,922
Hello. Mark, Susan, can
I steal you for a second

548
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:52,145
to sign some paperwork?

549
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,730
Of course.

550
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,833
You probably only
need one of us.

551
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,400
I'll stay here with Mary.

552
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,069
Um...

553
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,655
Yeah. Actually, I need
both your signatures.

554
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,273
It'll be real quick.

555
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:05,825
I'll keep her company.

556
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,395
I'm not going anywhere.

557
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,965
All right. Just right
there at the top.

558
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,884
Thank you.

559
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,364
Oh, I'm sorry. I
should've had that...

560
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,906
Uh, there we go.

561
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:30,016
And if, uh, could
give me the date.

562
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,435
Nah, we're good. We're good.

563
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,453
Never mind. Thank
you. Thank you.

564
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,691
Do you have any
reason to believe that...

565
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,149
that Susan would try
to poison your daughter?

566
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,888
Um, uh, of course not.

567
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,857
She's hard on her, but
she loves Mary like her own.

568
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:58,061
We found traces of thallium in
the tea that Susan gives Mary.

569
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,380
Sue gave Mary the tea,

570
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,350
but I'm the one who got it
for her from her acupuncturist.

571
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:06,487
I was just trying to
help her feel better.

572
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:09,173
The tea is supposed to calm
her and give her more energy.

573
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,492
- This is all my fault.
- No. We're not pointing

574
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:13,993
any fingers just yet, but...

575
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:17,031
but we just need to know
how the thallium got in the tea.

576
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,048
I don't know.

577
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,351
It comes in sealed packets.

578
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,868
Do you have one with you?

579
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:25,256
I mean, we give it
to her all the time.

580
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,507
I mean, I...

581
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:30,477
I mean, I can't read
any of these ingredients.

582
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:31,656
These kind of
alternative remedies

583
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,897
are completely unregulated.

584
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:33,898
There could be
anything in there.

585
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,159
We need to get this to the lab.

586
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:37,050
My wife.

587
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,886
She didn't do this.

588
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:41,187
You have to believe me.

589
00:25:57,939 --> 00:26:00,557
Please tell me
you're on your way.

590
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,092
They're ready to announce us.

591
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,177
<i>I'm not, Nadine.</i>

592
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:04,761
<i>I'm still at the hospital.</i>

593
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,764
<i>I had to stay with my patient.</i>

594
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,400
I'm so sorry.

595
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,046
They're about to
announce you as my escort.

596
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,018
I'm gonna look like

597
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:13,554
<i>an idiot out there.</i>

598
00:26:13,589 --> 00:26:15,889
I don't even know what to say.

599
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,592
Bye, Devon.

600
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:24,214
So, they did find
traces of thallium

601
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,366
in the packets from
your acupuncturist.

602
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:28,385
We contacted the manufacturer,

603
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,039
and they have submitted a recall
of the contaminated supplements.

604
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:33,740
And I'll be okay?

605
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:36,392
With a bit of rest and a
few more rounds of dialysis,

606
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,428
you should be fine.

607
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:41,998
I am so sorry.

608
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,050
I should've listened to you.

609
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:45,563
Honey, this isn't your fault.

610
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:49,156
I... I sent her to
the acupuncturist.

611
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,276
I told you the acupuncturist
was a bad idea.

612
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,880
At least I'm not impossible
to please, like you.

613
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:02,886
This is so embarrassing.

614
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:07,858
Who eats their own hair?

615
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,528
Look, stress can be triggering

616
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,830
for these kinds of
compulsion disorders.

617
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,865
Cut back your hours.

618
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,517
Take on fewer clients.

619
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,670
Easier said than done, I think.

620
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:21,922
And I will put you in
touch with a professional

621
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:23,835
who specializes in
trichophagia, okay?

622
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:29,646
I've been so stressed and
scared someone would figure it out.

623
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:32,832
I pushed everyone away.

624
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:35,001
All I had was my work.

625
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:36,453
It paid off, but, uh...

626
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,404
You were alone.

627
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,609
I shouldn't have asked
you to stay with me.

628
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:45,345
- You missed your ball.
- We all need support.

629
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,448
I wanted to be here for you.

630
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:53,003
Well, I'm okay now,
and you can still make it.

631
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,673
It's too late. I
can't show up now.

632
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:00,410
Hey. It's like you said,
everyone needs support.

633
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,863
Late or not, your
princess wants you there.

634
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:04,981
And, besides,

635
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,984
it would be a shame for
that tux to go to waste.

636
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,160
Thank you, Gemma.

637
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,990
Hmm.

638
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:20,764
Now, that is how you wear a tux.

639
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,365
Well, if I remember correctly,

640
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,885
you have a spectacular
wardrobe yourself.

641
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,937
I'm just popping in,
but I have a plus-one,

642
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,356
if you're interested.

643
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,492
You want arm candy.

644
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:33,860
Are you offen... Are
you offended by that?

645
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:35,579
Usually, yes.

646
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:38,582
But I do have a dress
I've been wanting to wear,

647
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,850
and I desperately
need a night out.

648
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,252
The whole night.

649
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,187
So I will drive myself.

650
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,755
Okay. It's a deal.

651
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,874
Uh, see you there.

652
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,209
Mm-hmm.

653
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,917
Hey.

654
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,388
Wow.

655
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:04,707
You in that dress is exactly
what I need right now.

656
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,612
It's time for you to
return the feeling.

657
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,618
- You want to talk about it?
- Eh.

658
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,990
Being chief resident is not
what I thought it would be.

659
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,886
You know, we
don't have to go out.

660
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,061
We can go home, get some wine,

661
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,580
- relax.
- Mm.

662
00:29:26,615 --> 00:29:28,982
And lose a night dancing
with you in that dress?

663
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,053
Absolutely not.

664
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:34,254
Mm.

665
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,436
All right, but if you're not
fist pumping in a half hour,

666
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,460
I'm calling it.

667
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:44,965
Okay. All right. Enough of that.

668
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,495

Can't even imagine the cost.

702
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:50,940
I would say about as much as
an obstetrics floor for six months.

703
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:55,362
I know you considered
decimating OB when you were CEO.

704
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:56,813
But I decided against it,

705
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:59,199
because when a hospital
decimates departments,

706
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:01,985
it loses prestige and status.

Rupa is one of my goddaughters.

Her unborn son has a
condition called ectopia cordis,

733
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,889
a very rare condition
in which his heart

734
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,290

00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,742
And, I mean, are we really

876
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:31,822
the romantic proposal
kind of people?

877
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,329
Oh, my God.

878
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,898
You<i> are</i> proposing.

879
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,568
- What?
- Oh, I reject your proposal.

880
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,887
- What, you... you reject it?
- Y-Yes.

881
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:44,907
<i>If</i> we ever decide
to get married,

882
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,420
I'd want the perfect
proposal for us.

883
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,422
And I'm sorry, seducing
me with insurance rates,

884
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,474
- that's not my idea of perfect.
- It...

885
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:53,244
It just seems like
the logical next step.

886
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:55,262
I mean, we're committed.
We should at least talk

887
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,503
- about making it official.
- Listen,

888
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,322
I-I love you deeply.

889
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,018
I mean, you were my
rock when I got fired.

890
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,436
You pushed me
to forgive my father.

891
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,661
You gave me chickens.

892
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:07,096
You will always make those
annoying sounds when you eat,

893
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,610
and I'll probably never
learn to pick up my socks, -

894
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,867
but nobody's perfect.

895
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:12,942
What matters is that
we just keep trying

896
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,687
to make each other better.

897
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,458
What matters is that we...

898
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,045
we belong together.

899
00:41:24,031 --> 00:41:26,332
Conrad.

900
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,867
Wait, are you
proposing to me now?

901
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,671
Why do you think I'm saying
all this lovey-dovey stuff?

902
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:33,222
And why do you think I've been

903
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,225
carrying this thing around
in my pocket for weeks?

904
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,450
Nicolette Marie Nevin,

905
00:41:44,486 --> 00:41:47,520
- will you do me the hon...
- Yes.

906
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,846
Are you sure?

907
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,218
I have never been so sure
of anything in my life before.

908
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:16,299
