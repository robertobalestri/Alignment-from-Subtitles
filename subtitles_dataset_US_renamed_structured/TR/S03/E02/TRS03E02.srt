<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,649
<i>- Dr. Cain.</i>
- Do you know how much he bills?

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,189
$80 million a year.

4
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:08,418
<i>Dr. Voss bills $2 million.</i>

5
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,069
Stick with me, and
we will rise together.

6
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,844
Sky's the limit for men like us.

7
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:12,906
Looked up my birth parents.

8
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,297
- Where are they now?
- Right here in Atlanta.

9
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:17,899
Three grown-ass kids. The
ones they didn't give away.

10
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,085
I want to start talking
about moving in.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,887
Let me do this at my own pace.

12
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,888
I just only have one request.

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,357
I really want those chickens.

14
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,112
No chickens.

20
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,012
Good morning.

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,196
I'm Dr. Bell.

22
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:49,664
We spoke on the phone.

23
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,461
I thought you said
there would be cameras.

24
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:52,884
There will be.

25
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,787
But I'm-I'm just here today
to go over the surgery.

26
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:57,172
Okay.

27
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:59,057
Come on in.

28
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,911
Dale, Reggie, we are so excited

29
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:04,346
that you're entrusting Chastain

30
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:06,932
with this life-changing
separation surgery.

31
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,134
We've always been
joined at the hip.

32
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,403
Side by side every
day of our lives.

33
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,389
To be honest, the idea
of not having my brother

34
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,425
right next to me is a little...

35
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,859
scary.

36
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:19,438
I don't know what
it would be like

37
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:20,874
-to sleep without
this jerk - this jerk

38
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:22,931
- snoring in my ear.
- Snoring in my ear.

39
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:25,533
After surgery, you can decide
how much togetherness you want.

40
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,385
How dangerous is it?

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,832
- For Reggie and Dale?
- June,

42
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,383
he already said
the risk is minor.

43
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:31,884
This is true.

44
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,592
Because the connection

45
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,744
is relatively superficial.

46
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,783
I love you.

47
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:43,901
Reggie, Dale,

48
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,287
the two of you are
the loves of my life.

49
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:48,640
And you are my everything.

50
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,575
My whole heart.

51
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,105
Boys, we can figure this all out

52
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:53,945
after the surgery.

53
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,942
You both can have
your own girlfriend.

54
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,665
Isn't that right, Dr. Bell?

55
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,235
If that's what they want.

56
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,788
You don't seem happy about this.

57
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,123
We want to know
what you really think.

58
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,519
- Talk to us.
- Talk to us.

59
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,461
If you two want this surgery,

60
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,862
I'll be there for you.

61
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,198
But to be totally honest,

62
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,750
I think our love is like
a three-legged stool.

63
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:19,854
Remove a leg, and I'm afraid
we're gonna tip right over.

64
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,323
Uh, this is a bigger decision

65
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:24,320
- than just one girl.
- Would you like to speak

66
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,494
to some separated twins?

67
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,715
No, thank you.

68
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,885
We're sorry for wasting your
time, but the surgery is off.

69
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,680
- Permanently.
- Permanently.

70
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,251
What are you thinking about?

71
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:57,892
I'm ready. Let's
move in together.

72
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:04,332
Mmm. Absolutely.

73
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,751
Mmm, mmm, as soon as possible.

74
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,470
Mwah.

75
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:11,806
I just wish we could get that
house that you showed me

76
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:13,436
when you first
started talking about it.

77
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,438
- It was so right for us.
- Mm, in this market,

78
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,223
somebody probably
already took it.

79
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:20,232
- Yeah.
- But we both have
great places now.

80
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,984
I could move into yours or
you could move into mine.

81
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,999
- Are those our only options?
- No, they're just the quickest.

82
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,910
This place is rent-controlled.

83
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,380
And I've clearly nailed
the urban chic look.

84
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,628
It's just not very private.

85
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,668
Mm, a short walk to work.

86
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:42,671
Yeah. How's the ankle?

87
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:45,017
I don't think you're gonna be
walking to work anytime soon.

88
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,542
Is that your way of saying
we should live at your place?

89
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:50,195
No, actually...

90
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,698
After everything...

91
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,185
- It's been a rough year.
- Yeah.

92
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,305
I just think it might be
nice to have a fresh start.

93
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,291
You know? Something
that's ours together.

94
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,212
<i>Boarding Flight 416...</i>

95
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,259
<i>Now, Dawn, your doctor told you</i>

96
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,944
<i>you have cancer of the appendix,</i>

97
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,269
<i>which is a very rare,
aggressive form of cancer.</i>

98
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:16,721
<i>So he basically said just
go home and give up hope.</i>

99
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,874
Yeah, he did.
But I can't do that.

100
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,460
I have seven beautiful kids.

101
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,796
I want you all to take
a look at these pictures.

102
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,066
- Take a look.
- Aw.

103
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,669
Dawn is a single
mom of seven kids

104
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,071
that she adopted through
the foster care program.

105
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,906
My kids need me.

106
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,909
So, I did my research,

107
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,112
and it turns out,
there is something

108
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,275
- that could buy me
precious time.
- And what's that?

109
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:45,684
They call it "the
Mother of All Surgeries."

110
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,902
<i>No doctor will do it.</i>

111
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:50,989
<i>12 hospitals
turned her down. 12.</i>

112
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,075
<i>They say the odds are too lon.</i>

113
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,628
But I am ready to fight, Montel.

114
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,281
I just need a surgeon
brave enough to help me.

115
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:04,536
Yeah, you can see we
all want this for you, Dawn.

116
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,981
- Right?
- Yes.

117
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,623
- We want this for your family.
- Thank you.

118
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,160
And that's why today
you're gonna meet a surgeon

119
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:15,863
who not only has the
courage but also has the skills

120
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,794
<i>to do the Mother
of All Surgeries.</i>

121
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,479
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, from
Chastain Memorial Hospital,</i>

122
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:22,537
<i>please welcome
Dr. Barrett Cain to the show.</i>

123
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,050
Dawn, will you let me
fight this cancer with you?

124
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,387
You're the answer to my prayers.

125
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:50,198
Dr. Damn He's Hot can
operate on me any day.

126
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,986
Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm.

127
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,522
♪ ♪

128
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:15,356
- What's this?
- Cool hundred if you make
the next one in.

129
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,409
Save it for Augusta.

130
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:36,072
Yeah, that's where
the big money is.

131
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,629
Just hang onto it and
let me, uh, put it toward

132
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,616
a healthier wager
on a real course.

133
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,052
I'm sure word must
have gotten to you by now

134
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:46,704
that I've brought in the Mother
of All Surgeries to Chastain.

135
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,692
Yeah, about that, um...

136
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:53,645
typically the chief of surgery
decides whether to take on

137
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,658
a high-risk, low-reward
surgery like that one.

138
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,250
Typically, I'm not used to
having someone vet my choices.

139
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,802
This one's
newsworthy, it's splashy.

140
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,256
This would be great
publicity for Chastain.

141
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,159
Greater than separating
conjoined twins.

142
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:13,598
Not if Chastain turns those
seven adorable foster children

143
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,645
- into orphans.
- I guarantee
that will not happen.

144
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,614
That is not a guarantee
you should make.

145
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:20,054
This surgery is
hardly that simple.

146
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,656
It's a brutal procedure.

147
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,308
It's like ten abdominal
surgeries rolled into one.

148
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,943
You're worrying too much.

149
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,346
The cancer has already
infiltrated her spine.

150
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,765
So, even if the
cancer is in end-stage,

151
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,568
the woman can die in a
week, even without the surgery.

152
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,937
Now, on the off chance
she gains no more time...

153
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,989
Or she dies on the table...

154
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,642
We gave a mother and
her seven kids hope.

155
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:43,745
We took a moon shot that
no other hospital would.

156
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,298
So, regardless of the
outcome, we're heroes.

157
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,295
Which is actually why I
came to see you today.

158
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,305
I am assembling a
team of the very best.

159
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,974
Which means you,
as my cocaptain...

160
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:01,463
we share in the
publicity and in the glory.

161
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:02,825
- Or the blame.
- You know, Randolph,

162
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,867
I actually took you
for a gambling man.

163
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,954
The PR payout on
this is off the charts.

164
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,023
What's the problem?

165
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,058
Stakes too high for you?

166
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,730
If we do this, we
could be fired.

167
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,566
If we don't, then I'm quitting.

168
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,951
Is this the breaking and
entering stage of grief?

169
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:25,520
Maybe.

170
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,055
- You backing out?
- No.

171
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,692
They say it's better
to ask for forgiveness...

172
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:33,161
Than permission.

173
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:38,394
Hey. Give me a
shot of cortisone.

174
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,419
What's wrong? Physical
therapy isn't helping?

175
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,583
No, it's helping, but
it's just a long process.

176
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,350
I need a little help
getting through today.

177
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:47,575
Hmm. No.

178
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,044
As in N-O, not a chance in hell.

179
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,324
Pain is the body's
warning system.

180
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,913
Mask it and what happens?

181
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,927
You can push yourself too
hard and hurt yourself again.

182
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,252
But I'm a doctor,
so I won't do that.

183
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,023
Here's my answer:
acetaminophen, ice, elevation.

184
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:04,392
Now, come on, I'll walk
you down to PT... ignore that.

185
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,840
Sorry.

186
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,797
I will find you, Conrad.

187
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,118
I know where you work.

188
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,910
- Traitor.
- It's a rotation
in the oncology service.

189
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,562
Everyone does rotations.

190
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,775
Yeah, but it's breaking
my heart to think of you

191
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,300
in anything but
eye-catching green scrubs.

192
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,720
Ow. ♪ <i>Babe magnet.</i> ♪

193
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:34,555
He's leaving us to roll in chemo
cash. That is not attractive.

194
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,791
It's, you know,
it's, it's betrayal.

195
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,443
Tumor biology has fascinated me

196
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,544
since my publication
in<i> JAMA Oncology.</i>

197
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,125
- You know that.
- Yeah, yeah, well, try
to remember us little people

198
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,685
down here saving lives
without kickbacks from pharma.

199
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:59,880
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

200
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,884
I'm so glad you could
make it for lunch.

201
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,485
Adaku, it's been ages.

202
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,432
The photos you've been
posting look amazing,

203
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:09,007
but it's impossible to keep
track of where you've been.

204
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,676
Kyoto, New Zealand, Norway.

205
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,245
Okay, please don't tell me

206
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,549
that this trip was
some sort of bucket list.

207
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,287
I'm not dying.

208
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,739
I've never felt more alive.

209
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:26,190
I beat breast cancer.

210
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,076
Thank goodness.

211
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:33,665
I was on a... babymoon.

212
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm pregnant.

213
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,957
Aren't you gonna say something?

214
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,594
What do you want me to say?

215
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,147
"I'm happy for you, Adaku.

216
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,160
You've wanted to be a
mother your entire life"?

217
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,229
- What did your oncologist say?
- "Congratulations"?

218
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,652
This is not a joke, Adaku.

219
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,282
Have you been
following her advice?

220
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:58,273
Completely.

221
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,775
She told me to extract
eggs before chemo, so I did.

222
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,538
She told me to wait
until after chemo

223
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,947
until we knew that I was
cancer-free to get pregnant.

224
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:09,951
And you did all of this without
telling me? Your best friend?

225
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:11,802
I didn't want to tell you,

226
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,299
because I knew
you'd say don't do it.

227
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:15,973
Have my ovaries and
tubes removed. It's safer.

228
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,626
BRCA1 mutation is definitely
linked to ovarian cancer.

229
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:20,389
Is it so awful that
I want you safe?

230
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,797
I am safe. I am healthy.

231
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:24,832
I am fit as a fiddle.

232
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:26,345
They said you were
free of breast cancer

233
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:28,253
before you got pregnant, right?

234
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,904
That was also before your
trip, so months ago now.

235
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,557
I have a friend in oncology

236
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:36,244
who can check to make
sure there's nothing worrisome

237
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,912
on your ovaries either.

238
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,514
Will you just go with
me for a quick test?

239
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,751
To... put my troubled
mind at ease?

240
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,054
Yes, dear Mina,

241
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,955
I can do that.

242
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,943
Yes, yes, yes.

243
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,330
We get this once a month.

244
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:56,815
It's me and you, baby.

245
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:04,866
Doughnut holes
are my preference.

246
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,507
Baker's dozen.

247
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,560
Glazed, chocolate, jelly.

248
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,544
Finish with the powder.

249
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:10,589
I like to get my hands dirty

250
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,564
in my work and my baked goods,

251
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,383
but I do not dunk.

252
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:16,901
That's me.

253
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,720
Speaking of me, I am...

254
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:21,372
I know who you are.

255
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,435
There were photos of you
in the files e-mailed to me

256
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,292
by the adoption agency.

257
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,062
You are my egg
donor's sperm donor.

258
00:12:28,098 --> 00:12:30,381
"Biological father"
works just as well.

259
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,533
Ah, the word "father"
in any capacity

260
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,885
is reserved for the
man who raised me.

261
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,087
Come on, dawg.

262
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,657
I-I-In what world did ambushing
me like this make sense?

263
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,092
I have my reasons.

264
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,560
Now, you can either hear me out

265
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,457
or do your damnedest
to chase me off.

266
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:46,781
Don't push my buttons,

267
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:49,167
or I will push back and I
will decimate your buttons.

268
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:50,679
You gonna play
fair, I can take it.

269
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,837
But you cross a
line, I will defend

270
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,307
with a tongue just
as keen as yours.

271
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:04,148
We are grown-ass men now.

272
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:10,504
And I am here to talk to you
about grown-ass men things.

273
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,698
Half your genes come from me,

274
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,932
and I'm dying.

275
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,668
Make an appointment.

276
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:26,353
It's hereditary.

277
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:31,392
Which means you
might be dying, too.

278
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,662
<i>If you're experiencing
immediate pain,</i>

279
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:40,947
come to the front.
Otherwise, take a seat

280
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:42,202
and we'll be right with you.

281
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,273
Everett Dobb.

282
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,493
Executive director of
the transformation team.

283
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,878
- Transformation team?
- I facilitate

284
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,831
a smooth operational shift
between the old and new regimes,

285
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,450
Chastain and Red Rock, by
managing the golden triangle

286
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:57,801
of patient safety, access,

287
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,154
- and cost.
- Well, that's a mouthful.

288
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,503
We did a cost-benefit
analysis and closed this clinic.

289
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,737
I'm not clear what
you're doing here,

290
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,406
- but you're trespassing.
- Well, Chastain

291
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,692
has an obligation to provide
health care for those in need.

292
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,899
We are a nonprofit
hospital and tax-exempt,

293
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,351
so it's a legal requirement.

294
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,736
An obligation we fulfill

295
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,649
by treating the
uninsured in our ER.

296
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:18,651
I'm not sure it's considered
charity when you're turning them

297
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:21,308
into collections and docking
paychecks when they can't pay.

298
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:22,877
All of which is in alignment

299
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,757
with our core value
of fiscal responsibility

300
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,826
and... I might point
out... Is totally legal.

301
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,827
You, on the other
hand, broke the law.

302
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:30,679
I can have you arrested
for breaking and entering.

303
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,336
If you close the clinic,

304
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,600
Chastain could very well
lose its nonprofit status,

305
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,007
ending the tax break
and saddling the hospital

306
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,421
with a bill for
millions of dollars.

307
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,661
We won't be
audited for two years.

308
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:42,997
Empty this place and vacate now,

309
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:44,565
or I will call the police.

310
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:52,935
I know you already know this,

311
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,087
but Dr. Grisham is going to
do a transvaginal ultrasound.

312
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:57,711
It'll allow us to check
your reproductive organs

313
00:14:57,747 --> 00:14:59,080
for any signs of cancer.

314
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,592
Remember, don't get
distracted by the fetus.

315
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:02,900
Just make sure her
ovaries look normal.

316
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,069
I love her, but she's bossy.

317
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,406
I love her because she's bossy.

318
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,790
Never say that again.

319
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,237
Okay, guys, we're
ready to start.

320
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,678
I'll be outside if you need me.

321
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,376
<i>Grisham's the best</i>

322
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,365
and always busy.

323
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:19,366
Thanks for getting us in.

324
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:20,368
No worries.

325
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:21,769
She's lucky to have you.

326
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:24,104
But, Mina, don't
scare her off too much.

327
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,889
Let her enjoy being pregnant.

328
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,392
I've watched too many women,
particularly women of color,

329
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,473
be harmed because no
one was looking out for them.

330
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:31,779
You know that as well as anyone.

331
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:33,213
I hear you.

332
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:34,949
But Adaku's getting great care,

333
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:36,601
and she's done everything right.

334
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,437
Her dream of becoming
a mother is coming true.

335
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,256
Except the pregnancy hormones
might bring her cancer back

336
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,276
or increase the risk
of ovarian cancer.

337
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,661
I'm afraid of losing her.

338
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:50,664
I know.

339
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,528
Triple negative
breast cancer is scary.

340
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,512
But we understand
more about it every day.

341
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,487
And now we can analyze tumor DNA

342
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,084
and know that
Adaku is less likely

343
00:15:58,108 --> 00:15:59,818
to respond to
pregnancy hormones.

344
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:02,092
It won't increase her
risk of reoccurrence.

345
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,946
Your fear is understandable

346
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:06,798
but groundless.

347
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,366
I promise.

348
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,303
I got to go.

349
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,454
Keep me posted, okay?

350
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,056
Thank you.

351
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,704
<i>Lamar gave me full access</i>

352
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,040
to his medical
file, and it indicates

353
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,181
his emphysema's in early stages.

354
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,349
So he's not dying?

355
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,934
No.

356
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:29,520
He does have the alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency.

357
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,023
Which can lead to end-stage
lung disease over time

358
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,190
but nothing imminent.

359
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,692
Exactly.

360
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,695
So now I'm gonna draw some blood

361
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,691
and see if you have
the deficiency as well.

362
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,192
Why would he show
up and lie like that?

363
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:42,527
I don't know, to
get the attention

364
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:44,001
of the child he gave away?

365
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,803
Yeah, but why?

366
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,455
I think there's more to
the story than you know.

367
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:51,475
You think?

368
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,560
Initial diagnosis.

369
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,830
Biology's a huge bitch, man.

370
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:59,166
I mean, Lamar rolls up on me

371
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:01,135
with my walk, my talk.

372
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,804
I never met the man, but
it's obvious we share DNA.

373
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,173
Yeah, well, I struggled to
give my dad a second chance

374
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,859
for a lot of reasons.

375
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,838
But then, when I
decided to let him in a bit,

376
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,590
I discovered some things,
some good things about him

377
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,075
I wouldn't have known
if I'd just shut him out.

378
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,499
Well, you and your dad were
estranged, but he raised you.

379
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,084
You had a foundation.

380
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,903
This man gave me away.

381
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,256
He married my biological
mom, had three more kids,

382
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,041
full siblings to me,

383
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,411
and none of 'em
cared to look me up.

384
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:28,929
Until now.

385
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,123
I am very excited to consult
on the Mother of All Surgeries.

386
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,542
The cancer has spread from
her appendix to her colon,

387
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:45,362
ovaries, gall bladder,
kidneys, and peritoneum.

388
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,015
It's hard to believe
it's even operable.

389
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,800
- It isn't.
- One opinion.

390
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,237
I'll remove any visible
tumor I see, meticulously,

391
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,216
even if it means
taking the entire organ.

392
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,407
Then the cavity will be filled

393
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,121
with hot chemo;
we'll bathe them.

394
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,028
Scalding-hot chemo.

395
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:02,063
107 degrees.

396
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:04,198
Enough to burn or destroy

397
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:06,483
any microscopic
cells that remain.

398
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,868
But still won't touch

399
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:10,387
the lesion wrapped
around her spinal column,

400
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,490
with a pathological fracture.

401
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,893
Which is why you're an
essential part of the surgery.

402
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,606
I'm assuming you'll be
taking the anterior approach

403
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,657
to the spinal lesions?

404
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,248
I won't be doing a damn thing.

405
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:24,301
The cancer is too
widespread and too aggressive.

406
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,887
The only acceptable
approach here is hospice.

407
00:18:26,923 --> 00:18:28,889
This is a high-profile case.

408
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:30,774
There's a family counting on us.

409
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,176
And we will fail them.

410
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:35,996
If so much as a cell, one
cell of tumor is missed,

411
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,431
which we know will happen,

412
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:39,433
the cancer will grow back

413
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:41,813
before the patient even recovers
from this barbaric surgery.

414
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:44,671
I'm gonna make sure this
poor woman understands that.

415
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,474
Malia, Malia, Malia,
Malia, grab him.

416
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,332
- Oh.
- Hello, darling.

417
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,427
You don't want to go out there.

418
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:57,279
It's much nicer in
here with Mummy.

419
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,970
So, guys, hey, listen up.

420
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,840
These are the doctors
that are gonna be helping

421
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,342
Dr. Cain save Mom.

422
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,057
- Can you say hey?
- You're gonna save Mom?

423
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,667
Oh.

424
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:13,100
Yeah. Hey, you know, I
heard that the cafeteria's having

425
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:17,955
kind of a special on ice
cream sundaes today.

426
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,301
Maybe you could go down
there and tell them Dr. Bell said

427
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,351
to have a treat on him.

428
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,570
Ice cream! Yay!

429
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,495
Shh!

430
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,197
Quiet, bunnies.

431
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,532
All right.

432
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,217
Hop, hop, hop.

433
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,003
Hop, hop, hop,
hop, hop, hop, hop,

434
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,155
hop, hop, hop, hop.

435
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:36,535
They're quite the handful.

436
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,514
Malia should be
in college right now.

437
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,316
I have to get better so
I can take over again.

438
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,636
Dawn, would you mind
telling me what you understand

439
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:51,071
about your prognosis?

440
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:57,811
I understand everything.

441
00:19:57,846 --> 00:20:00,548
In the best-case
scenario, this isn't a cure.

442
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,051
There is only a slim hope
this will buy you more time.

443
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:06,270
I'll take it.

444
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:10,173
And do you also understand
that it's far more likely

445
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,244
that you'll have less
time with your children?

446
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,613
This surgery is so dangerous,
y-you may not survive.

447
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,118
I'm dying anyway.

448
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,570
The odds may be long

449
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:26,907
that this will help, but
I want to beat them.

450
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:28,608
And I want to help you, but...

451
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,060
No buts.

452
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:34,064
I will do anything,
against any odds,

453
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,250
to stay with my kids

454
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:39,553
as long as I can.

455
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:40,938
I can't give up.

456
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:48,206
I still don't think there's
a chance that surgery

457
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,092
is going to give that
poor woman more time.

458
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:53,483
I have spoken to her at length,
and she understands that.

459
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,270
Yeah, she seems
perfectly aware of the lunacy

460
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:59,039
that is the Mother
of All Surgeries.

461
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:00,835
And in the end,
it's her decision.

462
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,310
Well, exactly, and she is
gonna have this surgery

463
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,996
with or without Chastain.

464
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,496
After her last TV appearance,

465
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,510
other hospitals tried
to poach her case.

466
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,051
They're less qualified,
and they don't have you.

467
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:12,803
Don't worry, I'm in.

468
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:17,123
But not because I agree.

469
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,072
But because I'm gonna
make good and damn well sure

470
00:21:20,096 --> 00:21:22,829
that Dawn makes
it off that table alive

471
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,025
and wakes up to have
as many days as possible

472
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,534
with her children.

473
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:39,924
<i>The clinic costs Chastain
money, end of story.</i>

474
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:42,983
I have graphs and charts that
show it actually saves money

475
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:44,285
by diverting the uninsured...

476
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,503
Your charts don't include
infrastructure costs.

477
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,638
And besides, what
matters most is income.

478
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,668
With surgeons who
bill $80 million a year

479
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:52,643
and do TV interviews.

480
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,489
What benefits the bottom
line benefits everyone.

481
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,114
So now it's profit and
publicity over patients.

482
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,161
You forget yourself. I
care as much as you do

483
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,651
about our patients.

484
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,314
Everything I do,
including publicity,

485
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:04,037
is for profits and patients,

486
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,001
because you can't have
one without the other.

487
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:09,209
And by the way, I don't
owe you an explanation.

488
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:20,721
These are all 3-D printed

489
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,517
exact replicas of
Dawn's anatomy.

490
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,192
I downloaded all the data
from Dawn's 2-D scans

491
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:27,244
and images into the computer,

492
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,796
then the brain machine combines

493
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:30,358
all that information
and prints it out.

494
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,733
And these tiny little
bumps on the kidneys...

495
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,718
Are tumors.

496
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,506
I only see three or so,

497
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,258
but I feel at least seven more.

498
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:44,762
It's part of the reason this
surgery is so complicated.

499
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,864
We'll wear gloves and
feel for tumors, inch by inch,

500
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,217
through the entire
abdominal cavity.

501
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:53,169
It'll take hours and
there is no room for error.

502
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,872
Which is why you're practicing.

503
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,340
Over and over.

504
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,211
This is my third go and I still
haven't managed to remove

505
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,175
the vertebral body
without compromising

506
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:05,932
the iliac artery, which is
plastered to it by the tumor.

507
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:10,187
"Fake Dawn" has
bled out every time.

508
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,455
Come on, Pravesh.

509
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,157
Spread the cavity.

510
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,710
If the corpectomy

511
00:23:16,745 --> 00:23:19,195
is causing problems, should
we get Cain in here to rehearse?

512
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,915
He thinks it's unnecessary.

513
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,535
Bell didn't RSVP either.

514
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,454
And believe me, this is not a
surgery that can be improvised.

515
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,369
You like that car?

516
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:44,588
It's hideous.

517
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:46,473
I designed it.

518
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,143
Frame-off restoration
built with these hands.

519
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,780
It's my passion.

520
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:54,631
It's what keeps me honest.

521
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,450
Does it?

522
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:57,979
That's funny,
because you certainly

523
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,586
didn't keep it honest with me.

You wanted to know if I

528
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:15,101
Well, yes, of course,
but I thought...

529
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:16,637
You thought what, Lamar?

530
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,325
If you are my son...

531
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,593

would carry the gene.

532
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,362

533
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,686
Wow, you don't know.

534
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,955
That's why you came.

535
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,674
What, you thought maybe Bio-Mom

536
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,202
was sleeping around
when she got pregnant?

537
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,810
Is that why you gave me away?

538
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,389

wasn't yours to begin with?

539
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,846
I may not have raised you,

540
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,365
but I'm not gonna stand here
and have you disrespect me.

541

sit your ass down,

someone I have no respect for.

545

We were young. It was the '70s.

some help over here!

Put him down gently.
Let him down gently.

567

I'll get a gurney.

568

- I was.

Since you implanted
your embryos,

578
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:31,404
you were able to test them
for the BRCA gene mutation

579
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,273
and select one without it.

580
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:41,248
You did... select an embryo
that didn't carry the mutation?

581
00:26:42,752 --> 00:26:45,235
Oh, no. Please...

582
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,971

is my decision, Mina.

It's not only yours, Adaku.

It's also the life

This awful disease killed
your mother and your sisters.

587
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:56,641
With one test, you could have
protected your child from it.

I will not play God.

589
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,134
God answered my
prayers. He delivered me

590
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:04,754
- from breast cancer.
- I got you through
breast cancer.

591
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,324
I brought my mother from Nigeria
to come and operate on you.

592
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,159
And I am so grateful.

593

But I also see
God's hand in that.

594

Then why not see his
hand in genetic testing?

595

Science froze your embryos,
medicine got you pregnant.

596
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,763
Without doctors, you
would have no baby.

597
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:20,753
You wanted me to
get an oophorectomy.

598

If I followed your
advice, I'd have no baby.

600

who does need my help.

lumbosacral plexus,

698
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:21,314
but the arterial wall
has been compromised.

699
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:23,400
Time to pull.

700
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,384
Slow and steady.

701
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:28,371
One moment.

702
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,744
Got it.

703
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,731
Deep breath worked the magic?

704
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:58,434
Picturing her kids watching
me, hopeful. That's the magic.

00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,772
- All yours, Dr. Cain.
- It's about time.

707
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,608
Get the microscope in place.

708
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07,093
I need somatosensory and
motor EPs on the screen.

709
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,288
Foot and a half from
lead position. Eye level.

710

A little room.

711
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,096
We're gonna double-check
everything in the abdomen

712
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,964
once you've finished to
make sure we've got it.

713
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,187
How much longer?

714
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,606
- Two more hours?
- Nope. Won't take that long.

715
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,926
I need some curettes,
couple of sutures,

716

and some Megadeth
on the jukebox.

717
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:28,381
Spine surgeries beg
for headbanging tunes.

718
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,932
Is that irony?

719
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:41,928
Dissecting the tumor
off the dural sac.

720
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:43,923

Yeah. Surgery was long.

761
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:55,761
My "Mother of All Surgeries"
patient was just on TV,

762
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,692
and I wanted to catch
it before heading home.

763
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,749
Barely made it out of surgery.

764
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:02,001

I don't know, man.

768
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,276
You know, my first
day at Chastain,

769
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,128
I was planning on
going into oncology.

770
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,536
Mm, but then the infamous
Lane Hunter came along.

771
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,589
Well, she was an anomaly.

772
00:37:22,624 --> 00:37:25,091
Criminal, psychopath.

773
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:27,427
I mean, the majority
of oncologists

774
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:30,263
are caring people
dedicated to saving lives.

775
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:33,482
When the treatment cures
the patient, that's one thing,

776
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,968
but what may help one patient

777
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,905
will harm or even kill another,
often without any benefit.

778
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,118
It's impossible to know
where your patient will fall

779
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:43,337
on that spectrum before
you start treating them.

780
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,006
That's why, sometimes,
I miss being a medic

781
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,714
with the patrol units
downrange. That job was clear.

782
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,651
We could be proud of what
we did every day. No gray areas.

783
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,603
But...

784
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,772
all this

785
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,519
corporatized medicine,
profit over patients,

786
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:01,143
I guess I just look at it as a
different kind of battlefield.

787
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,512
One where we need
to keep showing up,

788
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:05,798
keep fighting, keep
making a difference.

789
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:08,468
No matter what the
odds are against us.

790
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:11,136
Yeah.

791
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,605
Yeah.

792
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,018
Big-time oncologist

793
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,771
just couldn't stay away, huh?

794
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,607
My toe! Oh, my
God, I need a doctor!

795
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,977

out of control without me.

796

Bed 4, perfect for you.

797
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:40,099
You'll want a wardrobe
change and some gloves.

798
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:41,450
What's the bullet?

799
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,536
Patient's been
stopped up for weeks.

800
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,522
Disimpaction time.

801
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:48,558

802
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:51,361

803
00:38:57,319 --> 00:38:59,402

enough. Thank you.

804
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:02,238

00:39:02,274 --> 00:39:04,151

806
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,826

- Yeah.

807
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:10,074

what you guys are doing here.

808
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,742

809
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,043
Well, thank you so
much. I appreciate it.

810
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,395

newsworthy cases.

817
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:26,746
I'm telling you, Dr. Bell,

818
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,832
- he's one of the good ones.
- Well, as a nonprofit,

819
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,985
charity work is an essential
part of Chastain's mission.

820
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,565
You know, I can
see the segment now:

821
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:38,207

823
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,072

825
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:44,708
- And thank you.
- Thank you.

826
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:46,382
Yes, ma'am.

827
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:49,518

828
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,704
Neat trick.

829
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,589
It won't work again.

830
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,269
I made this for the baby.

831
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:07,887
Is this your apology?

832
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:10,789
I can't apologize for wishing
you'd done genetic testing,

833
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,792
but it is your choice,

834
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,477

did not respect that.

838
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,103
I have no idea what that is.

839
