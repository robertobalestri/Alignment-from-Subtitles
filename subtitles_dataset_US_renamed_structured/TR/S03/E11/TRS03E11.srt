<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- If I hadn't gotten injured,

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:05,787
they might not have
caught my cancer in time.

3
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:07,984
- Your supplements
have potential.
- You killed my pitch.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,820
You said Chastain
doesn't take chances.

5
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,125
They don't.

6
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:12,538
<i>- I do.
- So what's your plan</i>

7
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:14,713
if Adaku's baby becomes
your responsibility?

8
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,893
<i>- I don't have one.
- Hawkins is</i>

9
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,812
a whistle-blower. He's
a threat to the hospital.

10
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:20,018
I'll handle it.

11
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,220
Dr. Hawkins, you lied
to the transplant board.

12
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,857
You're fired. Give
me your pager.

13
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:28,193
Thank you.

14
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,657
<i>We're a high-volume outfit.</i>

15
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,016
A lot of kitchen mishaps
and food poisoning.

16
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,768
Waiting room's packed 24/7,

17
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,103
- so ten minutes per patient.
- And if the diagnosis

18
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,298
isn't obvious, and it
takes over ten minutes?

19
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,455
We also take pride in
customer satisfaction.

20
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,995
Your bonuses are tied to it.

21
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:48,830
So... flexible prescribing,

22
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:50,460
if you know what I mean.

23
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,000
Patients hate being told "no."

24
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:53,730
Yeah. Isn't that
what contributed

25
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,104
to the opioid crisis?

26
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,657
And<i> why</i> did you say you're

27
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,292
<i>If it were easy, everyone

28

29

Or maybe it will.

44
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:48,617
Okay.

45
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:52,003
Yeah.

47
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:20,882
Good morning, everyone.

48
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:23,151
I'm Dr. Garrison,
your chief resident.

49
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,552
Welcome, second-year residents.

50
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:26,721
You'll be getting interns
of your own today.

51
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,367
You will be their
mentors, their teachers.

52
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,259
Do not hesitate to work
them like pack mules.

53
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,079
The hospital relies
on their cheap labor.

54
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,858
No questions. There
are only two rules...

55
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,983
No one quits, no one dies.

56
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,428
Uh, Dr. Pravesh?

57
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,564
Ezra Dreyfuss, your intern.

58
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,182
Hey, Ezra. Welcome.

59
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,745
- And I'm Eline.
- Oh.

60
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,447
You didn't have to come.
Your son's in good hands.

61
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,803
Oh, she's not my mother.

62
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,572
I am also your intern.

63
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,707
Sorry. I-I wasn't expecting...

64
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,528
- You thought I'd be older?
- No, no, no. I... Of course not.

65
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:08,263
I-I meant...

66
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,233
There are two of you.

67
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:13,051
Eline, Ezra.

68
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,064
I'm thrilled to welcome
you to Chastain.

69
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,466
You know, on my
first day as a doctor...

70
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,441
Before you go all William
Wallace on us, I am highly

71
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,137
allergic to any
form of nut or dairy.

72
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,878
If I come into contact
with either, I will drop dead.

73
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:25,630
Sorry. Please continue.

74
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,432
Got it.

75
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,969
Today will set you on the
course for the rest of your lives.

76
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,455
So, when there are tough times,

77
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,658
just remember why you
decided to be a doctor.

78
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,393
Eline?

79
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,111
You ever met an intern

80
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,513
who watched a loved one
die of an incurable disease,

81
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,099
quit work to become a caregiver,

82
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:48,120
drew inspiration from
the medical professionals

83
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,021
they met throughout the disease,

84
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:52,490
enrolled in medical school
and became a doctor?

85
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:57,361
If that person is you,
then... then, yes, I have.

86
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,080
That person is<i> not</i> me.

87
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:00,693
- Oh.
- I was teaching math

88
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,695
to a bunch of third-grade
terrorists, and I was deeply

89
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,964
- inspired
to get the hell out of there.
- Wow.

90
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,132
- That's hilarious. Okay, my turn.
- Pravesh,

91
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:08,974
need you and your
children in Bay 3.

92
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,959
Thank you.

93
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:14,345
Odel. Dr. Pravesh.

94
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,499
If it's okay with you, I'd like
to have my interns observe.

95
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,118
Of course.

96
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,787
So, uh, I've had this
cough for a few weeks now.

97
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,451
- Okay. Just the cough?
- Just the cough.

98
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,190
It's called an emergency room.

99
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,460
I know, but I'm going to
Cambodia tomorrow, so I thought

100
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,473
I'd have it checked out,
and I didn't want to end up

101
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,509
in some remote village
clinic if it got worse.

102
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,683
Okay. Let me take
a look. Deep breath.

103
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,136
I backpacked through
Cambodia in college.

104
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,288
- You are gonna love it.
- Yeah?

105
00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:43,808
I have been to England
once with the symphony,

106
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,293
and that's about it.

107
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,795
- Atlanta Symphony?
- Yeah. I play cello.

108
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,542
You ever play with
Gianni Balissa?

109
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:52,367
- He taught me everything I know.
- Me, too.

110
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:55,469
I was honorary recipient of the
Sousa Band Award for the violin.

111
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:57,000
Let me guess. You're
a musical genius.

112
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,175
Uh... yeah. Yeah.

113
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,660
Dr. Pravesh!

114
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,223
Scooter versus fire
hydrant, we need you.

115
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:05,391
Beethoven, you're with me.

116
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:06,425
Eline, I want you
to finish doing

117
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,849
a full physical exam on Odel,

118
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,328
and report back to
me when you're done.

119
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:12,186
- You have got to be kidding me.
- I don't think he is.

120
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:14,389
More than half of
hospitals pay doctors

121
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:17,542
based on relative value
units instead of set salaries.

122
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,210
Think of it as capitalism.

123
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,713
The more procedures,
biopsies, test diagnostic surgeries

124
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,544
you do, the more money
you'll make; it's that simple.

125
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,095
So, what, are we
car salesmen now?

126
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,704
Commission-based pay systems
lead to rampant overtreatment.

127
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,183
- I've seen it myself.
- You concerned we'll all see

128
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:33,207
how you really
measure up, Dr. Austin?

129
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:34,509
Maybe you're not as valuable

130
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:35,855
to the hospital as
you think you are.

131
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,445
Well, depending on your values,

132
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,047
you might be right, Dr. Cain.

133
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,935
This isn't a discussion, it's
Red Rock policy from now on.

134
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,187
You'll be paid for the
volume of work you do.

135
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:48,439
And quality is irrelevant.

136
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,819
Nobody said that.

137
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,683
Neither of you had to.

138
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,130
Don't worry, Dr. B.

139
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,626
You won't be out here with
the minnows for too long.

140
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,050
I can feel it in my heart space.

141
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,153
Ooh, sorry. Sorry,
it's for my new boss.

142
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,833
What's the meeting about?

143
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,306
Just boring pay stuff.

144
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,825
Nothing like what's
arranged for you tonight.

145
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,822
Grayson, you don't run
my schedule anymore.

146
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,307
Well, my dad
hasn't caught on yet,

147
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,098
and he called me to tell you...
Now, don't hug the messenger...

148
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,467
But, Dr. B., you're
about to present 3B Life

149
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,102
to the U.S. of A.

150
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:22,106
So suit up and get camera-ready,
'cause you're gonna be on TV.

151
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,153
Oh, he got the spot on<i> Montel?</i>

152
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,760
Better. STV, baby.

153
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:27,262
Shopping Television?

154
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,407
I mean, this is incredible.
This could make our...

155
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:31,282
Our supplement line
an industry player.

156
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,828
It all depends on you,
though, so get that face ready

157
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,969
for the small screen.

158
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:45,079
There she is. Nurse
among nurses.

159
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:47,164
It's so good to see you, Finn.

160
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,318
Oh... How's the book coming?

161
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:53,338
Published. Yeah, and
not self-published, either.

162
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,790
Real published. Smell the ink.

163
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,959
That's amazing. Congrats.

164
00:07:57,995 --> 00:07:59,805
I hear you and Hawkins
live together now.

165
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,963
Sounds like Dr. Feldman
gave you an update.

166
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:04,815
- I hope he's a tidy roommate.
- Mm, getting there.

167
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:08,152
- Yeah.
- Wow.

168
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,604
All the details
of the life of Finn.

169
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,039
Flip to page three.

170
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,710
I'm pretty sure
you're responsible

171
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,385
for beating the odds.

172
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,038
Uh, where's Conrad? I've
got a copy for him, too, so...

173
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,640
He's not here anymore.

174
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,291
No, he practically lives here.

175
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:31,659
Well, I'm covering for him.

176
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:35,212
Which means I
have your test results.

177
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:40,384
I wish I had better news.

178
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,487
I've reached my final chapter.

179
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,317
My lung function's
deteriorating,

180
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:46,690
which means I'll be on a
breathing machine soon,

181
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,887
and then will go the way of
all my friends with Duchenne.

182
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:52,196
I am so sorry.

183
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,717
Well, bad news is no stranger
when you have a body like mine.

184
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:57,318
I know where I am.

185
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:59,387
Which is why I'm here.

186
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,189
I want to do something crazy

187
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:02,768
with the little
time I have left.

188
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,376
What are you planning, Finn?

189
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,088
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

190
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,635
One of your favorite
patients is here. Finn Niver.

191
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,126
- How is he?
<i>- As feisty as ever.</i>

192
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,893
But, um...

193
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,896
This is the end, isn't it?

194
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,782
Yeah.

195
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,717
I need to see him.

196
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,419
Well, that can be arranged.

197
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:33,571
You know I can't
set foot inside there.

198
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,106
<i>Well, not at Chastain.</i>

199
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,769
<i>There's something
that Finn wants to do,</i>

200
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,913
<i>and he needs a
doctor to do it with him.</i>

201
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:44,949
I'm listening.

202
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,819
How do you feel
about space travel?

203
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:00,414
You eat, sleep, and
breathe this place,

204
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,899
and the day I need you most,

205
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,312
I find out you don't
work here anymore?

206
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,635
What happened?

207
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,740
Ah, it's a long story, Finn.

208
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,308
Someone was a bit

209
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,844
cagey on the phone
about why I'm needed, so...

210
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,097
All I said was it's a
beautiful day to ditch gravity.

211
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,398
Good one. Nice work, Nevin.

212
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,434
What are we talking
about? Skydiving?

213
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:22,236
Hell no. I have
been tied to this chair

214
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:24,422
since I was five
years old; I want out.

215
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,525
I want to fly. I want to
float like I own the place.

216
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,410
In zero-g.

217
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:30,912
Zero gravity?

218
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:32,758
I sent a pandering
letter to the company

219
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:34,515
that does zero-g flights,

220
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,018
and they gifted tickets for me
and a doctor of my choosing.

221
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,353
So, you in?

222
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,755
Guys...

223
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,524
it is definitely crazy.

224
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,476
Which is exactly why I'm in!

225
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,645
Yes! Oh, let's do it.

226
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,502
I know this is as much
for me as it is for Finn,

227
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:56,854
and... I appreciate it.

228
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,807
I had nothing to do with
it. It was all Finn's idea.

229
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,130
Have fun.

230
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,464
Mom calls them brain
damage on wheels.

231
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:13,822
In her ICU in Boston,
a quarter of the beds

232
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:15,801
are always filled
with scooter patients.

233
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:18,745
- So I got off easy?
- Because you were
wearing a helmet.

234
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,312
So, how's it going with Odel?

235
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,391
He really wanted answers,

236
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,059
so I called Pulmonology
for a consult.

237
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,812
Dr. Langford recommended
a bronchoscopy

238
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:27,718
- just to be sure.
- He has a cough

239
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,565
with clear lungs and
a normal chest X-ray.

240
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,350
He didn't need a
Pulmonology consult.

241
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:32,501
The patient wanted one.

242
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,186
And he's about to travel.
I was in Nairobi once,

243
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,506
- caught this nasty parasite
and, um...
- Both of you, follow me.

244
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,962
Okay.

245
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, guess we're too late.

246
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,764
Can I help you with
something, Dr. Pravesh?

247
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,337
This procedure is unnecessary.

248
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,506
Step out, please.
This is now my patient.

249
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:52,827
O2 sat is dropping.

250
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:54,095
He's aspirating.

251
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,431
Turn up the suction.
Get him on 100% O2

252
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,716
and abort the bronch.

253
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,780
- Wh-What's happening?
- He's choking on his own vomit.

254
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,853
No invasive procedure
is completely safe.

255
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,189
You have to weigh the
danger of a simple cough

256
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,893
against an unintended
consequence like this one.

257
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,912
Yikes.

258
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,771
He's stable.

259
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,467
- That's something.
- But he has to be admitted.

260
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,740
He's on supplemental oxygen

261
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,487
and will need
antibiotics to treat

262
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,979
the aspiration pneumonia caused
by an unnecessary bronchoscopy.

263
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,032
He wanted answers. I consulted
an experienced pulmonologist

264
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,483
who suggested the bronchoscopy.

265
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,936
Which is a relatively
benign procedure

266
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,931
- with good diagnostic yield.
- Stop.

267
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,872
It's simple.

268
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:39,957
You made a mistake.

269
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,637
You need to
accept responsibility,

270
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,278
learn and move on.

271
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,983
You read Annie Diamonte's chart?

272
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,801
Yes. I recommend

273
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,564
you start with the good
news and finish with the bad.

274
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:54,989
Well, I prefer to
close on the positive.

275
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:00,161
- Hey.
- Hey.

276
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,324
You know, we really have
to stop meeting like this.

277
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,749
You know, as much as I enjoy
seeing you, Annie, I agree.

278
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,813
I was really hoping
that last chest tube

279
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,303
would have taken care of it,

280
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:11,416
but your CT scan
shows that you still have

281
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,774
what's called an empyema,

282
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:14,936
an infection between
your lung and your chest,

283
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,638
which is what's
causing your fevers.

284
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,779
But there's good news.

285
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:20,481
We saw your scan...

286
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,117
and no sign of cancer.

287
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:25,486
The immunotherapy is working.

288
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,937
What?

289
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,622
My cancer's gone?

290
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:29,969
Yeah.

291
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:31,953
Well, you know, you really
should have led with that.

292
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,794
I was gonna

293
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,814
tell you to stop the
drugs and let me go.

294
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,889
So... so what's the plan?

295
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,392
I mean, another chest
tube? New antibiotic?

296
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,338
Well, we are actually
here to talk to you

297
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,829
about another
option. A decortication.

298
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,631
We open your chest,
then we clear the infection,

299
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,795
and we scrape off the peel
that's trapping your lung,

300
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,314
which is what's making
it hard for you to breathe.

301
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,654
What could go wrong?

302
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,000
Plenty.

303
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,252
This is a very
high-risk surgery.

304
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,658
There's a high likelihood

305
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:07,194
of bleeding, which
could be catastrophic,

306
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:09,196
particularly given the trauma

307
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:10,759
you've already been
through from the explosion.

308
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,700
And even if Dr. Austin

309
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,852
is able to do the
surgery successfully,

310
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,622
your lung may never reexpand.

311
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:23,645
What are my alternatives?

312
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,180
I mean, I live my
life in and out of here,

313
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:29,316
sick and in limbo,
buy my time till I die?

314
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,985
I can't do that.

315
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,837
And if my cancer's in remission,

316
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,524
I have a shot at
getting my life back.

317
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:40,544
You do understand
the risks of surgery?

318
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,112
Yeah. Well, whatever they are,

319
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,682
I'll take my chances.

320
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,601
Oh, wow.

321
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,372
<i>For yourself or
for someone else,</i>

322
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,725
<i>- this is something...</i>
- I'm gone

323
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,376
a matter of weeks,

324
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:57,206
you're in the
servants' quarters,

325
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,132
and my son, one of the best
doctors at Chastain, is fired?

326
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,900
I'm not responsible for that.

327
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,718
Obviously.

328
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:06,887
Conrad is dodging my calls.

329
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:09,256
His way of asking
me to stand down.

330
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,776
- Hmm. Well, stand down.
- My lawyers are submitting

331
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,744
a whistleblower suit.

332
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,697
You know how many
are filed every year?

333
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,700
Whistleblower protection
is a joke in Georgia.

334
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,285
I'll tell you what'll happen.

335
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,938
Red Rock will sue you
for libel, and they may win.

336
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:27,108
So I'm taking advice from
a guy who's lost two jobs

337
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:28,754
- in two weeks?
- Yeah.

338
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:30,756
Being demoted by
these people is an honor.

339
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,113
How do we fight back?

340
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,633
Well, you got a slingshot?

341
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,419
Look, all due respect, don't
go down that path until you have

342
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,771
- a bulletproof strategy.
- Oh, I've got one.

343
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,322
Well, if you're hell-bent
on moving forward,

344
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,896
then I suggest...

345
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:51,716
you have a look at Logan Kim.

346
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:54,652
Thanks.

347
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,609
Dr. Austin.

348
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,779
Watch the coat. It's custom.

349
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,780
I don't like wrinkles.

350
00:16:06,816 --> 00:16:09,867
Well, here's one. I'm
reviewing mortality outcomes

351
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,786
of all surgeons,
and you're an outlier.

352
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,638
Your stats aren't up to par.

353
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,819
And as chief, your outcomes
are now my outcomes.

354
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:20,143
Come on, bruh. Everybody knows
that my outcomes are excellent

355
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,628
for the kind of cases I take.

356
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:24,382
My patients are the
sickest. My surgeries, risky.

357
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,378
Which is precisely my
point. Annie Diamonte's

358
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,480
upcoming surgery is
too much of a long shot.

359
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,449
- You need to reassess.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

360
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:31,856
Hold up.

361
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:35,459
You don't want me to do a
highly profitable procedure?

362
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,128
- The crème de la crème of RVUs?
- I'm only suggesting

363
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,530
that you have a plan B.

364
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,298
An escape hatch, so to speak.

365
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,018
Oh. So if something
catastrophic were to happen,

366
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:46,132
you want me to keep
her alive at all costs,

367
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:47,788
not let her die on my table,

368
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:49,701
- just to pad my stats.
- What I'm saying to you,

369
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,026
Dr. Austin, is
that your statistics

370
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:54,039
don't meet what I
expect from my surgeons.

371
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:57,131
So, yes, you keep
her alive at all costs

372
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,666
and don't mention a
DNR to your patient.

373
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,843
As the plane descends,
we'll vary the flight profiles

374
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,212
so you can feel the
weightlessness of both martian

375
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,435
and lunar gravity.

376
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,920
So this isn't a free fall.

377
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,354
That's Kimmy.

378
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:23,224
She makes these crazy
videos in the best way.

379
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,120
She may be a living emoji.

380
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,872
- Shh.
- You'll also experience...

381
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:28,412
And that's Reggie Perez.

382
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,398
Retired Atlanta United defender,

383
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,077
- 2015 to 2017.
- Hey, you're

384
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:34,079
in good company, Finn,
but they got nothing on you.

385
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,702
You're the real badass here.

386
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,955
Don't ever forget that.

387
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,968
You'll experience 15 simulations

388
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,793
in total in increments of
about 30 seconds a pop.

389
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,379
Most people think that
zero-g is only experienced

390
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:47,881
- when the plane is in a dive.
- Hey, Reggie.

391
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,501
Yeah.

392
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,604
I was MVP of the Golden Kickers

393
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,450
till my career
ended at age five.

394
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,275
But mini-me could have
taken mini-you down.

395
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,039
I don't doubt it
for a second, bud.

396
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,757
Well, once we're weightless,
it's an even playing field,

397
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,246
and I am coming for you.

398
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,616
And I'm scared.

399
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,102
I'll see you out there.

400
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,920
He said he's scared.

401
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,823
Does he look scared?

402
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,791
No.

403
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,287
Of Course all the
rush and excitement

404
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:16,922
come with perils, like nausea.

405
00:18:16,946 --> 00:18:18,757
It's called vomit
comet for a reason.

406
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:21,331
But there are also other
risks, including dizziness,

407
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,950
fluctuating blood pressure.

408
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,130
There are very rare but
very real complications

409
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,971
aside from the vomit
issue, of course...

410
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:31,008
Are<i> you</i> scared?

411
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,678
You can change your mind.
It's totally fine if you are.

412
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,446
It's not, really.

413
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,276
'Cause then I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life

414
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,100
wondering "what if."

415
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:43,453
Means my final weeks would
be torture, and I can't do that.

416
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,133
We'll take those
signed waivers now,

417
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,241
because it's time
for zero-g, people.

418
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,652
One thing, though, doc.

419
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,920
I know you've been
through a lot lately,

420
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:02,823
and I don't want
to make it worse.

421
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,927
Listen, if things
go south up there...

422
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,712
Like really south...

423
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:11,849
don't blame yourself, okay?

424
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,035
I mean, the worst that
happens up there is I die.

425
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,055
And is zero-g really
the worst way to go?

426
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,391
No, it isn't.

427
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:29,566
We obviously want the
surgery to be a success.

428
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:33,003
But it's risky. So
we have to ask

429
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,955
have you thought about

430
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,007
what you want if
things don't go well?

431
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,811
I've thought about it a lot
since the cancer diagnosis.

432
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,647
You know, I-I love the outdoors

433
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,200
and the physical challenges.

434
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:50,187
A life hooked up to a
machine is no life at all for me.

435
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,307
So if that is my only choice,

436
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,609
I want you to let me go.

437
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,862
Okay.

438
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,832
Well, then let's fill out a
Do Not Resuscitate order,

439
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,217
specifying your wishes

440
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,086
so that everyone follows them.

441
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,978
Before I sign that,
can I have a minute?

442
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:18,048
Sure.

443
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,705
Hey. Nic filled me in. I'm
really sorry I'm not there.

444
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,542
Yeah. I heard hints as to
why that is, and I don't like it.

445
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,129
<i>- Conrad, are you okay?</i>
- Right now, yeah.

446
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,432
How are you? I hear cancer-free.

447
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,062
- Yeah.
<i>- That's amazing.</i>

448
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,069
It is.

449
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:58,722
Look, I know you're
not gonna sugarcoat this.

450
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,491
That's why I called you, Conrad.

451
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,627
I'm not sure I can do this.

452
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:07,581
<i>Yeah, it's risky, and
I'm scared as hell.</i>

453
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:10,584
I know that.

454
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:13,971
I also know it takes a
special kind of superpower

455
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,557
to run into a fire
to save a hospital

456
00:21:16,592 --> 00:21:20,244
and kick cancer's ass
all in the same year.

457
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,813
So if anyone's got this,

458
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,481
<i>it's you.</i>

459
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:29,686
Thanks, Conrad. I
really needed to hear that.

460
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,321
<i>Bye.</i>

461
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,694
What's going on?

462
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,457
He was midway through
the cefepime when he started

463
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:41,360
to get wheezy. Now
he can't breathe.

464
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,368
- Sounds like anaphylaxis.
- A reaction to the antibiotics.

465
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,037
Push 0.5 of epinephrine I.M.
now and prepare an epi drip.

466
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,033
- And call the code team.
- Help me.

467
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,808
We got you, buddy.

468
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:54,311
Hang in there.

469
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,991
- Pressure's dropping.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

470
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,464
Let's get the pads on him. now.

471
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,566
Come on.

472
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,219
Run the code.

473
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:04,889
What? No, I-I ca-I can't.

474
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,292
We lost his pulse.

475
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,795
Starting compressions.

476
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,341
This is your patient.
You made the call.

477
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,480
Run the code.

478
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,162
What's the first question
you ask in a code?

479
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:19,303
What was the rhythm
before he arrested?

480
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,298
- It was PEA.
- What's the differential
for a PEA arrest?

481
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,174
- Eline!
- I can't.

482
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,710
Step aside.

483
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,011
Hold compressions.

484
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:30,630
He's still in PEA.

485
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,626
Restart compressions.
Push 1 of epi.

486
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:38,188
Let's move. I'll intubate.

487
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:53,331
- I'll get the printout.
- He looks better.

488
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,283
Epi usually works
quickly when you give it,

489
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,535
but his blood
pressure's still low.

490
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,186
- Is that real?
- Maybe.

491
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,344
But the monitor's just a tool.

492
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,906
I'll need an EKG
to know for sure.

493
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,899
I mean, what happened
back there? You just froze up.

494
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:07,051
Call a Code STEMI.

495
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,620
Get him to the cath lab now.
He's having a heart attack.

496
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:12,072
- What just happened?
- It's called a clinical cascade.

497
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:13,590
When one unnecessary procedure

498
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,236
leads to many more,
increasing the risk of harm

499
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,195
- from complications.
- Which I put into motion.

500
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,208
You couldn't have known
he'd be allergic to the antibiotics.

501
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,360
- That's not her fault.
- From the time a patient
comes in

502
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:23,445
to the time he is discharged,

503
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,418
he is in your hands.

504
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:26,030
This man came in
with a cough, and now

505
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:28,199
- he might die of a heart attack.
- I will no longer be a doctor.

506
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:30,218
Not exactly. You're
cheap labor and Red Rock

507
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,203
- will be very forgiving.
- Uh, Dr. Pravesh?

508
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:34,411
Do you have allergies too?

509
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,913
Your neck.

510
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:07,144
- Ah.
- Slow down, Turbo.

511
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,640
Oh, I'm very close
to injecting caffeine

512
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:10,181
directly into my veins.

513
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:11,976
When do humans
figure out the difference

514
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,401
between night and day?
Because Adaku's baby hasn't.

515
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:17,137
She was fully awake
from 2:00 to 7:00 a.m.,

516
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,588
just staring at me.

517
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,140
Until I tried to put her down.

518
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:21,269
Then she wails like a banshee.

519
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,787
And she's supposed
to eat every two hours,

520
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:25,245
but what does she do
almost every single time?

521
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,264
Chucks it up.

522
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,182
Have you tried cuddling?

523
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:33,287
- What?
- Eating, bathing, sleeping...

524
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:35,839
It's all secondary
to the snuggle.

525
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,341
It affects babies
on a molecular level.

526
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,961
Literally changing
their DNA for the better.

527
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:43,347
It improves their neural
development, their IQ...

528
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:46,500
I got it. Fine. I'll snuggle.

529
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:48,551
See you in there.

530
00:24:54,343 --> 00:24:57,978
Logan Kim. Marshall Winthrop.

531
00:24:58,013 --> 00:24:59,279
I know who you are.

532
00:24:59,315 --> 00:25:02,366
We both know why my son Conrad

533
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,367
was kicked out of Chastain.

534
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:06,286
He tried to do the right thing,

535
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:07,887
so you set out to ruin him.

536
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,690
I'm sorry.

537
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,641
- Who are you?
- I believe

538
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,493
we've already covered that.

539
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,189
No, I mean, who
are you, really...

540
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,331
The good guy you're
now pretending to be,

541
00:25:17,366 --> 00:25:19,566
or the world heavyweight
champion of hypocrites?

542
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,553
I'm here to talk about my son.

543
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,638
Take your grievance
elsewhere. You think

544
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:26,734
you can muscle me with
your power and fortune,

545
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,386
but I know how you
made that fortune,

546
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,261
and it wasn't through
random acts of kindness.

547
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,314
To get on your high
horse, it was kill or be killed.

548
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,016
This isn't about<i> me.</i>

549
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,419
I'm making it about you.

551

COO of one of
your first companies.

552
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,541
FCC came sniffing around.

553
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:48,161
But you made sure he paid
dearly for ratting you out.

554
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:49,941
See, I know where
the bodies are buried.

555
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,565
And I will dig them up
to stink in the light of day

556
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:53,911
and bring you to
your aging knees

557
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:56,286
if you ever challenge me again.

558
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,873

I-I've been planning

seen your face.

Scalpel.

00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,542
I-I can't see where
to start cutting.

590
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:05,810
All right. Let's
turn the lung over

591
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,311
- and go to the other side.
- Agreed.

592
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:09,819
Now, Mina, grab the
peel with a hemostat.

593
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,171
Make sure you use the
blunt end of the forceps.

594
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:16,559
Okay. I got it. I see
healthy lung underneath.

595
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,857
You know, Cain was
breathing down my neck

596
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:20,830
about my stats earlier.

597
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,744
He told me to keep
Annie alive at all costs.

598
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,768
Must be an open
bed at the vent farm.

599
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,754
- What's that?
- Atlanta Promised Care.

600
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,824
That's where he
sends all his... "saves."

601
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,061
Oh, so that's how
he keeps his stats up

602
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:36,496
and the money flowing.
His escape hatch.

603
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:39,198
- That's one point of view.
- Is there another?

604
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:41,730
Well, for every ten
patients we send to APC,

605
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:43,287
maybe one might make it home.

606
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,249
Those aren't great numbers,
but it's a chance, right?

607
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:48,125
But for Cain, that's not what
it's about and you know it.

608
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,620
- Ah!
- Damn it.

609
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,239
- A bleeder.
- Hey, Chu,

610
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,524
you get to work on
her pressure, man.

611
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:54,788
And order up some more
blood. We're gonna need it.

612
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,299
There's too much
bleeding. I can't see.

613
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,301
- Chu, hang another unit, please.
- I've already used everything

614
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,552
we have up here, another
cooler's on the way.

615
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,636
Suction.

616
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,904
Should we inflate
the lung again?

617
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:08,048
No, it's not gonna help.

618
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:12,965
If-if she codes...

619
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,086
You let her go.
To hell with Cain.

620
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,167
- But that's not gonna happen
because... You have a plan.

621
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,651
Of course I have a plan.

622
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,970
There's too much
damage to the lung.

623
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:23,305
We need to remove
the whole lobe.

624
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,140
Is that gonna leave her
with enough lung function?

625
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,114
It better. Let's get to work.

626
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,508
- Pressure's stable.
- Good deal.

627
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,355
All right, Dr. Okafor.
It's all you.

628
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,190
- Show me what you got.
- With pleasure.

629
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:45,181
Oh, yeah!

630
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,451
Ooh, nice one, Hawkins.

631
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:48,518
You okay, man?

632
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,622
Reggie, can you hear me?

633
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:00,330
Tell the pilot to level out.

634
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,665
Reggie's in cardiac arrest.
We need a defibrillator.

635
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:03,978
Captain, we have...

636
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,630
Flip upside down and put
your feet up on the wall.

637
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:06,953
Over here!

638
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:08,621
We need a defibrillator.

639
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:16,096
Let's hold him down.

640
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:19,015
Here we go.

641
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,693
<i>Returning to
Earth's gravity now.</i>

642
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:32,579
Conrad.

643
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,070
Clear.

644
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:49,563
You're good. You're good.

645
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,264
He's back.

646
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,504
We did it.

647
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,871
<i>- Deploying the stent.</i>
- Odel's clogged artery

648
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,312
is about to be opened,
and this cascade

649
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:10,083
will transform into
more of a trickle.

650
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,402
If he'd gone to a
Cambodian doctor in a village,

651
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,498
they would've given him a
tea and sent him on his way.

652
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:16,267
Instead he came
here with a cough

653
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,958
and I gave him a heart attack.

654
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:21,205
And that is what's gonna
make you a good doctor.

655
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:22,578
Giving patients heart attacks?

656
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:24,714
Humility.

657
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,232
Acceptance.

658
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,802
Those are the main
ingredients in being one.

659
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,907
He might have coronary artery
disease that was undiagnosed

660
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:36,025
and exacerbated during zero-g.

661
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,629
Tell Dr. Feldman to give
cardiology a heads-up

662
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,648
- that a V fib arrest
with ROSC is coming in.
- Copy that.

663
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,738
Reggie's gonna be okay, right?

664
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,139
I believe so.

665
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:50,785
'Cause, you know, I'd feel weird

666
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,276
talking about how
insanely awesome

667
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,907
that zero-g experience
was, right, if...

668
00:31:55,931 --> 00:31:58,131
He's in great
hands. It's not weird.

669
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,868
Oh, dude, how
freaking cool was that?!

670
00:32:03,806 --> 00:32:05,966
I believed you when
you said we'd be floating,

671
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:07,251
but I guess I didn't
really believe you,

672
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:09,087
because when we
started to rise up...

673
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:10,543
You-you almost peed yourself?

674
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:13,379
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, me too!

675
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:15,310
Except for me wouldn't be
the first time, so no biggie,

676
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,800
but that was incredible.

677
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,636
Yeah. Yeah, it was. Thank you

678
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,755
for dragging me out there.
I really needed this badly.

679
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,791
Oh.

680
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:31,131
Hey. You okay, man?

681
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,683
I mean, really.

682
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:38,321
I was so happy.

683
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,577
I had my work and the
most amazing woman

684
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:45,761
in my life.

685
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,699
They gave me purpose.

686
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,651
I don't know who I am right now.

687
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:57,457
Or who I'll be if I can't
be a doctor anymore.

688
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,993
I do know

689
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,645
whatever that version of me

690
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,532
looks like, there's no
way Nic deserves that.

691
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,925
No.

692
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:17,827
No?

693
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,280
No, you cannot let them win.

694
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:22,148
Medicine is money,

695
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:24,484
and money breeds jerks.

696
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,169
But you...

697
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,338
You got to knuckle up
and get your job back.

698
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:32,475
Hey, if not for yourself,

699
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,473
then do it for the patients
who are relying on you.

700
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:36,963
Get mad.

701
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:39,966
Go kick some Red Rock ass.

702
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:42,485
'Cause we are the
Zero-G Brothers,

703
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,988
and nobody... and
I mean nobody...

704
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,823
Can keep us down.

705
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,494
All right?

706
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,178
Zero-G Brothers?

707
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,848
Yeah.

708
00:33:54,883 --> 00:33:58,685
For life.

709
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,986
You know what?

710
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,620
Guys like us...

711
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,126
find a way to beat the odds.

712
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,378
Don't get too excited.

713
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,346
She'll be off that vent shortly.

714
00:34:27,382 --> 00:34:28,793
So you'll have to
find another patient

715
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,717
to fill your open bed.

716
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:32,469
What's an empty bed cost you...

717
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,805
Another overpriced painting?

718
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,123
I remind you that
I am the chief.

719
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,227
And with your stats,
you're expendable.

720
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:41,472
Well, I'd like to remind
you of something

721
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,145
you've apparently forgotten.

722
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:47,066
The sacred contract between
a surgeon and a patient.

723
00:34:47,102 --> 00:34:50,620
That which distinguishes
us from all other physicians.

724
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,439
We cut people open.

725
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:55,475
We inflict wounds
to make them better.

726
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,394
They trust us with their lives.

727
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,291
And I don't cut for
the sake of cutting.

728
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:03,416
I don't do it for the
prestige or the cash

729
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:05,785
or the stats or the RVUs.

730
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:08,304
I do it for the patients.

731
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,974
I do it for people like her.

732
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:13,776
You must have
been different once.

733
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,295
What happened to you, Barrett?

734
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,849
I was born the man I am
today, and I'm proud of it.

735
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:24,303
No. No, I... I
think you're lying.

736
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:26,606
You encouraged this
woman to sign a DNR

737
00:35:26,642 --> 00:35:28,152
when I explicitly
told you not to.

738
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:29,826
You will not disobey me again.

739
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,478
Or what?

740
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:33,257
You'll have me
fired, like Hawkins?

741
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:35,164
Demoted, like Bell?

742
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,134
What's the endgame, Barrett?

743
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,836
You cut all your adversaries,

744
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:40,932
surround yourself
with bootlickers

745
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:43,306
and those who toe the line.

746
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,969
Yeah, it'll work
for a hot minute,

747
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:47,760
but I guarantee you it
will breed resentment,

748
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:49,328
corruption.

749
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:52,965
And eventually
Chastain will implode,

750
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:55,001
and you right along with it.

751
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:09,327
I told him going to the
ER was a crazy idea.

752
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:10,628
It's a good thing
he didn't listen.

753
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:11,962
It's just lucky it happened
here at Chastain,

754
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:15,004
where we have a
world-class cardiac team.

755
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,650
That is lucky.

756
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,991
Honey...

757
00:36:19,027 --> 00:36:21,387
Did the bronchoscopy explain
why I have this damn cough?

758
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:25,881
Postnasal drip.

759
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:29,035
Which is what I saw when I
first examined you in the ER.

760
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,681
But we needed the
test to confirm that.

761
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,722
Did we?

762
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,253
Antihistamines are the
first line of treatment.

763
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:36,403
If it's still bothering
you, I'd say

764
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,855
talk to your
primary care doctor.

765
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:39,896
But there's nothing
to worry about.

766
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,065
- See?
- That's good news.

767
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,684
Thank you...

768
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,503
for the great care.

769
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,903
Our pleasure.

770
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,837
<i>Why didn't you say anything?</i>

771
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,523
He wasn't lucky to
have a heart attack here.

772
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,512
I gave it to him.

773
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,764
It is also my
instinct to be truthful,

774
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,083
and I am, most of the time.

775
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,403
- So why not now?
- Because if we tell the truth,

776
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:04,615
you'll be fired for
whistleblowing,

777
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,923
and another conscientious
doctor will no longer

778
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,286
be helping patients.

779
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,609
The lesson to learn is

780
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,572
the best and hardest
thing in medicine

781
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,047
is often to do nothing.

782
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:16,282
We care for our
patients knowing full well

783
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,616
this is also a business.

784
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,885
The trick is not to get
caught between the two.

785
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:22,138
My first day was
also a disaster.

786
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:23,122
And by the end of it, I
was questioning whether...

787
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,392
I worked way too
hard to get here.

788
00:37:26,428 --> 00:37:28,311
I have no intention of quitting.

789
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,563
Good.

790
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,032
No one died, no one quit.

791
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:34,107
My job here is done.

792
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:38,204
Oh, and you're not
the only one to blame

793
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,538
for Odel's bronchoscopy.

794
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:41,457
The new RVU system is, too.

795
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:44,277
Radical virus...

796
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:47,964
- Relative value units.
- Oh.

797
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,117
That's why Dr. Langford
was so quick to suggest it.

798
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:53,486
Right.

799
00:37:57,659 --> 00:37:59,603
Well, today is the day

800
00:37:59,627 --> 00:38:02,228
we introduce 3B Life
to the American public,

801
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:04,631
and I'll be damned if you
two handsome bastards

802
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,316
aren't just perfect for the job.

803
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:08,312
Just, you know, stick
to the teleprompter

804
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:10,135
and gold we shall be.

805
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:11,432
As they say on the
boards of Broadway,

806
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,205
<i>hatsloche un broche.</i>

807
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:16,275
Break a leg.

808
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:17,505
<i>3B Life, you're
up in one minute.</i>

809
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,140
We have Dr. Randolph Bell

810
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,513
and Andrea Braydon...

811
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:23,682
- Ready to make history?
- You bet.

812
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,979
Hey, how's the big first day?

813
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:38,481
Mm, practicing medicine is hard,

814
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,150
but teaching it is a
whole other beast.

815
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,718
That's the truth.

816
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,732
There's something else. I
need to schedule some lab work.

817
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,805
- Yeah? For who?
- Me.

818
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:48,658
What's wrong?

819
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,321
I've just got some
pain under my ribs.

820
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:52,328
Stomach ache, and this rash.

821
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:53,997
And my fingers are...

822
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:56,466
Hmm, headache?
Increased heart rate?

823
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,633
Yeah.

824
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,203
I think you have RAS.

825
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,890
Resident anxiety syndrome.

826
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,810
Conrad had it, too.

827
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,407
It's the anxiety of being
a second-year resident

828
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,646
responsible for others.

829
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,181
Can't say it ever goes away,

830
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,994
but you do learn
to live with it.

831
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,135
- I hope you're right.
- I think I am.

832
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:17,503
Get some rest, Pravesh.

833
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,578
Forget about your
interns till tomorrow.

834
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,221
Mm.

835
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:26,595
Yeah! 3B For Life,
people. I mean,

836
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,776
- we rocked America.
Well, Andrea took the lead,

837
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,011
- I just... I followed.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, what happened?

838
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,863
No, it was great, really.
We had a weight-loss story

839
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:34,253
and a heroic tale.

840
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,755
Couldn't have planned it better.

841
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,085
Which is hardly
a surprise, I'd say.

842
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:39,008
Hey, what's going on?

843
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,371
You know, Grayson
told me about your day,

844
00:39:40,395 --> 00:39:41,878
so I said I had to come by

845
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,396
and congratulate you in person.

846
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:47,283
Dr. Barrett Cain.
Chief of Surgery.

847
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:50,114
- Um...
- Yes, I know. I know,
this is a hard act to follow,

848
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,198
but I'm doing my best.

849
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,189
Andrea Braydon.

850
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,025
Would you, um, like s...
Oh. Looks like we're running

851
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,788
- a little low. Well, we'll have
to get some more. Oh, great.

852
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,474
- Thank you very much.
That's-that's what I'm talking about.

853
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,714
Uh, Dr. Bell. Word, please?

854
00:40:06,754 --> 00:40:08,382
- Well, cheers, guys.
- Amazing.

855
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,222
- Mazel tov.
- Mazel tov.

856
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:11,977
Yeah.

857
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,905
You know, it's only
a matter of time

858
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:17,289
before the board realizes
that you swiped an opportunity

859
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,698
from underneath them.

860
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:20,594
You rejected
Andrea's pitch to them

861
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,463
so you could have the
investment all to yourself.

862
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,087
That's hardly what happened.

863
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,537
And it's a high-risk investment,

864
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:27,318
and one that Chastain
would never make.

865
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,941
Hmm.

866
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:31,827
Well, that's not how
I'm gonna spin it.

867
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,600
So what do you want?

868
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,335
I don't know.

869
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:42,805
A healthy percentage of our
growing supplement business.

870
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:46,075
And in return I'll just smooth
things over with the board.

871
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,827
Look, I have partners.

872
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,156
- Right.
- It's hardly my decision
to make.

873
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,664
Yes, and I'm sure
they will be thrilled

874
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,020
to add another prestigious
physician with the product.

875
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:58,337
And if anybody can
convince 'em, it's you.

876
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,039
Ain't that right, partner?

877
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:09,765
He's bringing it.
Yeah. More bubbly.

The answer is yes, I have
been dodging your calls.

883
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:24,156
I am well aware.

884
00:42:24,192 --> 00:42:25,524
Guessing you heard I was fired.

885
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:26,826
<i>You know, the truth is</i>

886
00:42:26,861 --> 00:42:28,539
I figured it would
happen one day.

887
00:42:28,563 --> 00:42:29,812
You're a rule breaker.

888
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,902
I've decided I'm not gonna
let them win so easily.

889
00:42:36,938 --> 00:42:38,504
Son, I've gone toe-to-toe

890
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,073
with a lot of titans in my time.

891
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:43,776
These Red Rock people...

892
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,210
You're gonna have to bring

893
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:47,463
more than a
slingshot to this fight.

894
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,248
<i>It's gonna get ugly.</i>

895
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:51,250
<i>For all of us.</i>

896
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:53,930
<i>I just want to make
sure you know</i>

897
00:42:53,954 --> 00:42:55,805
<i>what we're up against.</i>

898
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,557
I hear you, Dad. Thank you.

899
00:42:58,593 --> 00:43:00,276
- Hey.
- Hey.

900
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,312
Missed you today.

901
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:03,946
I missed you, too.

902
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,297
It was a good day?

903
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,883
Zero-g with Finn is
just what I needed.

904
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,653
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

905
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:12,922
Red Rock came for me.

906
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,440
Now I'm coming for them.
