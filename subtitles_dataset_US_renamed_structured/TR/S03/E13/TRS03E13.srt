00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:03,980
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- You're fired.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,887
You're afraid of me.

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:07,005
<i>And you should be.</i>

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,401
<i>Security will escort you out.</i>

5
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,626
<i>If my sister has a child,</i>

6
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:12,138
then that child
becomes my family, too.

7
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:13,857
Are you saying you'll
be my baby's godmother?

8
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:14,863
<i>You said yes?</i>

9
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:16,298
All right, so what's your plan

10
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,427
if Adaku's baby becomes
your responsibility?

11
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,251
I don't have one.

12
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:22,821
<i>There was a learning
curve, but I mastered it.</i>

13
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,401
Why don't you come
over to our place later?

14
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,191
Uh, not tonight.

15
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,526
<i>I'm tired.</i>

16
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,011
<i>A little time alone
with my thoughts.</i>

17
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,683
<i>This incredible woman
had the ability to save a life</i>

18
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,767
<i>right in front of me. And
I knew, in that moment,</i>

19
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,408
<i>that I wanted to be a person</i>

20
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,945
<i>who could jump out of
the car to help people.</i>

21
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:48,980
<i>So that's what I do.</i>

22
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,790
Methodist Memorial
went with someone else.

23
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:07,949
Apparently they checked
in with my last employer.

24
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,779
Red Rock has
gotten you blacklisted

25
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,914
from every hospital in Atlanta.

26
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,138
I want to practice medicine,

27
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,639
I'll have to find
work out of town.

28
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,904
Have a long-distance
relationship

29
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:20,779
or give up being a doctor.
This is what it's come to?

30
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:21,947
No, it hasn't.

31
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:24,616
We're gonna figure this out.

32
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,162
You should go,
you're gonna be late.

33
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,769
Eh...

34
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,486
You have any idea why
Reggie wanted to see you?

35
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,627
No, he just said to meet him

36
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,629
at the Georgia
FC practice field.

37
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:40,299
Is it bad that I had no idea
Atlanta has a soccer team?

38
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:42,800
Yes.

39
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,503
But I forgive you.

40
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:55,447
Well, hel-hello, good sir.

41
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,815
Some tea and crumpets, perhaps?

42
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,950
Ha. Very funny.

43
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,014
I need to make a good
impression on my new attending.

44
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,490
Ah, right, first day in the
dual residency program.

45
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,768
Internal medicine
this week. ER next.

46
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,192
And then I go back and forth.

47
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,996
A foot in two departments
fundamentally at odds.

48
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,309
Well, as a dual resident, I
can reach across the aisle,

49
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,112
- help each department
see how the other lives.
- If you say so.

50
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,036
But lose the bow tie.

51
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,682
You look like a
chemistry professor

52
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,039
who refuses to hand out As

53
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,358
even when they're
totally deserved.

54
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,793
- That was oddly specific.
- I was really good at chemistry.

55
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,967
Fine. You know what?

56
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:33,502
Okay, baby girl.

Yeah, rookie out of Memphis.

73
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,948
- You're supposed to be
the next face of the franchise.
- Yeah. That's the plan.

74
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,583
If I can get my
injuries under control.

75
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,451
Today is Dax's
first practice back.

76
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,577
- He's recovering from
a calf injury.
- Which feels fine, but...

77
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,456
what worries me is I get
these cramps and injuries

78
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,762
from the smallest things.

79
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,115
The more conditioning I
do, the weaker I seem to get.

80
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,418
The team doc, he
ran a bunch of tests.

81
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,953
Everything came back normal,
so he cleared Dax to play.

82
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,050
But I keep telling him
there's something up with me.

83
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,718
But he won't listen,
so I asked Reggie

84
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,454
if he knew a doctor who
could give me a second opinion.

85
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:48,627
And I thought,

86
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,062
why not the guy who
saved my life in zero G?

87
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:55,194
Yeah, well, I'm happy to take
a look at your medical records.

88
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:58,186
That's me. Good looking out.

chest and abdomen.

Yeah, I'm here. We're

I'm a friend of the patient,

131
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,006
that's not against
hospital policy.

132
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:03,512
Okay, his O2 stats are
dropping. We need to intubate him.

133

- Chest cavity is full of blood.
- Get me a chest tube kit.

You got into a fight?

- It was schoolyard stuff.
- Between two grown men?

148
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,782
Well, he threw the first punch.

149
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,962
The police agree that I'm
innocent, so they released me.

150
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,887
- Who were you fighting?
- This guy, he bought my car.

151
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,439
He had buyer's remorse,
he thought I'd take it back.

152
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:08,109
- And then he made fun of my hat.
- Wait, you-you sold your car?

00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,428
You've had that
car for 20 years.

00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:20,738
Yes, look... Okay, I've
been a-a little down lately.

patch every now and then?

159

I'm fine.

160
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,662
I promise.

161
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,165
Well, the repeat
cultures are negative.

162
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,906
Plus no fever in two days.

163
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,659
Which means your
infection is clearing.

- I can't wait to have
Michelle in my arms

172
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,593
- and finally to be able
to get out of here.
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,118
Do you think she'll
know who I am?

174
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,771
I'm sure she'll know

175
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,956
by the love you give her.

176
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,279
- Look at how cute she is.
- Yeah.

177
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,065
As my admitting resident,

178
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,301
you are gatekeeper
to the medicine floor.

179
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,636
And when I say "gatekeeper,"

180
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,649
I mean you are to be
a blocking machine.

181
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,791
Mrs. Allen, 68-year-old female
with alcoholic pancreatitis.

182
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:32,076
Know what went wrong here?

183
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,090
She binged on alcohol and
gave herself pancreatitis?

184
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,547
Wrong. The ER were too
slow giving her a benzo,

185
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,561
so now we're stuck chasing
her withdrawal symptoms.

186
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,752
That's not entirely
fair. The ER is always...

187
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,736
Mr. Hopper, 80-year-old man.

188
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,806
Fell in his home,
sprained his hip.

189
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:45,985
Care to guess the mistake?

190
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:48,376
He's an elderly
man who lives alone

191
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:50,773
- and he needs
discharge planning.
- Which could have been done

192
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,565
while he was waiting in the
ER. Instead, he's taking up

193
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,227
one of our beds,
waiting for a placement.

194
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,211
I could go on, but
the trend is clear.

195
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,572
We're accepting patients from
the ER that don't belong here.

196
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,275
Look, I agree
that these patients

197
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,954
in particular could have
been managed better,

198
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:08,062
but most of the patients on
this floor do need to be here.

199
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:15,286
I know you're not a
pure medicine resident,

200
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,189
that you've been tainted by
habits you learned in the ER.

201
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,360
- I wouldn't say that...
- But you're on this team now.

202
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,328
So, what are you going to be?

203
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,615
A blocking machine.

204
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,252
A blocking... machine.

205
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,644
Dr. Hawkins...

206
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,314
this is Bill Landry,
owner of Georgia FC.

207
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,984
Son, I have a team of
top doctors from St. John's

208
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,219
who take care of my players.

209
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,465
I don't know who you are
or why you were on my field.

210
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,457
Why exactly did you poach
a patient from St. John's

211
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,837
- and bring him here?
- That's not what happened.
- I don't care.

212
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:58,964
- I want Dax transferred
to St. John's immediately.
- Well, that would be a bad idea.

213
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:02,383
Dax has sustained
significant injuries to his chest

214
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:04,802
and his abdomen, leading
to multiple broken ribs,

215
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,388
lung contusions,
lacerations to his spleen.

216
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,307
I trust that, when
he stabilizes,

217
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,337
- you'll make that transfer
happen as soon as possible.
- Y-You have my word.

218
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,313
And I apologize for the
inconvenience. I-I hope...

219
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,604
Bill Landry is the
richest man in Georgia,

220
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,623
and in one morning you have
him pissed off at Chastain.

221
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,693
You shouldn't have been anywhere
near Dax Ramsey to begin with.

222
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,640
He asked for a second
opinion, so I helped.

223
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:34,632
He's at Chastain now, so your
services are no longer required.

224
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,834
Treating a patient

225
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,285
without hospital privileges
is against the law.

226
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,204
I'm not treating him.

227
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,372
I'm here as a friend.

228
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,876
Which gives Dr. Hawkins
every right to stay.

229
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,629
If you so much as lay a
finger on Dax Ramsey,

230
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:49,664
I'll have you thrown
out and sued.

231
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,543
Wow. You guys already
boarding patients in the hallway?

232
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,350
One of those days.

233
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,820
- You here for my admit?
- First one of the day.

234
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:15,206
Riley, this is Dr. Pravesh.
He's gonna do an assessment.

235
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,219
Okay. Hey, can I do the thing?

236
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,044
The floor is yours.

237
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,379
Riley Jackson,
28-year-old female.

238
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,582
Five hours of sudden
onset nausea and vomiting.

239
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,151
- Did I get it right?
- Nailed it.

240
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,203
And that's vomiting
with a capital "V."

241
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:31,306
I can't even keep crackers down.

242
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,258
It's good to meet you, Riley.

243
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,887
Uh, can you tell me
when all this started?

244
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,394
Uh, this morning.

245
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,063
I woke up fine, dropped
my daughter off at school.

246
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,493
And then on the
drive back home...

247
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:41,760
- Capital "V"?
- Yeah.

248
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,879
- Hmm.
- All over my steering wheel.

249
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,169
It was not pretty.

250
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,248
Okay. I'm gonna talk to
Dr. Feldman and figure out

251
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,451
- the best way
to take care of you, okay?
- Thank you so much.

252
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,556
All right.

253
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,826
- We'll be right back.
- Thanks.

254
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:53,739
Hey, this looks
like gastroenteritis.

255
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:55,207
- This is a soft admit.
- Yeah...

256
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:56,843
Got you there, Feldman.

257
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:59,266
Give it a few more hours of
continuous fluids and meds.

258
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,737
Are you seriously
blocking this admission?

259
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:07,175
Wow, you've, uh, already
become one of them.

260
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,472
Stashing a patient in
the ER for a couple hours,

261
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,140
hoping they somehow
cure themselves?

262
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,125
- Internal medicine's
signature move. Look,

263
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,299
I can't give Riley a
bed that doesn't exist.

264
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,196
Between surgical patients
and medical patients,

265
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,597
- a bed isn't available.
- That's true.

266
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,465
They got a lot of
surgical patients today.

267
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,067
- You know, how about
you just pick a side, man?
- Pick a side.

268
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,642
Sorry. I like watching
you two argue.

269
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:28,462
My therapist says it's because
I envy your guys' relationship.

270
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,963
Which I do not.

271
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,797
Just because you're
busy upstairs doesn't mean

272
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,632
you get to saddle
us with your work.

273
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:40,291
We don't exactly, uh, have
spare time down here either.

274
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,611
Fine. I'll put in
holding orders.

275
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:45,630
But she will have
to board in the ER

276
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,448
until a bed is available.

277
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:50,200
As long as she's not on my list,
you can do whatever you want.

278
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,807
Look who's here.

279
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,825
Hi.

280
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,790
Hi.

281
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,799
I'm your mom.

282
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,985

Oh, well, I want to
take a look at that cut.

301
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,318
- It could get infected.
- I-I got bandages

302
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,043
and all sorts of
antiseptic stuff.

303
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,861
I'll be fine.

304

Okay, well, I thought we were

to do that, or...?

306
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,728
Well, yeah. Sure,
sure. Yeah, of course.

307
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,136
I just, I'd like to
clean up and...

308
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:17,038
My place is a mess and, uh...

309
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:20,391
Tell you what, why don't
we grab lunch a little later?

310
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,626
Sure, yeah. I'll
call you in a bit.

311
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:06,053
Were you at least gonna tell
me that you were leaving again?

312
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,057
No.

313
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,628
I thought you were in trouble.

314
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,648
I told you I was fine.

315
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,650
Things have been
so good between us,

316
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,203
and you want to
throw it all away? Why?

317
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:25,656
S-Settling down, volunteering
at Chastain, being an angel,

318
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,776
trying to be a good dad
to you, it's exhausting.

319
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:31,996
- I can't do it anymore.
- So you're just gonna
take off again?

320
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,802
Nicky, I burn down
every good thing

321
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,204
that's ever happened to me.

322
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,208
That's who I am.

323
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,965
I'm sorry I led you to believe
that, even for a second,

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,850
that I had changed.

325
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,119
I... Here.

326
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,822
Here, I want you to have this.

327
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:02,276
It's money from the car.

328
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,695
I wanted to leave you
something f-for the... sh...

329
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,265
I-I don't know, for
all the, for all the time

330
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,118
that you-you wasted on me.

331
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:14,155
Come on, please. Here.

332
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,339
But his history is unremarkable.

333
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:32,773
Nothing is jumping out at me.

334
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:35,626
Whoa. If I knew it was you

335
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,740
on the other end of the page,
I would've rallied the troops,

336
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,457
signaled the alarm,
called the band...

337
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:41,627
Can you just say it's good to
see him and be done with it?

338
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:44,484
- Thanks for coming down, Austin.
- No problem.

339
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,137
I see we're hiding out
in the conference room.

340
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,656
Avoiding Logan Kim, I take it?

341
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:51,242
And the appearance that I'm
treating a patient in Chastain.

342
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,843
A loophole. I dig it. What's up?

343
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,463
Dax Ramsey. He has a
chest tube, a lacerated spleen,

344
00:16:55,498 --> 00:16:57,426
and multiple pulmonary
contusions with hemorrhage.

345
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,133
Do you think he'll need surgery?

346
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:02,419
His chest tube is only draining
a hundred mils per hour.

347
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,433
So we have to wait
and watch and hope

348
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,840
that his lungs heal itself.

349
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,826
If not, I will come in
and save the day, but...

350
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,413
Taking off my thoracic hat and
putting on my trauma fedora...

351
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,326
- Bell, are you seeing
what I'm seeing? Yeah.

352
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,928
The injuries are severe
for the trauma he took.

353
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,446
Uh, we were just
getting to that.

354
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,654
Is... Any idea why he
wanted a second opinion?

355
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:20,671
Yeah, over the years,
Dax has suffered

356
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,239
more injuries than normal.

357
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,775
He thought maybe his team
doctor missed something.

358
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,894
Yeah, well, I think Dax
was onto something.

359
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:29,163
Mm-hmm.

360
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:31,215
Dax is crashing.

361
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,029
You might want
to hang back, bro.

362
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,338
Our patient is critical. I
can't worry about the rules.

363
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,293
Get a crash cart. He's in V fib.

364
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,744
His sats are down to the 80s.

365
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,714
Hawkins, I need you
to do compressions.

366
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:50,417
Do it. Abdomen's soft.

367
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,803
There's no blood in his
drainage system either.

368
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,610
We need to decompress his chest.

369
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:19,497
He's back in sinus tach,
but he's still hypotensive.

370
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:22,350
You ready? Get it.

371
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:30,073
Massive hemothorax.

372
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,029
We need to get
Dax to surgery now.

373
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,675
Give me the bag.

374
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,932
Let's go.

375
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,321
I told you what would happen
if I caught you treating a patient.

376
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,190
It was compressions.

377
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,494
For a patient who would
have died otherwise.

378
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,645
It's okay.

379
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,783
- Take care of Dax.
- Yeah.

380
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:16,721
Well, the lobectomy should
keep Dax's bleeding under control.

381
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,122
We solved one issue, and
another keeps sprouting up.

382
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,119
- You notice his legs
were swollen?
- Yeah.

383
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:24,545
I also saw what looked
like blood in his urine bag.

384
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,947
- He's in rhabdo.
- But why exactly

385
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:28,950
is his muscle tissue
breaking down?

386
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:31,451
His pH is normal. At
least he's not acidotic.

387
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:33,637
You know, maybe
it's a mixed picture.

388
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,306
Metabolic acidosis
plus respiratory alkalosis.

389
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,976
What is going on with this kid?

390
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,489
You know, the only
thing I know for certain

391
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,145
is we'll figure it out.

392
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,532
No doubt. No, a theory
will come to us in a minute.

393
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,001
We got this.

394
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,325
So it's not coming to
us at-at this m-moment.

395
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,727
Well, w-we... you know,
Bell, we have nothing to prove.

396
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,841
You know, you have a
bomb-ass supplement line

397
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,525
- taking off right now.
- You're a triple-board-
certified surgeon.

398
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:02,444
- Right?
- The reality is,
we are out of our wheelhouse.

399
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,230
- Well, that's fair.
- This is much less
of a surgical case

400
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:06,865
- and more of a medical...
- It, uh, is a mystery.

401
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:08,739
There you go.

402
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,106
I never thought I'd
say these words.

403
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,731
Oh, go ahead, say it.

404
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,566
One of us has to, Bell.

405
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,586
- We might need Conrad Hawkins.
- Now, did that hurt much?

406
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,789
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

407
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:30,244
Look, he can't come here, so
we got to make a house call.

408
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:33,414
So far, we've only been treating
the trauma-related injuries.

409
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,633
Injuries exacerbated
by an underlying,

410
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,618
- undiagnosed condition.
- Right.

411
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,448
We've seen his records.
What do we know?

412
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,616
He typically
experiences vomiting

413
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,305
after strenuous workouts.

414
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,453
And most recently, he's
been suffering a string

415
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:47,811
of musculoskeletal injuries
and now has rhabdo.

416
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,734
I know that look.

417
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,369
You know, I dig that look.

418
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:58,039
It's been an
acquired taste for me.

419
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,294
He's not septic. And
while the rhabdo alone

420
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,790
can cause some
elevation in the lactate,

421
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:06,247
it's more than I'd expect.

422
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:10,984
I think we're seeing...

423
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,405
Type B lactic acidosis.

424
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,292
In plain English, there's
something that's preventing Dax

425
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,827
from breaking down
glucose in the normal way.

426
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,480
How do you treat that?

427
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,432
Type B lactic acidosis is a
symptom of something else.

428
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,101
And it's that something

429
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:28,964
that might explain
what's been causing

430
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,322
all of Dax's injuries
in the first place.

431
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:34,025
Well, you guys seem to
know what you're doing.

432
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,620
Guess it's good
that Dax landed here.

433
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:38,195
We only employ
the best at Chastain.

434
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,514
Thank you.

435
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,350
Mm-hmm. You bet.

436
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,188
Surgeons usually don't possess
such an in-depth knowledge

437
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,673
of medical management.

438
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,628
Um, well, I'm sorry,

439
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,848
last time I checked,
you weren't a doctor.

440
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,634
Yeah, so why don't you run along

441
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,337
and worry about whatever
it is you worry about?

442
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:05,756
And you let us focus
on saving our patient.

443
00:22:09,145 --> 00:22:11,072
Nurse Ingrid, have you
checked on Riley Jackson?

444
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,730
I don't see her on the floor.

445
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,449
I don't know who that is.
Is she a medicine patient?

446
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,951
I admitted her two hours ago,
and we have open beds now.

447
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:19,848
Do you know why she
hasn't been brought up?

448
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,883
I can tell you, Pravesh.
Canceled her admission.

449
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,359
I told you to be a blocking
machine, but instead

450
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,239
you let your friend
from ER run over you.

451
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:30,164
No, that's not what happened.
I made a compromise

452
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:32,319
to ease the tension
between our departments.

453
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,219
Who are you, Oprah?

454
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:37,574
Since we haven't checked
on her, hopefully the ER has.

455
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,460
Riley?

456
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:45,813
Riley?

457
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,849
Open your eyes.

458
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:52,353
Pupils dilated,
minimally reactive.

459
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,691
She's having a stroke.

460
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,209
Let's go.

461
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:01,395
- Hey, I have a code stroke here.
- Three.

462
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,832
Code stroke, ER Bay Three.

463
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,401
Code stroke, ER Bay Three.

464
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:08,463
I need an intubation kit.

465
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,238
Draw up 20 of
etomidate and 70 of roc.

466
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:12,968
Okay, once we get better access,
let's get the portable monitor

467
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:16,276
and get her to CT. She came
in with nausea and vomiting.

468
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,163
How did this happen?

469
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,075
Hey, how is it going with Kyle?

470
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,944
<i>Not good.</i>

471
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,163
He's leaving Atlanta.

472
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,400
Wasn't even gonna tell me.

473
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:41,118
<i>Nic, I'm so sorry.</i>

474
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,572
I let my guard down.

475
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:47,474
- I let him back into my life.
<i>- Well...</i>

476
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,277
you thought he
changed, so did I.

477
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:52,162
<i>I should have known better.</i>

478
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:54,915
I mean, he always bails.

479
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,751
He usually tells me
some lie as to why it's best.

480
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:01,588
This time, he didn't even
bother to lie. He's just...

481
00:24:01,624 --> 00:24:03,056
he's just leaving.

482
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:04,753
<i>Bell and Austin know
how to reach me.</i>

483
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:05,959
<i>Why don't I pack up,</i>

484
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:08,912
come home, and we
turn this horrible day

485
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,097
into something else?

486
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:12,665
It's okay.

487
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,435
I think I just need some time.

488
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,655
Okay.

489
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,525
But you call me the
second you need anything.

490
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:26,030
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you, too.

491
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,009
I can't do it anymore.

492
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
<i>I'm sorry that I
led you to believe</i>

493
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,626
<i>that-that-that it was
different, even for a second.</i>

494
00:24:56,012 --> 00:24:58,092
<i>First day on the
job as a volunteer.</i>

495
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,838
You're all I got, kid.

496
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,276
He did lie.

497
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:45,926
♪ ♪

498
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,277
I don't think I'm
doing it right.

499
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,029
Oh, here, let me

500
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,465
- show you what she likes.
- Okay.

501
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,783
Hey, hey.

502
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:18,804
You know her better than I do.

503
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,321
I've been taking
care of Michelle.

504
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,811
Of course I learned a few tricks

505
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,781
along the way.

506
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,633
Rhythmically, tap
on her back like this.

507
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:33,440
Yeah.

508
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:36,888
Oh, come to Mommy. Yes.

509
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:38,495
Come to Mommy.

510
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,415
Oh.

511
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,502
- You okay?
- Fine.

512
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,171
Yeah?

513
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,174
Mina, is this hard for you?

514
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,342
Will you miss her?

515
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:54,794
Are you kidding? She's
cute and everything,

516
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,181
but, um, I'll have my life back.

517
00:27:00,502 --> 00:27:04,521
Are Dax's next set
of labs in? Thank you.

518
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,574
They're cooking.

519
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,644
Oh, damn it. Just
stay on the line.

520
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:11,840
<i>I'm being paged to Dax's room.</i>

521
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,531
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure. Just listen in.

522
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,787
Okay, he is rapidly alternating

523
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:22,650
between fast and
slow heart rates.

524
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,835
<i>Tachy-brady syndrome, but why?</i>

525
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:26,543
No, he's too young for
primary cardiac disease.

526
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,046
And his echo from a few
months ago was normal.

527
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,648
His muscle cells are
bursting into his bloodstream.

528
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,968
Yeah, making it likely
an electrolyte issue.

529
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:36,854
We need a point-of-care chem-8.

530
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,474
Sodium 134, bicarb 22,

531
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:43,126
<i>glucose 110, potassium 6.9.</i>

532
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,678
He needs calcium and bicarb.

533
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,448
Need an amp of calcium
gluconate and bicarb now,

534
00:27:47,483 --> 00:27:49,716
then an amp of D50
and ten of regular insulin.

535
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,462
<i>I'm not sure how this fits
into his underlying condition.</i>

536
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:52,819
This is odd.

537
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:54,666
- What now?
- His abdomen is distended.

538
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,240
Reggie? Patrick?

539
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,302
- What are you thinking?
<i>- I'm just, I'm worried</i>

540
00:27:58,326 --> 00:28:00,171
<i>his splenic lac has
opened up and he's starting</i>

541
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:01,895
to rebleed. Take him down to CT

542
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,991
- and find out what's going on.
<i>- I want to help.</i>

543
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,743
<i>I need to know.
So keep me posted.</i>

544
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,001
<i>Okay. I will.</i>

545
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:11,972
Thank you.

546
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:13,340
That call about your patient?

547
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,359
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

548
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,044
Getting worse.

549
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,027
Listen, you're doing
everything you can do.

550
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,602
Don't beat yourself up.

551
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,922
You're gonna be back
in the trenches soon.

552
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,607
How's the job hunt going?

553
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,275
Rough.

554
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,572
Found some hospitals in
Tennessee that look promising.

555
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:37,280
Tennessee?

556
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,849
Yeah, I got fired. I'm
poisoned goods in Atlanta.

557
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,669
And after my run-in with
my dear friend Logan Kim,

558
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:44,788
the poison's gonna
spread statewide.

559
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,290
Okay, so you're
just gonna give up?

560
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,794
I'm persona non
grata. I'm out of options.

561
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:55,299
I'm sorry, I'm looking for the
table with Conrad Hawkins.

562
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,134
Come on, man.

563
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,297
Look, you're always telling us
to fight, think outside the box.

564
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,587
That's what I've been doing.

565
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:02,550
I can't keep fighting the
same battle and losing.

566
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,740
I have to move on.

567
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,892
Listen,

568
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:08,428
you are the guy that pulls
Hail Marys out of nowhere.

569
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:10,647
And guys like
you, they don't just

570
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,561
think outside the
box, they create

571
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,750
their own box if necessary,

572
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,785
and then you think
out of that one, too.

573
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,239
What's going on
with your patient?

574
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,610
She had a cerebellar stroke,

575
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:25,289
and then she
started to herniate,

576
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:29,249
so they did a
posterior craniectomy.

577
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:32,886
Red Rock prioritizes surgical
patients over ER patients.

578
00:29:32,922 --> 00:29:34,171
It's more lucrative.

579
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,100
So ER patients that
should be upstairs

580
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:38,741
in a room are being
boarded in the hallway.

581
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,688
And that's what happened
to my patient today.

582
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,930
It delayed us realizing
she was having a stroke.

583
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:46,150
- So do something about it.
- There's nothing I can do.

584
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:49,269
Oh, yeah, I'm-I'm sorry, I
was looking for the table

585
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:52,105
with Devon Pravesh.

586
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,358
No, it-it's... That's
not the same thing.

587
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:57,477
Patient boarding...

588
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:59,112
That's a national crisis.

589
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:01,297
Okay.

590
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,628
So you find the local solution
to the national problem.

591
00:30:03,652 --> 00:30:05,785
If I have to think outside

592
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,016
of the box for my unwinnable
situation, so do you.

593
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,676
I miss this.

594
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,229
Yeah, me, too.

595
00:30:36,218 --> 00:30:38,234
Dad, open the door.

596
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,792
Dad.

597
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,844
I think I know what
you're planning,

598
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,863
and I'm not gonna let you do it.

599
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,909
I'm...

600
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:11,635
I'm worried you might
be a danger to yourself.

601
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,755
That's a pretty big
leap, but I get it.

602
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,786
You're upset about
what I said earlier.

603
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,694
We are rebuilding
our lives, together,

604
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,262
and things are really good.

605
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,950
And I think it caught
you by surprise.

606
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,103
When you came
back to help Jessie,

607
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:34,291
you didn't expect that the man

608
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,893
who burns everything down

609
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:41,465
would start building things
he was scared to lose.

610
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,245
You're-you're just
making this a lot harder

611
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,719
than it has to be. I really
think you need to leave.

612
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:48,972
You and I both know
if I walk out that door,

613
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:51,441
- I'll never see you again.
- Nic, if you love me,

614
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,443
you will go.

615
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,429
No.

616
00:31:55,464 --> 00:31:57,459
Because every day
for the rest of my life,

617
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,794
I will live with the guilt that
I walked out on my father

618
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:01,818
when he needed me, so, no.

619
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,157
It won't be your fault.

620
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,390
I'm the broken
wheel in this family,

621
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:16,166
and this, today, I
can free you of that.

622
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:21,066
And I don't want you to
shed a single tear for me.

623
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,890
I don't deserve
it. I never have.

624
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:25,908
Do you remember
when they took me in

625
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,645
for Jessie's transplant surgery?

626
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,682
I wanted to tell you something.

627
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:35,252
Yeah.

628
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,437
What was it?

629
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:41,341
If I died saving Jessie,

630
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,393
it'd be the only good thing
that I've ever done with my life.

631
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,615
I know that I'm worthless.

632
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:49,999
That's why I-I run,

633
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:55,488
it's why I, I-I, I fail
at everything I touch.

634
00:32:55,523 --> 00:32:59,575
God... he just keeps
choosing the wrong one of us.

635
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,363
First your mother.

636
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,832
Jessie.

637
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:13,190
I'm at the end of my life.

638
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:18,011
And that is all I
got to show for it.

639
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,949
The sum total of my life...

640
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:26,369
stuffed into an envelope.

641
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,572
That is not true.

642
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:34,227
Things haven't always been
easy with us, but... you have me.

643
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,203
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you this sooner, but...

644
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:48,424
when I think about my
future... I see you in it.

645
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,430
At my wedding, walking
me down the aisle.

646
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:55,160
Birthdays, holidays,

647
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:57,634
and every moment in
between, you are there.

648
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:02,638
It would break my
heart if you were gone.

649
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,608
So, no.

650
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,444
I'm not leaving.

651
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,654
Will you be honest with me?

652
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,292
Can you tell me what
you are planning?

653
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,633
Dad.

654
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,338
Okay.

655
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,925
- Sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

656
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,977
Will you give it to me, please?

657
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:43,847
It's okay.

658
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,101
Okay.

659
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,136
Okay.

660
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:57,810
- I'm scared.
- It's okay. It's okay.

661
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,588
Bell, what happened?

662
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:10,585
Well, I noticed his
abdomen was distended,

663
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,086
and then his
hemoglobin took a dive.

664
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,771
What, you're thinking
it's his splenic lac?

665
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:15,515
Well, yeah, that's what
I was worried about.

666
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,026
That's what's
happened. That spleen's

667
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,094
got to come out immediately.

668
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,262
Whatever is going on with Dax

669
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,797
is causing him to
become coagulopathic.

670
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,971
Well, clotting issues aside...

671
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:26,868
we got to get him
to the OR stat.

672
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,892
- I hope there's time
to save his life.
- All right, let's go.

673
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,649
Hey. Hey. What is this?

674
00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:37,044
Patients who have been
sitting in the ER hallways

675
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,996
for hours, waiting for a
bed on the medicine floor.

676
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,031
A hallway in the ER
versus a hallway here.

677
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,007
- What's the difference?
- Proximity.

678
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,770
Doctors tend to forget about
these patients even though,

679
00:35:45,794 --> 00:35:47,489
technically,
they're on their lists.

680
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,607
Out of sight, out of mind.
A patient almost died today

681
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,108
because she fell
through the cracks.

682
00:35:51,132 --> 00:35:52,882
Administration won't allow this.

683
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,113
It'll go back to the
way it was tomorrow.

684
00:35:55,137 --> 00:35:56,520
Maybe.

685
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:57,965
But at least today,
these patients,

686
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,189
they won't be forgotten.

687
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:09,543
We're slightly off the
midline to the fascia,

688
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,285
- 'cause I see rectus muscle.
- Agreed.

689
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,203
Wait. Hold up.

690
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,789
Lac.

691
00:36:15,824 --> 00:36:18,508
Peep the color.

692
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,212
That doesn't even
look like muscle.

693
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,696
It's more pale than usual.

694
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:25,092
And look at that.

695
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,816
It barely twitched.

696
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:30,220
Well, that's odd, given
Dax's athletic background.

697
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:32,567
I think we've hit the part of the
story where we find answers.

698
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:35,658
Conrad? You there?

699
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,095
I am with you every
step of the way.

700
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,666
I know what's wrong with Dax.

701
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,102
You'll need a muscle
biopsy to confirm.

702
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:52,225
Mr. Landry. Hey.

703
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,595
So, it turns out that Dax has a
genetic mitochondrial disorder.

704
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,042
And that occurs
when mitochondria

705
00:36:58,066 --> 00:36:59,449
fails to produce enough energy

706
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:02,535
for the body to
function properly.

707
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,171
When Dax went pro, he
started doing intermittent fasting.

708
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:09,459
It triggered his disorder and it
exacerbated his trauma symptoms.

709
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:10,960
Is it treatable?

710
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,640
With a specialized
diet and supplements,

711
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,131
it's likely he'll be able
to continue to play.

712
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,800
- I can't thank you both enough.
- Uh,

713
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,813
we aren't the only
ones you should thank.

714
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:22,483
We didn't make
the diagnosis alone.

715
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:25,091
Conrad Hawkins
was an integral part.

716
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,227
Really?

717
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:38,771
Mr. Landry?

718
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:41,223
I heard what you did for Dax.

719
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,209
I owe you a debt of thanks.

720
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,278
Oh. Glad I could help.

721
00:37:45,313 --> 00:37:48,297
I also heard that
Dax brought you in

722
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:51,635
because our team doctor
didn't address his concerns.

723
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,235
That's unacceptable.

724
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,122
My players are
like family to me.

725
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:59,309
And this has shown me
that my family needs a doctor.

726
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,928
I'd like that doctor to be you.

727
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,633
Is, is this is a real offer?

728
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:10,269
It is. I don't think
I'll have a problem

729
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:12,305
getting you a
position at St. John's.

730
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:17,894
So, Dr. Hawkins,
what do you say?

731
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:34,994
Hawkins, what
are you doing here?

732
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:36,640
I thought you'd like to
know I've just been hired

733
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:39,332
as the new team
doctor for Georgia FC.

734
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:42,952
Physical therapy, medical tests,
referrals, orthopedic surgery.

735
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:47,557
It's the prestige and money

736
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,993
of a partnership with
a major sports team.

737
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:54,781
Now, all of this will
remain at St. John's,

738
00:38:54,816 --> 00:39:00,320
unless there's another
hospital I decide to call home.

739
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:04,457
Do you want Chastain
to be that hospital?

740
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:09,295
Or should I just
let Red Rock know

741
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:12,648
you let this golden goose
slip through your fingers?

742
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,250
You're bluffing.

743
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,503
Bill Landry has a
contract with St. John's.

744
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,149
A contract his lawyers
say he can get out of

745
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:20,824
with a few quick phone calls,

746
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,426
given what happened
to Dax Ramsey.

747
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:27,413
If I were to agree to this,
what would be the terms,

748
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,432
moving forward?

749
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,851
Well, you and I hug it out...

750
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,773
and then I decide

751
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:41,745
which physicians treat
and consult Georgia FC

752
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,365
and I monitor every
aspect of team care.

753
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,235
I'm chief resident.

754
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,604
And I'm gonna do
whatever I think is best

755
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,540
for my patients
here at Chastain.

756
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,862
I love it. Yes, yes.

757
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,098
I can't believe
you pulled this off.

758
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,145
I wish I could've seen the
look on Logan Kim's face.

759
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:06,603
Oh, if you were truly our
friend, you would have

760
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,532
recorded it so we
can play it on a loop.

761
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,969
I have to admit,
it was pretty great,

762
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,793
but this is just the beginning.

763
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,946
He's right. We still
have a lot of work to do.

764
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,959
Like ousting our
corporate overlords.

765
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,762
- Which won't be an easy task.
- True,

766
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:24,453
but we will get
it done, together.

767
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,105
Agreed.

768
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:31,511
But first, we need to do
something about your wardrobe.

769
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:35,814
Welcome home, Conrad.

770
00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:43,506
Yeah! All right.

771
00:40:44,993 --> 00:40:48,178
Yeah!

772
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:52,448
- Mwah.
- Thank you.

773
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:53,800
Still looks good.

774
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,802
A toast.

775
00:40:55,837 --> 00:40:58,654
Here's to another
day in the trenches.

776
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,334
I'll drink to that.

777
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,037
- Cheers. Cheers.
- It's good to have you back.

778
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:05,644
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

779
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:15,171
I'm sorry I wasn't there
to celebrate with you.

780
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,156
After the day you've had,

781
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:19,270
I'm the last person
you should think about.

782
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:25,548
Kyle has a long road ahead,

783
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:26,994
but you don't have
to do this alone, Nic.

784
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:28,651
Whatever happens, I'm here.

785
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,273
Hey. What did I say?

786
00:41:33,308 --> 00:41:36,476
Exactly what I needed to hear.

787
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:40,697
Oh. Oh, hey, sorry.

788
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,359
Sorry, I just...

789
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:44,128
Do you...? I-Is it
okay if I borrow this?

790
00:41:44,152 --> 00:41:46,297
- I kind of already stuck my...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

791
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:48,049
You can keep it. You
got everything you need?

792
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:51,908
Uh, yeah, yeah. You got snacks,
you got tunes, you got road map.

793
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:56,078
I think we are good to go.

794
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,480
Well, if you need anything...

795
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,349
Yeah.

796
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:04,888
Hey, so... you-you think
this place in Savannah,

797
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,089
you really, you really
think they can help me?

798
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,569
It's one of the best

799
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:10,388
inpatient centers
in the country.

800
00:42:10,412 --> 00:42:12,273
It's a psych joint.
I get it, but good.

801
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,280
Whatever it takes.

802
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:19,068
I really want to be there
for all those moments

803
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,953
that you talked about.

804
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,323
Me, too.

805
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:25,608
Come on.

806
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,296
Call me on the way?

807
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:54,604
We can all help prevent suicide.

808
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:57,122
The National Suicide
Prevention Lifeline

809
00:42:57,158 --> 00:43:00,142
is a national network
of local crisis centers

810
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:04,046
that provides free and
confidential emotional support

811
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,882
to those in suicidal crisis
and emotional distress

812
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:10,036
24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

813
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:12,655
If you're struggling
with thoughts of suicide,

814
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,124
or worried about a
loved one or a friend,

815
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,975
help is available to you.
