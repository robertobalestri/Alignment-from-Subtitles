00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,639
Cervical spinal fusions?

179
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:13,641
If I wanted to go the
ordinary route, yeah, sure.

180
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,560
But I'm not ordinary.

181
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:19,664
Artificial disc surgery.

182
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,232
But not just one.

183
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,518
I'm gonna replace all
four of the affected discs.

184
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,215
What, a four-level
disc replacement?

185
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,333
- Has that ever been done?
- Not in the United States.

186
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:32,043
So when I'm done, Horace
Dudley will have a bionic spine.

187
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,140
There are no U.S. studies
on long-term outcomes

188
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:36,397
for multiple artificial discs.

189
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,017
Every study needs
a first patient.

190
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,018
Horace Dudley
will be that patient.

191
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,082
Well, great. I'll just need
to see the overseas data

192
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,946
before I can sign
off on the surgery.

193
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,511
Sure. I'll send them right now.

194
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,951
♪ ♪

195
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,502
Oh. Mm.

196
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,031
Dr. Broome.

197
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,235
Uh... Bonnie.

198
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,420
Please call me that.

199
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:10,508
I-I know you have
a mom, Dr. Austin.

200
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,992
They call him A.J.

201
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,350
So, lunch?

202
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:31,813
A poker game?
Are you kidding me?

203
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:35,633
- Good morning to you, too.
- No. You can't gloss this over.

204
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,752
This is wrong on
every level imaginable.

205
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,353
You gambled a person.

206
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,017
Look, now, hold
it. That wasn't me.

207
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,607
A bunch of men drinking,
betting, gambling with a life.

208
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,938
- You're complicit.
- So, what are you
actually mad about?

209
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:49,413
The drinking? The
gambling? Men in general?

210
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,602
Patients are human beings
with needs, not poker chips.

211
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:56,971
Horace Dudley
is my ortho patient

212
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,500
who sometimes makes
the uninformed choice

213
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,152
of finding surgeons
to do operations

214
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:01,609
I've warned him against.

215
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,322
I've been encouraging
him to go to PT,

216
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,374
and now, after one
night of Texas hold 'em...

217
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,009
What does it matter
how Cain got him?

218
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,517
This is a patient who is
going to go to a neurosurgeon.

219
00:11:09,553 --> 00:11:11,119
He's proved that over and over.

220
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:13,137
And Cain's as good as
McGill. He's better even.

221
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,374
This is a radical surgery
that might paralyze or kill him.

222
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,210
It's a proven technique; it just
hasn't made its way here yet.

223
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:22,141
Oh, and because it's Cain,
and he brings in millions,

224
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,909
we have no problem
being the first.

225
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,711
Well, somebody
has to, you know that.

226
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:28,168
Forget it. I'm
going to the board.

227
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:30,555
I'll tell them he trades
patients over cards,

228
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,902
publicize his surgical notes,
file a complaint with the AMA.

229
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,242
- No, don't. Don't.
- Why the hell not?

230
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,262
Be-Because this is why
I'm keeping him close.

231
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,415
The board will side
with Cain, and he...

232
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,900
he'll destroy you.

233
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,520
I don't want to see that happen.

234
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,771
Thanks for the
vote of confidence.

235
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,323
Oh, Kit, come on.

236
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:52,393
What... Wh-What
are you gonna do?

237
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,499
Turn your head all the
way to the left for me.

238
00:11:58,534 --> 00:11:59,834
Stop when you hit pain.

239
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:01,586
- Uh, uh, r-right there.
- Okay.

240
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,182
- That-that hurts.
- Okay, now go all the way
back to the right.

241
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,923
This stops now.

242
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,876
How can I help you, Dr. Voss?

243
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,411
How about you start by
telling your patient the truth?

244
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:12,129
Horace has already been

245
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,860
fully briefed on his
upcoming surgery.

246
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:16,651
Dr. Cain won you
in a poker game.

247
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,354
Excuse me?

248
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:22,273
Your original neurosurgeon,
Dr. Vince McGill,

249
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,076
ran out of chips, so he
put your name in the pot.

250
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,278
Like betting a car.

251
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,731
Only he bet you, and lost.

252
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,095
<i>Lab extension 2419...</i>

253
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,784
What'd you have?

254
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,970
Full house, queens over eights.

255
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,756
I won 20 grand in Vegas
once, queens over eights.

256
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,169
He thought he
had me with a flush.

257
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,093
Of course, he didn't.

258
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,656
I remember one time,
about three months ago, right,

259
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,274
I drew sixes on a big
blind. Flop, nothing.

260
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,909
The river was sweet.

261
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,482
- You know what it was, yeah.
- Yeah.

262
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,252
Thanks for getting here so fast.

263
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:54,105
Well, when my son summons
me for an ASAP checkup,

264
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,757
I do as I'm told.

265
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,408
How's the device company?

266
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,977
It's never easy to
challenge the status quo,

267
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,563
- but you know that.
- Yeah.

268
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:03,747
- So, what's going on?
- Hopefully nothing.

269
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,334
I'm just a little concerned
about one of the meds you're on,

270
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,986
so I wanted to check you out.

271
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,522
I feel fine. Couple of
Crohn's flares now and then,

272
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,957
but, uh, the steroids help.

273
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,675
All right, we're
just right here.

274
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,660
Leg swelling? Chest pain?

275
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,446
No, none of that.

276
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,098
Breathing okay?

277
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,993
Well, a little shortness
of breath here and there,

278
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:23,985
but I figure that's age,

279
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,015
plus a little too much
room service on the road.

280
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,606
Okay, I'll do a quick
exam down here,

281
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,376
and then we'll run up to CT,
so I can rule out a blood clot.

282
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,030
I missed you.

283
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,382
I missed you, too.

284
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,319
Did I tell you Nic
and I got chickens?

285
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:52,830
Hi, good morning.
Hi, I'm Dr. Okafor.

286
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,348
Rosie. This is Lacy.

287
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,795
And...

288
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,798
- I'm sorry, I just...
- You're fine.

289
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:01,205
Thank you.

290
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,753
I've had to be strong
for her, you know.

291
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,460
What are Lacy's symptoms?

292
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,696
She used to be so smart.

293
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:11,749
All this energy,
all these friends.

294
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,869
And now her teachers
say that she's not playing

295
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:18,022
with anyone at recess, and
she can't keep up in class.

296
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,224
They might hold her back.

297
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,811
A mental disorder wouldn't
cause this kind of lethargy.

298
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,013
I will run some tests,

299
00:14:25,048 --> 00:14:27,548
and then we can see
what we're dealing with.

300
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,536
Um... will it take a long time?

301
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,254
We don't have clinics in Dawson,

302
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,740
and the hospital
is so expensive.

303
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,769
I already had to take
off a shift at the diner

304
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,826
to drive here.

305
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,456
I was only supposed
to take three hours,

306
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,358
and you know traffic
coming into Atlanta.

307
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,032
I will do everything I
can to help you both.

308
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,587
Thanks.

309
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,223
I got to take this. I'll
meet you guys inside.

310
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:55,542
Yo.

311
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,240
So I have an out
if you need one.

312
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:00,381
Oh, well, that's
tempting. What is the out?

313
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,518
A child with an undiagnosed
condition and heart murmur.

314
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:06,270
<i>You and Mother of Raptors
could come in for a consult.</i>

315
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,855
Hard pass.

316
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,274
You're just trying to get
a look at my bio mom.

317
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,327
I'm trying to save this family
the expense of an ER visit.

318
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,998
I'll think about it.

319
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:24,288
I'll be back to you.

320
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,041
Jessica doesn't want to move
in with me unless we're married.

321
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,794
You know she lived
with an artist? In Paris.

322
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,212
I've never even been to Paris.

323
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,075
I'm not sure what
you're looking for here.

324
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,665
Jessica's done
all this stuff, right?

325
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,084
She's had real
relationships before me.

326
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,803
I haven't. Not really.

327
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,239
You know the one time I
downloaded a dating app,

328
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,257
I was too freaked
out to even open it.

329
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,854
Now all I do is
pay student loans

330
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:46,827
and hang out with you.

331
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:47,828
I'm boring.

332
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,546
I've never even had car sex.

333
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,066
Does an RV count?

334
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:55,235
Look, Jessica took her
path, you took yours.

335
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:57,304
They brought you to each other.

336
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:00,007
Don't let insecurity
ruin a good thing.

337
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,275
Okay, Dr. Wisdom.

338
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,010
Okay, no, I know

339
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,479
that I'm not exactly the guy
to give out relationship advice.

340
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,927
The woman I left at
the altar is now dating

341
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:10,450
some hotshot sportscaster
in San Francisco

342
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,102
while I spend my days with you.

343
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,323
So do as I say, not as I do.

344
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:17,876
Hi, Mr. Jones.

345
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,430
No, Jonesy, if
you would. Please.

346
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:20,762
Hurt your arm, Jonesy?

347
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:22,196
Fat Charlie got his revenge.

348
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,842
Was it because you
called him Fat Charlie?

349
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,718
No, no. Fat Charlie is my horse.

350
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,936
I know what you're thinking.

351
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,439
I'm too old to still be
a professional jockey.

352
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:33,190
My wife tells me every day.

353
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,191
Of course, she's
a horse trainer,

354
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,176
so she can work forever.

355
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,376
Is she here yet?

356
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,812
She hasn't checked in.

357
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,898
Preemptive apology if she's
a little much. She worries.

358
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,629
- It's understandable.
- Maybe it's time to quit.

359
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:45,969
Never.

360
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,683
If I'm not on the
back of a horse,

361
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,306
I'm not alive.

362
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,524
You got to fix me up.

363
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,527
Jonesy, you have a
fracture of your distal radius.

364
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,195
See that?

365
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,332
Now, yours is easily treatable
and won't need surgery,

366
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,052
but we're also seeing
signs of low bone density.

367
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:04,055
We need to run some
tests. Okay? We'll be back.

368
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,771
That's another
thing I've never done.

369
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,328
- What, break your arm?
- No, ride a horse. Have you?

370
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,247
Yeah.

371
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,782
See?

372
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,003
Let me guess, third cup?

373
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,855
- Fourth. You?
- Second.

374
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,774
- I need to catch up.
- Mm.

375
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,209
You're not the only one.

376
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:28,174
- Hey, Cindy.
- Mm?

377
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:29,413
Wake up.

378
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,562
- What time is it?
- I was gonna say
time to prep Cain's OR,

379
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,670
but I don't think you should
be doing that right now.

380
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:37,600
- It's okay. I'm fine.
- You're exhausted.

381
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,607
Who isn't? We're
overstaffed, underlapped.

382
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,108
Flipped around, upside down.

383
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,459
Sorry, coffee just kicked in.

384
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,972
With all these
overlapping surgeries,

385
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,212
they don't think about us.

386
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,443
Nurses and techs... we're
here early to set up the ORs.

387
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,850
And we stay after and make
sure everything is cleaned up.

388
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:52,552
First in, last out, from
one OR to the next.

389
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,915
All so Red Rock can
schedule more operations

390
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:54,979
and make more money.

391
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,091
No comment.

392
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,954
But I'm pulling rank.
Go home, get some rest.

393
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,155
I'll look around, there's
got to be someone

394
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,046
- who can swap with you.
- Me. I got you covered.

395
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,593
Jessica, you just finished
back-to-back surgeries, too.

396
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,434
Well, then I'll be in
back-to-back-to-back surgeries.

397
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,430
I may as well ride
this second wind.

398
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,075
Okay.

399
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:16,794
Scalpel.

400
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:22,149
Retractor.

401
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:34,362
Curette.

402
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,915
You've hardly spilled
a drop of blood.

403
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,222
Anything is possible in my OR.

404
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:47,792
Disc.

405
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,178
- You okay in there?
- Great.

406
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,764
Like a free nap.

407
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,501
- How's he doing?
- So far so good.

408
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,821
Nice to see you, Marshall.

409
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,058
Okay, I just have a second.

410
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,687
Jessica's covering
for Cindy in the OR,

411
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,813
so I'm trying to find someone
to cover for Jessica on the floor.

412
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:30,217
Anyway, I heard back
from my friend at General.

413
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,453
Hemopleatin patients
have died there, too.

414
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:36,135
A dialysis patient. Had
a PE just like Jessie.

415
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:37,520
He had two kids.

416
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,177
We need those records.

417
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:44,048
And someone in Oncology
who has more access.

418
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,901
I'm gonna try something else.

419
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,389
Do you have any nurses
who can help out in Neuro?

420
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,040
Cain scheduled way
more than we can manage.

421
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,914
Sorry, we're short, too.

422
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,250
Happy freakin' Nurses' Day.

423
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:06,915
- Hey.
- Hey.

424
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,340
Can I steal you for 30 seconds?

425
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,908
I got 20. What's up?

426
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,827
You did that
rotation in Oncology.

427
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:16,680
Were there any doctors that...

428
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:19,666
might be willing to
think outside the box?

429
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:21,919
I'm not sure what you mean.

430
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,288
Conrad and I think there's
a problem with this drug,

431
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,539
hemopleatin.

432
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:26,924
We're trying to find a doctor

433
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,760
who will share patient outcomes,

434
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:32,179
- but if we can't...
- You mean open patient
records that aren't yours.

435
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:35,249
That's an invasion of
privacy, plus it's illegal.

436
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:36,300
You could be fired.

437
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,935
My sister might have died

438
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,532
because of this drug.

439
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:44,074
So, honestly, I
don't give a damn.

440
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,029
Rules exist for a reason, Nic.

441
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:50,309
You can't just go break
them because in the moment

442
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,448
you think it's right.

443
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,602
You and Conrad, I love you guys,

444
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,098
but I thought I
made myself clear:

445
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,655
I am not going to
be that kind of doctor.

446
00:21:05,748 --> 00:21:08,232
But we'd only been
dating a month.

447
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,767
It was more like three weeks.

448
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,235
I can't even say for
sure we were in love.

449
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,622
You were in love, I was in lust.

450
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,474
Let her talk.

451
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:20,511
Medical school was like a dream.

452
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,980
Full ride, good grades.

453
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,149
I understand.
You had priorities.

454
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,080
No. No, not priorities.

455
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:29,581
That's... No, that's...

456
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,855
Harsh. We were kids.

457
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,419
She could have
ended the pregnancy.

458
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:36,660
Credit us that.
We saw it through.

459
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,932
I managed to stay in med school.

460
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,936
I hid the pregnancy
from everyone.

461
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,022
And then...

462
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,458
- we...
- Then you gave me away.

463
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,665
There's no judgment
here. Really, there isn't.

464
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,677
But we should at
least be honest, right?

465
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:01,969
I mean, he didn't want
me because he didn't think

466
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,187
I was his.

467
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:05,339
And then, by the time I
was born, you decided

468
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,452
you were going to be
together, so next thing you know,

469
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:09,660
you got married and
you had three more kids.

470
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:13,881
The marriage was
fast, the kids were not.

471
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,317
They came ten
years later. It's...

472
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,872
At 22, it wasn't just
Lamar who wasn't ready.

473
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,858
I didn't think I would
be a good mother.

474
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:28,479
I still don't know
if I ever was.

475
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,631
But I knew I would
be a good doctor.

476
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,250
A really good one.

477
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:35,802
And it was a time when
there were almost no doctors

478
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:37,421
who looked like me.

479
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,857
That mattered.

480
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,159
I had a goal, a mission,

481
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,713
something to prove,
and I proved it.

482
00:22:56,743 --> 00:23:00,110
You know what? Since
you're such a good doctor,

483
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,346
can you do me a favor?

484
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,532
Come with me to a peds consult.

485
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,099
Right now?

486
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,968
Yeah.

487
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,205
Stay.

488
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,289
Eat.

489
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,203
Well, that expression
doesn't look like,

490
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,521
"Hey, Dad, you're dying."

491
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:30,023
Lungs are clear. No blood clots.

492
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:32,393
Good. Now why don't you tell me

493
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:34,661
the part you wouldn't
tell me before?

494
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:40,434
The drug you're
on, hemopleatin...

495
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,321
I think it may have
caused Jessie's death.

496
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,225
- Nic knows?
- Yeah.

497
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,326
Not easy.

498
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,892
Right now we only have
anecdotal evidence that it happened.

499
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,050
I need access to a
large sample of patients,

500
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:57,979
and I can't even get the
data from this hospital.

501
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,386
And I work here.

502
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:03,340
Conrad, let me in.

503
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,609
Maybe I can help.

504
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,518
- Henrietta.
- Yes, dear?

505
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,519
- What's wrong?
- I can't breathe.

506
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,155
Oh... Somebody help!

507
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,439
Help!

508
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,510
Call a Code Blue, get
me an intubation kit.

509
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,911
What's happening?

510
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:27,447
His throat is closing.

511
00:24:27,483 --> 00:24:29,749
It's a complication
of Cain's surgery.

512
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:31,735
We need to intubate him.

513
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:34,738
Hang in there, Horace.

514
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,711
Throat's swollen shut.

515
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,186
- I can't get it in.
- Sat's 70%.

516
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:51,438
- Did somebody call Cain?
- It went to voice mail.

517
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:53,902
He's suffocating. We're out
of time. We need an airway.

518
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,977
That's it. We can't wait.
Get me a cric kit now.

519
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,679
Code team's on their way.
Wait, you're gonna cric him?

520
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,615
- Sats?
- 60%.

521
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:02,983
Then, yeah, I'm cricing him.

522
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,252
Come on, come on, come on.

523
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,345
Trach tube.

524
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:36,583
We're in.

525
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,425
02 sats are rising.

526
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:52,623
What in God's name
happened here?

527
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,953
This is Cain's patient.
Have you paged him?

528
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,673
Cain signed out. He's
not answering pages, texts,

529
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:02,136
- carrier pigeons.
- Well, then, wait
until you do hear from him.

530
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,622
- If the patient
isn't emergent...
- The patient needed to be criced

531
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,525
because of Cain's operation.

532
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,960
- I can fix him now,
I'm not waiting.
- Let's just give Cain

533
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,434
a couple of hours.

534
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:11,529
Because you're worried
about what he'll say

535
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:12,864
- if I do this.
- No, Kit.

536
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:15,522
Because I'm worried
about what he will do to you.

537
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:17,285
It'll be bad for you if you
take one of Cain's patients

538
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,609
to surgery without
consulting him.

539
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,446
Horace is my patient now, and I
didn't win him with a card game.

540
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:25,081
I got him because Cain's
unjustifiable experiment

541
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,867
nearly killed the man.

542
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:29,603
His life is still in jeopardy,
so I must try and save him.

543
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:31,304
And I hope to God I can.

544
00:26:36,912 --> 00:26:39,796
It looks like Jonesy has
early-onset osteoporosis.

545
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,615
His chart says he's got celiac.

546
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,311
Low bone density is
a common problem.

547
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,635
Not if he's stays gluten-free,
which he says he is.

548
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,454
Mm. He can't keep riding.

549
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:50,590
Another fall and his bones
could shatter like glass.

550
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,760
Poor guy. We have
to break it to him.

551
00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:54,422
Well, at least he got
to have the experience

552
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,680
in the first place.

553
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,265
Wendy Jones?

554
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,383
Right here.

555
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,754
Hi.

556
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,230
- Hi.
- Hi.

557
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:11,261
- Hey.
- Hey.

558
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,081
- You almost done here?
- Yep, shift's over.

559
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:17,117
- You want to grab a bite to eat?
- Not quite.

560
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:18,852
You have a suit?

561
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,520
Uh, I'm not a three-year-old.

562
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,689
- Yeah, I have a suit.
- Great.

563
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,358
Get it, put it on, let's meet
back here in one hour.

564
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,772
I'll text you the details.

565
00:27:26,796 --> 00:27:28,190
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Where are we going?

566
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:30,680
- D.C.
- D.C.?

567
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:33,116
Yeah. My jet's fueled
up and on the runway.

568
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:37,637
I think I can get you all of
the data you could ever need.

569
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,311
He said

570
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,708
his stomach hurt and
then he started throwing up.

571
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,882
Dying, hurts like dying.

572
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,734
- Need me?
- Heart rate is 176.

573
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,735
He's in AFib with RVR.

574
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:53,348
All right, let's get
20 of diltiazem.

575
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,400
Let's get a liter
of normal saline

576
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,224
and give four of ondansetron.

577
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,351
Deep breaths.

578
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:11,872
- That's better.
- Okay, let's get him to CT,

579
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,518
- see what's going on.
- I don't know what happened,

580
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:15,403
We were sitting
here the whole time.

581
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,707
Except for when I went to the...

582
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,433
Open your mouth.

583
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:27,870
You ate a death cookie.

584
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,167
Jonesy knows he's
allergic to gluten.

585
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,435
Yeah, he also
knows that eating it

586
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,543
helps him stay on
his stupid horse.

587
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,546
Uh, the truth is,
I had a cookie.

588
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,582
Hmm.

589
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,750
Three cookies.

590
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:42,286
So you eat gluten,
flares up your celiac,

591
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,421
and the aftereffects
keep the weight off.

592
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:48,274
- Hmm.
- Well, look, it's harder to keep
the weight off at my age.

593
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,443
If I get too heavy for
Fat Charlie, then...

594
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,806
You won't be able
to ride anymore.

595
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,947
Not professionally.

596
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:56,066
Except when celiac is
flared, it stops your body

597
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,068
from absorbing
nutrients like it should.

598
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,023
That is why your
arm broke so easily.

599
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,906
We met at the track.

600
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,742
You fell in love with a jockey.

601
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:10,130
If I'm not riding
anymore, who are we?

602
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,565
Honey.

603
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:14,151
Sure,

604
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:17,053
the riding crop and
the cute little pants

605
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,217
and the helmet were
what did it for me at first.

606
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:24,794
But then, when I fell in
love, I fell in love with you.

607
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:30,033
Dude.

608
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,486
You've got someone
who loves you.

609
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,788
Don't ruin that for something

610
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:36,290
that doesn't make sense anymore.

611
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:39,125
It's time to hang up
the saddle, Jonesy.

612
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,847
You don't have to
retire the whip, though.

613
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,882
Mama has needs.

614
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,002
I'm out.

615
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:53,706
Meredith, glasses. Jessica.

616
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:58,194
Dr. Bell. How's your back doing?

617
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,579
I'm all right, thanks.

618
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:01,877
We have to figure out what
happened to Cain's poker prize.

619
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,484
Aren't you worried about
angering the great Dr. Cain?

620
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:06,736
I'm the CEO, so, frankly, no.

621
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,642
I'm here to help.

622
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:12,938
You figure out what happened?

623
00:30:12,962 --> 00:30:15,546
Retropharyngeal hematoma.

624
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,275
Compressed his airway.

625
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,282
Well.

626
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,301
What have we got here?

627
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:24,471
One of the manufacturer's
discs was defective. It happens.

628
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:28,057
Certainly. But it's more likely
with each disc that's inserted.

629
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:32,895
Taking these out,
gonna put 'em back.

630
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,148
Okay, let's-let's
start with this one.

631
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,600
She seems nice from here.

632
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,977
Is this normal for Lacy?

633
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,714
No. She's been doing
harder puzzles for years.

634
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:52,332
Here, let me have it.

635
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:53,584
It's okay.

636
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:58,650
- Have you ever seen a cow?
- I saw a baby deer.

637
00:30:58,674 --> 00:31:01,391
- Where?
- I think she means at camp.

638
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:03,488
Our church took
the kids in July.

639
00:31:03,512 --> 00:31:05,695
To North Carolina,
in the mountains.

640
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,413
Lacy brought books.

641
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,049
Picture books. She was...

642
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:11,568
She was good then.
She was reading.

643
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:12,902
She came back like this?

644
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,749
No, she was fine
when she got back.

645
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,390
She had a flu. It was rough.

646
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:20,527
A flu. How long
after her return?

647
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,613
Couple of weeks. Had to
miss the first day of school.

648
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:27,434
The mountains of North
Carolina in July, that is tick season.

649
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,819
Lyme disease.

650
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,505
But she doesn't have a rash.

651
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,173
Sometimes it doesn't show up.

652
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,342
Sometimes it's
hidden under the hair.

653
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:39,146
Lacy, have your
bones been hurting?

654
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,749
Lyme is known as
"The Great Imitator."

655
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:45,702
It can mimic
virtually any disease.

656
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,455
Untreated, it can also
cause neurological symptoms.

657
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,274
That could be the source of the
cognitive decline you're seeing.

658
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,539
But don't worry, it is treatable
if diagnosed this early.

659
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:56,363
We'll run a test to confirm,

660
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:58,292
but if this is Lyme,
I am quite certain

661
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,867
we can get Lacy back
to herself in no time.

662
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:06,373
You hear that, baby?

663
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:09,693
It's gonna be okay.

664
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,755
There you are.

665
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,325
Whoa. Is this a
surprise date night?

666
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:28,779
Going to a shareholder meeting.

667
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,665
This is a Marshall thing.

668
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,569
He knows the CEO of this
kidney dialysis company in D.C.

669
00:32:35,604 --> 00:32:39,689
They handle 50% of the
renal patients in the U.S.

670
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:42,308
We're hoping they're gonna let
us take a look at their database

671
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:43,843
for hemopleatin patients.

672
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,163
You are a rock star.

673
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,816
Who kind of looks like a spy.

674
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:56,689
Good luck. Let me
know how it goes.

675
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:02,712
Maybe think about wearing
that suit to our next date night.

676
00:33:10,305 --> 00:33:12,905
Can't keep a
fireman from the fire.

677
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:18,044
I was gonna call you.

678
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,363
Dr. Okafor and I agree

679
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,183
that you saved that
little girl from a lifetime

680
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:25,352
of preventable disabilities.

681
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:27,988
I'm glad I could help.

682
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,524
You are a good doctor.

683
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:35,461
You don't think I
loved you enough

684
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:38,298
or wanted you enough,

685
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:41,001
but how could I? I...

686
00:33:41,036 --> 00:33:44,570
I didn't know what your
adoptive family had named you.

687
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:48,408
The records were
sealed back then.

688
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,476
So...

689
00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:54,064
every time a little boy
came into my office,

690
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,349
if he was the right age...

691
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,188
and had the right color of skin,

692
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:04,841
I looked for you in his eyes.

693
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,243
I...

694
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,696
I never stopped looking.

695
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,902
Well, now you can.

696
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,851
Would it be moving too fast

697
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:34,504
if I invited you
to Thanksgiving?

698
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,557
Um...

699
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:40,426
I spend Thanksgiving
with my family.

700
00:34:40,462 --> 00:34:41,912
The one that raised me.

701
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:44,731
I understand that.

702
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:48,151
But maybe there's
something we can work out.

703
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:51,454
No promises, but...

704
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,024
Understood.

705
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,659
Even if this doesn't
work, what you are doing

706
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,895
is above and beyond, so...

707
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,618
thank you.

708
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:09,088
Well, it's the annual
meeting of one of the top two

709
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:12,125
dialysis companies
in the country, so...

710
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,976
it'll be a blast, right?

711
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,312
Not exactly, but,

712
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,730
hey, if they'll give us the data

713
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,527
on hemopleatin,
it'll be well worth it.

714
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,018
How many of these things
have you been to in your life?

715
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,647
Hundreds.

716
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:26,272
Okay. What's the plan?

717
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,641
Try to stay awake
through the financials.

718
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:31,923
You'll see. It's so boring,
half the people fall asleep.

719
00:35:31,947 --> 00:35:35,365
When the speeches are over,
we'll find the CEO, Jim DeLoach,

720
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,366
and we'll go from there.

You saved Horace Dudley's
life and his ability to walk.

754
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,567
Not that we should have
had to do that surgery.

755
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:59,491
That man had four hockey
pucks shoved in his spine.

756
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,138
Is that what you'll
tell the board?

757
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:03,379
Cain is not one
of the good guys.

758
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,967
But if I go to war
with him and lose,

759
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:10,753
I won't be here
to fix his mistakes.

760
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,589
I agree completely.

761
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,192
You won't be able to save the
Horace Dudleys of the world.

762
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,261
So I'm not giving up.

763
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,347
I promise you I'm not.

764
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,466
I'm just gonna have to
fight in a different way.

765
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:38,797
Dr. Cain.

766
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,433
I owe you an explanation.

767
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:42,852
I assume it's about
how you took my patient

768
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,054
into the OR without
my permission.

769
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,724
You were wrong to
perform that operation.

770
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,359
I've heard enough. I'm filing
a complaint with the board.

771
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,679
No, wait, please.
Uh, what I mean is,

772
00:38:52,714 --> 00:38:54,897
I<i> believe</i> you were wrong.

773
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,566
That doesn't make it so.

774
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,568
We both have different
approaches to patient care.

775
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,537
We just do.

776
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,684
I can't fault you for leaning
into Red Rock's mandate.

777
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,570
You also can't fault
me for doing things

778
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,560
the way I've always done them.

779
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,914
So maybe there's a
way we can keep an eye

780
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,099
on each other's
surgical practices...

781
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:19,038
while making an extraordinary
amount of money along the way.

782
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,075
What'd you have in mind?

783
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,261
A joint venture.

784
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:27,596
An ortho-spine surgery center

785
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,365
for comprehensive spine care.

786
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:32,868
To include neuro
and ortho surgery

787
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,987
and physical therapy.

788
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:38,975
Both quality and
quantity of patients.

789
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:41,577
Agreed.

790
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,759
- Thanks, Jules.
- Mr. DeLoach,

791
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:59,194
this man says that he knows you.

792
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,265
"Winnie the Winner" Winthrop.

793
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,884
- How you been?
- Fantastic.

794
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:07,036
You the son? Look
just like your old man.

795
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,272
Conrad Hawkins.

796
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:12,942
Dr. Conrad Hawkins,
Chastain Park in Atlanta.

797
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,178
No kidding. That's amazing.

798
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,747
So what are you doing here?

799
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,610
Been way too long
since the Old Green.

800
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,768
Was a private
gentlemen's club in D.C.

801
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:23,753
It's a hell of a thing
you've got here.

802
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,471
A falcon?

803
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,539
Yeah. Always loved the birds.

804
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:29,141
So, you kids want a drink?

805
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,560
Actually, we need
help with something.

806
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,446
Anything for the old Winnie.

807
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:36,933
Your database. We're doing
a little research on a drug.

808
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,551
Bigger the sample size,

809
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:40,219
more accurate the data will be.

810
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:42,654
No problem. It's all yours.

811
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:46,642
That's-that's great.
That's a big help.

812
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,072
Just need a little
something from you fellas.

813
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:50,913
Little QPQ.

814
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,682
I've had my eye on
Chastain for a while.

815
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,434
Big market, lot of promise.

816
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:59,138
An exclusive with DiaCure renal
services would help us all out.

817
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:03,008
Think you can make that happen?

818
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:09,148
Okay.

819
00:41:09,183 --> 00:41:12,318
So, five seconds of action,
and then I'm on the road.

820
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,386
Usually, it's at
least ten seconds.

821
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,691
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

822
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:28,351
- Okay.
- That's it?

823
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:29,396
Five seconds are up.

824
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,270
- Okay.
- Yeah.

825
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:34,373
Next time, don't waste it, or
else I'll have to punish you.

826
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,903
- Ooh, a consequence?
- Mm-hmm.

827
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,177
Bring it.

828
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,951
Think he'll be back to the ER?

829
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:48,504
My guess is, he's
done with horses.

830
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,073
Yeah, the next time we see
him, it'll be for a sex injury.

831
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,526
He gets it.

832
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:55,544
So do I.

833
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,241
Stupid to question
the love of your life

834
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:01,167
for something
that's just... stupid.

835
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:05,071
So Jessica is the
love of your life.

836
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,939
Nicely done, man.
