00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,546
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- You want Conrad to go down.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,665
Whistleblowers like Hawkins
cost hospitals millions.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,956
It's him or you.

4
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:09,669
If it were easy, everyone
would be a doctor

5
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:12,194
because this is the
best job in the world,

6
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:15,013
despite everything,
because of everything.

7
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,816
Cardiac issues can escalate
quickly for pregnant women.

8
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:21,319
Worsening heart failure
could kill both you and the baby.

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:24,089
So, guys, hey.
These are the doctors

10
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,909
that are gonna be
helping Dr. Cain save Mom.

11
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,171
There is only a slim hope

12
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,145
this will buy you more time.

13
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,498
I will do anything
to stay with my kids

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,662
- as long as I can.
- When is she gonna wake up?

15
00:00:35,686 --> 00:00:37,936
Dawn has endured
17 hours of surgery.

16
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,021
Her body is
struggling to recover.

17
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:42,002
She hasn't regained
consciousness and as yet,

18
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:43,946
isn't able to
breathe on her own.

19
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,699
- What?
<i>- Mina, I think it's happening.</i>

20
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,522
What do you mean it's happening?

21
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,008
- The baby.
<i>- It's five weeks early.</i>

22
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:02,272
- How far apart are
your contractions?
<i>- Hang on a sec.</i>

23
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:10,034
20 minutes maybe.

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,386
I think some are coming sooner.

25
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:12,699
<i>I think they're
getting stronger.</i>

26
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:14,767
Use the app. It's
important to log each one.

27
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,192
- Did your water break?
<i>- N-No.</i>

28
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:18,905
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm at Peachtree and 4th.

29
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,924
It's a big sale. First come,
first serve. I need a crib.

30
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,048
<i>- I'm in line.</i>
- Sit down immediately.

31
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,049
- Yes, Doctor.
- Okay, I'm on my way.

32
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,768
I'm taking you to Chastain.

33
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,572
Okay. Okay.

34
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,729
- Hey, what's up?
<i>- Adaku is in labor,</i>

35
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:45,420
and in line at a box
store, if you can believe it.

36
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,683
<i>- I'm gonna get her right now.</i>
- She's five weeks early.

37
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,074
<i>Yeah. So to be safe,
I'm taking her to the ER.</i>

38
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,904
Well, of course. With her
heart condition, she needs

39
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:54,257
<i>- to be monitored.</i>
- Obviously, I will not
make lunch today.

40
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,752
- What was that?
<i>- Um,</i>

41
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,404
I, uh, almost hit
a car. All good.

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,668
- Okay. I'm coming to meet
you both at the ER.
<i>- Uh, no.</i>

43
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,259
It's your day off. Enjoy your...

44
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,607
- yoga.
<i>- On a scale from one to ten,</i>
<i>your stress level</i>

45
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,759
<i>sounds like a 12. Emotional
support is required,</i>

46
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:14,127
and that happens
to be my superpower,

47
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:15,845
so I will see you
at the hospital.

48
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,003
Now turn off your
phone and slow down.

49
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,122
<i>I will. I promise.</i>

50
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,487
And we're done here.

51
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,994
Dr. Voss, the hip is all yours.

52
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:30,848
He's bradying down.

53
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,804
Coleman, push two grams of
mannitol and open up the drain.

54
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:39,824
His brain is swelling again.

55
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,292
What's your issue, Dr. Voss?

56
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,472
He had advanced
dementia even before he fell.

57
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,046
Uh, he's 89.

58
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,399
Yes, I've had the pleasure
of reading his chart.

59
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,800
Your point?

60
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:53,171
His ICP's increasing.
He's gonna herniate.

61
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,918
There's no way this
is gonna end well.

62
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,302
Given his physical
and mental status

63
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:59,794
before surgery and
this complication,

64
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:03,365
he'll have zero quality of
life, if you could even call it life.

65
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,184
Are you suggesting
we let him die?

66
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,154
He'll be a body in
a bed. A vegetable.

67
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,391
It's the compassionate
choice at this point.

68
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,212
I'm gonna say this
once and never again.

69
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,647
Nobody...

70
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:21,866
and I mean nobody...
Dies in my OR!

71
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:27,022
Coleman, proceed.

72
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,744
Pushing two grams of
mannitol and opening the drain.

73
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:54,633
So, the son is
expecting an update.

74
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,362
Why don't you go out
there and talk to him,

75
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:57,869
tell him the surgery went well.

76
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,805
Tell him his father is
stable and in the ICU.

77
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,459
Remember to smile.

78
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,478
It shows you take pleasure
when delivering good news.

79
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,514
Understood?

80
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:30,585
♪ ♪

81
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,085
Last day as an intern
for Dr. Devon Pravesh.

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,471
Yeah!

83
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,908
- My, how time flies.
- Seriously?

84
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:55,938
- Thank you.
- That felt like
the longest year in history.

85
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,257
12 more hours,
you'll be free of me.

86
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:58,580
I will never escape you

87
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,655
since you're going
to be chief resident.

88
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:02,033
Oh, yeah.

89
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,602
- Good point.
- As a second-year resident

90
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,321
with interns of your own, you'll
need to up your wardrobe game.

91
00:05:07,357 --> 00:05:09,440
I could definitely
see him in a bow tie.

92
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,487
Oh, yeah, I've already
got three picked out for him.

93
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,106
- What? No. No.
- Nic leans towards plaid,
but I think he's more

94
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,296
- of a polka dot kind of guy.
- Oh... Uh...

95
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:18,917
Batman, Robin, you're
needed in Bay Two.

96
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:26,491
Hello. I'm Dr. Hawkins,
this is my<i> intern</i> Dr. Pravesh.

97
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,842
Hi.

98
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:29,338
Now, can you tell
us what happened?

99
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:33,532
Uh, I, um, I think Tyler
took a bunch of these...

100
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,151
I'm not sure how many...
And a few sleeping pills.

101
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:38,703
Okay. Sleeping pills.

102
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,705
I... it-it's not what you think.

103
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,708
H-He's been having
trouble sleeping

104
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,026
and lots of pain
from sports injuries.

105
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:48,980
I think he took too much
acetaminophen by mistake.

106
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,966
Okay. Thank you.

107
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:52,494
We will let you know as
soon as we have an update,

108
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,147
- okay?
- Nurse Hundley?

109
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:55,931
Would you mind taking
Tyler's mom outside

110
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,915
- where she can wait, please?
- Sure.

111
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:00,842
- Excuse me.
- Come on.

112
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,362
Vitals are stable.

113
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,881
Pulse 80s, BP 120/70.

114
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,836
- Satting 100% on room air.
- Tyler.

115
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,037
Tyler, can you hear me?

116
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,890
- Where's my mom at?
- She's here. We got you.

117
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:19,010
I'll order a set of labs with an
acetaminophen and aspirin level.

118
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,079
- Don't forget...
- Coags.

119
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,842
- I know.
- We'll add a liter of saline.

120
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,900
Labs could be hours and we
have a high index of suspicion.

121
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:28,720
- Let's start him on NAC.
- Hmm. Hey.

122
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,533
I think it, he says it.

123
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,068
It's like I taught him
everything he knows.

124
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,342
Hey. I was also involved.

125
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,511
- Eh.
- Okay, guys.

126
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:38,529
Chill out.

127
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,694
Katie and I cooked
dinner yesterday.

128
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:55,213
Tim cleaned. Well...

129
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,064
He sort of cleaned.

130
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,969
We always have to
wash his dishes twice.

131
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,970
I miss you.

132
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,157
I bet your mother loves
hearing about your day.

133
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,878
Do you really
think so, Dr. Cain?

134
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:15,300
She never squeezes my
hand or makes any sign

135
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,118
that she even knows I'm here.

136
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,837
Well, I have some good news.

137
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:24,070
Your mother is
ready to leave the ICU

138
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:26,193
and go to a great
rehab facility.

139
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,182
Rehab? She, she
doesn't even move.

140
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,935
Hmm? Give her some
time. Don't count her out.

141
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:36,922
Your mother is a fighter.

142
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,108
She survived the
Mother of All Surgeries.

143
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,811
She's being transferred today.

144
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:45,474
Just let her settle
into her new home

145
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,948
and then you can go visit her.

146
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,822
And, Malia, don't give
up before the miracle.

147
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,142
Okay?

148
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,789
Where are you
taking this patient?

149
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:18,796
Long-term acute care facility.

150
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,816
- On whose orders?
- Dr. Cain,
at the family's request.

151
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,039
Adaku?

152
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,508
So, this is your
baby's birthday.

153
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,576
So excited. Scared and excited.

154
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,011
Where is her OB?

155
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,541
I texted her to meet
us half an hour ago.

156
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,527
Dr. Lin has a patient
but will be here soon.

157
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,833
Put her in Trauma Bay 11.

158
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,501
How is that good enough?

159
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:42,064
I'm going to call the
OB chief and complain.

160
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,705
Dr. Lin is the OB chief, Mina.

161
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,806
That's why you chose
her. Remember?

162
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:46,974
Breathe.

163
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,510
I'm not having a contraction.

164
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,228
He means me.

165
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,058
- Mina, darling. One minute.
- What? Do you have pain?

166
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,843
- Is your heart racing?
- I'm fine.

167
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,819
Soon we will meet my baby,
the child I've wanted my whole life.

168
00:08:57,854 --> 00:09:00,021
And you'll be her godmother.

169
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,256
You are my dearest friend.

170
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,175
I've known you half my life.

171
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,745
It's time for us to
be happy. Together.

172
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,814
Okay.

173
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,771
♪ ♪

174
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,044
Got a new one for the vent farm.

175
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,041
- From Chastain. Dr. Cain's patient.
- Another?

176
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:43,792
We won't have a
room ready for her

177
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,277
- until later today.
- Got to put her somewhere.

178
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,963
She can't go back to the
hospital. Doctor's orders.

179
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,820
Okay. Stash her there with
the others who are waiting.

180
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,939
How you doing, Tyler?

181
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,243
Uh, I'm-I'm better. Thanks.

182
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,740
Do you want to tell
us what happened?

183
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:16,580
Sophomore year, I
was tackling a fullback.

184
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,835
He was a big guy and
I... dislocated my elbow.

185
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,104
Painful.

186
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:27,425
Yeah, and... junior year, I
lost sight of the quarterback.

187
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,472
- Got blindsided.
- Did you get this bruise

188
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,446
playing football?

189
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:33,847
Uh, that one, I don't know.

190
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,066
I'm not sure.

191
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,419
When's your next game?

192
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:39,437
For me?

193
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,773
Never, 'cause I got cut.

194
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:47,028
And then Tilly, my girlfriend,

195
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,464
she broke up with
me the next day, so...

196
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,117
Did that happen today?

197
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,019
Tilly was yesterday and...

198
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,004
team was the day before.

199
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,090
Um...

200
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,961
Then, this morning...

201
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,458
uh, my parents told me

202
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:08,632
that they're calling it quits.

203
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,668
Filing for divorce.

204
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,289
That is a lot to deal with, man.

205
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:17,341
I-I did something
really stupid, um...

206
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,329
I...

207
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:23,831
I tried to kill myself.

208
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,690
Yeah.

209
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,155
- Tyler?
- Yeah.

210
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:38,173
Listen, have you been thinking
about taking pills for a while?

211
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,197
No, man, no.

212
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,648
It was...

213
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:42,344
gosh, it was a
spur-of-the-moment thing.

214
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,317
I was just...

215
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:45,837
I was, I was angry and I...

216
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,255
I'm not like that,
like, I'm-I'm not...

217
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,175
I, uh...

218
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,993
Where am I...?

219
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,393
- Hey, Tyler, look at me.
- Oh...

220
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,694
- Huh?
- Open your eyes.

221
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,168
- Okay, okay.
- Bruising, confusion,

222
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,882
- scleral icterus.
- No, guys.

223
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:04,016
I'm good, I'm okay.

224
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,217
I'm okay...

225
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:06,407
Whoa, whoa.

226
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:07,858
Okay, okay.

227
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,228
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm good.

228
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,896
And what time did
the contractions start?

229
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,220
Her first contraction was
at 6:42, second at 7:15,

230
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,689
- third at 7:33.
- It sounds like early labor,

231
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:24,526
which isn't great, considering
she's five weeks early.

232
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:26,555
We can deal with that, and
we'll give her steroids to help

233
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,457
- the baby's lungs mature.
- Her heart rate has raised

234
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,399
from 100 to 125
in the past hour.

235
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:34,535
She has a history of
dilated cardiomyopathy.

236
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:36,821
She cannot handle a
sustained tachycardia.

237
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,423
Believe it or not, she
can be a ton of fun.

238
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,587
You should see her when
she has a few drinks in her.

239
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:43,272
Mina, I'm sure Dr. Lin
is very well versed

240
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,879
in her patient's medical needs.

241
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:46,558
An excess of caution is
appropriate in this case.

242
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,916
So, normally, if your
contractions stopped,

243
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,280
we would watch you, we might
even consider sending you home.

244
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,098
But with your cardiac
history, I think the safest choice

245
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:54,933
is to get you comfortable
in labor and delivery,

246
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:56,668
and we will monitor
you and the baby.

247
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,893
And you'll be back to
check on her shortly.

248
00:12:58,929 --> 00:13:00,189
Thank you, Dr. Lin.

249
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,445
You're welcome.

250
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,897
I'm getting Dr. Austin.

251
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,151
A full cardiac exam should

252
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:09,854
put everyone's mind
at ease, especially...

253
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,248
All right, good news.

254
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:22,083
Tyler's brain CT is negative.

255
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,001
No bleeding and no signs

256
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,764
of cerebral edema...
What about the labs?

257
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:27,455
Not good news.

258
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,823
Let me guess.

259
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,258
Fulminant hepatic failure

260
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:32,493
from all the
acetaminophen he took?

261
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:35,179
He needs a liver
transplant or he'll die.

262
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,443
I wish I could say I
haven't seen this before,

263
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:39,617
but I've seen it too many times.

264
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,114
Acetaminophen overdose
is the leading cause

265
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:43,954
of liver failure in the U.S.

266
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,956
He's young, otherwise
in good health.

267
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,986
That should put him at
the top of the transplant list.

268
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,811
He could get an organ quickly.

269
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:52,780
If we tell the transplant board

270
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:55,233
that Tyler attempted suicide,

271
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,953
he will be ruled ineligible.

272
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:00,749
He won't be at the top
of the transplant list.

273
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,072
He won't be on the list at all.

274
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,343
That is a rule here at Chastain.

275
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:09,831
As long as we get
him counseling,

276
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:12,183
I say...

277
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:17,504
what suicide attempt?

278
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,574
Wait, did I hear that right?

279
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,912
Is that Dr. Pravesh
or is that an imposter?

280
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,666
Look, I'm the same man
that I've always been,

281
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,485
but I see more shades
of gray than I used to.

282
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,372
Sometimes, to do right,

283
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,741
you can't follow the rules.

284
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,838
I think the short answer

285
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:41,278
is, I'm not an intern anymore.

286
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,016
I'll transfer him to the ICU.

287
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,269
And I'll contact
the transplant team.

288
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:58,946
Well, you're definitely still
pregnant, but I'm guessing

289
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,366
you already knew that.

290
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,922
Shallow breaths, use
your abdomen like this.

291
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,355
What do you see?

292
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,857
Heart's beating a little fast.

293
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:12,760
But you're pumping for
two, so that's totally normal.

294
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:17,898
What is it?

295
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,735
All good.

296
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,598
Listen, I've got some
instructions for your ladies

297
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,906
in waiting on how to
best take care for you.

298
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,924
- So, they'll be right back.
- Okay.

299
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,733
One of her heart
valves is failing.

300
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,086
It's leaking severely.

301
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:40,387
Mitral regurg.

302
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,056
It's causing fluid to back up

303
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:43,557
into her lungs.

304
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:45,604
We have to, uh, get
her in surgery right away.

305
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:46,906
I'm gonna book
an OR and scrub in.

306
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,574
Whoa, wait, take
your foot off the gas.

307
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:50,097
The regurg isn't emergent.

308
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:51,749
The valve needs to be replaced.

309
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,245
With the continued stress
of pregnancy, she could

310
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,964
- decompensate rapidly.
- Or it could last

311
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,572
another week or another
month. There's no way to predict.

312
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:59,602
Do not play Russian
roulette with Adaku's life.

313
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,827
No delay, we need to get
her to surgery right now.

314
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,446
No... I'm gonna close
my eyes and pretend

315
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:08,098
the last 15 seconds of this
conversation never happened.

316
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,152
And when I open them,
history will be erased,

317
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,381
and I will know that you
still have unlimited faith

318
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,440
in my ability to deliver
the best care possible

319
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,875
to your friend.

320
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,539
We obviously
trust your judgment.

321
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,857
What I think Mina's
trying to say is,

322
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,464
we need to save Mom and baby.

323
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:24,943
No, that is not
what I want to say.

324
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:27,785
The mother is
priority number one.

325
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,447
There is no choice
to be made, Mina.

326
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,272
We save both baby and the mama.

327
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:32,823
Adaku is a high-risk pregnancy.

328
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,286
We need to get
our ducks in a row

329
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,455
- before surgery, Mina.
- Thank you, Nic.

330
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:38,963
Now, that means we have to
line up the best anesthesiologist,

331
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,614
the best neonatologist,

332
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,200
have an on-call perfusionist,
and put blood on hold.

333
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,836
It's gonna take a few
hours, and once everything is

334
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,972
in place, Dr. Lin
will deliver the baby

335
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,474
and we will repair the valve.

336
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,143
And there is every
reason to believe

337
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,307
it's going to be fine.

338
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,915
If her condition
changes, page me.

339
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:01,002
Look, if you are frightened,

340
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:03,637
you are gonna transfer
that anxiety onto Adaku.

341
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:07,058
The only thing we can do
now is show rock-solid support.

342
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,509
And to restate the obvious,
Mina, I'm here for you.

343
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:10,878
Okay?

344
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,514
So, your patient, Dawn Long,

345
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,431
you moved her to an LTACH?

346
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,767
Family didn't want to let
her go, so in deference

347
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,564
to their wishes, I
admitted her to a facility

348
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,915
where she can be
safe and comfortable.

349
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:39,040
Yeah, just wondering
about the timing.

350
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,058
Meaning?

351
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:46,914
Well, if you keep her
alive past the 90-day mark,

352
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,444
then her outcome won't
be tracked anymore

353
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,062
and you can claim
your patient survived

354
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:51,351
the Mother of All Surgeries.

355
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,237
As can the hospital.

356
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,034
Better outcomes
mean more patients

357
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:56,601
and better Medicare
reimbursements.

358
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,220
Yeah, agreed,
except neither of those

359
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,289
are appropriate reasons
for a medical decision.

360
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,613
So, tell me, what's
the harm in allowing

361
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,115
a family to live with hope
for just a little while longer?

362
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,534
In a facility owned
by Red Rock costing

363
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,069
thousands of dollars a day.

364
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:11,522
Exactly... you're
making my case for me.

365
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,298
Tyler's an excellent
candidate for a liver transplant.

366
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,593
The patient is
otherwise healthy,

367
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:23,667
no underlying
medical conditions?

368
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,337
None, and he's a teenager
with his whole life ahead of him.

369
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,066
According to your
notes, he presented

370
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,907
with an overdose of painkillers.

371
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,075
Yeah, acetaminophen.

372
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,576
He's a football player.

373
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,939
Tried to self-treat
his back pain.

374
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:36,097
Took too many.

375
00:18:36,132 --> 00:18:38,248
Ah, this was a...

376
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,752
a-a therapeutic misadventure.

377
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,499
You know, people don't
realize how easy it is

378
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,739
to take too much
over-the-counter pain medicine.

379
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,485
You talk to our ER
staff, they'll tell you.

380
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,504
- They see it all the time.
- You understand that

381
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,246
patients with suicidal
ideations are disqualified

382
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:54,292
from receiving
transplants at our hospital?

383
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:56,512
- Mm-hmm.
- We've had a few
recent bad outcomes.

384
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,969
And any more could put
our program in jeopardy.

385
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,205
Of course.

386
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,992
Was Tyler's overdose
a suicide attempt?

387
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:09,441
Absolutely not.

388
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:13,100
We'll get Tyler listed.

389
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:15,035
Notify UNOS.

390
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,337
With his numbers,
he's first priority.

391
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:18,939
Great.

392
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:20,841
Thank you.

393
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:30,901
Torturing yourself?

394
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,155
Facing our new reality.

395
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,823
The Barrett Cain
Center for Neurosurgery.

396
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,021
He's a pot of gold at the
end of Red Rock's rainbow.

397
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,294
I'm the chief of surgery,

398
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:41,912
and I still can't control him.

399
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,025
You remember Dawn Long?

400
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,982
The lovely woman with seven kids

401
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,811
who had the Mother
of All Surgeries?

402
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:49,653
He had her transferred
today to an LTACH for rehab.

403
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,150
You're joking.

404
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:53,168
He was gaming the
system to boost his own stats

405
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,642
at the expense of his patients.

406
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,672
That's what I'm here
to talk to you about.

407
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,556
You know how I've
been trying to play nice

408
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,208
with Cain in his
sandbox to find out

409
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,376
- what he's up to?
- Yes.

410
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,883
I've seen multiple surgeries

411
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,885
with residents in charge,

412
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,503
overtreatment, up-coding.

413
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,417
This morning he
operated on a patient

414
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,586
who shouldn't have had
surgery in the first place,

415
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,510
then condemned him to life
on a vent in a vegetative state

416
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,407
just so he wouldn't
have a death in his OR.

417
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,164
I'm not surprised.

418
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:18,499
We have to do something.

419
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,361
No,<i> we</i> don't have
to do anything.

420
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,347
<i>You</i> have to stay
out of the line of fire.

421
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:25,055
Chastain needs good doctors
like you now more than ever.

422
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,119
And your contract is
coming up for renewal.

423
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,376
If he thinks that
you're against him,

424
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,628
you're gone.

425
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,346
What about you?

426
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,598
My contract is virtually
unbreakable, so...

427
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,364
I guess what happens
next is up to me.

428
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,751
Chest feels heavy.

429
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,359
She became acutely short of
breath and her 02 sat dropped.

430
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:46,705
Harsh holosystolic murmur.

431
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,373
We need to take
another look at that valve.

432
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:50,614
Coming up.

433
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,971
A chord must have ruptured.

434
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,968
It's wide-open
mitral regurgitation.

435
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,558
That valve is blown.

436
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,737
What? What does that mean?

437
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,939
It's time to have this baby.

438
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,396
Page Dr. Lin!

439
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,226
- Mina, what's happening?
- We're gonna proceed

440
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,084
immediately with the C-section
with Dr. Lin, and then you're

441
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,914
gonna go into surgery
right after with Dr. Austin.

442
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,232
It's my heart? Listen to me.

443
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:14,899
Take the baby first. Save my,

444
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:17,224
- save my...
- Adaku?

445
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,558
Save my baby.

446
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:20,744
Adaku?

447
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,324
I still have a pulse,

448
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:23,993
but she's hypoxic...
We need to bag her.

449
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,744
- Acute pulmonary edema.
- Get a code team in here now!

450
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:27,262
She's in V tach!

451
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,248
V fib. We lost her pulse.
Starting compressions!

452
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:31,255
We got no time
to waste... Let's go.

453
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,606
Where's Dr. Lin?!

454
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,088
- OR Three is ready for us.
- Good.

455
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:37,873
We need to get this baby
out as soon as possible.

456
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,458
No, no. Adaku's
coding. We save her first,

457
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:41,110
- then think about the baby.
- Negative.

458
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,099
We do that, then the baby dies.

459
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,312
Adaku made her wishes clear.

460
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,186
She said save the baby first.

461
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,782
- Austin, I swear,
if you don't save Adaku...
- Mina! Listen to me.

462
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,951
We get her on bypass
as Lin delivers the baby.

463
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,308
Then we deal with the valve.

464
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,105
That's the only way
we save them both.

465
00:21:53,129 --> 00:21:55,496
Trust me.

466
00:21:58,835 --> 00:21:59,995
- How long do you need?
- About a minute.

467
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,186
Ten blade.

468
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,854
Adaku won't make it.

469
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,333
Yes, she will.

470
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,142
We just have to
buy her more time.

471
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:20,554
All right, baby's out.

472
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,242
Baby's not breathing.

473
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,498
Now I'll prep her for bypass.

474
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,739
You handle the cardiac massage.

475
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,358
Let's get some blood in here.

476
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,480
How we doing over there, Nic?

477
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:48,365
Baby's still not breathing.

478
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,494
Okay, let's bag her.

479
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,448
- Heart rate's still in the 50s.
- She's been hypoxic too long.

480
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,752
Okay, I'm starting compressions.

481
00:22:56,024 --> 00:22:57,719
Giving 0.5 milliliters

482
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,526
epinephrine.

483
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:15,871
Okay.

484
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,711
Thank God.

485
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:20,764
Welcome to the
world, little one.

486
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,883
Let's get her to
the NICU, please.

487
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:26,604
She's ready for bypass.

488
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,745
How we doing?

489
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,281
I'm starting to repair
the heart valve.

490
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,234
Mina.

491
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:41,919
Let's go to the NICU.

492
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,715
I can finish the
surgery, Mina. Go.

493
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:45,567
We saved the baby,
but Adaku still might die.

494
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,002
You should have
operated her hours ago.

495
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,386
- We shouldn't have waited.
- Mina,

496
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,922
that's not helping.
He made the right call.

497
00:23:49,946 --> 00:23:51,507
Adaku and the baby
are both still alive.

498
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,224
- That is the best possible...
- I'm staying.

499
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:55,749
- No more mistakes on my watch.
- There were no mistakes!

500
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,929
That baby is going to have
her mother, and I'm going

501
00:23:57,953 --> 00:23:59,920
to make sure of it.

502
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,494
- Looks good.
- What?

503
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:13,917
It's perfect.

504
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,914
Let's start weaning
her off bypass.

505
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:17,905
She's undergone

506
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,506
two major surgeries at once.

507
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:25,595
Her heart was already
weak to begin with.

508
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,081
It may never restart.

509
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:30,650
Even if it does restart,
she may never wake up.

510
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:31,969
Please clear.

511
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:41,461
Sinus rhythm.

512
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:46,217
Look at that.

513
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,453
That's a win for now.

514
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,439
I'm going to give you a
pass on how you behaved

515
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:53,986
because I know
how upset you are.

516
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,661
But I certainly won't forget.

517
00:24:58,681 --> 00:24:59,813
It's all you.

518
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,362
Conrad.

519
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:17,514
Dr. Moore, how we doing?

520
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,349
Your organ is perfect.

521
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,585
The timing is
practically a miracle.

522
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,394
Hey.

523
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,063
- We have a liver.
<i>- Incredible.</i>

524
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,333
Tyler is still down here.
They had no beds in the ICU.

525
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,036
All right, we'll send him
up to the OR now. Let's go.

526
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:58,589
Take good care of her.

527
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:12,485
How is she?

528
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,291
Uh... alive.

529
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,560
We fixed the valve.

530
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:24,998
Her heart's beating,
but beyond that?

531
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:30,420
I don't know if I'm gonna
be okay if she's not.

532
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:33,107
You want to see the baby?

533
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,321
♪ ♪

534
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:45,628
Hey. How's it going?

535
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,864
So far so good.

536
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,815
Three more hours
and you're official.

537
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:58,474
That first day you told
me, "Go be a doctor

538
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,577
or go be something else."

539
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,562
Yeah, I remember.

540
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,693
And you said this is
the best job in the world,

541
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,099
despite everything.

542
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:09,653
Because of everything.

543
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,557
That day I watched
a young girl die.

544
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:17,177
And today I watch good
doctors save a young man's life.

545
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:19,897
And right now all
I am thinking is...

546
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:26,786
what a privilege it
is to be a part of it.

547
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,222
Dr. Cain still in surgery?

548
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:06,259
Uh, I don't know.
He was in OR Two.

549
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,973
Where is Dr. Cain?

550
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,058
Uh, he left 15 minutes ago.

551
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,388
Who are you?

552
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:25,145
I'm his resident.

553
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,267
- Uh...
- What's going on?

554
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,237
- Page Dr. Cain.
- What is going on? Talk to<i> me.</i>

555
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,133
I lost control of the bypass,
can't stop the bleeding.

556
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:38,308
He's losing
perfusion to his brain.

557
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,821
Page any attending.
I need help now.

558
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,978
Hang on, I'm coming in!

559
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:45,176
- What's happening?
- I can't finish the patch. The artery's shredding.

560
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,195
Take a deep breath.
I'm not kidding.

561
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,236
Take a deep breath. Do what
I say and this will be all right.

562
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:51,989
There's blood everywhere.

563
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,818
I've only done
this in-in a sim lab.

564
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:55,820
First we need to
see the field. Suction.

565
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:58,261
Now I'm gonna help you get
proximal and distal control.

566
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,175
- All right.
- Grab the vessel clamps
and put them

567
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,809
- where my fingers are.
- All right.

568
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,311
- Do you see that?
- Yeah, right there.

569
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,769
Okay, good. Now what?

570
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,254
Um, reinforce the patch.

571
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:08,956
Uh-huh. Do it.

572
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,330
Bajwa here. Dr. Cain
left the hospital.

573
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:20,817
He did what?

574
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,735
It's gonna have to
wait. I got an urgent text.

575
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,126
Yeah, don't worry,
it's been handled.

576
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,563
- By whom?
- Yeah... by me and Dr. Bajwa,

577
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:33,796
who happened to be on deck.

578
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,076
I've been a surgeon a long time.

579
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,628
I've seen attendings
come in drunk,

580
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:38,663
I've seen 'em fall asleep
from sheer exhaustion.

581
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:39,831
I've seen incompetence
and heroics and everything

582
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:42,739
in between, but this
defies description.

583
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:47,310
Your patient nearly died, you
left him wide open on the table.

584
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:50,413
You want an attaboy
for saving one life?

585
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,649
I save dozens every day,
hundreds by the week.

586
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:55,347
- Get over it.
- Do you save them
or manage not to kill them?

587
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:58,638
Wheeling a patient with
a blown brain into the ICU

588
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:00,985
and hooking them up to a vent
is not a life-saving procedure.

589
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,671
- It's abusive.
- Oh.

590
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,311
Look who's talking.

591
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:06,157
One glass of ten-year-old
bourbon and your residents

592
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:10,016
cannot wait to share the
tales of the mighty HODAD.

593
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:11,384
Hands of Death and Destruction.

594
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:12,697
That is what they
call you, isn't it?

595
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:14,732
Patients dead after a
routine appendectomy,

596
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:16,723
catching fire in the OR?

597
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,992
Yeah, I've made
mistakes, but I was there.

598
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:22,011
With my staff in the
OR, not off joyriding

599
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,875
while my patients
were left incapacitated.

600
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:26,066
I have saved the lives
of kings and princesses

601
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,517
from every corner of this world.

602
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,019
They worship me.

603
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,704
They want to name
their children after me.

604
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,540
They will never forget who I am.

605
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,370
- But it seems that you have.
- No.

606
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,904
You're the one who's
forgotten who I am:

607
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,195
chief of surgery and your boss.

608
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,498
You will answer to the board.

609
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:51,741
Yeah? What do you think?

610
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:54,377
Wow. Nic let you out
of the house like that?

611
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,326
What are you doing?

612
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,044
I've gotten a free sandwich
here ever since I started.

613
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:02,903
- These guys love me.
- Is that right?

614
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:06,389
Let me guess, fried egg.

615
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,392
Yeah. How'd you know that?

616
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,471
They like you,

617
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,140
but they don't
like you that much.

618
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:15,214
Have you been buying
my lunch this whole time?

619
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,767
Yeah. Something my resident
did for me. It's a tradition.

620
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:20,437
You just pay it forward,
do the same for your intern.

621
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:23,306
It's a way to say thank you

622
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:26,292
for all the hard
work they put in.

623
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:29,662
Last one. Better enjoy it.

624
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,273
Listen.

625
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,860
I want you to know that...

626
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:46,646
I do know.

627
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:51,822
Hey, I want to
show you something.

628
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,344
- You mean...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

629
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,315
Wow.

630
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,217
- Congratulations.
- Aah!

631
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,686
I haven't... asked her yet.

632
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:11,482
I just have to find
the right moment.

633
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:13,167
- She needs to say yes.
- Oh, she will.

634
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,358
You guys are inevitable.

635
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,611
No, I know how I feel about Nic.

636
00:33:18,647 --> 00:33:21,498
That's never changed.
It never will change.

637
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:25,685
She's everything.

638
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,123
- Hi.
- Hi.

639
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:31,857
Oh, no, no.

640
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,660
Come on.

641
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:37,547
How's Mina?

642
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,365
Rumpled and grumpy.

643
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,969
She slept in a chair by
Adaku's side last night.

644
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:45,188
And Adaku?

645
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,141
Critical.

646
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:49,993
She's intubated and sedated.

647
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,344
It's gonna be a long road ahead.

648
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:53,158
She'll be in the
hospital for a while.

649
00:33:53,182 --> 00:33:55,098
The baby, on the other hand,

650
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,650
might be able to
go home in a week.

651
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:59,903
With Mina.

652
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:03,356
Wow, that's a scary thought.

653
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,743
Ho...

654
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:28,582
I'm sorry... for earlier.

655
00:34:28,617 --> 00:34:30,750
The things I said.

656
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,855
But I was not wrong.

657
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:37,434
If we had taken her
to surgery first thing...

658
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,409
Mina, stop.

659
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:46,299
Taking care of her was my job.

660
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:51,887
Look, I get it.

661
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,674
It's been a rough 24
hours for everybody.

662
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,746
And you have another
challenge ahead of you now.

663
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,369
She's just so small.

664
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:18,914
The surgery went perfectly.

665
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,284
We're hopeful
for a full recovery.

666
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,152
That's wonderful.

667
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,274
How you feeling?

668
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:32,478
I've been better,
but I can't complain.

669
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:35,248
Still here, right?

670
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:37,316
I know I have you
to thank for that.

671
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:40,520
Well, the person we
have to thank is the donor.

672
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,124
He gave you a
very precious gift.

673
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,477
Look, I promise I
learned my lesson.

674
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,481
I'm not gonna make
that mistake again, okay?

675
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:58,388
I'd like to be sure of that.

676
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,308
I want you to start by
being honest with your mom.

677
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,657
- I can't do that.
- No, no, no, no.

678
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:09,615
It's okay. It's important.
She needs to know.

679
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:14,554
And this is why... I want
you to get counseling.

680
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,351
You need to talk to
someone about why you tried

681
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,775
to take your own life to make
sure it doesn't happen again.

682
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,683
Are you sure the transplant
surgeon heard you?

683
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,392
Positive.

684
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:36,704
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

685
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,339
He walked away
without speaking to me.

686
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,529
Okay, this is bad.

687
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,064
Well, maybe, maybe not.

688
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,494
We don't know if
he'll tell anyone.

689
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:44,829
The surgery's done,
the outcome is good.

690
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:46,319
They can't turn back the clock.

691
00:36:46,355 --> 00:36:47,999
This shouldn't even be an issue.

692
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:49,851
There are no
guidelines from UNOS

693
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,241
telling transplant centers

694
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,504
whether to give organs to
someone who attempted suicide.

695
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:56,413
Transplant protocol varies
from hospital to hospital.

696
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,182
If Tyler had gone
to Atlanta General,

697
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,517
they would have approved
the transplant surgery

698
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,631
with virtually no
questions asked, but...

699
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:07,407
Chastain doesn't work that way.

700
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:10,426
So what do we do now?

701
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:14,280
Behave as if nothing happened.

702
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:33,633
Where's the board? I
requested a meeting.

703
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,251
Your request was denied.

704
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:36,702
Well, you can't do that.

705
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:38,071
It's in the hospital charter.

706
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:40,389
The chief of surgery
may request...

707
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,925
You've been stripped
of that title, Dr. Bell.

708
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,579
What'd you say?

709
00:37:46,615 --> 00:37:50,933
Dr. Cain is Chastain's
new chief of surgery.

710
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:55,287
All future requests
will go through him.

712

Randolph, I heard.

00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:16,525
Are you all right?

714
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,611
Tending to my first love.

715
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:20,491
Putting my affections
where they stand a chance

716
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,265
of being returned.

717
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,084
Will you leave Chastain?

718
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,720
I won't give 'em
the satisfaction.

719
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:33,509
And if they fire me, they will
owe me a substantial sum.

720
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:36,129
But they will fire me.

721
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:39,282
You know how the pressure
drops before a storm,

722
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,684
and you're not aware of
it in any conscious way,

723
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,354
but you know
something is changing?

724
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,200
I finalized your
paperwork last night.

725
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:50,310
You have a five-year
contract, ironclad.

726
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:54,397
I don't know what to say.

727
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:58,818
Just be what you
are, a great surgeon.

728
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,140
All right, everybody, can I
have your attention, please?

729
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:11,680
Let's welcome our
new chief resident,

730
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,366
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

731
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:19,422
Speech!

732
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,507
Oh, yeah.

733
00:39:21,543 --> 00:39:23,371
If Devon wants a speech,
he's gonna get a speech.

734
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,511
Keys to the palace.

735
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:27,397
Got your own office, a
call room with a shower.

736
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:29,110
- Ooh.
- She's all yours.

737
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:31,028
Thank you, thank you.
We'll see if you're all

738
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:32,563
still clapping for me when
I'm busting your asses

739
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:33,753
first thing in the morning.

740
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,991
- Did you meet your interns yet?
- No.

741
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:39,086
I don't know anything about 'em.

742
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,737
- Nice coat, Hawkins.
- Thank you.

743
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:42,840
Not that it matters much.
I was never chief resident.

744
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:45,782
Look at me now.

745
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:48,351
So, I hear

746
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,053
your office has a
brand-new 72-inch flat-screen

747
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,054
and an Xbox.

748
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,100
You got time for<i> Call of Duty?</i>

749
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,751
- Oh, yeah, let's make it happen.
- All right.

750
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:57,760
- Just the man I was looking for!
- Aah!

751
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,345
I can use the new shower, right?

752
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,015
Anytime, anytime.

753
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,183
Hey, how about me?

754
00:40:03,218 --> 00:40:04,883
Ah, not a chance.

755
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,080
What, the free fried
egg sandwiches

756
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:09,388
- weren't enough for you?
- Mm...

757
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,524
This is impressive.

758
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,480
I've never had my
name on a door.

759
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:17,579
Let me try.

760
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:21,284
Maybe they haven't
programmed it yet.

761
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,737
Dr. Hawkins.

762
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:26,872
Uh, I'll-I'll take
that. Thank you.

763
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:30,727
You lied to the, the
transplant board.

764
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,556
We don't give organs to
patients who are suicidal.

765
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:35,247
Wait, Tyler's not suicidal.
It was a stupid mistake.

766
00:40:37,085 --> 00:40:39,786
Am I talking to you?

767
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,724
You're fired.

768
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,429
Ah, that rule's arbitrary
and you know it.

769
00:40:49,464 --> 00:40:51,075
You don't care
about Tyler Warzel,

770
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:53,783
you care that I'm
a whistleblower.

771
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,419
That's what this is about.

772
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,138
Huh? I blew the whistle

773
00:40:59,173 --> 00:41:02,158
on a bad drug, and you're
afraid for your bottom line.

774
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,995
You're afraid of me.

775
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,632
And you should be.

776
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:14,787
Security will escort you out.

777
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:17,373
Give me your pager.

778
00:41:21,863 --> 00:41:23,963
Thank you.

779
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,830
- What's going on?
- They're firing Conrad.

780
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,628
- You can't do this.
- Whoa, whoa.

781
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:46,647
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

782
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,681
It's okay, it's okay.

783
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,305
Then I'll quit, too.

784
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,857
No, you'll stay here.

785
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,044
I'll see you tonight.
