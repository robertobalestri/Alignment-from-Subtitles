00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,854
Hit his head on
the deck. No LOC.

181
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,429
GCS 14 on scene for confusion.

182
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:03,598
I'm fine. Just
please save my wife.

183
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,295
Becky, do you
know where you are?

184
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,934
Hospital.

185
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,005
BP's 75/40, pulse in
the 140s, 02 sat 99%.

186
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,152
She's cold and clamped
down, going into shock.

187
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,611
No, she's<i> in</i> shock. Hang
two units of O neg now

188
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:19,147
and activate massive
transfusion protocol.

189
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,899
Dr. Feldman, can you
put in a central line?

190
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,672
Oh, there's blood in her pelvis.

191
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,085
The propeller could
be tamponading

192
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,308
a more catastrophic bleed.

193
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,560
Becky, can you
wiggle your left toes?

194
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,997
Great. How about your right?

195
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,085
I... I...

196
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,337
can't move my leg.

197
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,188
What's going on?

198
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,487
Ah, pupils are
equal and reactive.

199
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:50,028
This shouldn't need stitches.

200
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,263
How you feeling?

201
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,731
Ah, just-just a headache.

202
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,595
Maybe my eyes
are a little bit blurry.

203
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,419
Okay, possible concussion.
We'll run some tests.

204
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,072
Hey, I got another patient.

205
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,169
- I got to go. You good?
- Good.

206
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,893
- Sure?
- Mm.

207
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:06,171
- John?
- Mm.

208
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:07,723
- Squeeze my fingers.
- Ah.

209
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,397
Squeeze my fingers. Good. Good.

210
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,115
So you live here in Atlanta?

211
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,003
Yeah, we do, but we spend
most of our time on the road.

212
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,207
- Oh, yeah, why's that?
- Uh, well,

213
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:24,212
Becky and I started the Copple
Foundation about 15 years ago.

214
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:27,115
All right, push on the gas.
Push on the gas. That's good.

215
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,134
Yeah, we, uh, serve the causes

216
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,120
that we're most
passionate about.

217
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,255
Health care is one of them.

218
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,758
And that is why we
know this man so well.

219
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,293
John.

220
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,106
I'm so sorry to hear
about the accident.

221
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,780
Thank you, Logan.

222
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,149
I'm, uh...

223
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,718
Becky's hurt really bad.

224
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,481
I assure you
she-she's in the hands

225
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,405
of our absolute best.

226
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,973
As are you.

227
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,776
Thank you.

228
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:59,163
I'll be right back.

229
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,163
John and Becky Copple are among

230
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,719
the biggest donors to Red Rock.

231
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:07,989
Most notably, our
new neuro center.

232
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,575
You gave me a reason
to bring you back.

233
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,794
Let's make sure that I continue
to feel good about my decision.

234
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,196
Okay?

235
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,364
BP's up to 100/60. Pulse
has come down to the 90s.

236
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,938
This is our window to move her.

237
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:25,924
Hang another unit of blood

238
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,603
and let's bring the
cooler with us to CT.

239
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,688
And then to the OR to
remove the propeller.

240
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,178
Come on, people, let's move.

241
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,344
Wait, wait. Wh-Wh-Where-where
are they taking her?

242
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,152
Imaging. Just
part of the process.

243
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:46,544
It was my idea to go Jet Skiing.

244
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,431
Becky loves the outdoors.

245
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,799
I hate the sun.

246
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,168
It's one of the few things
we don't have in common.

247
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:58,055
But this boat came
out of nowhere.

248
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,191
And we crashed at full speed.

249
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:04,462
I just wish I had gotten
the worst of it and not her.

250
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,997
I can't lose her.

251
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,216
I just...

252
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,520
I-I don't even know what my
life looks like without Becky.

253
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,924
I understand.

254
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,371
But if we don't take care
of you, then you can't

255
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:22,163
take care of Becky, so how
about we focus on you for a minute?

256
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,131
Deal?

257
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,033
- Deal.
- All right.

258
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,065
I'm seeing on
your medical record

259
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,589
you had a brain tumor
removed eight years ago?

260
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,157
I did. Yes.

261
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,226
It was a benign growth.

262
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,178
- Hmm.
- Why?

263
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,914
Just want to get a CT to
make sure everything's okay.

264
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,550
- Sound good?
- Let's do it.

265
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:45,036
<i>So, thanks to ads,</i>

266
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,039
point of sale displays,
strategic partnerships...

267
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,359
Oh, Randy, there
you are. Have a seat.

268
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,895
The lovely Andrea just
came to the interesting part.

269
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,566
You gentlemen remember
our first quarter projections.

270
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:03,237
Well, this is our
actual revenue.

271
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:05,289
50,000 units sold
in the first month.

272
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,192
100 last week alone.

273
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,139
- Those are real numbers?
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,190
I mean, I knew we
were doing well, but...

275
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,942
We can barely keep
up with demand.

276
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,310
Well, then, I say we
increase production,

277
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,067
with a larger facility.

278
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,279
We could expand
to other regions.

279
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,314
- Mm-hmm.
- You know,

280
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,582
we should put some cash into R&D

281
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,090
and lay the foundation
for a whole new line.

282
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,586
You'll all be
parking your yachts

283
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,137
next to mine before
the year's out.

284
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,789
You know, maybe you
can quit teaching Pilates.

285
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,990
Or, hell, she could
buy the studio.

286
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,247
Hell, she could buy Pilates.

287
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,764
I don't think that's possible.

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,761
Uh, with the fortunes
we're gonna make, it is.

289
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,446
L-Listen, listen.

290
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,938
I-I-I have been here before.

291
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,490
All right? I mean, we are
playing with the big boys now.

292
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,753
And with profits this
promising, competitors will be

293
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:44,128
trying to buy us for a
nickel and a rubdown.

294
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,998
But I think we can all agree
that the real winning formula

295
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,968
is not just what's in this
little bottle. No, no, no.

296
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,898
No, it's-it's the
people in this room.

297
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:56,107
All y'all, the-the men and
brilliant lady right here,

298
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,509
united, working together.

299
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,941
We have struck gold, my
friends, and I don't know,

300
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:03,792
but anybody here want to
let 'em take away our gold?

301
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,434
I'd like to see 'em try it.

302
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,840
That is one enormous fracture.

303
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,454
The propeller sliced
through her sacroiliac joint.

304
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:17,173
Explains why she
can't move her leg.

305
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,807
Her pelvis has been completely
separated from her spine.

306
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,459
And it's torn
through her internal

307
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:22,016
iliac artery.

308
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,834
The damage is so extensive

309
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,764
- because this
propeller is cupped. So,

310
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:27,972
the plan is, we
remove the propeller,

311
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,035
stop the bleeding before
she exsanguinates.

312
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,610
Then, if we succeed,
reattaching her pelvis

313
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,380
to her spine will not
be a walk in the park.

314
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,300
I'll prep the OR.

315
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,982
What's the story?

316
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:45,039
TBI.

317
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:48,192
History of a benign brain tumor
that was successfully removed,

318
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,179
but it's regrown.

319
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,159
Well, hopefully
it's still benign.

320
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:55,833
I'll send it to pathology
when I take it out.

321
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,153
I'm gonna need to review his
prior scans and path reports.

322
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:02,039
- Mm-hmm.
- There's also
an associated hemorrhage.

323
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,243
- Is he symptomatic?
- Headache, blurry vision.

324
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,730
And it's only gonna get
worse the longer we wait.

325
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,726
We're gonna have to operate
soon. Any there any issues

326
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,262
- that might complicate
his surgery?
- Eh, mild hyponatremia.

327
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,753
That's likely related
to dehydration.

328
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,172
Otherwise, labs
were unremarkable.

329
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,075
All right. I'll take
him to my OR.

330
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,802
Sir, you need to
stay in your bed.

331
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:30,268
And keep your pants on.

332
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,869
L-Look.

333
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,073
Fasciculations?

334
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,839
- When did it start?
- A few minutes ago.

335
00:14:39,863 --> 00:14:42,880
- Let's get another
full set of labs.
- Right.

336
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,511
We'll check for any
electrolyte abnormalities.

337
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:48,002
Should I, uh, cancel
Waffle Wednesday?

338
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:50,121
Maybe just reschedule
till next week.

339
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,466
- A - little help over here!

340
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,041
Respiratory distress, Bay Eight.

341
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,934
- Pravesh.
- Stay there.

342
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:58,045
Get me an intubation kit.

343
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,083
She started to wheeze and
couldn't clear her secretions.

344
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,896
We tried BiPap and
she became altered

345
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,898
and we couldn't get
her sats over 72%.

346
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:21,803
Mild crackles bilaterally.
Increase the PEEP.

347
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,990
PEEP is up to 15.

348
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,608
Okay, that bought us some room.

349
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:28,988
But she's still
skimming the treetops.

350
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,173
All right, let's get a blood
gas and a chest X-ray.

351
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,165
And write her for broad-spectrum
antibiotics with cultures first.

352
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,800
Once we get the gas, we'll
put her on ARDSNet protocol.

353
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,953
If her oxygenation
is still tenuous,

354
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:40,738
we'll start inhaled epo.

355
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,467
Good plan. But this is strange.

356
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:43,969
I mean, she came in with
a headache, for God's sake.

357
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:45,988
And now she's very
close to max vent settings.

358
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,979
We need to figure
this out. And fast.

359
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,671
Can I talk to my wife?

360
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,602
We need to get you
both in ORs ASAP.

361
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,808
No, no, please. I just...

362
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:02,087
- I need a sec.
- We have to be quick, though.

363
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,195
Hold up, hold up.

364
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:09,200
I know what you're gonna
say. We're in good hands.

365
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,668
We're both gonna be fine.

366
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,152
You love me.

367
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,105
I was gonna lead
with "I love you."

368
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,209
But, yes, all of that.

369
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,193
Then I'll see you tonight.

370
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,530
Make sure we're in a
recovery room together.

371
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,605
In our 20 years of marriage,

372
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,858
we've never spent a night apart.

373
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,305
We wouldn't want to
break a streak like that.

374
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,990
Well, you've got two softies

375
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,491
who'll do our best
to make it happen,

376
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,282
but right now we got to go.

377
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:42,561
I love you.

378
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,236
- I love you.
- I love you.

379
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,499
Hey.

380
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:01,096
<i>How you feeling?</i>

381
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,555
Better. Thank you.

382
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,557
It's so quiet. Where are you?

383
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,727
Our supply closet.

384
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,845
Oh, it's<i> our</i> supply closet now?

385
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:14,215
Well, we-we share it
with Jess and Irving,

386
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,750
but it's mostly ours.

387
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,755
You okay?

388
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,774
Nic,

389
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,760
I just...

390
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,063
I just want to say
thank you for...

391
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,751
for being there

392
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:37,254
<i>and for, for never doubting
that I would be okay</i>

393
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,491
<i>and for helping me.</i>

394
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,578
Helping me find
my way back here.

395
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:47,114
You don't need to thank me.

396
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,099
Yes.

397
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,135
I do.

398
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,122
<i>Hey.</i>

399
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,124
<i>You'd do the same for me.</i>

400
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,223
But you need to
get back to work.

401
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,808
People are gonna
think you lost your mind,

402
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,794
talking to yourself
alone in a supply closet

403
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,049
on your first day back.

404
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,621
That's fair. That's fair.

405
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,090
<i>I'll get home as soon as I ca.</i>

406
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,309
I know you will.

407
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,461
I'll see you tonight.

408
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,617
Again?

409
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:27,088
Unfortunately, Raj's bathroom
situation has escalated.

410
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:29,151
But all of his stool studies
have come back negative.

411
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,624
Mr. Corson's pants

412
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,060
are back on, but he's
still having fasciculations,

413
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:35,016
and he's started
to act confused.

414
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,334
What?

415
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,289
Pravesh. What's up?

416
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:52,029
MUDDLES.

417
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,531
I haven't heard that term
since I was in medical school.

418
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,317
Meiosis, urination...

419
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:57,968
Diarrhea, diaphoresis...

420
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,370
Lacrimation, excitation of
the central nervous system,

421
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,122
salivation.

422
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:03,874
Yeah, so, if you add

423
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,320
Doug, Cynthia and
Raj's symptoms together,

424
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,661
it is textbook
organophosphate poisoning.

425
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:09,725
How do three patients who
have nothing in common

426
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,494
get exposed to a
toxin that's only found

427
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,496
- in pesticides
and chemical weapons?
- I don't know.

428
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,720
But they're all showing
different signs of exposure.

429
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:20,441
If it is, we need
to treat them fast.

430
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:22,809
Organophosphate poisoning
can progress rapidly.

431
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,179
Hundley, push atropine
and one gram of 2-PAM

432
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:27,054
- for all three of them.
- On it.

433
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:33,020
Dr. Okafor,

434
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:34,232
why don't you give
that propeller blade

435
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,890
a nice, big tug.

436
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,644
It's not budging.

437
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,056
It's stuck in the SI joint.

438
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,000
You have to pull
with more force.

439
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,335
Put your back into it, dear.

440
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,688
Okay, it's not working.

441
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:52,901
Step aside.

442
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,227
I've got Excalibur.

443
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,104
Damn.

444
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,106
- It won't come out.
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,874
Allow me.

446
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,329
Ortho isn't just
about brute strength.

447
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:17,531
Sometimes you have to
think outside of the box.

448
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:18,583
Hammer, please?

449
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,936
And<i> then</i> use brute strength.

450
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,455
Get ready.

451
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,288
Suction.

452
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,232
- Retractors.
- Sutures.

453
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,184
What are the odds

454
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,687
a benign brain tumor regrows?

455
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:42,039
Well, it's rare,
but it can happen.

456
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,392
Don't worry. I'm
here to deal with that.

457
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,037
We're gonna proceed
with the craniotomy

458
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:47,923
- to remove the tumor.
- Copy that.

459
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,930
I'll get scrubbed up.

460
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,751
Thank you, Dr. Cain.

461
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,426
You're welcome.

462
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:04,778
John, I'm gonna
administer the propofol now.

463
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:08,115
Start counting
backwards for me from ten.

464
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,093
Just breathe.

465
00:21:21,831 --> 00:21:23,146
<i>What'd you give him?</i>

466
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,077
Just relax. Just breathe.

467
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:26,984
<i>What did you give him?</i>

468
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,080
I haven't given
him anything yet.

469
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:29,364
You must have done something.

470
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,599
He's tach'ing away in the 150s.

471
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,356
His BP shot up to 180s.

472
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,086
- It hurts!
- What?

473
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,138
- Where do you... Where does
it hurt? Tell me what hurts.
- It hurts!

474
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,173
- What's-what's hurt? What hurts?
- My stomach!

475
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,426
Your stomach?

476
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,999
Abort the surgery!

477
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,786
Dr. Austin, you're
on the left pelvis.

478
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,438
Dr. Okafor, you're on the right.

479
00:21:52,462 --> 00:21:56,497
Fasten this obtrusive
instrument on each side.

480
00:21:56,532 --> 00:22:00,017
Now for the most
critical part of the surgery.

481
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,020
We must bring her pelvis
and spine back into alignment.

482
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:05,567
- We're gonna
reduce her SI joint?
- Correct.

483
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:09,026
You will both push your side of
the pelvis towards one another.

484
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:10,878
How hard do we push?

485
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,396
It must be equal pressure.

486
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,042
And what if one pushes
harder than the other?

487
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,883
Then her pelvis will be
misaligned from her spine.

488
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,570
We could crush her sacral
nerves and leave her paralyzed.

489
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:23,157
You must be perfectly in sync.

490
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:24,858
I know I can count on you both.

491
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,004
We got this.

492
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,548
On three?

493
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,500
One, two, three.

494
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:35,033
Slowly.

495
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:39,540
A little more pressure
from you both.

496
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,028
Feeling some resistance.

497
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,704
I'll adjust.

498
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,902
Stop.

499
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,008
How did we do?

500
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,244
That's anatomic.

501
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,064
I've never seen a
more perfect alignment.

502
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,366
Game, set...

503
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:07,951
Match.

504
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,459
My patient is stagnating in
the ICU after an aborted surgery

505
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,110
because something you missed.

506
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,763
We don't know that yet.

507
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,032
Then what do you know?

508
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,863
- You're the internist
here, right?
- Mm-hmm.

509
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,905
In the great ecosystem
of this hospital, a flea.

510
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,441
You had one job:

511
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:33,710
to make sure my patient
was tuned up for surgery.

512
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,986
So let me give you some advice

513
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,281
upon your fresh
return to this hospital.

514
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,233
Go do your one job

515
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:41,152
so my patient doesn't die.

516
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:47,575
What the hell happened in there?

517
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,093
I'm replaying it in my head.

518
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,379
This, uh, acute
abdominal pain with nausea

519
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:54,965
and hemodynamic
instability in the OR

520
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,150
but with absolutely no prodrome.

521
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,181
Could he have thrown
a clot to his bowel?

522
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,149
I thought about that,
but nothing on imaging.

523
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,006
And his lactate is flat.

524
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:03,923
So what's your plan?

525
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,844
Uh, reexamine head to toe.

526
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,456
Rerun labs. Get to
the bottom of this.

527
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,527
Listen, let me know
how I can help you.

528
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,584
They-they took your head.

529
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,031
You figured out how
to grow another one.

530
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,582
But don't think for a
second they're not looking

531
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:18,984
for any reason to
bring the ax down again.

532
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:19,990
Who's "they"?

533
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,975
Kim did the firing,

534
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,593
but he and Cain are a team.

535
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,373
There's no way Cain
didn't have a hand in it.

536
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,659
And Cain doesn't care that
you brought in Georgia FC.

537
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:30,167
For him, getting rid
of you is personal.

538
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,452
Be careful.

539
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:40,627
Buy you coffee?

540
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,596
No.

541
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:44,615
Please?

542
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,815
Thank you.

543
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:46,983
Fine.

544
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,319
Uh, one almond
milk latte and one...

545
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:52,156
- Large coffee.
- Thanks.

546
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,653
What do you want
to know about him?

547
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:58,329
AJ seems amazing,

548
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:00,397
but I have been conned before.

549
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,617
So, woman-to-woman,
off the record,

550
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:06,720
jump in or run like hell?

551
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:17,525
All three patients
have stabilized.

552
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,965
Cynthia just got extubated.

553
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,695
- So you were right.
- Yeah.

554
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,171
But how do three
people with no connection

555
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:27,308
end up with the same
rare poison in their system?

556
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:29,237
First, we find out. Then
we call County Public Health

557
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,044
and stop whatever caused this.

558
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,065
So, you live nearby in...?

559
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,034
- Savannah.
- Chamblee.

560
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,836
Sandy Springs.

561
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,115
Any recent exposure
to chemicals?

562
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,089
- No.
- No.

563
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,475
I bought a can of body spray.

564
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:48,445
Has anyone sprayed insecticides

565
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,746
near your home or your garden?

566
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,164
I don't have a garden.

567
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,515
Not that I'm aware of.

568
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,945
No.

569
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,086
Any vitamins or supplements?

570
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,755
Yeah.

571
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,408
Yeah, I just picked
up a new one.

572
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:02,559
Um...

573
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,395
3, uh... 3B something.

574
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,512
3B Life.

575
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,013
That's it.

576
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:08,777
Hey, fingers crossed, I look
just as good as that doctor

577
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,241
on the label when
I'm his age, right?

578
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,371
Three different patients...

579
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,035
All with organophosphate
poisoning.

580
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:18,091
All on 3B Life.

581
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:20,577
Well, maybe they use
the same cleaning supplies

582
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,612
or pesticides.

583
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,697
We did extensive
patient histories.

584
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:25,494
You can't possibly
know everything

585
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:26,778
that they came
in contact with...

586
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:28,718
Yes, but, right now,

587
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,332
the only link that we do
have is your supplement.

588
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,806
- How widely was it distributed?
- Wide.

589
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:35,119
Okay. We need to call Public
Health and warn them about it.

590
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:36,060
That's ridiculously premature.

591
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,079
You can't call the
CDC on three patients.

592
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:41,326
Dr. Bell, I know that you
have a personal stake in this,

593
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,316
- but we have to...
- Okay.

594
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,720
Maybe, maybe they have
other things in common.

595
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:49,122
And if we act too quickly,
we'll destroy the reputation

596
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,941
of a good product
that is helping people,

597
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:52,926
not to mention me.

598
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:54,356
Yeah, but if we wait,
people could die.

599
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,974
So, beyond an acute
cholinergic crisis,

600
00:26:55,998 --> 00:26:57,976
people could have serious
long-term disabilities...

601
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,667
I don't need to be educated on
the effects of organophosphates.

602
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,820
Okay, Dr. Bell, we just
need to do the right thing.

603
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,616
I can only see you
when I turn to look at you.

604
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,930
When you stand to the right
of me, I can't see you at all.

605
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:20,487
Must be because of the tumor.

606
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:22,705
The bleeding is
causing some swelling,

607
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,925
and that is what's
affecting your vision.

608
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,293
Well, will it get better?

609
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:27,461
I-I can't go blind.

610
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:28,689
We're giving you some steroids.

611
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,125
We're gonna
decrease the swelling.

612
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,766
Now, if we can get
that tumor out soon,

613
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:34,012
- then you should regain
your vision.
- "If"?

614
00:27:34,036 --> 00:27:36,019
- Let's get it out now.
- Yes, I know.

615
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:38,455
I am of the same mind.

616
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,034
But your labile blood
pressure and heart rate

617
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,836
haven't been responding
to the treatments.

618
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,045
And I can't risk sending
you back into surgery

619
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,282
unless Dr. Hawkins
can come up with a plan

620
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:51,835
to make sure that
you're safe in the OR.

621
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,698
- What's the plan?
- Yes, Dr. Hawkins.

622
00:27:53,722 --> 00:27:56,106
What is the plan?

623
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:03,497
John, I know you've been
scanned and examined up and down,

624
00:28:03,532 --> 00:28:07,917
but do you mind if I
take one more look?

625
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,651
Did that start to hurt
after the accident?

626
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:26,936
No, actually.

627
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:30,440
That pain has been
on and off for a while.

628
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,709
Sometimes it hurts
so bad, I feel like

629
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,921
it's gonna rip right through me.

630
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,113
Like today in the OR.

631
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,381
And then...

632
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,566
all of a sudden, it gets better.

633
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,585
Now...

634
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,788
I'm gonna untie your gown

635
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,375
so I can get a good listen...

636
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,127
to your lungs.

637
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,267
What?

638
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:58,930
What's wrong?

639
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:01,922
There are blisters
on your shoulder.

640
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,123
I did not see that earlier.

641
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,953
Why the hell didn't
you see that earlier?

642
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:07,072
That's your job. Didn't you
do a full physical examination?

643
00:29:07,096 --> 00:29:09,429
They-they weren't
there this morning.

644
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:11,731
I'm sure. I would know.
I've had them in the past.

645
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:14,151
That's why I hate the sun.

646
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:17,237
And when we were outside, I
was covered from head to toe.

647
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,323
Hyponatremia.

648
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,042
Recurrent abdominal pain.

649
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:23,326
Blistering skin lesions.

650
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,145
Blistering.

651
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,380
Blistering, blistering,
blistering skin lesions.

652
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:37,090
I need a urine sample.

653
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:39,994
Right now.

654
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,149
<i>There's got to be a mistake.</i>

655
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,134
I don't know.

656
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:48,435
It doesn't make sense.

657
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,164
We ship out hundreds
of thousands of units

658
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,249
and only three people get sick?

659
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:53,157
Well, it's not just three.

660
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:55,959
No, I just found out
that two more patients

661
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,006
have been diagnosed with
organophosphate poisoning

662
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,857
- over at Atlanta General.
- Oh, my God.

663
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,992
They're stable. They're
getting treatment,

664
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:02,593
just like the ones
here at Chastain.

665
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:03,783
Are they on 3B?

666
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:04,785
They're on supplements.

667
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,970
But if I ask for specifics,

668
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,607
the doctors there will make
the same connection that we did.

669
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,008
Then we test the facility,

670
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,871
- we prove it's not us.
- Agreed, but...

671
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:18,998
Zip is gonna start talking
about an exit strategy.

672
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:21,351
- Wait, what? It's too soon.
- No, Andrea,

673
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,955
there's a chance, no
matter what the percentage,

674
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,408
that 3B is the culprit and
that we're dead in the water.

675
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:32,829
I can't believe
this is happening.

676
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,514
I-I...

677
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:37,016
I have to call the partners.

678
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:46,176
Your post-op CBC is stable.

679
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,411
No more bleeding.

680
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,556
Distal pulses are strong.

681
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,014
Becky, can you wiggle your toes?

682
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,067
Looks good.

683
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:56,481
Recovering from major
surgery is challenging,

684
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:58,366
so we will be
monitoring you closely.

685
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,340
Thank you.

686
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,308
And what about John?

687
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:05,145
He didn't have surgery yet.

688
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,229
Why?

689
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,814
We don't know.

690
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:10,234
But we do know his
doctors are working on it.

691
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,901
What does that mean?

692
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,070
Will he be okay?

693
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,023
Can I be with him?

694
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:18,191
First, you must get well.

695
00:31:18,227 --> 00:31:21,277
Then you can be strong for him.

696
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,331
When he had brain
surgery eight years ago,

697
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:27,345
I held his hand all night.

698
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:31,337
Like I could keep him with
me, just by physically holding on.

699
00:31:31,372 --> 00:31:32,456
And it worked.

700
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,540
Well, as soon as we can,

701
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:36,576
we'll get you two
back together again.

702
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,016
And now we have
urine in the sun.

703
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:45,385
Dr. Hawkins, I'm starting
to lose my patience.

704
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,070
Just wait.

705
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,255
I am not gonna stand here

706
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,602
and stare at another man's
urine with you while John's tumor

707
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:53,410
continues to swell.

708
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:55,679
We don't have time for this.

709
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,518
It was time well spent.

710
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,291
What-What's happening?

711
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,760
John, this urine changed color.

712
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,222
That explains what
happened in the OR

713
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:14,163
and gives us a
diagnosis: porphyria.

714
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,160
Porphyria's when you have an
excess of the chemical porphyrin

715
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,000
and it builds up in your organs,

716
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,604
and when that happens,
certain stressors, like...

717
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,834
the intense lighting in
the OR, triggers a crisis

718
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:27,460
that causes things like
blisters, stomach pain,

719
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:28,929
and even organ damage.

720
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:31,081
You got all that from my pee?

721
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,079
Combined with your exam

722
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:36,502
and history of previous
stomach pain and skin blisters.

723
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,137
But yes,

724
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,274
when the porphyrins turned
your urine dark in the sun,

725
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,276
my clinical suspicion
was confirmed.

726
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,529
So I've had this my whole life?

727
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,614
Incredibly rare, easily missed,

728
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,167
but the good news is...

729
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,370
we can treat you.

730
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,041
We'll be sending
confirmatory labs of course,

731
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,961
but I am confident you
will be back in the OR soon.

732
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,497
Which Dr. Cain and I
will be prepping for you.

733
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:06,933
<i>I made a list</i>

734
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:09,063
of all the meds that can be
fatal to a porphyria patient.

735
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,949
Avoid these at all costs.

736
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,951
I haven't had a porphyria
patient since residency.

737
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:15,659
Yep, this is a unique
case. That's exactly why

738
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,288
I made a list for everyone.

739
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,479
Propofol for
anesthesia, that's safe.

740
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:21,409
Morphine's okay. Just let
me know before you give

741
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,060
- any antibiotics.
- Dr. Hawkins is right.

742
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,134
We all need to
review the drug list.

743
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,698
And the reason John
crashed in the OR before

744
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:29,917
was because of these intense
lights, so we got these filters.

745
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,403
We'll still be able to see, but
they change the wavelength

746
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,189
of the light that
hits John's body.

747
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,173
Avoiding a porphyric crisis.

748
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:47,507
What the hell happened?

749
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:48,819
She came out fine
after the surgery,

750
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:50,938
then she went into V
tach and lost her pressure.

751
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,980
Hold compressions.
Checking a rhythm.

752
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,433
Damn, she's still in V fib.
We need to shock again.

753
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,851
Charging to 200.

754
00:33:57,886 --> 00:33:58,886
Clear.

755
00:33:58,921 --> 00:34:00,665
Restart compressions.

756
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:02,272
I'll take over.

757
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,273
Code labs are back.

758
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,442
Hemoglobin is stable.

759
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:06,537
She's not losing blood.

760
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:07,994
But her calcium is under five.

761
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,373
That's not doing
her heart any favors.

762
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:11,081
Okay, we need more calcium.

763
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,744
One gram of
calcium chloride, now.

764
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:14,729
We ordered it hours ago. There's
a calcium chloride shortage.

765
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,586
Take it from the crash cart.

766
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,966
She should have
received more calcium

767
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,372
with her blood transfusions.

768
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:21,069
This is what happens
when drug companies

769
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:25,078
discontinue products that
save lives but don't make money.

770
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:27,130
Calcium chloride is in.

771
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,208
Continue compressions.

772
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,111
30 seconds to the
next pulse check.

773
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,751
Hope this works.

774
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,532
Bull's-eye.

775
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:39,225

hemodynamic instability
