1
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:04,297
<i>- Previously on</i> The Resident...
- This is my son-in-law Derek.

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:05,965
He's been complaining
of shortness of breath.

3
00:00:05,989 --> 00:00:07,550
- Mom.
- And my daughter Molly.

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:10,359
Derek has an aggressive
B-cell lymphoma.

5
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:12,860
You have a 50%
chance at being cured.

6
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,324
<i>This is Dawn Long,
the one from TV.</i>

7
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,327
She's not getting better,
but Cain wants her treated

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,312
and sent back to the LTACH.

9
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:21,503
Your patient had<i> Candida auris.</i>

10
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,182
- The superbug?
<i>- Once</i> Candida auris

11
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:24,589
<i>spreads throughout a building,</i>

12
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,665
<i>it's nearly impossible
to eradicate.</i>

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,850
Anyone know what this is about?

14
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,448
- Logan Kim is gonna give
an announcement.
- These Red Rock speeches

15
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,850
are starting to drive
me up the wall, man.

16
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,940
Why can't we just go
back to paper memos?

17
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:45,510
Ah, okay.

18
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,596
As you know, ICU nurses

19
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,683
must chart patient
data constantly.

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,037
This practice is
inefficient, tedious

21
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:57,539
and expensive for the hospital.

22
00:00:57,574 --> 00:00:59,524
Today is a new day.

23
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,079
As a trial run, these
rooms are being retrofitted

24
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:07,048
with state-of-the-art
automated patient monitoring.

25
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,102
The system is so sophisticated

26
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,587
that it could even tell
if doctors and nurses

27
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:15,240
don't wash their hands before
entering the patient room.

28
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:18,560
Chastain is taking its place

29
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:21,813
on the technological
map in health care.

30
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,053
- Staff loves that guy.
- Just wish I could hug him.

31
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,072
Good times.

32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,476
Through and
through. Inside there,

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,317
and the ceiling all
around. In there.

34
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:59,017
As far as anyone's concerned,

35
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:01,486
we're just installing
A.I. technology.

36
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,105
No one knows we're also
eliminating a deadly fungus.

37
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:07,309
<i>Candida auris</i> is
highly dangerous

38
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,577
in immune-compromised patients.

39
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,174
Half the people who get it die.

40
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,831
We're lucky it's not airborne

41
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,300
like the coronavirus.
The staff is not at risk,

42
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,501
but the patients could be.

43
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,170
The protocol here

44
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,350
is gonna be to notify the
state health authorities.

45
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,018
- We need to follow protocol.
- You didn't mind

46
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,843
bending protocol to keep
a vegetable on life support

47
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,439
just to protect your stats.

48
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:28,646
I kept Dawn Long
alive for Red Rock.

49
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,793
It's because of me, you can
have the Mother of All Surgeries

50
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,779
- in the win column.
- No, you weren't
helping Red Rock,

51
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:34,769
you were feeding
your god complex.

52
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:36,037
As a result, she brought

53
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,500
a deadly fungus
into this hospital.

54
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,986
And there was no way for me to
know that she had the superbug.

55
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,811
It's common in nursing
homes and LTACHs.

56
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,790
Even I know that.
But you missed it.

57
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:47,665
You approved or demanded
every step I took in this.

58
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,668
According to you.

59
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,486
I've got your back,

60
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:55,290
as long as you've got mine,
and not a moment longer.

61
00:02:55,326 --> 00:02:58,577
- Are you threatening me?
- Get on board

62
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,647
and help to fix this
mess or I'll tell the world

63
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,882
what happened when
you were an intern.

64
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,174
♪ ♪

65
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,574
You need to be honest with me.

66
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,758
I haven't had any.

67
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,411
- I promise.
- Look,

68
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,257
we can only treat your
cardiovascular disease

69
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,881
without surgery if
you quit smoking.

70
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,269
I haven't had a smoke
since you last saw me.

71
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,099
Oh, so what were the
cigarettes you had this morning?

72
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,101
Reformed addicts are the worst.

73
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,792
Yeah, I'm just
looking out for you.

74
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,868
Look, there's a
sign-up table over there

75
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,863
for a program
that helps you quit.

76
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,048
Will you just walk over?

77
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,969
Maybe.

78
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:01,272
Uh, thanks for trying, Nic.

79
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,393
Are you feeling okay?

80
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,428
I'm good.

81
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,813
Well, let me just...

82
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,380
Your heart's racing,
you're coughing.

83
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:16,204
Any muscle weakness, headaches?

84
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,234
Yes, to all of the above.
But before you say it...

85
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,126
I think we should
get you to Chastain.

86
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,579
I'm not gonna go. You know
what my insurance deductible is.

87
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:26,442
Come on, people like
me only go to the hospital

88
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,250
- as a last resort.
- Right,

89
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,096
but I think this is one
of those moments.

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,814
Come on, let's
get you to a doctor.

91
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,198
Look at the all the people
who need you to stay healthy.

92
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,441
Come on.

93
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,416
You rang?

94
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,785
We've got a case.

95
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,121
45-year-old female
suffering from fever,

96
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,189
joint pain, chills and diarrhea.

97
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,785
Well, that's all
painfully nonspecific.

98
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:54,442
She could have anything.

99
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,622
Yeah, which makes this
the perfect medical mystery

100
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,613
and teaching tool for you.

101
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:03,317
You mean it's full of grunt
work you don't want to do.

102
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:05,954
See? You're learning already.

103
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:08,173
Sophia, these are Drs.
Pravesh and Dreyfuss.

104
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,019
They're gonna help
me with your care today.

105
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,377
Great, 'cause I could
use all the help I can get.

106
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,879
Sophia, it's nice to meet
you. I've seen you around.

107
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,848
- You're an EMT, right?
- Guilty.

108
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,279
I had to take the day off,
though, 'cause I got this bug.

109
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:20,936
Good thing you did.

110
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:23,939
Your ketone and glucose
levels are sky-high.

111
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:25,973
You're in diabetic ketoacidosis.

112
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,360
How does an EMT not
understand how dangerous it is

113
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,279
to let her sugars
get out of whack?

114
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:32,659
You'll have to
forgive Dr. Dreyfuss.

115
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,699
He has an issue of his own.

116
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,296
His mouth moves before
his brain catches up.

117
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,797
It's all right.

118
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,470
I deserve the judgment.

119
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,135
I should be monitoring my
blood sugar more closely.

120
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,503
Uh, your diabetes diagnosis

121
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:44,976
is recent.

122
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,011
Lifestyle adjustments,
they take time.

123
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,130
See what he did there?

124
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,510
So,

125
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:52,534
- what's the plan?
- An X-ray

126
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,536
and empiric antibiotics.

127
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,382
I'll go check on your blood
and urine cultures, okay?

128
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:59,340
- Thanks, Dr. Hawkins.
- You got it.

129
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:02,644
Now, Dr. Dreyfuss,
what do you recommend

130
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,495
for her diabetic ketoacidosis?

131
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,682
An insulin drip until
her anion gap closes.

132
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:11,153
Along with aggressive hydration
and dextrose to keep her glucose

133
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:13,004
from dropping too precipitously.

134
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,290
And the kid redeems himself.

135
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:38,046
I love unicorns.

136
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:46,438
Excuse me.

137
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,123
Has this vent been
used in the last 24 hours?

138
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,293
No, it's been down here for
the decontamination process.

139
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,895
Okay, good. Clean it now.

140
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,146
Like, right now.

141
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,383
- Okay.
- Hey.

142
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,402
I need to talk to you.

143
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,295
Lunch. Half hour.

144
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,308
<i>What were you doing in there?</i>

145
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,293
<i>I'm making sure they
cleaned Dawn Long's vent.</i>

146
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,784
Don't want one more
person getting the superbug.

147
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,436
It might be too late for that.

148
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,433
I had one of our I.T.
guys ping any patients

149
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:22,774
who might have had
contact with Dawn Long.

150
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,645
They got a hit with this
new admit Sophia Masters.

151
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,576
She's one of the EMTs
who brought Dawn here,

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,944
and she has fever,
joint pain and diarrhea.

153
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:32,745
That could mean
a number of things.

154
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,280
Health care
providers aren't at risk

155
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:36,464
unless they have a
compromised immune system.

156
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,261
According to her
charts, she also has

157
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,281
poorly managed diabetes,
which would check that box.

158
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:47,649
Who's her doctor?

159
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,784
Conrad Hawkins.

160
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:53,455
The whistleblower you
let back into our house?

161
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,957
He finds out, he will
definitely trace it back to Dawn.

162
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,809
You have to handle this.

163
00:07:57,845 --> 00:08:01,162
If it gets out now that we have
a deadly fungus at Chastain,

164
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:03,514
this hospital goes bankrupt.

165
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,384
Which is why I'll handle it.

166
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,758
- It's on me.
- Oh, wow.

167
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,194
Thanks, Dr. Cain, but
you don't have to do that.

168
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,580
Always here to help a
struggling young intern.

169
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,432
Well, um, thanks again.

170
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,717
You've done so much
for me, and my mom.

171
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,936
Well, no more
than she did for me.

172
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,888
Hey, you got a few? Let's walk.

173
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,394
You know, your mother is one
of the finest nurses I've ever met.

174
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,906
- How's she been?
- Oh. S-She... Well,

175
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,542
she's-she's, uh,
she's much better

176
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:12,266
now that you've, uh,
recommended her for that new job.

177
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,963
Oh, good. Good. Do you know that

178
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,297
she helped me
when I was an intern?

179
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,938
No, I didn't know that. How?

180
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,107
Well, nurses, they teach
interns more than anyone,

181
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,393
and she was so generous to me.

182
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,562
- Oh.
- She's why I wrote

183
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,809
the recommendation for
you to match here at Chastain.

184
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,751
Oh, well, uh, I-I wouldn't
be here without you.

185
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,864
Well, that's very
true, very true.

186
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,921
Please, want to step in?

187
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,642
Mm.

188
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,782
I need a small favor.

189
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,546
Uh, sure. Uh, a-anything.

190
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,581
Now, I understand that
you're working with Dr. Hawkins

191
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,771
- on an EMT patient named Sophia.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,802
I'm worried that she
has<i> Candida auris.</i>

193
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,592
<i>Candida auris?</i>

194
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,261
That-that has a
mortality rate above 50%.

195
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,764
Yeah, well, it's-it's
just a hunch.

196
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,069
Sophia transported my patient
Dawn Long here from LTACH.

197
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,122
What, did your patient have it?

198
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,940
I don't know for certain.

199
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:13,411
You know, but looking back,
uh, I believe that could be

200
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,163
the reason why
Dawn's final illness

201
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,399
didn't respond
to the antibiotics.

202
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:20,735
Well, we need to
tell Dr. Hawkins.

203
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,520
Well, no, that can't happen.

204
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:26,457
Because if I'm right about this,
it all stems from my mistake.

205
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,444
I misdiagnosed a patient,

206
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,196
and let me tell you, I am
beating myself up about that.

207
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,450
So my-my hope is to fix it,

208
00:10:35,485 --> 00:10:40,705
but quietly, by making
sure Sophia gets antifungals.

209
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,791
I just need to make sure

210
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:45,710
that you can treat Sophia
without Hawkins finding out.

211
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,313
What... Are... You're
serious? I, um...

212
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,964
Dr. Cain, what you're asking...

213
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:53,618
Is a big, big
favor. I know that.

214
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,803
But it repays a pretty big debt.

215
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:02,994
And I know that you'll help
me... because I helped you.

216
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:13,888
- Ezra.
- What are you doing?

217
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,291
Did something happen to Sophia?

218
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:19,322
Her MRSA and VRE
screens were negative.

219
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,839
Well, given her symptoms,
I thought it could be

220
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:22,463
a-a C. diff infection.

221
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:24,026
- Why didn't you page us?
- I should have. I-I'm sorry.

222
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,318
I just, I guess I... My-my
OCD got the best of me.

223
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,804
I started thinking about the
germs and then... uh, you know,

224
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,323
I had no idea that, uh,
sending stool for C. diff

225
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,419
would trigger
isolation protocols.

226
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,410
Look, interns overcall

227
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,663
C. diff all the time.

228
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,915
Since when are you the good cop?

229
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,700
When it's not my intern.

230
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,151
Because of what you did, Ezra,

231
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:45,764
Sophia will have to
remain in isolation

232
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,988
until her stool sample
comes back negative.

233
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:51,776
Again, so sorry.
I-I didn't realize.

234
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,982
Fine. OCD or not...

235
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:04,071
you're going in there and
checking in on our patient.

236
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,242
Hi, Isaac.

237
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:11,763
This is Dr. Austin, our very
best cardiothoracic surgeon.

238
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,265
Oh, I need a surgeon now?

239
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:17,218
Woof. That can't be good.

240
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:19,649
- Or cheap. Wow, Nic
was right about you.

241
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:23,307
- You are a charmer.
- Um, why are you here?

242
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,227
Well, you have some scarring
and other signs on your CT

243
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,295
that suggest you
have a lung disease

244
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,315
called pulmonary fibrosis.

245
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,784
It's the reason you've been
having a hard time breathing.

246
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:39,456
I was homeless for a while
myself when I was a teenager.

247
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,293
Did I get this from
living on the streets?

248
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,778
No, not in this case.

249
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:46,247
In this case, it's
more likely it's genetic.

250
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,665
Premature gray hair

251
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,418
is a rare genetic
manifestation of the disease.

252
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:55,840
So... I got this from my family?

253
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,626
Wow, I've never seen a patient

254
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,505
so happy about
inheriting a disease.

255
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,457
Probably because
most of your patients

256
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,449
know where they came from.

257
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,968
My parents dropped me off at
a fire station after I was born.

258
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:10,788
I was raised in foster care.

259
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,608
And, uh, I've
waited my whole life

260
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:17,128
to learn any scrap of
information about them.

261
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:22,149
So this is like
Christmas for me.

262
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:24,302
Uh, tell me there's a cure

263
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,671
for pulmonary fibrosis
under the tree, too.

264
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:30,308
Uh, I'm sorry, Isaac.

265
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:34,462
I'm worried the damage to
your lungs cannot be repaired.

266
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,826
We're gonna try to ease your
symptoms with medication,

267
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,144
- but, um...
- But we need to take a biopsy

268
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,752
of your lungs to be certain.

269
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,551
What's wrong?

270
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,287
It's Derek.

271
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,872
I thought he was doing better.

272
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,691
He was.

273
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:06,394
But then one
cough led to another,

274
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,046
and before we knew
it, shortness of breath.

275
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:12,850
I discussed it with Conrad,
and it's Derek's lungs.

276
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:16,487
He has diffuse
bilateral crackles.

277
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,640
Pulmonary edema?

278
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:21,592
He thinks so.

279
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,428
Derek's gained five
pounds of fluid since chemo,

280
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,891
and his kidneys still
haven't bounced back.

281
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,927
Well, haven't they
given him diuretics?

282
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,150
Yes, but that might
not be enough.

283
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:32,803
And if that's the case...

284
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,270
<i>They want to put you on a
ventilator to help you breathe,</i>

285
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,578
and hopefully allow
your lungs to heal.

286
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,762
A ventilator?

287
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,781
For how long?

288
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,116
There's no way of knowing.

289
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:50,388
Will I be awake,
able to communicate?

290
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,257
No, we have to sedate you.

291
00:14:55,945 --> 00:15:01,131
And there's a chance you
could develop other complications

292
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,918
that could prevent

293
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:07,772
the breathing tube
from being removed.

294
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:11,442
So, when they p-put
me under, there's...

295
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,273
there's a chance that
I might not wake up,

296
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:16,959
that I might not
see my family again.

297
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,227
- Is that what you're saying?
- Shh...

298
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,234
That's a worst-case scenario,

299
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,431
but it's the only way
you recover lung function.

300
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:26,290
Kit, there has to
be another way.

301
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:29,810
- There has to be another way.
- No. Honey, honey.

302
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,918
I don't think there is.

303
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:43,590
If I do this,

304
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,626
I could die.

305
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:53,283
If you don't do this...
you definitely will.

306
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:58,456
How long can I
delay being intubated?

307
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,274
The way things are going,

308
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,211
unless something changes,
it will need to happen soon.

309
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:12,002
Okay, well, I just, I have
to see Josie one more time.

310
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,205
- Yes.
- Okay, I know that we said

311
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,368
that she needed a day
a-away from all this but...

312
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,376
No, I'll-I'll let the babysitter
pick her up from school

313
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,180
and bring her here immediately.

314
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,453
This is a bag of antifungals.

315
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,023
- Yes, I'm aware.
- How did you get this?

316
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,942
You don't get to where I am
without making a few allies.

317
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,627
You know someone in pharmacy?

318
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,996
No, I<i> have</i> someone in pharmacy.

319
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,699
I have someone everywhere.

320
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:45,520
Is Sophia still being treated
with the insulin drip and D5?

321
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:48,689
- Yes.
- Here's a label for her fluids.

322
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:51,158
Put it on the
antifungals and hang it.

323
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,830
Are you having doubts?

324
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:58,715
No, I want to help. I, uh...

325
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,069
Yes.

326
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,471
Chock-full of doubts.

327
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:06,040
I get it.

328
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,908
You know, when I was an intern,

329
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,864
I was faced with
so many choices.

330
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:13,214
It was all confusing.
I struggled, too.

331
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,768
But eventually, I learned to
just do what I was told to do

332
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,585
by the people who knew better.

333
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,437
And I got rewarded for that.

334
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:24,942
I didn't climb up the
ladder, I flew up it.

335
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,610
That could be you, Ezra.

336
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:51,718
Blood pressure 90/50,
tachycardic in the 130s.

337
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:53,954
My heart, it's pounding.

338
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,942
Ezra, check her lungs.

339
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,577
Uh-huh.

340
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:03,347
She's burning up. Temp is 101.5.

341
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:08,068
Breathing sounds are diminished.

342
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,620
She's septic.

343
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,956
Two liters of normal saline now.

344
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:15,076
Dizzy. Hot. Turn down heat.

345
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:17,912
Should we start her on pressors?

346
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:19,914
Let's see how she
responds to volume.

347
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:23,683
I'm putting her
in Trendelenburg.

348
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:28,856
Squeeze the bag.

349
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:35,074
Her BP is rising.

350
00:18:35,098 --> 00:18:36,647
It's working.

351
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:42,247
Something is causing
her to deteriorate.

352
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:44,283
Yeah, but there's nothing
in her labs that's suggesting

353
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:45,817
- what that could be.
- Well, something's changed.

354
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:48,642
We need a new set of labs.

355
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:51,662
And broaden her
antibiotics, just in case.

356
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:54,609
- I'll put in the orders.
- We'll have the nurse

357
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,650
come check on you, Sophia.

358
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,873
♪ ♪

359
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,629
Hey. Ezra, what are you doing?

360
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,581
- Hey.
- When I said,
"Put in the orders,"

361
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,921
- I meant you would.
- Yeah, right. Coming.

362
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,750
We got the results
from your lung biopsy.

363
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,387
I'm so sorry, Isaac.

364
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,423
You need a transplant.

365
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,210
Well, what are my chances
of getting a new lung?

366
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:58,262
Well, you're a good candidate.

367
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,981
You're young, otherwise healthy.

368
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:03,383
But in order to be
eligible for a transplant,

369
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:05,819
all patients must
have a support system.

370
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:08,822
Two people who can take
care of you after the surgery,

371
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:12,109
take you to appointments,
administer medication

372
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,178
for as long as necessary.

373
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,208
They'll have to commit
to your recovery,

374
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:19,133
which can be a long process.

375
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:23,754
Yeah, I am the support
system for other people.

376
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,841
I don't have one of my own.

377
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:31,194
Well, surely there's someone
who can step up, right?

378
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,165
Old foster parents, friends?

379
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:43,107
It's my own fault.

380
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:46,409
Growing up, I had a
huge chip on my shoulder.

381
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:50,597
Anger cost me every
relationship in my life.

382
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:54,634
I found my
companionship in drugs.

383
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,471
I lost my job and then my home.

384
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,593
I've lived my life alone.

385
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:08,148
Now it sounds like
that's how I'll die.

386
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,637
Okay.

387
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,106
Why don't you give us some time,

388
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,642
see if there's something
that we can figure out, okay?

389
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:21,328
<i>You know, I do have a contact</i>

390
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,346
in the pulmonary
fibrosis community.

391
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:27,250
Maybe they have some
resources that could help Isaac?

392
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,955
Never thought I'd say this,

393
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,209
but silence is not
a good look on you.

394
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,161
What's up?

395
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:43,751
I was thinking about Isaac.

396
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:46,186
He was abandoned by his parents,

397
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:50,307
never had a real home or
people who cared about him.

398
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:55,212
And how he just ended
up living in the streets.

399
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,964
Do you think that could have
been you if you weren't adopted?

400
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,186
Look, I was dealt a
good hand. He was not.

401
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:05,456
He can't think of one
person that can help him?

402
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,958
I have worked with
Isaac for over a year.

403
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,621
He spends all of his
time helping those

404
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:10,822
who aren't equipped
to help themselves.

405
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:13,447
He really doesn't have anyone.

406
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:16,183
You know, he's not gonna
live long post transplant

407
00:22:16,218 --> 00:22:17,668
without a lot of help.

408
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:23,207
But come on, who's got the
capacity and the willingness

409
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:27,511
to take responsibility of a
20-something-year-old man?

410
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:31,665
Me.

411
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,316
I wanted to give them a moment
alone before Josie arrives.

412
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:51,112
Derek's parents
are trying to get here,

413
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,087
but I'm not sure
they'll make it.

414
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,440
And Molly's dad?
Is he on the way?

415
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,525
Brett's in Denmark for work.

416
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:00,210
He's trying to get home,

417
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:03,080
but... we're not together
anymore, it's complicated.

418
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:05,332
I... That's none of my business.

419
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:09,536
And I... and I can... I know
I have no standing here.

420
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:12,072
But I... had to do<i> something</i>

421
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,225
for you and your family.

422
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,727
And this is just... the
best I could come up with.

423
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,295
What is it?

424
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:20,458
I approached our palliative
care people for advice,

425
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,682
and they suggested this.

426
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,800
It's a legacy book.

427
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,920
So, a guide that helps patients

428
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:31,392
facing a dangerous procedure
with an uncertain outcome.

429
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:35,279
It helps them organize
their memories and, um,

430
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:38,699
put their wishes in order.

431
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,951
Just in case the...

432
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:44,082
And if, and if this
is... If I'm intruding,

433
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:45,389
if this is the wrong thing,

434
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,075
- I'm...
- It's perfect.

435
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,795
Derek needs to feel
like he has some control.

436
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,747
Thank you.

437
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:08,979
Sorry. We got trapped in the ER.

438
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,897
How's Sophia?

439
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,116
She became more
acidotic and hypoxic,

440
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,768
so I had to intubate her.

441
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:17,104
And she's still spiking a fever

442
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,106
despite being on
new antibiotics.

443
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:22,409
Her latest set of labs
show an acute liver injury.

444
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:24,144
Right.

445
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:30,817
What if she doesn't
have an infection?

446
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:35,122
You did a detailed
patient history.

447
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:36,790
Tell us more about Sophia.

448
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:39,793
Well, her mom
suffered from lupus

449
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:43,480
- and her dad had MS.
- Both are autoimmune disorders.

450
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:47,217
- They could run in families.
- Acute liver injury, joint pain,
and Sophia's other symptoms,

451
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,770
she may have
adult-onset Still's disease.

452
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:52,050
Ezra, what is the treatment
for adult-onset Still's?

453
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,641
Steroids. But we
can't give her that.

454
00:24:54,677 --> 00:24:57,144
That absolutely can't happen.

455
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,949
- Why not? Because...
W-Well, there's no test to confirm

456
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:06,503
adult-onset Still's, so we'd
be treating Sophia blind.

457
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,039
That's not ideal,

458
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,875
but if we do nothing,
Sophia could get worse.

459
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,177
I'm gonna check on Sophia.

460
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,545
And then I'll
order the steroids.

461
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,926
Uh, uh, aren't-aren't there
risks in giving her steroids?

462
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,185
Yes. Why don't you
tell me what they are?

463
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,648
<i>Death.</i>

464
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,921
If you give high-dose
steroids to a patient

465
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,373
with<i> Candida auris,</i>

466
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:28,036
you'll exacerbate
the fungal infection

467
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,995
- and kill her.
- Look, we can't let her die.

468
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,712
Her death won't make sense.

469
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:34,325
We could trigger
an investigation.

470
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:37,017
We can't let Sophia die
because she's a human being

471
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:38,530
- and we could prevent it.
- Of course.

472
00:25:38,554 --> 00:25:41,772
Of-of course, that's
the first priority here.

473
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,285
Let me think, we
have to fix this.

474
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,024
We've gone too far already.

475
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,778
None of this would be
happening if not for the liver injury,

476
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,447
and that is a known side effect
of the antifungal I gave her.

477
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:52,932
Okay. I get it.

478
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,386
So what we have to do is
we have to stop Hawkins

479
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,282
- from treating with steroids.
- How do we do that?

480
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,973
I don't know!

481
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,943
- It's not just me?
- No, it's not just you.

482
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,929
Oh, that's nice. Although,
I'd like to be more of a...

483
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:13,387
Well, you two seem
to be hitting it off.

484
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:15,099
Well, of course. I'm trying.

485
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:18,258
Or she's very easily
impressed. I'm not sure which.

486
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,260
People like you are why I run

487
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:22,279
a pulmonary
fibrosis organization.

488
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:26,616
We are in contact with
more than two million people.

489
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,068
And I will absolutely put
you in touch with survivors

490
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:30,448
who can talk to you
about what it's like

491
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,539
to live with the disease.

492
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:34,374
Just know that you're not alone.

493
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:36,343
I-I love the sound of that.

494
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:40,964
Well, hopefully you'll
like the sound of this, too.

495
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:44,785
Conrad and I have agreed
to be your support system.

496
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,321
Wait, you're serious?

497
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,458
And with that assurance,

498
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:54,478
we got you on
the transplant list.

499
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,786
My entire life, I've
never had anybody

500
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,189
really stand by me.

501
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:08,892
I don't even know
how to thank you.

502
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:19,203
Wait, wait!

503
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,354
Are those steroids?

504
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,856
No, it's an antifungal.

505
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:29,162
Sophia has<i> Candida auris.</i>

506
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,681
<i>Candida auris?</i> H-How did
you go from diagnosing Sophia

507
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,468
with adult-onset
Still's to<i> Candida auris?</i>

508
00:27:34,503 --> 00:27:37,670
There is no test to confirm
onset Still's disease...

509
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:41,341
- but you can rule it out.
- I'm sorry, I'm a...

510
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:43,777
intern, still learning here.

511
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,530
- Sophia had a fever. Right?
- Yeah.

512
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:50,283
The only telltale
sign of Still's is...

513
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,353
a salmon-colored rash
when a fever spikes.

514
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:54,505
She didn't have one.

515
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,542
When that happens...

516
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,730
you go back to the well.

517
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,449
And you dig deep.

518
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,886
Have a look.

519
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:23,662
Otitis externa. She
has an ear infection.

520
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:26,252
Which is how<i> Candida
auris</i> was discovered in 2009.

521
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,521
Hence the name...
<i>Auris</i> is Latin for ear.

522
00:28:28,557 --> 00:28:30,034
Seemed like a leap,
but I ran the cultures

523
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,424
and confirmed it.

524
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,874
Dr. Hawkins knows.

525
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,911
He figured out Sophia
has<i> Candida auris.</i>

526
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,729
I heard.

527
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,166
He already notified
the health department.

528
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:00,403
It's over.

529
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,456
Get the bag of antifungals
that you hung and it will be.

530
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,759
It's the only thing that
connects us to this.

531
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,309
There's something
I don't understand.

532
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:17,270
Why cover this up?

533
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:18,633
You're the most
powerful doctor I know.

534
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:20,256
You could have survived this

535
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,960
if you'd just told the
truth from the beginning.

536
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,628
Why didn't you?

537
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:27,447
Because Logan Kim
would have destroyed me.

538
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,998
Over one mistake?

539
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:35,956
This isn't the first, Ezra.

540
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:42,062
When I was an
intern, much like you...

541
00:29:42,097 --> 00:29:44,097
something really bad happened.

542
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:45,593
We all make mistakes
in the beginning.

543
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,301
Not like this one.

544
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:52,806
Laparoscopic instruments
got infected by bacteria.

545
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:59,613
Patients got sick just
from routine procedures.

546
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:04,484
Four of them ended up dead.

547
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,600
I suspected that the
instruments were contaminated,

548
00:30:08,624 --> 00:30:11,591
but... I never said anything.

549
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:14,277
Why?

550
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,845
Fear.

551
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:23,103
Red Rock covered for
me, but that was all possible

552
00:30:23,138 --> 00:30:26,156
because your mother
took pity on me.

553
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,040
She helped them.

554
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,477
And I would not be here
right now without her.

555
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:32,795
My mom wouldn't have
stuck her neck out like that

556
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,132
if she didn't see
something in you.

557
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,168
And with her sacrifice,
I've done a lot of good.

558
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:42,772
A lot. And I hope to do more.

559
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:49,713
But there's just one
more loose end...

560
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,531
What else should we
put in our picture book?

561
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,338
My birthday party.

562
00:30:58,373 --> 00:31:00,501
- Good idea.
- There you are
at the steamboat restaurant

563
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,143
with your cake and
ice cream. Hmm?

564
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:04,911
Mm.

565
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:09,265
So this one for sure
goes in the legacy book.

566
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,554
'Cause Josie and I,
we love our ice cream.

567
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:16,739
Yeah?

568
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,569
I'll get a print made.

569
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:22,745
Here.

570
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,281
Why does Daddy
have to wear the mask?

571
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,933
It helps him breathe.

572
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,520
- He's still very sick?
- Yes.

573
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,722
But he's fighting to get better.

574
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:37,226
Honey? You and Mommy

575
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:42,349
are gonna be alone
while I'm in the hospital.

576
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:46,637
I know this is all
confusing and scary.

577
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,556
But will you promise me

578
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:51,157
you'll take care of each other?

579
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:57,780
That's my girl.

580
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:01,713
Thought someone might
want a hot chocolate.

581
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:04,888
- What do we say?
- Thank you, Dr. Hawkins.

582
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,457
Oh, you're welcome.

583
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,409
What's that for?

584
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,456
Uh, the vent will
help your dad breathe.

585
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,114
They're just
setting it up for later.

586
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:17,967
<i>Code Blue, Room 54-17.</i>

587
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:21,404
<i>- Code Blue, Room 54-17.</i>
- I need a vent, now!

588
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,940
Go. I'll ask for another one.

589
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:38,772
Isaac. What's happening, man?

590
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:42,059
Sats in the 80s.
BP's down to 70/50.

591
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,128
No, wait.

592
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,413
- If we wait, he'll code.
- Well, his neck veins,

593
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,800
they're distended
up to his ears.

594
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:53,670
He's hyperresonant on
the left. There's air in there.

595
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,624
Chest tube is kinked.

596
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,293
What? You got to be kidding me.

597
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,040
That's what's causing
the hemothorax.

598
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:08,785
Oh, yeah, there you go.
Hey, hey, hey, you all right?

599
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:09,998
- You're breathing now, right?
- Mm-hmm.

600
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,504
All right, all right, Isaac.

601
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:13,284
We got you.

602
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:14,852
Listen to me. Guys like Isaac,

603
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:16,788
if they go on the vent,
they never come off.

604
00:33:16,812 --> 00:33:19,529
Vents fall into the "last
resort only" category.

605
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,532
- You got me?
- Got it.

606
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,684
All right, all
right. We got you.

607
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,652
You need this?

608
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:28,608
No, it's okay.
Put it over there.

609
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:37,658
Well, because your
fibrosis is genetic,

610
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,193
I asked Cheryl if she knew
of anyone with premature

611
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,483
gray hair in their 20s.

612
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,985
Is she sure that this
guy is my cousin,

613
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,849
not just some
dude that recovered

614
00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:46,373
from pulmonary fibrosis?

615
00:33:46,408 --> 00:33:48,141
A DNA test will confirm,

616
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:51,844
but you cannot deny
the resemblance.

617
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,103
Those are definitely my eyes
and my nose and my chin.

618
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,207
And everything.

619
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,910
His name is Gabriel, and
after hearing your story,

620
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:09,379
he thinks your mom is his aunt.

621
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:13,382
She got pregnant as a teen,
and ran away from home.

622
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:18,071
And they've been searching
for her and her child ever since.

623
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:19,900
Now, he's talked to
the rest of his family,

624
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,959
and they have agreed to
be your support system.

625
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,544
Even if you're not related.

626
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,047
I don't even know
how to thank you.

627
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:33,069
You've been longing
for this your whole life.

628
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,421
And now it's here.

629
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,767
He's ready.

630
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,588
As ready as he'll ever be.

631
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,485
I helped him write
a beautiful letter

632
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,877
for the legacy book that
Josie will have all her life.

633
00:34:57,912 --> 00:34:59,807
Let's hope she
never has to read it.

634
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,448
Yeah.

635
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:06,286
The legacy book was
a great idea, Mom,

636
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:10,323
and made Derek feel
like... like no matter what,

637
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,926
he was still taking
care of me and Josie.

638
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:16,595
Oh, darling, it's okay.

639
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:17,948
Let it go.

640
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,267
Okay.

641
00:35:20,302 --> 00:35:22,418
Remember this.

642
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,105
Derek can still make
it through, and no one

643
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,273
is giving up on him.

644
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,995
Come here.

645
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,118
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

646
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,664
It's gonna be okay.

647
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:55,334
Okay.

648
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:58,487
It's time for Dr. Bell to
take you to get some food.

649
00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,806
I don't want to leave Daddy.

650
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,786
Daddy wants you
to go with Dr. Bell.

651
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,826
He's very nice.

652
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,782
Sometimes even
a little bit funny.

653
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,369
I love you.

654
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:15,405
I love you, too, Daddy.

655
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:34,774
We'll be here when you wake up.

656
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,763
They'll be fine.

657
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,230
I'll make sure of it.

658
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,871
I know.

659
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,606
I love you, too.

660
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,447
It's okay.

661
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:04,237
- You good?
- I'm good.

662
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,040
All right.

663
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:08,619
We're gonna give
you a medication

664
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,142
that will put you to sleep.

665
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,600
All right, Kathleen.

666
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:35,985
There you go.

667
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,270
♪ ♪

668
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,651
What happened to her?

669
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,186
Antifungals aren't working.

670
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,167
We've got her on four
liters of normal saline.

671
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,634
Her systolic is
still in the 70s.

672
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,470
She's going into shock.
She needs pressors.

673
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,188
There's no access.
Her veins are collapsed.

674
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:53,195
Then let's get an IO.

675
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,231
Ezra, grab one
out of the code cart.

676
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,231
Where's that drill going?

677
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,467
Directly into the bone marrow.

678
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,305
Now you have
your central access.

679
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:26,362
Okay, starting her on norepi.

680
00:39:29,384 --> 00:39:32,102
Turn it up to 50 mics per kilo.

681
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,457
Higher.

682
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:41,026
- She's maxed out.
- So what do we do?

683
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,924
Hit her with every
antifungal in our pharmacy.

684
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,364
And if none of them work?

685
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:45,531
Then she dies.

686
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,697
<i>I mean, how did Sophia even
get Candida auris to begin with?</i>

687
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:10,223
The health department
will have to find the source.

688
00:40:10,258 --> 00:40:11,735
If we would have
found it sooner,

689
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:13,839
maybe that would have
made the difference.

690
00:40:15,296 --> 00:40:19,114
Hey, it's not your fault.

691
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,086
<i>Candida auris</i> is notoriously
difficult to diagnose.

692
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:27,935
She got antifungals
from the start.

693
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,460
Long before you knew.

694
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:33,262
What are you talking about?

695
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:36,049
I gave them to her.

696
00:40:36,084 --> 00:40:39,585
- What? Why would you do that?
- Dr. Cain told me to.

697
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,306
Why?

698
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:46,176
He knew she had<i> Candida auris?</i>

699
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,344
He suspected.

700
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,796
How?

701
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:55,451
It's been killing me
keeping Cain's secrets.

702
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:59,272
You better sit down and tell
us the whole story right now.

703
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:18,269
I assume you heard the EMT who
brought Dawn Long here is dead.

704
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:20,793
Sophia.

705
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,648
Say something.

706
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:26,999
What do you want me to say?

707
00:41:27,035 --> 00:41:29,352
That you regret going to Logan

708
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,115
instead of the
state health board.

709
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:33,939
That you wish you would have
come to me from the beginning,

710
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:36,236
'cause maybe we could've
done something to save her.

711
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,146
That you regret using
a scared, vulnerable kid,

712
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:42,659
saddling him with
guilt he'll carry

713
00:41:42,683 --> 00:41:43,894
with him the rest of his life.

714
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,903
Spare me your
self-righteous anger.

715
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,305
You're no angel.

716
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,851
You've caused harm.
You've made mistakes.

717
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,626
I don't willfully
endanger my patients.

718
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:55,473
I told Kim and I warned him

719
00:41:55,497 --> 00:41:57,425
to be straightforward
about<i> Candida auris.</i>

720
00:41:57,449 --> 00:42:00,015
I told him about that.

721
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:03,736
- He threatened me.
- But you... you caved?

722
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:06,655
All that bluster, you
bow down to a suit?

723
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,474
Why do you come in here?

724
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,009
So you can feel like a king?

725
00:42:10,045 --> 00:42:12,444
Convince yourself
you're not a coward?

726
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:16,933
Get out.

727
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,602
How could someone
so brilliant and so gifted

728
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,739
throw it all away and sell
their soul to Red Rock?

729
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:26,376
Is it just the money? The power?

730
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:29,362
Your name on a building?

731
00:42:29,397 --> 00:42:31,391
What does any of that
mean at the end of the day

732
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,399
if you can't look in the mirror?

733
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:55,805
Come on. It's okay.

734
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:14,723
Sleep tight, Daddy.

735
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,839
