1
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,941
When I was 18, I wanted a tattoo

2
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,105
of a panda right
here, on my arm,

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:18,516
but, uh, my girlfriend at the
time talked me into a heart.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,920
Stop moving. Yeah.

5
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,514
I don't know why I thought
a panda would be so cool.

6
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,626
Well, this tattoo will guide
the external beam radiation

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,889
to within less than a
millimeter of your tumor,

8
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,328
so, also cool.

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,729
Yeah, but three dots?

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,461
Three dots is so lame.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,935
Why couldn't you give me,
like, a badass teardrop or a tiger?

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,369
I get that you're nervous.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,303
Hmm.

14
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,472
When will you tell the staff?

15
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,309
I was kind of hoping
they wouldn't notice.

16
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:49,574
Four days in you're gonna
start vomiting constantly.

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,895
After two weeks, you'll be fed
through a tube in your stomach.

18
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,582
You won't be able to
swallow. There'll be hair loss.

19
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,816
Weight loss.

20
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,151
What I'm saying is, I
think they're gonna notice.

21
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,990
They're gonna notice, yeah.

22
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,862
I'll tell them.

23
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,021
Somehow.

24
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,660
Okay.

25
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,497
Hold. Don't move.

26
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,501
Imagine it's a panda.

27
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:33,994
So in the middle of stitching up
her arm, she asks for a mai tai.

28
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,359
I was like, "Lady,

29
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,989
"does this look like
a tiki bar to you?"

30
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,222
Hey, thanks, guys.

31
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,944
I would never have made it
from the Bronx without you.

32
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,596
Next time, drinks
are on me, okay?

33
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,208
Stealing snacks again?

34
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,745
No name, fair game.

35
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,479
Moonlighting before a double?

36
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,048
So? Like you don't.

37
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,144
Yeah, but I'm not
the department chair.

38
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,458
Later. All right.

39
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,154
Lauren?

40
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,074
Hey, do you know what
kind of Scotch Floyd drinks?

41
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,862
What? You guys are buds.

42
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,368
Yeah, it's just weird hearing
him being called Floyd.

43
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,494
Oh, yeah, right.

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,147
It's way more normal to call
somebody by their last name.

45
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,230
So, Scotch?

46
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,666
Uh, if he's paying,
whatever's in the well,

47
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,836
and if someone else is
paying, then top shelf.

48
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,674
Why? It's his birthday.

49
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:29,342
Oh, man. Well, good
luck. Wait, why good luck?

50
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,228
Well, it just sucks to start dating a
guy and then have it be his birthday.

51
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,447
Does it? Yeah.

52
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,231
If he's one of those guys
who loves his birthday.

53
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,917
I love my birthday.
Not like he does.

54
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,356
It's impossible.

55
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,503
So you're thinking I should get
something better than Scotch?

56
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:41,586
Yep. Good luck.

57
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,731
Thank you.

58
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,774
This is too much.

59
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,510
I don't even know how to...

60
00:02:58,712 --> 00:02:59,771
Oh!

61
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,312
You got me a FloTech
Cell Sorter for my birthday?

62
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,480
No. Man, you shouldn't have.

63
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,252
I didn't. And yet, here it is.

64
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,123
I guess HCC decided to
upgrade our old cell sorter,

65
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,994
which, no surprise,
didn't need upgrading. Oh.

66
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,892
Maybe your girlfriend
pulled some strings?

67
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,195
I don't know. This machine
costs 100,000 bucks.

68
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,644
Which could have
been better spent

69
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,830
almost anywhere
else in the hospital.

70
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,532
Yes. Bureaucracy. Bureaucracy.

71
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,817
Here, help me get it to the OR
before someone else nabs it.

72
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,900
You're keeping it?

73
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,335
Well, possession's
9/10 of the law.

74
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,534
It's not, actually.

75
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,856
Well, then I'm invoking
the "finders, keepers" rule.

76
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,008
Just help me move it. Come on.

77
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,511
How do you... Do you know
how to... Do you know how to do...

78
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,912
It's broken.

79
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,954
Yeah, well...

80
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,220
Bureaucracy.

81
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,028
Oh, oh.

82
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,361
Keep walking.

83
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,094
Keep walking.

84
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,097
I am still very angry.

85
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,838
Down three with seven seconds left
and Hardaway's sitting on a bench?

86
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,604
And then they
don't call a time-out.

87
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,543
He's our only
three-point shooter.

88
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,408
Well, to love the
Knicks is to suffer.

89
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:18,056
Would you like to
watch the game tonight

90
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,151
together?

91
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,354
I can't.

92
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,296
Okay.

93
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,464
I'm getting my one-year chip.

94
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,030
Chip? For being clean.

95
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,603
I see.

96
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,866
It's at the downtown Y.

97
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,408
You could come if you'd like.

98
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,309
That would be...
Strange to get a reward.

99
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,544
I mean, it's kind of a big deal.

100
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,144
I would think that the
real reward would be

101
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,549
not being an addict.

102
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,489
Okay.

103
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,125
So I guess you're not
coming. I have a better idea.

104
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,419
Uh...

105
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,326
Knicks game? Next week?

106
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,396
Yeah.

107
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,665
Patient.

108
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,139
So I'll see you next week?

109
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,580
Uh, Max.

110
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,000
Can I just get your
thoughts on a patient?

111
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,619
Yeah. Locally advanced
pancreatic cancer.

112
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,956
Amenable to surgery? Yes,
he's prepped and ready to go.

113
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,930
Great, then go for the
cure. There's a catch.

114
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,196
Cardiology work-up found a
left-ventricular ejection fraction of 35%.

115
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,897
That is a catch. 90%
chance he'll die on the table.

116
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,635
But a 10% chance he won't.
Technically. But those are terrible odds.

117
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,937
That's for him to decide.

118
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,854
I can't suggest he go
through with the surgery, can I?

119
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,210
Why not?

120
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,477
Because that's like me saying to
you, "Hey, let's scrap chemo and wing it

121
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,793
"with precision-targeted
therapy."

122
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,286
Well, some of those
trials show a lot of promise.

123
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,886
And some show it
makes the disease worse.

124
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,001
But we're not talking about you.

125
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:04,054
Right, but we have to give
your patient both options, right?

126
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:05,855
"We"?

127
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,838
A man named Daniel was
captured by Roman soldiers.

128
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,774
The general told
Daniel he could make...

129
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,836
Nurse, can you give us a
minute? Thank you, he's all yours.

130
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,290
The story was just getting good.

131
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,393
Rabbi Skillman, I'd like to introduce
you to our medical director, Max Goodwin.

132
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,079
Goodwin. Is that Jewish?

133
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,913
I believe my
great-great-grandmother was,

134
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,322
but I was raised nothing.

135
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,484
Then you're Jewish.

136
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,750
I'll take it.

137
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,863
So, Dr. Sharpe.

138
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,869
Do you have good news
for me this morning?

139
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,833
Lot of whispering going on.

140
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,924
I wish I did.

141
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,861
Okay.

142
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,134
It's what you
feared? His heart...

143
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,507
Work-up shows that it's
not pumping blood very well.

144
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,342
Hmm. The cherry
on the cancer cake.

145
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:58,284
There's a 90% chance
of dying in surgery.

146
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,877
Or a 10% chance of a cure.

147
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,284
Not great odds.

148
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,057
The other option is no surgery.

149
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,792
You can go home.

150
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,494
Spend a year of good-quality
life with the people you love.

151
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,295
We'll make sure that
you're comfortable.

152
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,470
Like any good conundrum,

153
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,531
I believe I'll need some
time to think about this.

154
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,066
Yeah, of course.

155
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:24,520
And if you have any
questions, I'm here.

156
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,308
Take all the time you need.

157
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:30,942
We just want to make sure
you really consider both options.

158
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,820
Okay. Hmm.

159
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,295
Amy.

160
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,165
I see your migraines
haven't improved.

161
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,600
And, uh...

162
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,430
Your triptans did not help.

163
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,565
No.

164
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:58,573
We can run a second MRI,
but I'm afraid we've exhausted

165
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,113
all the traditional treatments.

166
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,341
Is there anything else...
Find a better treatment.

167
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,284
Yes, Mrs. Chiang.

168
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,950
I'm starting to think that
stress could be a factor.

169
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,186
And we might think about
counseling as an alternative treatment.

170
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,695
I speak many
languages, Mrs. Chiang,

171
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,794
but Mandarin is not one of them.

172
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,170
My mom is just saying... My
daughter is here for migraines.

173
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,010
I have a colleague,
Dr. Iggy Frome...

174
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,615
And, uh... Ah.

175
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,343
He's a wonderful psychiatrist.

176
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,959
Okay.

177
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:56,868
"Dr. Ignatius Frome.
Chair of Behavioral Health."

178
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,472
Mom. It's just to talk.

179
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,341
One appointment can't hurt.

180
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,011
Okay, but what if
Dr. Frome could help?

181
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:15,749
We don't talk to strangers
about our problems.

182
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,946
What do we got?

183
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,385
"Failure to fly." Bowery
stop, attempted suicide.

184
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,700
Escort her out of here. Would
you give me the rundown?

185
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,192
Amy Chiang, 21.

186
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,905
Got lucky, landed on the track
bed so the train went right over her.

187
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,262
Left her with lacerations,
possible patellar fracture.

188
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,527
Amy, look at me. Can
you move your leg?

189
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,796
Got her chart.

190
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,735
Get ortho and prep
for surgery. Now.

191
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,049
You're not gonna believe this,
but she was here this morning.

192
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,269
Why? Seeing Dr. Kapoor.

193
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,639
First-generation
Chinese-American.

194
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,706
First to go to
college in her family.

195
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,761
Scholarship. Works full-time
at the family restaurant.

196
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,482
Grades started to slip. She
came in complaining of migraines.

197
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,649
Medication didn't work, at which
point Kapoor suggested stress

198
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,635
as a possible trigger, and
then referred her to me.

199
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,094
The next thing you
know... Only 21.

200
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,755
Possible undiagnosed
severe depression.

201
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,442
We saw this at the Chinatown
clinic. Called it "the F train disease."

202
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,764
Never heard of it.

203
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,434
Well, the F train runs
through Chinatown,

204
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,597
and a lot of women
would use it as a last resort.

205
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,503
Depression can be

206
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,769
hard to accept in some
Asian communities.

207
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,333
In many communities.

208
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,743
Yeah, well, stigma or
no, if we don't help Amy,

209
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,748
she will probably try
to kill herself again.

210
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,916
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

211
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,748
What does it even do?

212
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,021
Oh, nothing. You know, just
separates the white blood cells

213
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,120
from the red blood cells
with the flick of a switch.

214
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,860
Best birthday present ever.

215
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,592
You really are a birthday dork.

216
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,639
My mom worked two
jobs seven days a week,

217
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,906
but every year on my birthday
she took the whole day off

218
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,443
and took me to the bookstore,

219
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,741
where she bought me as
many books as I could carry.

220
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,611
Correction. You are just a dork.

221
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,809
No way.

222
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,815
It's the wrong connector.

223
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,517
It's not compatible with
any of the machines.

224
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,793
Call an electrician.

225
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,761
No, we'd have to
upgrade the whole OR.

226
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,889
This is just $100,000
worth of useless junk.

227
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,296
Quality genes. I
bet he's smart, too.

228
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,841
You don't get abs like that
without crushing the SATs.

229
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,639
When I want input on
my choice of sperm donor,

230
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,179
I'll let you know. Right.

231
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,112
Has the rabbi decided
on the surgery yet?

232
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,981
I usually give my
patients a little more time,

233
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,485
you know, when it comes
to life-and-death decisions.

234
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,231
Well, you know, in poker they say,
"You think long, you think wrong."

235
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,918
Well, that's interesting,
because in oncology we say,

236
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,119
"Do the opposite
of poker players."

237
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,287
Well, let's see what
the patient has to say.

238
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,523
No. Max!

239
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,295
I think you're getting
too invested in this.

240
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,336
Really? Isn't this the same amount
of "too invested" I always get?

241
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,314
I take it, if you were the
rabbi, you would take the year.

242
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,807
I have my reasons. Well,
I respect those reasons,

243
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,001
except they're ridiculous
because a year is nothing.

244
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,254
A year is everything if it's
with someone that you love.

245
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,372
There's a year, and then
there's a year with cancer.

246
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,348
Believe me, most people
would take the surgery.

247
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,442
Max. Signatures. Dora,
my dear, how are you?

248
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,952
Uh, good, thanks.

249
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,545
Actually you're not. I'm not?

250
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,284
You have terminal cancer. What?

251
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,690
Uh, you're settling a debate
between Sharpe and me.

252
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,022
Oh, do I have to?

253
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,359
Choice one: get a surgery
that would cure you.

254
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,299
Right? Or choice two: go
home, do nothing, and die.

255
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,560
- Definitely the surgery.
- No, hang on.

256
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,206
Max is trying to sway the
jury. Here's the real situation.

257
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,299
Option one: have
a surgery so risky

258
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,207
you're more likely to
survive a plane crash,

259
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,121
or go home and have a
good year with your family

260
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,704
living in peace and comfort.

261
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,246
Definitely the year.
Can I be done now?

262
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,816
No. Yes.

263
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,314
It's okay. Just go. See?

264
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,413
It's all in the presentation.

265
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,253
He's doing the surgery.

266
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,789
It's a no-brainer.

267
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,494
I'm not doing the surgery.

268
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,661
The risk is too great, I...

269
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,031
I was prepared, but now...

270
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,763
90% death rate?

271
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,738
I'm a Jets fan.

272
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,104
Historically, luck has
not been in my favor.

273
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,702
Hey, hey, hey.

274
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,112
This is the path
God chose for me.

275
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,843
We're gonna have a good year.

276
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,176
You could take more
time to decide, if you want.

277
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,848
You can go home and talk it
over with the rest of your family,

278
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,721
your congregation...

279
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,317
I'm at peace with my decision.

280
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,594
I accept my circumstances
for the way they are,

281
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,625
not the way I want them to be.

282
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,565
We both do.

283
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,829
I want the year.

284
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,931
And New Amsterdam will be here
to support you every step of the way.

285
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,406
Thank you, Dr. Sharpe.

286
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,535
Now let's talk about
what comes next.

287
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,908
We're going to connect
you with staff members

288
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,644
who will discuss home
care and medication.

289
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,479
Rebecca's going to
be incredibly important.

290
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:17,956
And the focus of
this year is you.

291
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,390
Your comfort.

292
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,026
Mrs. Chiang. How is she?

293
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,732
Amy is stable. When
can I take her home?

294
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,471
Hi, I'm Dr. Frome. Dr. Kapoor
gave you my card earlier.

295
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,609
I just wanted to say I'm very, very
sorry about what happened today.

296
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,200
When your daughter
gets out of surgery,

297
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,843
we would like to discuss
inpatient psychiatric care with you.

298
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,910
She's not crazy.
She's a good girl.

299
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,956
No, no, we know
that. We know she is.

300
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,923
She just needs help.

301
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,687
We're going to go now.

302
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,204
Okay. We want what's
best for your daughter,

303
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,856
and I'm sure you do too.

304
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,727
But you're not the patient here.

305
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,125
Amy is.

306
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,929
Mrs. Chiang,

307
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,602
your daughter jumped
in front of a subway train.

308
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,905
She didn't jump.

309
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,999
I beg your pardon?

310
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,374
She didn't jump. She slipped.

311
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,922
Come here, baby. Come here.

312
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:37,160
Studies found that docs
working shifts of 30 hours or more

313
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,070
end up making 36% more mistakes.

314
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,699
I'm fine. I'm a
polyphasic sleeper.

315
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,175
That's not a real thing.

316
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,907
Me and Thomas Edison.
We thrive off of short naps.

317
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,882
Define "thrive."

318
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,409
You gave the subway jumper
20 milligrams of morphine?

319
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,716
Is she dead?

320
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,190
No, 2, 2 milligrams.

321
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,749
It's a typo.

322
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,261
I didn't submit it.

323
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,264
I was gonna proof it.

324
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,890
36%. Shut up.

325
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,990
Okay.

326
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:39,857
Hey, Doc. Hey. Thought
I was gonna miss you.

327
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,991
Everything all right?

328
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,525
Yeah, um...

329
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,635
I need to ask you a question.

330
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,572
And, uh...

331
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,078
This isn't me,
Dr. Goodwin, asking.

332
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,808
This is, uh...

333
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,752
This is me, Max.

334
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,050
What is it, Max?

335
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,847
That decision you made...

336
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,794
I don't think I
could have made it.

337
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,298
And you seem so
at peace, I mean,

338
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,164
real, in your bones, at peace.

339
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,215
You want to know how I can be at
peace when I know I'm going to die?

340
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,497
Yeah.

341
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,477
Do you know the story
of Abraham and Isaac?

342
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,304
No.

343
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,974
Okay, so...

344
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,745
Abraham and Sarah
have no children.

345
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:35,481
But when they're very old,
God gives them a son, Isaac.

346
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:40,088
And then God asks Abraham
to sacrifice Isaac. Kill him.

347
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,526
And he'll reward him
with as many children

348
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,656
as there are stars in the
sky and sand in the sea.

349
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,930
And Abraham, being a
good and faithful man,

350
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,597
takes Isaac up the
mountain to sacrifice him.

351
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,938
And God rewards him for it.

352
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,101
That's choice one.

353
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,109
But what if Abraham said no?

354
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,015
What if Abraham said,
"There's lots of stars in the sky,

355
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,782
"but only one Isaac, who
I waited 100 years for,

356
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,818
"and I'd rather spend the
time I have left on this Earth

357
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,190
"with him and Sarah,
reward be damned"?

358
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,526
That's choice two.

359
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,362
Two impossible choices.

360
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,469
So I took the one that
makes me happier.

361
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,035
I have a confession.

362
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,969
Wrong religion,
but I'm listening.

363
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,202
I have cancer.

364
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,136
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,980
The chemo starts tomorrow

366
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,555
and, uh, what I'm learning
is that I'm not a good patient.

367
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,421
'Cause I'm scared.

368
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,924
And I'm frustrated.

369
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,428
And I'm angry, you know?

370
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,498
I don't know what to do.

371
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,842
Cancer changes
everything and nothing at all.

372
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,021
Where is my sandwich?

373
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,122
I need a sandwich!

374
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,126
I need a sandwich.

375
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,929
Would you mind checking
it out? Yeah, not a problem.

376
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,549
How are you feeling, Rodger?

377
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,713
His asthma seems better.

378
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,389
Do you know how much
longer we have to stay?

379
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,384
I'm sorry, what?

380
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,789
When can we go?

381
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,890
Yeah, uh, since your
husband also has hypertension,

382
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,697
we're going to need to
watch his pressure overnight.

383
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,556
I'm afraid the recital's
gonna have to wait.

384
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,342
Is he gonna be okay? Absolutely.

385
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,580
Okay, you were right.

386
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,810
Polyphasic sleepers are real.

387
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,749
Yeah, you were right too.

388
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,654
I'm gonna hit the on-call
room and just crash for five.

389
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,327
What the...

390
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,400
Can someone get whatever
the hell this is out of my ED?

391
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,337
You better be
ready to party. What?

392
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,703
Uh, I thought
about what you said

393
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,368
and I decided to throw Floyd a
surprise party right after work.

394
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,411
Right. Great
idea. He'll love it.

395
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,207
Just a few more quick
questions. Cake or pie?

396
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,447
Neither. Cobbler. Peach.

397
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,079
Does he like karaoke?

398
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,788
Only if he can do power ballads.

399
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,490
Can't wait to see that.

400
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,290
You can't, really?

401
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,088
Are balloons too much?

402
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,131
Nothing is too much.

403
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,031
Thanks, you rock.

404
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,079
Dr. Bloom?

405
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,116
I could really use your
opinion on the patient in Bay 3.

406
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,885
Did you have a good nap?

407
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,267
Hi there, Amy. I'm Dr. Frome,

408
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,359
I believe Dr. Kapoor spoke
to you about me earlier?

409
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,835
Um...

410
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:45,997
Do you mind if I sit?

411
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,336
Thank you.

412
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,670
Okay, so.

413
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,444
I would like to talk to you
about what happened today.

414
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,156
You are very lucky to be alive.

415
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,794
You know that, right?

416
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:17,102
Okay, tell me if any of
these feel true for you.

417
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,831
Can't concentrate at school.

418
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,805
Chronic fatigue,
but you can't sleep.

419
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,140
You feel like a failure,

420
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:28,306
despite your many
accomplishments.

421
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,871
Feel hopeless.

422
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,850
I thought it was stress.

423
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,783
That's depression.

424
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,791
And millions of
people suffer from it.

425
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,561
I have a lot of good things in my
life. I shouldn't have depression.

426
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,756
Yeah.

427
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,197
Depression doesn't
work that way.

428
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:53,067
But the good news
is it's highly treatable.

429
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:57,968
How?

430
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,309
Well, the first step
is to ask for help.

431
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,576
I like to start
with talk therapy.

432
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,713
What if my mom found out?

433
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,725
Or my dad?

434
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,355
They'd think I was acting weak.

435
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,494
I think it's a good thing to talk
to others about our problems.

436
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,728
I'm on my parents' insurance.

437
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,038
Okay.

438
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,872
They would know I
was going to therapy.

439
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:35,244
They'd think I was talking about
them or telling family secrets.

440
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,451
They'd stop talking to me.

441
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,290
Amy... I can't.

442
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,353
I'm sorry.

443
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,897
Okay.

444
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:00,338
Amy shouldn't have to suffer because
her community is afraid of mental illness.

445
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,375
It is not about fear,
it's about shame.

446
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,138
No, it's about stigma.
You have to understand

447
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,621
that they are afraid
of what others think.

448
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,375
Yeah, well, who cares
what others think?

449
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,025
Look, we all want
what's best for her, okay?

450
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,927
But we can't fight every
cultural stigma in one day.

451
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,476
Told you it was
stigma. It's shame.

452
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,430
We've got a patient
that we want to help,

453
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,323
but we can't help her because of
all these stupid insurance forms.

454
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,523
You're right. See?

455
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,653
About what?

456
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,096
Downcode it. Are you serious?

457
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:29,192
I had to do it for girls whose parents
wouldn't allow them birth control.

458
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,100
Billed it as "round
ligament pain."

459
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,231
We would look incompetent.
But you'll help the patient.

460
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,999
You want us to
defraud the hospital?

461
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,742
Exactly.

462
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,347
Max.

463
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,353
What the hell did
you tell the rabbi?

464
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,184
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

465
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,350
After you talked to him,
he changed his mind.

466
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,257
You have just talked
him into a risky surgery

467
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,762
that will most likely
lead to his death.

468
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,276
Sorry, Jane? Give
us a second, please?

469
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,045
You're wondering why
I changed my mind.

470
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,606
I am praying it is
not because of me.

471
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,309
What can I say? You
made a good case.

472
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,787
This is a high-risk surgery.

473
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:26,257
And for me to tip the scales in
any way with my own baggage

474
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:28,590
is the definition of unethical.

475
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,152
Tough luck. You did.

476
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,289
Max. Rabbi.

477
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,934
Max, I make my own decisions.

478
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,130
Yeah, I could be
home with family.

479
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,571
But I'd still be a patient.

480
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,165
That's not the life I want.

481
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,705
But... If I do this,

482
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,643
tomorrow I'll be
better or I'll be dead,

483
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,706
but I won't be a patient.

484
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,712
Not sure that clears me of
the malpractice suit, but...

485
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,981
Max, go. I absolve you.

486
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,082
Wrong religion.

487
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,519
Now you're being picky.

488
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,766
Sorry. Rabbi?

489
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,340
Did Abraham actually
sacrifice his own son?

490
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,537
No.

491
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,308
An angel came down
and stopped him.

492
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,976
But he was going to.

493
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,452
And it was enough
to pass God's test.

494
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,490
And God rewarded him
with as many children

495
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,721
as there are stars in the
sky and sands in the sea:

496
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,820
the Jewish people.

497
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,195
Some things are worth the risk.

498
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,534
Why is there a cell
sorter in the hallway?

499
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,313
It won't connect to the
other machines. Bureaucracy.

500
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,248
Tell HCC to take it back.

501
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,582
They won't. It's like
we're working for the army.

502
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,883
Well, it can't live here. I
know. Can you take it?

503
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,388
And do what with it?

504
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,288
I don't know. But
it's my birthday.

505
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,991
Dr. Goodwin, Sandra Fall from
billing. Yes. You left me a message?

506
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,760
Yeah, and you
didn't call me back.

507
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,243
I knew there was something
I forgot to do today.

508
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,412
Um, are you aware that two of
your doctors are downcoding?

509
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,665
Downcoding?

510
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,582
Yeah, it's when doctors
bill for something small

511
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,040
but provide more expensive care.

512
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,336
Why would they do that?

513
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,774
Because if they were upcoding,

514
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,254
they could make
money, but downcoding...

515
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,612
Yeah, exactly. So they told
me to put down CPT code 90868

516
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,992
for transcranial
electrical stimulation

517
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,848
for patient Amy Chiang,

518
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,718
but that doesn't require
three weekly sessions

519
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,755
in the psych ward,
so I will also notify...

520
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,333
Okay, you got me.
I told them to do it.

521
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,588
I just hoped they
would do it a little better.

522
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,754
Uh, wait, you told your doctors
to extort money from the hospital?

523
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,923
Well, it sounds really bad
when you say it like that,

524
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,899
but, uh, we're just
trying to help a patient.

525
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,765
Yeah, and it's my job to make
sure the hospital has enough money

526
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,634
to help all our patients.

527
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,196
When is somebody gonna
get this thing out of here?

528
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:56,970
You bring up an excellent point.

529
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:00,444
So how do you intend to
make up the lost revenue?

530
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,277
Would $100,000 cover it?

531
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,146
You can do that?

532
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,448
Call therapy something else?

533
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:10,851
We want to get you the help
that you need any way we can,

534
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,548
so we're gonna
start therapy in here,

535
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,384
while you're in recovery,
three times a week.

536
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,687
And I will navigate your school
schedule and your work schedule.

537
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,898
Your mother will never find out.

538
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,396
But it's a lie.

539
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,004
On paper, yes.

540
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,400
And what will I tell my mother

541
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,808
when she asks about
the brain stimulation?

542
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,007
Well, you can tell her
it was very stimulating.

543
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,845
So then I will be
lying to my mother.

544
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,977
And to my father. It's...

545
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,750
It's for your mental
health. She'll know.

546
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,359
And even if she
doesn't say anything,

547
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,758
she'll judge me.

548
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,393
I can teach you some
coping mechanisms.

549
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:55,190
She won't love me the same.

550
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,406
Is there a coping
mechanism for that?

551
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,235
<i>The downcoding will work.</i>

552
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:09,644
But it's not gonna
help, not in the long run.

553
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,616
The stress of having
to lie to her family

554
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,811
is only going to
exacerbate her depression,

555
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,046
her sense of isolation.

556
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,712
Our only option is to
work around the mother.

557
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,052
I think that's the problem.

558
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,684
I don't think we
should work around her.

559
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,999
I think we should bring her in.

560
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,221
For therapy? Yeah.

561
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,490
They need to do it together.

562
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,031
The whole reason we are here is

563
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,499
because the mother is
against talking to anyone.

564
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:31,059
I know, but we have
to get her on board,

565
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,037
or we're gonna lose Amy.

566
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,604
Okay. Okay.

567
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,817
Rodger Conway's gone into A-fib.

568
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,079
What?

569
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,081
Sorry, I can get someone else.

570
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,713
No, just, just give me a sec.

571
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,290
No, we can handle it.

572
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:55,390
I'm fine. I'm fine.

573
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:03,133
SVT. Ventricular rate of 160.

574
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,767
Dr. Bloom? Uh, how's the
patient? Any chest pain?

575
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,897
I would ask him, but
he's unresponsive.

576
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,169
Okay. Uh, carotid massage.

577
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,438
He's a set-up for
carotid stenosis.

578
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,980
He'll stroke out. We
need a heavy hitter.

579
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,342
Okay. Okay.

580
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,450
What do you want
us to do, Dr. Bloom?

581
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:34,290
Bloom? Dr. Bloom, we
need your instructions. Yes.

582
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,857
Yes?

583
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,630
- BP's down to 95/50.
- Dr. Bloom.

584
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:39,967
Okay. Okay.

585
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,839
Okay.

586
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:48,807
Atenolol, 5 milligram, IV.

587
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:52,246
You mean adenosine.
No, I said atenolol.

588
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,842
Atenolol.

589
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,814
All right. Got it. Here.

590
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,123
BP's down to 90/50.

591
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,493
Mr. Conway?

592
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,122
Are you with us?

593
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,835
Still unresponsive.

594
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,231
The medication will
take a minute to work.

595
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,562
BP's down to 86.

596
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,817
He's about to convert to V-tach.

597
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:18,281
Blood pressure's still dropping.
We usually shock this rhythm.

598
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,510
Don't. No. This med will work.

599
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,876
We need to shock him now.

600
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,913
No, just wait.

601
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,986
Just stop!

602
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,090
He's back.

603
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:46,398
Normal sinus rhythm.
The medication worked.

604
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,005
What just happened?

605
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,874
You're okay, Mr. Conway.

606
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,874
It's okay. You're okay.

607
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,321
Okay, one last quick
question, and it's kind of funny.

608
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,018
How old is Floyd going to be?

609
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,703
I don't know. He's
not my boyfriend.

610
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,128
We just slept together
a couple of times.

611
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:32,040
There must be a
part of you that knows

612
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,110
that your daughter did not slip,

613
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:38,455
that she tried to
end her life today.

614
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:43,024
I know it's hard to accept.

615
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:46,531
When a child needs
help, one may think,

616
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,590
"I did a bad job as a parent."

617
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,666
One may wonder,

618
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,434
"Why I didn't see
the signs sooner?"

619
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:59,108
Our children aren't perfect.

620
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,505
And why should they be?

621
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,673
We are not.

622
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,690
He's a good man.

623
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,493
Does that count for something?

624
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,534
In here, no. But,

625
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,302
everywhere else, yes.

626
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,369
He was always going
to do the surgery, I think.

627
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:39,378
He just needed to
explore the alternatives

628
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,716
to know it wasn't for him.

629
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:48,186
Do you

630
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,858
resent him for it?

631
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,788
I love him for it.

632
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,267
Hi.

633
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,172
Just came by to check on you.

634
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,344
How you feeling?

635
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,538
Mmm. Like I've
been hit by an F train.

636
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,014
Whoa!

637
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,918
Solid. Solid jokes
are a very good sign.

638
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,816
I'm sorry I can't go
behind my mother's back.

639
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,254
You know...

640
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:28,494
You are obviously
a very, very loyal,

641
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,126
very caring daughter.

642
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,863
I see that.

643
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:35,032
And you're part of a very
tight-knit, close family,

644
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,768
and you care what they think.

645
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,236
I know it sounds

646
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,908
silly,

647
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:50,288
but the hardest
part of every day is

648
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,358
just getting out of bed.

649
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,791
I lay there thinking about

650
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:03,730
all the things I
have to get done.

651
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:06,135
I imagine it all in my mind.

652
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,639
And one by one,

653
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,769
I fail at everything.

654
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,676
I don't finish my schoolwork.

655
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,720
I'm late for work.

656
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:27,058
I say the wrong thing at home,

657
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,529
and then I think maybe
I shouldn't even try.

658
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,430
So I lay there for a while,

659
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,328
all the time wishing

660
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,999
that I could just tell my mom

661
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,872
how much pressure I feel

662
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,310
to make her proud.

663
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,005
Ma!

664
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:58,082
I told your mother how
we will bill your insurance.

665
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,455
She said it was quite clever.

666
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:06,625
I... Yeah, I would like
to, if it's okay with you,

667
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,167
see the two of you together.

668
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,003
I want you to get better.

669
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,533
I'm sorry.

670
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,000
I need help.

671
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,718
We all need help.

672
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,117
Ma.

673
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,805
Surprise!

674
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:56,815
Yeah, dawg! Yeah!

675
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,509
Did you do all this?

676
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,677
It's no big deal.

677
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,381
Thank you.

678
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,154
Seriously.

679
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,560
How amazing are you?

680
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,563
Ooh!

681
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,926
<i>Paging Dr. Reynolds.</i>

682
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:22,231
<i>You are urgently needed
in the karaoke department!</i>

683
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,671
How did you know?

684
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,339
Honestly, Bloom told me.

685
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:34,548
<i>I believe I said
"urgently needed"?</i>

686
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,110
Yeah. Yeah, come on!

687
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:45,463
<i>Ooh, child, things
are gonna get easier</i>

688
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:51,532
<i>Ooh, child, things
will get brighter</i>

689
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:59,271
<i>Ooh, child, things
are gonna get easier</i>

690
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:05,483
<i>Ooh, child, things
will get brighter</i>

691
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,486
<i>Someday</i>

692
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:13,982
<i>We'll get it together
and we'll get it all done</i>

693
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:19,459
<i>Someday, when your
head is much lighter</i>

694
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,325
<i>Someday</i>

695
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:28,172
<i>We'll walk in the
rays of a beautiful sun</i>

696
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,801
<i>Someday, when the
world is much brighter</i>

697
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:40,077
<i>Ooh, child, things
will get brighter</i>

698
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:48,792
<i>Someday, we'll get it
together and we'll get it all done</i>

699
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:54,865
<i>Someday, when your
head is much lighter</i>

700
00:38:56,534 --> 00:39:02,667
<i>Someday, we'll walk in
the rays of a beautiful sun</i>

701
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:08,603
<i>Someday, when the
world is much brighter</i>

702
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,613
<i>Brighter</i>

703
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:20,020
<i>Ooh, child, things
are gonna get easier</i>

704
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,820
Rabbi Skillman's
surgery is looking good.

705
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,729
Yeah, I got a text
from Dr. Anders.

706
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,130
I'm so relieved.

707
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,994
Rolled the dice
and came up huge.

708
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,873
Maybe you should do the same.

709
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:37,472
Choosing a donor.

710
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,010
I still miss him.

711
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,076
His name was Muhammad.

712
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,213
Internal medicine.

713
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,818
One of the good ones.

714
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:59,894
We were completely out
of our minds for each other.

715
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,497
You know what that's like?

716
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,270
He asked me to marry him.

717
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,206
We were gonna have kids.

718
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:12,744
The whole thing.

719
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,774
You broke up?

720
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:19,910
Brain aneurysm.

721
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,085
All our plans, just...

722
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:35,233
And now here I am, freezing eggs

723
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,498
and asking strangers for help.

724
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,075
I feel like I'm...

725
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:55,380
I feel like I'm betraying him,

726
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,479
and I don't know
if it's worth it.

727
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,953
It's worth it.

728
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,922
<i>All right, let's do it. Turn on the
mic now. Turn on the mic now.</i>

729
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:13,596
<i>Don't you forget about me</i>

730
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:16,641
Reynolds.

731
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,207
<i>Don't you forget about me</i>

732
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:23,271
We should stop him before
he moves onto prog rock.

733
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,092
Yeah, I didn't even know
he could go that high.

734
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,642
I mean, that is...

735
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,749
And would you cancel
my chemo tomorrow?

736
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:35,157
I wanna try
precision-targeted therapy.

737
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,354
Clinical trials?

738
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,727
Mmm.

739
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:43,461
Chemo's gonna take
the life out of me, and I...

740
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,231
I wanna keep
running this hospital.

741
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:49,672
I want to be there for
Georgia and the baby.

742
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,605
Max, we had a plan.

743
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,247
I know, but I don't
want to be a patient.

744
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,306
I just want to be myself.

745
00:41:58,383 --> 00:41:59,874
It's too big a risk.

746
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:04,288
It's a risk I have to take.

747
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,722
<i>Ooh, child</i>

748
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,455
<i>Ooh, child</i>

749
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:21,497
<i>Ooh, child Things
will get easier</i>
