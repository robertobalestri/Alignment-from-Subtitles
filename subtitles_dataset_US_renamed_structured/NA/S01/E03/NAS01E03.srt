1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,636
31,252.

2
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,372
Is that how many
times the Dean called?

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,122
According to my Fitbit,
that's how many steps

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:14,705
it's taken to keep up with you.

5
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:17,113
Here. I don't want
another apple.

6
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,153
Also Dean of Medicine needs you.

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,930
Tell him I'm eating an apple.
You can tell him yourself.

8
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,320
I need to sustain my energy.

9
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,789
He's in your office.

10
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,487
Dean.

11
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:32,859
You're fired.

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,235
You're fired. Okay.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,038
I said you're fired.

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,511
And I said okay.

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,745
What do you mean, "Okay"?

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,078
Two months ago you were
practically begging me for this job.

17
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,721
A lot's changed in two months.

18
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,916
Two months ago this
country had health insurance.

19
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,187
Two months ago I was
still living with my wife.

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,572
Please don't tell me that you're
having a nervous breakdown,

21
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,173
because that's what
this sounds like to me.

22
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,689
Nope, this is just me
trying to help this hospital.

23
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,531
How can you say that
when you've eliminated

24
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:09,934
the cardiac surgery program,

25
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,835
you have gutted the
highest source of revenue

26
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,203
that this hospital produces...

27
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,818
Either I shut it down or the New
York Department of Health would have.

28
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,074
Max, you hired 50
new attendings. Fifty!

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,912
You cut the balls off my
residents, my training program.

30
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,609
Some of those
residents have ovaries.

31
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,163
And when people come to this
hospital, you know what they never say?

32
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,747
"I'm sick and dying, so
let me train your residents."

33
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,018
This is a job of
a lifetime, son.

34
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,527
This is the big leagues. And
you're just throwing it away.

35
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,873
You hired me to make changes.
That's right. My changes.

36
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,456
Your changes aren't working.

37
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,605
They haven't worked for
20 years. And you know that.

38
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,212
You must, otherwise you
wouldn't have hired me.

39
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,966
But you chose me,

40
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:49,032
because deep down, you care
about this place as much as I do.

41
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,080
When I hired you, I thought
that you would be grateful.

42
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,206
I am grateful.

43
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,578
I thought that you would be
compliant. I'm not compliant.

44
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,614
Yeah, that's for sure.

45
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,441
Well, I'm not gonna
make that mistake again.

46
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,314
And why are you wearing scrubs?

47
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,282
Because I'm a doctor.

48
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,223
If you fire me, you will
help save my marriage

49
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,391
and I will be
eternally grateful.

50
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,901
If you let me stay, I
will do everything I can

51
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,302
to save this hospital, and
you will get all the credit.

52
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,299
You have six months.
Give me three.

53
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:36,580
Maddy, I need to see you.

54
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,458
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

55
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,294
Maddy, I need you back.

56
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,524
I need to be with you.

57
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,164
Huh?

58
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,437
What time's the prisoner
coming in? Any minute.

59
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,047
Guys, we got a patient
from Rikers coming in,

60
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,619
so let's clear this area.

61
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,295
And let's lose any equipment
that might be weaponized.

62
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,127
Is a toothbrush weaponizable?

63
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,497
Oh, yeah, yeah, especially
in the war on tartar.

64
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,629
That's not the prisoner.

65
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,636
Cops found him in a
cemetery digging up a grave.

66
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,006
His vitals are normal,
but nothing else is.

67
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,477
Hey, what's your name, sir? Ray.

68
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:35,009
Hey, Ray. I'm Dr. Bloom. Would
you mind just, uh, looking at me?

69
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,049
I wasn't, uh, doing
anything wrong.

70
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,385
I've lost her.

71
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,879
Who?

72
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,315
Maddy.

73
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,321
My fiancée.

74
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,085
She's gone.

75
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,657
Everything's gone.

76
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:55,994
Let's, uh...

77
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,130
Let's clean him up
and run a tox screen.

78
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,264
And get psych down here.

79
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,171
Let's clear that
bay for the prisoner.

80
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,255
Dr. Bloom? That's me.

81
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,126
Where do you want her?

82
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,669
Max? I need you to sign these.

83
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,969
Wow. Am I being sued?

84
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,271
Every time you change
a rule, you need to sign.

85
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,573
Remind me to change that rule.

86
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,312
Wait. Where are you going?
The staff meeting's that way.

87
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,849
Right, but my wife is this way.

88
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,179
Max. Dr. Sharpe.

89
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,729
Max, we need to talk
about your treatment.

90
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:20,777
Not here, we don't.

91
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,265
How long do you think
you can keep this a secret?

92
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,313
Public hallway, Sharpe.

93
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,949
Before you even start chemo,
we have to take out your molars,

94
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,018
PEG insertion, IV ports
all over your body...

95
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,263
I know the drill. But
you're the patient now.

96
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,293
Exactly. "Physician,
heal thyself."

97
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,577
You do realize that
phrase is about a physician

98
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,036
who helps others
but not himself, right?

99
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,298
All right, bad example.

100
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,349
But I don't need you to be
my doctor because, you know,

101
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,466
I am a doctor.

102
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,186
I just need you to bounce
ideas off of, like a guide.

103
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,145
Or a Sherpa. A Sherpa?

104
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,044
Yeah. All right,
another bad example.

105
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,357
But just come on.
Roll with me here.

106
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,873
Have you told your wife? Uh, no.

107
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,484
Max. I couldn't.
She's on bed rest.

108
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,853
But as soon as she
feels better, I will tell her.

109
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,351
Hey, Max. Dr. Reynolds.

110
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,117
How's the department
search coming?

111
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,338
Excellent. We got three new
attendings coming in today.

112
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,728
Thank you. All great hires.

113
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,475
Hey, this is gonna be the most innovative
cardiac surgery department in the country.

114
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,523
That's what I wanna hear.

115
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,445
Just for the record, I
don't agree with this plan,

116
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,613
if you can even call it that.

117
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:13,903
Noted. Food for thought. See,
this dynamic is working already.

118
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,013
Morning. Perfect timing.

119
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,747
Really? What do you
need? Breakfast? Water?

120
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,014
My clothes.

121
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,586
They're releasing
me today. What?

122
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,086
That's good news, Max.

123
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,686
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

124
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,155
That's good.

125
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,661
That's good. It's just so soon.

126
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,036
Well, Suzanne says I'm ready.

127
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,766
Well, you can't go back
to the apartment alone.

128
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:50,935
I'm not.

129
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,278
I'm gonna go stay
at my folks' place.

130
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,276
In Connecticut?

131
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,918
I'm never gonna see you.

132
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,082
My mom is there.
And I need the help.

133
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,630
What? What, you
want me to stay here?

134
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:13,957
Yeah.

135
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,773
Max, you are the only person in
the world who actually likes hospitals.

136
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,212
Sorry to intrude. I know
I'm late for the staff meeting.

137
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,272
Actually, the Dean
just started without you.

138
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,083
<i>Arthur Ryland
was a great friend.</i>

139
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,651
He was a wonderful friend.

140
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,116
And not just to me,
but to this institution.

141
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,582
And I'm happy to report
that in his will he pledged

142
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:43,058
$10 million to our
network of hospitals.

143
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,596
But per his widow,

144
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,065
only one will get the money.

145
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,728
I gave Mrs. Ryland a tour
of University yesterday,

146
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,269
and she was very impressed,

147
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,002
but she still wants to
visit New Amsterdam.

148
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,472
As a teaching hospital, I
suspect she wants to see

149
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,602
how you make the sausage.

150
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,239
Sausage?

151
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,677
It's a figure of speech, Max.

152
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:11,782
She wants you to take her around.
So be charming. Just not too charming.

153
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,786
Right, because you've earmarked
her money for University?

154
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,091
Ah.

155
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,325
I'm aware of your
budgetary needs,

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,835
so if you go with me here,
the love will trickle down.

157
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,264
Is that clear? Crystal.

158
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,464
Good.

159
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,481
So who wants $10 million?

160
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,974
Uh, you missed
an important call?

161
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,790
Oh.

162
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:56,064
I was expecting one, but I'm
beginning to think it won't come.

163
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,869
Oh. Ghosted. That sucks.

164
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,637
Is that why it's
chocolate croissant day?

165
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,209
Like a furrowed brow pick-me-up?

166
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,909
I was not aware that I furrowed.

167
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,209
Well, we're always
the last to know.

168
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,917
Are you new here?

169
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,718
Two weeks. But I notice things.

170
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,831
Thank you. Bye.

171
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:33,167
Okay. Janelle, your blood
pressure is way too high.

172
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,100
You may be developing a
condition known as preeclampsia.

173
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,487
We're gonna send out for
some more tests to confirm, but...

174
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,535
What about my baby?

175
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,943
The baby's fine for now,
but we need to stay on this.

176
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,018
Hang one bag normal saline
and start magnesium sulfate

177
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,552
and a hydralazine drip
titrated to systolic under 140,

178
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,250
and send for a U/A ASAP.

179
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,837
You got it, Dr. Bloom.

180
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,927
Hey, uh, can we
take those off her?

181
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,393
Not in an unsecure area.

182
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,871
Well, look, the more she pulls,

183
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,533
the higher her blood
pressure's gonna go.

184
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,593
They're for your safety
as well as hers, ma'am.

185
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:07,196
Okay, look. I don't
really see a threat here.

186
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,801
I mean, what was her
crime? Felony robbery.

187
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,743
So, shoplifting?

188
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:15,572
I'll take responsibility, okay?

189
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,777
This is my ED. She's my
patient. But she's my prisoner.

190
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,821
Ray DeMarco?

191
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,119
I'm Dr. Iggy Frome.

192
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,090
So, I hear you've been
doing a little grave digging.

193
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:35,660
Naked.

194
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,305
I'm not judging.
Just, uh... Just asking.

195
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,008
I didn't wanna ruin the clothes.

196
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,246
Okay. Got it.

197
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,580
All right. Why don't you
tell me about Maddy?

198
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,518
She was my fiancée.

199
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,584
My best friend.

200
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,359
We were gonna get
married in a month.

201
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,769
So, um, to lose her like this...

202
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,496
All right, I'm sorry.

203
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,273
Your toxicology report
came back clean,

204
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,763
but you've been putting
something in your body, right?

205
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,144
The tracks on your arm?

206
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:23,941
What arm?

207
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,816
You feel that? No.

208
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,020
How about there?

209
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,958
Why would I feel anything?

210
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,565
I'm invisible.

211
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,241
Mrs. Ryland. Max Goodwin.

212
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,138
How do you do?
Thank you for coming.

213
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,776
I'm so sorry to hear
about your husband.

214
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,246
So, how much time do we
have? I've cleared the day.

215
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,034
Great, because I wanna introduce
you to all of our department heads.

216
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,321
When my husband
had his first heart attack,

217
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,587
the people here saved him.

218
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,718
Here?

219
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,195
The Dean wants Arthur's
money to go elsewhere, of course,

220
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,392
but the ultimate
decision is mine, so...

221
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,030
Lead on and we'll see
where providence takes us.

222
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,566
We're better than
Providence, too.

223
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,253
Well, if you spent
any time here,

224
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,508
you know that the
Dam is like a small city.

225
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,606
We have our own school, our
own court room, a medical library.

226
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,083
And you're new, correct?
Well, yeah. Five days.

227
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,120
So maybe I know more
about the place than you do.

228
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,554
Well, maybe more about where it's
been, but I can tell you where it's going.

229
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,122
Dr. Sharpe. This is Mrs. Ryland.

230
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,752
This is Dr. Sharpe,
our head of oncology.

231
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,024
Pleasure. What a radiant smile.

232
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,532
How do you keep it up?

233
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,124
Excuse me?

234
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,636
Billions of dollars spent on
cancer research and still no cure.

235
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,434
Oh.

236
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,373
Well, we've made
lots of strides.

237
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,238
But you're right.
Cancer is relentless.

238
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,571
And expensive.

239
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,896
Especially in this
new era of cost control.

240
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,205
We're constantly under water caring
for patients who can hardly afford it.

241
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,380
That's a Birkin, isn't it?

242
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:11,784
$15,000.

243
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,937
If you're having trouble
keeping your head above water,

244
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,486
that bag ought
to help you float.

245
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,326
There's a lot to see.

246
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,231
My shift is up. What's
going on? Candelario.

247
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,117
Okay, tell him we've
got a bleeder in bay two

248
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,737
and we've got a hip fracture awaiting
ortho consult for an ORIF in three.

249
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:33,979
Dr. Bloom, Janelle's
urine came back.

250
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,492
Protein's sky-high and her arm's
bruised where we took the blood pressure.

251
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,247
That's more than preeclampsia.
Okay, test her for HELLPS.

252
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,230
If we find it, then the baby's
gonna have to come out now.

253
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,054
- HELLPS?
- Blood not clotting.

254
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,461
She's terrified.
Candelario can handle it.

255
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,974
Candelario can handle
the ED. I'll stick with Janelle.

256
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,160
You've been on for
12. You're not allowed.

257
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,463
This is my own time.
And I need an OB.

258
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,827
On it.

259
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,525
You know, at first I thought
it was a schizophrenic break

260
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,859
triggered by the
death of his fiancée.

261
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,374
- Certainly possible.
- Excuse me.

262
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,365
Yeah, of course, but, uh,
now I'm super confused

263
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,320
because he can't feel his arms.

264
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,687
Any drugs in his system?

265
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,521
He's got tracks, but the tests
came back completely clean.

266
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,822
No ketamine, no PCP, nothing.

267
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,307
You know, there was a bit
of an odd anion gap in there,

268
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,492
so I ordered some more labs.

269
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,626
He needs an MRI. Agreed, Doctor.

270
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,068
But, uh, that is not
the weirdest part.

271
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,798
He thinks that he's invisible.

272
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,652
That's why he can't feel anything.
There's nothing there to feel.

273
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,702
Invisible? Invisible.

274
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,907
Ray?

275
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,411
Man might have a point.

276
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:58,157
He can't have gone too far. If
he's invisible, how would we know?

277
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,824
Oh, get it out of your
system. You done?

278
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,758
Hey, uh, Mason.

279
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,760
Listen, we got a runner.
Male, average build, mid-30s.

280
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,883
You want all exits covered? And
notification the minute you see him.

281
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,239
Assuming that's possible.

282
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,233
Would you stop?

283
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,904
What about Max's $10 million
woman? What about her?

284
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,860
Do you really want her to know there's
an escaped psych patient on the loose?

285
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,513
Uh, yeah, Mason, hey,
hold off on the PA, all right?

286
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,947
Let's go walkies only.
Old school. All right?

287
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,691
Thought we would swing through
pediatrics and then maybe stop by the ICU.

288
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,726
Can I get you a
water or a coffee?

289
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,189
I'm fine.

290
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,023
Some of our patients'
artwork. Kids?

291
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,927
Mmm-hmm. Our psych
department is second to none.

292
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,732
Some very interesting people
have come through those...

293
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,964
Doors.

294
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,277
Never know what
you're gonna see.

295
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,078
Mind if we record this?

296
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,087
We're meeting with
lots of potential doctors,

297
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,765
so we want to
remember everything.

298
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,224
Of course. Dr. Helen
doesn't mind cameras.

299
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,227
You're used to
it from TV, right?

300
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,623
So, Dr. Lalani recommended
you. Yeah, she thinks you're great.

301
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,330
Nasreen is a good friend.

302
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,264
And one of the best
internists in the city.

303
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,496
We've both seen you
on television, of course.

304
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,730
You're great there, too.

305
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,138
But we were both wondering
what your actual qualifications are.

306
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,177
My qualifications?
To practice for real.

307
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,440
Well...

308
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,309
Cambridge.

309
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,185
Cambridge School
of Clinical Medicine.

310
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:32,455
Foundation Doctor
and Specialty Registrar

311
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,357
at King's College
Hospital, London.

312
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:38,426
Additional residencies and fellowships
here at Columbia-Presbyterian.

313
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,866
Board-certified in adult and
pediatric hematology and oncology.

314
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,836
Wow. No wonder
she's so busy. Sorry?

315
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,433
We had a difficult time
getting an appointment.

316
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,174
Almost three weeks.

317
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,105
I apologize.

318
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,812
I've had a number of
outside commitments.

319
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:02,879
Dr. Lalani said your work was
going to be more patient-focused now.

320
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,185
My patients have
always come first.

321
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,157
But raising awareness for New
Amsterdam is a big part of my job as well.

322
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:12,988
Huh.

323
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,539
I'm gonna be
cutting back on press.

324
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,339
I'm sorry, Dr. Sharpe.
We're gonna need someone

325
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,815
who will put Anna's
needs first. Not the camera.

326
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,919
And how did your
husband end up here?

327
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,261
He was on his way to a meeting
downtown and had chest pains.

328
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,522
The driver brought him in.

329
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,996
And any issues after?

330
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,090
Besides having
another heart attack?

331
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,596
It wasn't the hospital's fault.

332
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,433
Arthur's mistresses were
steaks and cigars. Ah.

333
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,430
And money, of course.

334
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,220
Dr. Reynolds, I'd like
you to meet someone.

335
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,008
Mrs. Ryland, I presume.

336
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,773
Dr. Reynolds is our new
Chair of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

337
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,104
Ah. And you ladies are?

338
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,718
Dr. Hastings, Dr. Flores
and Dr. Jessup.

339
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,945
My new attendings.
Building the dream team.

340
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,852
You're all so...

341
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,756
Young? Uh... No, I
was going to say...

342
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,058
Excellent surgeons?

343
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,131
Because they all come with
glowing recommendations.

344
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,429
Yes, I'm sure. Is
Dr. Merritt around?

345
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,698
He's the one who
saved Arthur's life.

346
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,070
Dr. Merritt is actually
no longer working here.

347
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:29,867
Did he retire?

348
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,707
Well, he was let go.

349
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,237
By whom?

350
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,207
Uh, me.

351
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,577
Max, you're not
answering your pager.

352
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,796
Dr. Bloom, this
is... We need to talk.

353
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,947
Okay. Excuse me.

354
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,078
Right this way...

355
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,425
I am with... BLOOM: I
know, the money lady.

356
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,618
Yeah. I'm sorry.

357
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,370
I've got a pregnant
woman up in Corrections

358
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:51,262
who's got HELLP Syndrome
complicated by maternal seizures.

359
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,427
She needs to deliver her baby
ASAP or both are going to die.

360
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,625
How many weeks? Thirty-two.

361
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,069
Okay, so do it. Deliver.
She won't let us.

362
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,009
Excuse me. I have
to deal with something.

363
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,483
You got anything in your
pockets, put it on the belt.

364
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,147
Now, this might still be the
hospital, but these are real prisoners.

365
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,526
So keep your distance
for your own protection.

366
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,789
Yeah. Yeah, I keep hearing that.

367
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,041
Janelle.

368
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,359
I've got someone here
who wants to talk to you.

369
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,627
I don't need a shrink.

370
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,657
That's good, 'cause I'm not a
shrink. Just the medical director.

371
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,350
Max.

372
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,658
Dr. Bloom tells me
you're refusing treatment.

373
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,870
Janelle, your red blood
cells are breaking down.

374
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,668
And your liver is
barely functioning.

375
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,479
If you don't deliver this baby
now, you are both going to die.

376
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,705
I won't have her in prison.

377
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,863
I know what'll happen. The
same thing that happened to me.

378
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,312
Foster care.

379
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:27,659
Do you have anyone who could
take care of her until you're released?

380
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,923
Do you have any family?

381
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,555
No.

382
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,697
I get out in six weeks.

383
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,670
Can't you just do something
to keep her inside of me

384
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,818
for just six weeks, please?

385
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:41,672
You won't... You won't make it.

386
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,844
I gotta try. For
her. I'm gonna try.

387
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,047
Janelle, if you don't give
consent to deliver this baby,

388
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,880
the court is gonna
make you deliver.

389
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,471
And I don't wanna
put you through that.

390
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,783
So she loses either way?

391
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,225
No. I won't let that happen.

392
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,624
What does that mean?

393
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,127
It means

394
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:14,065
I will find a way to
take care of you both.

395
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,041
Okay?

396
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,149
There's always a way.

397
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,322
I'll, uh, call the OB.

398
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,075
We need blood. Two
units type and cross.

399
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,699
And FFP in case her
platelets bottom out.

400
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,818
I just don't know how much more
description you could possibly need.

401
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,001
Three people have seen the guy
running naked through the halls.

402
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,740
He's... He's a naked
man, for God's sake.

403
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:58,148
He's naked and he's
probably very distraught.

404
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,116
He just lost his
fiancée, so... Dr. Frome?

405
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:03,588
Yeah, what? I'm Maddy
Gianni. Ray DeMarco's fiancée.

406
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,958
Make yourself comfortable,
okay? Just sit tight. It's okay.

407
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,304
She looks quite healthy
for a dead person.

408
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,999
I mean, she's pretty upset,
but yeah, she's definitely alive.

409
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,434
So, why was Mr. DeMarco in
that cemetery? I have no idea.

410
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,537
She said a week ago
everything was fine, you know?

411
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,342
The love of her
life, and then boom.

412
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,043
He just drops out, stops taking
her calls, stops going to work...

413
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,949
Disappears? Oh, my God.

414
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,219
So, when did she last see him?

415
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,286
You asking me
genuinely? Two days ago.

416
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,936
The only reason she
even knew he was here

417
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,804
was 'cause the cops found
his wallet and they called her.

418
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,696
Did you happen to mention that
the love of her life has gone missing?

419
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,892
Uh, I was kinda hoping
that you might cover that.

420
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,545
Okay, Mr. DeMarco's
tox labs are in.

421
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,021
Did the woman say
anything about drug use?

422
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,848
Mmm-mmm. She swears he was
clean, but Ray definitely had track marks.

423
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,080
He injected something.

424
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:11,089
Indeed. Trace amounts
of glutaraldehyde.

425
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,089
Mmm. Glutaraldehyde.

426
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,059
I don't know what that is.

427
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,028
Did the man actually say
that his fiancée was dead?

428
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,532
Well, I don't know if he
used that word exactly,

429
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,319
but he was going on
about her in past tense,

430
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,667
and how he lost her, and he was
digging up a grave, let's not forget.

431
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,264
The common name for
glutaraldehyde is embalming fluid.

432
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,535
Oh, holy hell.

433
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,406
He wasn't digging up her
grave. He was digging his own.

434
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,956
Yeah, because he doesn't
think that his fiancée is dead but...

435
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,076
He thinks he is.

436
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,684
I think I know where he is.

437
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,721
Well...

438
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,760
Okay, out you get.

439
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,436
You're killing me, Ray.

440
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,770
Yeah, Dr. Max Goodwin.

441
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,901
I'm the Medical Director at
New Amsterdam Hospital.

442
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,036
You're dressed.

443
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,477
I'm leaving. Now?

444
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,603
Later.

445
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,918
I need to talk to the
Mayor about a patient

446
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:15,113
in the corrections
ward. Yes, a prisoner.

447
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,780
Were you even gonna
say goodbye? Of course.

448
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,919
And my folks said you can come
up every weekend if you want.

449
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,085
I Don't. I don't want.

450
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,830
Yes, the Mayor can call me back.

451
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,231
Just please tell him it has
to be very soon. Thank you.

452
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,136
You're talking to the Mayor?

453
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,101
I'm very powerful.

454
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:39,776
Please don't go.

455
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,681
I would need a bigger room.

456
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:46,780
We have the President's suite.
For the, you know, President.

457
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:49,913
Max, you belong here, not me.

458
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,353
I belong with you.

459
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,526
We tried that. And I
messed it up. I know.

460
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:02,124
But I broke a lot of promises, and
I'm just trying not to break any more.

461
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,493
I know.

462
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,963
And I do love you.

463
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,836
To my core.

464
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:16,611
But this is what has to
happen, and I'm okay with it now.

465
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,546
And Luna will be, too.

466
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,552
And when you come to
Connecticut, we'll all be together.

467
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,090
I hate Connecticut.

468
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,324
Yeah. Yes.

469
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,721
Go. Go.

470
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,699
Mr. Mayor, um, sorry to
bother you, but this is important.

471
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,793
Uh, if you just have...

472
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,832
Hey. Hi.

473
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:45,571
Nice bag. You want it?

474
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:47,702
Rough day?

475
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:51,578
Just the ongoing discovery
that the world thinks I'm a fraud.

476
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,819
Well, I kinda doubt that.

477
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:58,085
Seems my outside commitments
have relieved me of all credibility.

478
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,387
This was a gift, by the way.

479
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,719
Hey, look, I get that you're
upset, but you're amazing.

480
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:07,258
You're an excellent physician and you've
raised a ton of money for this place.

481
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:10,232
Patients don't care about
that. Nor should they.

482
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,147
They just want a
doctor they can trust,

483
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,333
and right now, Dr. Helen
isn't worth trusting.

484
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,813
Then tell them why they should.

485
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,372
Oh, hey, uh, can I
really have that bag?

486
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,407
Piss off.

487
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,845
Embalming fluid?

488
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,197
Yeah, we believe that Ray
is suffering from something

489
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,416
called Cotard's syndrome.

490
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:33,936
It's a rare disease where the victim
actually believes that they've passed on.

491
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:38,463
Sometimes as a result, they can
imagine that they can't be seen.

492
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:40,457
Like a ghost.

493
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,898
Ray thinks he's dead?

494
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:46,968
But he's talking.
Dead people don't talk.

495
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,902
It's not logical.

496
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,634
It's delusional.

497
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,708
Well, why can't
he feel his arms?

498
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,876
Well, we don't know yet,
but Dr. Kapoor is giving him

499
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,440
an MRI as we speak,
so he's in good hands.

500
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,879
Hey.

501
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,314
You know...

502
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,227
You know, the, um,
the good news is,

503
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,925
um, that lack of feeling
could be neurological.

504
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:16,419
Cotard's wouldn't cause that,
and neither would embalming fluid.

505
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,233
I think you and I have a very
different idea of good news.

506
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,186
Okay, what do we got?

507
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,417
Tumor?

508
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,521
The pressure from which
is causing him delusions.

509
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,494
Out-of-body feeling.

510
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,423
Numbness.

511
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,628
So, while Mr. DeMarco
is certainly not dead,

512
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,530
he may well be soon.

513
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,937
Oh.

514
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,642
Doctor. Doctor.

515
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:02,840
Where are you racing to?

516
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,110
Correctional ward. I've
got a baby on the way.

517
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,516
Oh, nice. Hopefully.

518
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,930
I see you're putting
together quite the team.

519
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:10,786
Uh-huh. Any future
wives in the mix?

520
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,359
Oh, man. What?

521
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,624
All these women have
better resumes than we do.

522
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,161
I'd expect nothing less. I
just... I couldn't help but notice...

523
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,458
Right, right.

524
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,365
Everybody notices something,

525
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,061
but nobody says anything.

526
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,836
So please, just say it.

527
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,673
I was gonna say how
attractive they all are.

528
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,873
Didn't stop you
from getting hired.

529
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,909
Don't make this about me.

530
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,644
No, but it is.

531
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,527
Look, you ought to
know more than anyone

532
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,629
how often women are
overlooked for surgical positions.

533
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:42,677
A lot.

534
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,189
Only 19% of the surgeons
in this country are women.

535
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,053
I mean, I didn't know
the exact statistic.

536
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,879
You wanna hear the
stats for women of color?

537
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,393
I'm scared to ask.

538
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,023
They don't exist.

539
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,263
So, while I intend to hire folks

540
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,599
of every ethnicity and
gender for my staff,

541
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,036
I'm hiring women of color first.

542
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,110
I believe this is you.

543
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,286
Mr. Mayor, I understand.

544
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,857
I was just hoping that
in this particular case,

545
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,359
you might make an exception
for a pregnant young woman

546
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,689
six weeks from being...

547
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,062
Thank you for calling back.

548
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:27,889
Okay.

549
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,393
Mrs. Ryland. Hello, Max.

550
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,680
I'm surprised you're still here.

551
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,468
I told you I cleared the day.

552
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,764
Yeah, but...

553
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,139
The Dean sent a copy of
some plans he had drawn.

554
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,712
Would you like to
see them? Why not?

555
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,378
Oh, wow.

556
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:50,613
"Arthur Ryland Heart Institute."

557
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,581
At University Hospital.

558
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,593
State-of-the-art facility.
Arthur's name in big gold letters.

559
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:02,765
Tell me something, Max.
Why did you fire Dr. Merritt?

560
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,969
'Cause he only
cared about money.

561
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,073
Just like my husband.

562
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,906
I think the gold letters
are garish and vulgar.

563
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:20,779
But it's exactly what
Arthur would have wanted.

564
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:27,820
Mrs. Ryland, what do you want?

565
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,341
Fresh bag normal
saline, running open wide.

566
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,143
Okay, cephalic
presentation. Anterior position.

567
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,967
Crowning now. I
can't feel anything.

568
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,780
Okay, gotta get
through to the neck.

569
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,830
Now, nuchal cord.
Just hold my hand.

570
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,163
Excellent.

571
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,438
- And clear.
- Easy now.

572
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,845
- Shoulders in position.
- Right, right.

573
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:47,969
Just a little twist.

574
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:52,708
And we have a newborn baby.

575
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,944
Baby girl.

576
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,633
Moving all four extremities.

577
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,124
She looks really good.

578
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,714
They're just gonna
take her over there.

579
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,026
Gonna wash her up. How
are you feeling? Are you okay?

580
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,190
Mmm-hmm.

581
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,562
Okay? I'm tired.

582
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,178
Look how beautiful she is.

583
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,248
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

584
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,157
Your friend said that
he would find a way

585
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,525
for us to be together
and to take care of us.

586
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,023
He's working on it.

587
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,421
No, no, no,

588
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,524
but my baby's already
here. She's already here.

589
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,031
I just can't...

590
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,706
Just hold her. No one's
taking her right now.

591
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:52,040
I can't. She's already
here. Where is he?

592
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,046
Janelle, no one's
gonna take her right now.

593
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,049
No, no, no, but
I can't. I can't.

594
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,676
I can't take her.
Janelle, listen to me.

595
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:01,947
No, I have to
give her up. I can't.

596
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,022
I can't. I won't.

597
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,034
We never had
children, Arthur and I.

598
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:27,045
I wanted them, of
course. He said he did, too.

599
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,449
But after we got married,
he changed his mind.

600
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,338
I shouldn't have
let that happen.

601
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:43,890
What is this?

602
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,321
We call it Kangaroo Care.

603
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,463
Instead of
traditional incubators,

604
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:52,504
these volunteers provide low
birthweight premies with human contact.

605
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,462
Skin-to-skin.

606
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:59,634
And, um, I think
that one right there

607
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:00,768
was just born.

608
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,578
She's so small. Yeah.

609
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,311
Will she be all right?

610
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,922
Mrs. Ryland, what
if... What if instead of

611
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,195
giving your husband's money
to University or New Amsterdam,

612
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,428
you gave it to someplace
else altogether?

613
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,865
There wouldn't be a fancy building
with your husband's name on it,

614
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:32,467
but your contribution could potentially
change the course of hundreds,

615
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,343
if not thousands, of lives.

616
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,652
<i>Rikers Island?</i>

617
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,356
You wanna give $10
million to Rikers Island?

618
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,200
The Ryland Endowment would
be used to convert unused space

619
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,997
to a nursery and
Kangaroo Care unit.

620
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,115
This would allow incarcerated
mothers to keep their newborns close

621
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,499
while they complete
their sentence.

622
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,409
And even though the unit
itself won't be ready for weeks,

623
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,038
they can designate a room
and start the program today.

624
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,180
With Janelle Mason. Max...

625
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,681
I've already spoken to the warden,
and there is no law against doing this.

626
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,255
The only thing
required is... Is money.

627
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,221
Unlike us, Rikers needs money.

628
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,929
Do you really believe that
Arthur would want this?

629
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,527
No. But I do.

630
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,902
Isn't our job to provide our
patients with the best possible care?

631
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,840
I know very well
what our job is.

632
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:43,114
But isn't it also to help people out
in the world not become patients?

633
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,212
Even if the system is broken,
we can offer them a path.

634
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,583
Because if we don't,
we are just gonna see

635
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,386
each generation back
here again and again.

636
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,792
Babies returning with
obesity before the age of six.

637
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,962
Foster kids coming back as psych
patients before they can even vote.

638
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,297
So we need to break the chain.

639
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:08,738
But we can only help people if we
ourselves are willing to take risks.

640
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:15,806
'Cause change
is always possible.

641
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:21,209
I'm sorry, Peter. I know you
wanted a different outcome.

642
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:25,819
And Max tried to honor
that. But this was all me.

643
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,930
Yeah, well, thank you
for your contribution.

644
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,270
Janelle?

645
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:55,110
When you go back, your
baby's going with you.

646
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,161
<i>One night to be confused</i>

647
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,792
<i>One night to speed up truth</i>

648
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,498
<i>We had a promise made</i>

649
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:16,268
<i>Four hands and then away</i>

650
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,367
<i>Both under influence</i>

651
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,638
We're starting Ray
on a steroid to relieve

652
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,822
the pressure from the tumor,

653
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,042
and by tomorrow, his
delusion should be gone.

654
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:27,817
And the tumor itself?
With time, treatable.

655
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,552
<i>To call for hands of above</i>

656
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,455
<i>To lean on</i>

657
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:38,224
<i>Wouldn't be good enough</i>

658
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,628
<i>For me no</i>

659
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,894
What did they say?

660
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:47,635
That tomorrow, they're
gonna bring you back to life.

661
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,671
<i>The start, a simple touch</i>

662
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:53,974
<i>One night to push and scream</i>

663
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,344
<i>And then relief</i>

664
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,077
<i>Ten days of perfect tunes</i>

665
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:01,312
<i>The colors red and blue</i>

666
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,818
<i>We had a promise made</i>

667
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,981
Excuse me.

668
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,685
<i>We were in love</i>

669
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,160
What does "ghosted" mean?

670
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:17,034
Oh, that's when someone, uh, that
you love disappears from your life.

671
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,163
Who ghosted you?

672
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,499
My son.

673
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,015
But I think I ghosted him first.

674
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:37,050
<i>And you, you knew
the hand of the devil</i>

675
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:44,361
<i>And you</i>

676
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,866
<i>To call for hands of above</i>

677
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,628
<i>To lean on</i>

678
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:53,136
<i>Wouldn't be good enough</i>

679
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,139
<i>For me no</i>

680
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,267
<i>To call for hands of above</i>

681
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,436
<i>To lean on</i>

682
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:05,142
<i>Wouldn't be good enough</i>

683
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,458
Dr. Sharpe, I need you to...

684
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:16,398
Do you have any idea how long people
wait to get an appointment with me?

685
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,554
Sorry, what?

686
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,723
I'm an excellent
physician. Yeah.

687
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,259
An extraordinary physician.

688
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,399
And I have a radiant smile.

689
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,935
Okay, can you let me finish?

690
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,596
No, can you let me finish?

691
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,384
If you don't have
faith in my abilities,

692
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,343
if you can't say, "I need
you to be my doctor,"

693
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,388
then you're making a mistake
that could cost you your life.

694
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,903
I need you to be my doctor.

695
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:43,582
I wanna be a father.

696
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,250
And I wanna be a husband.

697
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,621
So I'm putting my life

698
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:54,622
in your hands.

699
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,631
I won't bargain with you, Max.

700
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,767
I know. I won't negotiate.

701
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,168
I'm all in.

702
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,808
Whatever you say, I'll do
it. Just please, be my doctor.

703
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:23,293
How much time do I have before
the, uh, chemo and radiation?

704
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,454
Three weeks.

705
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,324
And is there any way
that we could kind of...

706
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,458
Max. I'm just kidding.

707
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,398
Three weeks.

708
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:35,631
Okay.

709
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:41,879
If you'll excuse me, I
don't have a lot of time.

710
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,915
Where's Georgia? Discharged.

711
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,757
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

712
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,405
I'm not letting
you do this, okay?

713
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,709
You're not going to Connecticut.

714
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,458
We're not there yet.

715
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:39,128
I know, but she is,
Georgia. She's there. Here.

716
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:41,536
Our daughter is almost here.

717
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:46,436
And the first thing that she's gonna
see in this world is your beautiful face.

718
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,607
She's gonna love
you like I love you,

719
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:53,107
and then maybe after
a really, really long look,

720
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,716
she is gonna turn
and look for me.

721
00:40:55,787 --> 00:41:00,157
And if I'm not there, she is
gonna wonder where I am.

722
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:02,051
Where did I go?

723
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,062
She knows my voice.

724
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,493
Georgia, she knows my voice.

725
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,000
I have to be there.

726
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,067
I have to be here.

727
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:22,505
Let me... Let me take you home.

728
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,772
Let me take care
of you both, please.

729
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,340
In our house. Let me help you.

730
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,644
Because if I can't help

731
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,948
my wife and my daughter, then...

732
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,792
And... And if it's
really not working,

733
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,189
say the word and I promise

734
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:44,030
I will drive you to
Connecticut myself.

735
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,147
Okay. Great.

736
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,480
Okay. Okay.

737
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:12,564
I'm gonna be a father.
I'm gonna be a father!

738
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,221
That's my wife.

739
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:15,694
It's all right.

740
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:17,500
I'm gonna be a father!
