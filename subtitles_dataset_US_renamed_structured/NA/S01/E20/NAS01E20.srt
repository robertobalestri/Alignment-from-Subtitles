1
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,232
Mom?

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,701
Mom?

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,437
Next Tuesday's fine.

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,591
Let's do that. - Yeah.

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,095
Keep him on the leash, honey.

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,881
Thank you.

7
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,781
Mom!

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,584
Mom?

9
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,055
Mom!

10
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,929
Shh, shh... It's okay, honey.

11
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,629
It's okay. How can I help?

12
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,724
I can't find my mom.

13
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,070
I don't know where
she went. It's okay.

14
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,627
We'll find her.
What's your name?

15
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,471
Luna. Luna.

16
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,434
That's a pretty name.

17
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,909
What about your dad?
Do you know where he is?

18
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,202
I don't have a dad.

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,714
My dad died.

20
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,626
All right, I've got two infinity pools,
I got a swim-up Jacuzzi, and this?

21
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,364
This is where the
Millennium Falcon lands.

22
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,495
So...

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,899
What?

24
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,567
No, Jeffrey, it's, it's great.

25
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,676
It's just, it's safe to say
you followed the letter

26
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,579
of the exercise and
perhaps not the spirit.

27
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,014
I mean, you said
envision our futures, right?

28
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,575
- Well, y'all, this is mine.
- Yes, Jeffrey.

29
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,655
It's just, your future
contains a few more

30
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,850
two-piece bathing suits than
I had anticipated. That's all.

31
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,352
Can I go next, Dr. Frome?
Yes, Avi, please.

32
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,904
Talk us through your
vision of your future.

33
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,260
Jeffrey, it's fantastic.

34
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,558
Thanks.

35
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,024
Okay, so right here is
Parthenon in Athens.

36
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,502
I'm gonna go after I learn
some Greek, you know?

37
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,732
So I can speak to the locals.

38
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,418
I hate that everybody just
assume that everybody's

39
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,719
just gonna speak
English, you know?

40
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,177
That's smart.

41
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,508
And this?

42
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,241
This is Table
Mountain in Cape Town.

43
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,712
One day I'm gonna hike it.

44
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,885
Right to the top.

45
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,880
What drew you to Cape Town?

46
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,084
I guess I just, you know,
want to see the world.

47
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,191
Go places I never been before.

48
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,196
I mean, come on.
Look at that view.

49
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,396
That's spectacular.
It's beautiful.

50
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,027
It is, Avi. Fantastic, truly.

51
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,596
Now, guys, it is more than fine
to look forward to material things...

52
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,608
Yeah. Yes.

53
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,406
But... But sometimes

54
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,879
goals are stronger when
they affect who we are.

55
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,472
You know what I mean?

56
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,150
Iggy. Yes.

57
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,411
You have a visitor.

58
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,545
Ah... It's my new Jet Ski.

59
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,752
Guys, keep filling out your
vision boards. I will be right back.

60
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,795
And Jeffrey, ease off the
swimsuit models. Thank you.

61
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,489
Hi. Hi.

62
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,294
Tiara Dobbs. Avi
Mantell's social worker.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,811
It's good to finally
meet you in person.

64
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,098
Yeah, likewise.

65
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,228
So, what brings you down

66
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,829
to our neck of the woods today?

67
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,499
Avi's mother's been
offered a job in Missouri,

68
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,339
her hometown, and she
can't pass it up... Mmm.

69
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,222
So she's gonna be moving
back there next week.

70
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,839
Oh, wow!

71
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,314
With Avi, obviously.

72
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,440
Yes.

73
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:15,353
I've reviewed Avi's case and it appears
that he has made huge strides with you,

74
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,947
so I can't think of any
reason that he can't transfer

75
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,654
from inpatient care to weekly
visits with a local therapist.

76
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,663
I just need you to sign off

77
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,860
so I can begin Avi's
official discharge procedure.

78
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,834
Unless you don't agree.

79
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,370
Uh, I did. I did have

80
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,475
a pretty huge breakthrough
with him recently.

81
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,839
Well, that's certainly
good to hear. Yeah, it is.

82
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,846
Yes, I think that Avi is
ready for the next step.

83
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:45,780
Wonderful. Okay.

84
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,980
I'll tell Avi to
pack his things.

85
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,318
What is so funny?

86
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,623
I've just discovered that New
Amsterdam has a listing on Yelp.

87
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,855
"Yelp"?

88
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,774
Yeah, you know, where
people post online reviews

89
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,199
about places they love, things
they hate, their experiences.

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,293
Oh, like Facebook
but on the internet.

91
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,805
Yes, exactly.

92
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,535
Listen to this: it was
posted two minutes ago

93
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,133
by @NancyPants.

94
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,809
"The rooms at New Amsterdam are freezing,
the lights are horrifically bright,

95
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,679
"and the only thing
older than this mattress

96
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,049
"is my bald doctor who can
never seem to find his glasses.

97
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,711
"One star."

98
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,546
Let me see this.

99
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,856
I know this patient.

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,256
This is Nancy Nan.

101
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,153
She's doing a
sleep study with me.

102
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,993
One star, Vijay. Ouch. One star?

103
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,332
That's absurd. All she
has to do is to sleep.

104
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,763
I'm joking. Don't
worry about it.

105
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,876
Forty-plus years of practice
and an expert in my field of study.

106
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,742
I should be able to
do better than one star.

107
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,047
We shall see about this. Vijay.

108
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,948
My phone and your glasses.

109
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,412
Yeah.

110
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,622
Nice cap, Williamsburg.

111
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,528
When does your artisan
pickle shop open up?

112
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,296
Proud of 'em? I'm
proud of all of them.

113
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,595
So, today's schedule
isn't too terrible.

114
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,106
Fist up: Quarterly
Allocation Review Committee.

115
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,937
Pass. You can't really pass.

116
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,002
No? Watch me. I'm skipping
that redundant meeting.

117
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,137
What's next?

118
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,545
Then there's a new pharma
vendor show-and-tell.

119
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,948
Pass. Okay.

120
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,452
The Board requested
your presence

121
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,545
at the Strategic Objective
Luncheon in Midtown.

122
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,386
Pass. Next? Max...

123
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,925
Pass. Next?

124
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,202
Police commissioner
called again.

125
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,605
I'm guessing it has to do with
what happened to Officer McNeil.

126
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,222
Yeah, hard pass.

127
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,429
Max. No.

128
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,143
There's not a single essential
meeting on that entire list.

129
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,068
They're all just arbitrary,

130
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,163
and I'm not wasting any
more time on arbitrary.

131
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,831
Well, what... Well,
now that you've cleared

132
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,753
your entire schedule,
what do you intend to do...

133
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,747
I don't know, something that matters.
You know, something worth my time.

134
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,406
Maybe something life and death.

135
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,283
What was that all about?

136
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,687
He's in a mood.

137
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,116
It's okay, honey.

138
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,319
Whoa, whoa.

139
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,261
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

140
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,829
What the hell happened in here?

141
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,094
You might want to ask him.

142
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,976
Okay, I got this.

143
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,342
It just came out of
nowhere. It's okay.

144
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,175
All right, let's go.

145
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,614
That was your vision board, bud.

146
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,819
What's going on?
I'm not going nowhere!

147
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:40,986
Avi...

148
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,130
You're gonna do great today.

149
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,475
I've been to plenty of morbidity
and mortality conferences.

150
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,058
Just never had to lead one.

151
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:51,830
Well, you're my chief resident
now. It comes with the job title.

152
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,046
Been going over your case
and it sounded just awful.

153
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,675
Officer McNeil
just bled out so fast.

154
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,139
Yes.

155
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,506
I'm sorry, Dr. Reynolds.

156
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,348
So am I.

157
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,861
Look, I just want you to
know I'm not gonna throw you

158
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,196
under the bus or anything
during this discussion.

159
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,849
No, no, no. Look, M&Ms
are not about blame, all right?

160
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,084
They're a teaching tool.

161
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,135
We come together to see
if our actions contributed

162
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,492
to the patient's death, so we
never repeat those mistakes.

163
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,807
But that's just the thing. I've
been preparing this for days.

164
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,975
I haven't found any mistakes.

165
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,558
Hey, that can
happen, too, all right?

166
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,704
But we still study the case so
we vow to do better the next time.

167
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,829
That's it.

168
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,898
Today's case is a white
40-year-old female trauma patient.

169
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,841
She initially presented with...

170
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,749
Go ahead.

171
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,022
The patient presented
with a fractured femur,

172
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,887
cervical and
thoracic abrasions...

173
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,018
Was Officer McNeil
on any medications?

174
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,289
She was on

175
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,593
low-dose birth control.

176
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,371
Twenty-five
minutes post arrival...

177
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,908
Did Officer McNeil have
a history of heart disease?

178
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,908
Uh...

179
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,138
No, the patient did not.

180
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,245
We all know you're talking about
Officer McNeil, Dr. Nottingham.

181
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,717
No need for anonymity.

182
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,883
Okay.

183
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,587
Um...

184
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,926
Twenty-five minutes post
arrival, Officer McNeil developed

185
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,053
a pneumomediastinum,
necessitating...

186
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,654
Before the pneumomediastinum,
were there any other signs

187
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,233
in her vitals that could have
predicted her eventual death?

188
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,102
Not that I'm aware of.

189
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,764
Hmm. What did Officer McNeil
look like as she went into surgery?

190
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,241
I don't know. You don't know?

191
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:38,942
I wasn't there.

192
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,675
You weren't there.

193
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,312
Well, if we have any hope of
getting some real answers today,

194
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,183
then we need someone
presenting this case

195
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,156
who was actually there.

196
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,456
Dr. Reynolds?

197
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,965
She was your patient, right?

198
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,527
Yes, she was.

199
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,629
Hmm. So you would have the
most salient information on this case.

200
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,505
I think Nottingham is providing
an accurate case review.

201
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:15,848
Hmm. Indeed. But, to really
get to the bottom of how she died,

202
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,714
don't you think that you
might be better qualified

203
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,446
to lead this discussion?

204
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,481
If it's not too much trouble.

205
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,494
Okay. Let's go to the
chest X-ray first. Okay, good.

206
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,231
All right.

207
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,198
So here we have Marie
McNeil's chest X-ray.

208
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,833
You will notice the mediastinum.

209
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,345
It measures just over
nine centimeters in length.

210
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,813
Now, Dr. Nottingham,
can you give us the criteria

211
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,214
for pathological widening?

212
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,410
Eight centimeters
on a supine AP chest.

213
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,648
Very good. We have met the
criteria for pathological widening.

214
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,590
If we take a closer look
right about here... See that?

215
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,019
Air bubbles.

216
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,063
That's the cause for the
widened mediastinum.

217
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,859
Now, that's actually caused
by tears in the esophagus

218
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,333
called Boerhaave
syndrome, all right?

219
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,164
And also of note:

220
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,569
normal pulmonary parenchyma

221
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,573
and normal cardiac silhouette.

222
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,101
Next.

223
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,005
Wait, go back to
the chest X-ray.

224
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,384
You said cardiac
silhouette was normal?

225
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,612
Yes.

226
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,850
But the chest X-ray is
a rather blunt instrument

227
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,084
for examining something as
delicate as the human heart,

228
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,458
wouldn't you say?

229
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,587
So what other
modalities did you use?

230
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,932
An EKG and a transthoracic echocardiogram,
both of which came back normal.

231
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,727
Good. Can we see those?

232
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,067
Dr. Nottingham
didn't include them

233
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,080
in today's presentation
because they were normal.

234
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:58,380
Well, I can't tell if they were
normal if I can't see them for myself.

235
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,413
Well, I don't have them here.

236
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,482
No?

237
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,426
The entire purpose of an
M&M is to analyze the data

238
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:12,932
to ensure that if mistakes were made
those mistakes will not be made again.

239
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,991
It is particularly difficult
to analyze that data

240
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,400
when that data isn't here.

241
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,736
So why don't we take a brief recess
to allow Dr. Reynolds to compile

242
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:24,801
all the necessary cardiac data.

243
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,190
Why are you moving me?

244
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,986
I honestly have no idea.

245
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,152
To get better results
on your sleep study

246
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,254
we wish for you to
have a warmer room

247
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,425
with better lighting and
much, much softer bed.

248
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,798
Okay.

249
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,467
Uh, hello. What's
up with the lamp?

250
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,200
Uh, we're moving this
patient to a nicer room

251
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,674
for some random reason.

252
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,308
What? No.

253
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,971
We have a reason.

254
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,406
The reason is
because we are trying

255
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,144
to provide Ms. Nan with the
most comfortable care here

256
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,982
in the New Amsterdam
because patient comes first.

257
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,213
Right?

258
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,148
Yes.

259
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,691
Yes.

260
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,124
Finally, someone
who gets it. Thank you.

261
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,525
You are welcome. Yeah.

262
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,460
We gotta go the
extra mile, you know?

263
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,964
Our patients do come first.

264
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,509
I mean, this is what
I've been saying.

265
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,211
You know, these people
depend on us for care.

266
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,204
They put their very
lives in our hands.

267
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,333
My boyfriend just
hates my snoring.

268
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,000
You know, we can do better.

269
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,806
We can do better than just
provide her with comfortable care.

270
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,141
We can? Yeah.

271
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,011
How would Ms. Nan like a
stay in our Presidential Suite?

272
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,847
I imagine she would
like that very much.

273
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,478
Yes, thank you. Mmm-hmm, good.

274
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,681
Okay.

275
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,085
Come on, before
he changes his mind.

276
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,526
Hurry up.

277
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,660
Why does she have to be here?

278
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,431
Ms. Dobbs and I are
both your advocates, Avi.

279
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,934
She's part of the team.
I don't have a team.

280
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,754
You don't. You have
an entire network.

281
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,406
Me, Ms. Dobbs, your mother.

282
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,846
The All Stars, man, you know?

283
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,356
Everyone wants to
see your transition

284
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,861
to life outside of the
hospital go smoothly.

285
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,855
I'm too big of a freak to be in
the real world with normal people.

286
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,766
What is... What are you
doing? Time out, time out.

287
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,726
You know full well on this ward
we don't use words like freak.

288
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,858
"Real world," "normal,"
whatever that is.

289
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,355
All right?

290
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,830
Those are day-one
ground rules, Avi.

291
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,560
Come on.

292
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,030
I think you're breaking the rules
on purpose. That's my theory.

293
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,636
I think you're scared
of what's to come.

294
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,202
You're scared of these changes,

295
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,291
so you think if you act out
now you can get out in front of it

296
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,943
and stop these
changes from happening.

297
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,652
Talk to us.

298
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,982
When they kicked me out of school,
I didn't care where they sent me.

299
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,827
I didn't care about anything.

300
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,627
It was like, whatever.

301
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,297
But then...

302
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,924
Yeah?

303
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,603
Things just got better here.

304
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,333
That's right.

305
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,272
Things were starting
to make sense.

306
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,110
I felt like I belonged here.

307
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,408
But now that I'm starting
to get the hang of it,

308
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,244
my mom is trying
to ruin my life again.

309
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,319
No one... No one is
ruining your life, Avi.

310
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,423
I don't even think
anyone has that power.

311
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,122
All right? You put in the work.

312
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,287
You learned the tools.
You can cope anywhere.

313
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,763
Even Missouri.

314
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,759
How do you know?

315
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,598
Just listen to me, okay?

316
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,963
'Cause I'm good at what I do.

317
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,264
I can promise you this:

318
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,008
you are ready.

319
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,779
He is not ready. What?

320
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,617
Were we both in
the same session?

321
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,654
Avi accused his mother

322
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,882
of ruining his life again.

323
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,013
And?

324
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,286
Avi was admitted for a
serious outburst at school.

325
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,104
Kids were teasing him
over his learning disability,

326
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,705
but it had nothing
to do with his mother.

327
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,822
What are you saying?

328
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,417
I'm saying whatever's
going on with him

329
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,010
was triggered only once
he learned he was leaving.

330
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,162
Avi's mother can't just
change her travel plans.

331
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,702
Her new job is expecting
her there on Monday.

332
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,569
I need more time with him.

333
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:19,669
Dr. Frome, his discharge
paperwork has been filed.

334
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,577
I know. I know.

335
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,744
Just let me talk to him.

336
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,211
Alone.

337
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,206
Let me see if I can
get through to him.

338
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,751
That's it.

339
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,935
Thank you.

340
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,102
Oh, um, Dr. Kao?

341
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,367
How do you spell your last name?

342
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,273
Uh... K-A-O.

343
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,377
"Dr. Agnes Kao..."

344
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,783
Thomas Jefferson once
stayed in our Presidential Suite.

345
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,227
Is that right? Mmm-hmm.

346
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:12,194
This room has housed the architect
of the Declaration of Independence.

347
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,126
And now @NancyPants from Yelp.

348
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,294
I know how this looks.

349
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,872
Yeah, I feel like if you did,

350
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,717
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

351
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,232
This was not my idea, I swear.

352
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,039
It was Max's. Hold on.

353
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,246
The ludicrous
coddling of Nancy Nan,

354
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,441
a woman who isn't even
sick, came from Max?

355
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,778
Yes.

356
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,478
And if his error in judgment
leads to an enhancement

357
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,111
of my online status,

358
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,722
well, this is just a
happy coincidence.

359
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,120
Did Max seem
like himself to you?

360
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,760
He seemed erratic.

361
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,100
Annoyed, then
excited, then distracted,

362
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,498
all in quick succession.

363
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,265
And if it was anyone but
Max, I would have got worried.

364
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,904
Should I be worried?

365
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,343
Aw... She found the fizzy water.

366
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,019
Brought everything I could find.

367
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,029
Action logs, nursing
notes, imaging studies.

368
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,294
And here are those
ultrasounds. Good work.

369
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:22,945
I'm sorry about
this, Dr. Reynolds.

370
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,447
I didn't really expect Dr. Goodman
would want to see every last scan.

371
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,530
It's not your fault.

372
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,199
This level of due
diligence is extreme.

373
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,601
That's one way to put it.

374
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,703
But my work on Officer
McNeil was solid, you know?

375
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,715
Our job now is just to
present the case clearly.

376
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,475
Hey, can we talk?

377
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,112
I'll get these loaded
onto the computer.

378
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:42,382
Thanks.

379
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,546
Hey.

380
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,285
I don't like this,
Floyd. It's fine.

381
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,554
It doesn't feel fine.

382
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,471
Feels like you're putting
yourself on the line.

383
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,397
Okay, these conferences
are for internal use only.

384
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,557
They're protected.

385
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,135
But we both know that Max has
been fielding calls on this one.

386
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,504
From the mayor, the
police commissioner.

387
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,598
Board of Directors,
malpractice department at HCC.

388
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,868
Evie...

389
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,952
There was a police officer
that died on your table,

390
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,410
under your knife.

391
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,345
You know that they're gonna
be looking for someone to blame.

392
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,684
Hate to say it, but it sure
feels like Max is trying

393
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,751
to make sure that person is you.

394
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,686
Dr. Reynolds?

395
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,432
Are you actually ready?

396
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:41,912
What we have here is the pre-op
echocardiogram for Officer McNeil.

397
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,725
Now, let's focus on
where the rupture occurred.

398
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,547
Here to here, all right?

399
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,052
.34 centimeters

400
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,854
at the thinnest width of
the right ventricular wall.

401
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,117
Normal.

402
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,385
Also, normal valve function.

403
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,257
Normal papillary musculature.

404
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,124
And, as noted
before, normal echo.

405
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,427
Hmm.

406
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,968
How about a second opinion?

407
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,272
Dr. Jessup?

408
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,573
Yes, it appears normal.

409
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,942
How about you, Dr. Flores?

410
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,106
Don't you think the right
ventricular wall looks a little thin?

411
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,474
Uh...

412
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:21,945
No. It looks like a
normal thickness to me.

413
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,923
Is there anyone
here who disagrees?

414
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,416
Dr. Nottingham?

415
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,927
I see what Dr. Reynolds sees.

416
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,890
Normal ultrasound.

417
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,226
Well, an ultrasound is just an
approximate image of the real heart.

418
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:38,635
But, fortunately for us,
the real heart is still here

419
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,607
down in pathology, so I think we
should all take a trip down there

420
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,736
and have a closer look for
ourselves. You can't be serious.

421
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,775
Oh, but I am serious.

422
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,578
Once we examine the
real heart, then we'll know

423
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,244
if these readings were in
fact, as you say, normal.

424
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,152
Right now. Here we
go. Everybody up.

425
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,663
You know you can
talk to me, right?

426
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,204
It's just me and you.

427
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,034
In here, just like before.

428
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,340
It'll never be
like it was before.

429
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,006
Not where I'm going.

430
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,437
Okay, let's talk
about that. Let's not.

431
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,810
Avi, I believe there is
something in your life

432
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,016
that really upsets you.

433
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,847
Something you've worked
very, very hard to lock away.

434
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,688
And now, for some reason,

435
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,284
that thing has snuck back around

436
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,693
to the front of your mind.

437
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,077
For some reason, that's all
you can think about right now.

438
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,699
You know I can help you. I can
help you manage these emotions,

439
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,346
but first you have to let me in.

440
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,895
I don't want to move back there.

441
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,567
I hate it there. You
hate it in Missouri?

442
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,336
Why do I have to go with her?
Why can't she just go back there

443
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,005
and do her dumb job there
and I could stay here, right?

444
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,914
Don't make me go.

445
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,693
Does this have something
to do with your mom?

446
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,741
No!

447
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,753
My mom doesn't
know anything about it.

448
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,680
Doesn't know
anything about what?

449
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,224
No, no, no, no.

450
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,921
No, Avi, what doesn't
she know about?

451
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,057
You have to tell me.

452
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,675
You gotta let me in so
we can face it together.

453
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,258
I don't want to face it!

454
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,968
I want to stay here, but
nobody cares about what I want!

455
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,336
That is not true. It is true!

456
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,069
If you cared about me at all,
you'd be on my side right now.

457
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,704
You'd be on my side
instead of working so hard

458
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,576
to ship me off to Missouri!

459
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:38,789
I can't go back.

460
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,764
Hi. Hi. Have you got a minute?

461
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,195
Well, despite this whimsical
tableau, I'm actually quite busy.

462
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,299
Tough case? Understatement.

463
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,968
But, you know,
nothing fires up the brain

464
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,980
like sugar and titanium dioxide.

465
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,541
Well, before you
slip into insulin shock,

466
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,416
I... I want to get your
professional opinion.

467
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,715
About?

468
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:10,756
About Max.

469
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,761
You know, speculating
on the boss' mental health

470
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,730
is not my favorite thing.

471
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,665
Nor mine, but if the medical
director of New Amsterdam's ability

472
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,259
to make decisions is compromised,
then I need to know about it.

473
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,733
Every cancer patient struggles,
but in the past few days,

474
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,002
he has been exhibiting
behavior that's erratic.

475
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,809
Unstable, even angry.

476
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,073
That's not Max.

477
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,916
Well, I do, um... I
have a theory, but...

478
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,161
I don't think
you're gonna like it.

479
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,346
Go on.

480
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,645
It's you.

481
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,985
Me?

482
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,694
This all started once you passed
him off to Dr. Stauton like a hot potato.

483
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,287
That's irrelevant. Our treatment
plans are almost identical.

484
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,926
Yeah, but your relationships
with Max are not, are they?

485
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,129
Dr. Stauton is an excellent
doctor. Max knows that.

486
00:23:58,304 --> 00:23:59,966
Yeah, and he respects her.

487
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,599
But he believes in you.

488
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,969
I need your help right away.

489
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,639
Hey. Not now.

490
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,148
Okay.

491
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,109
This better be important.

492
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,982
I am at the end of my rope now.

493
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,215
I have a patient who,
no matter the treatment,

494
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,620
cannot be helped.

495
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,601
Is this about your spinocerebellar
degeneration patient?

496
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,117
No, he's fine. It's
about @NancyPants.

497
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,359
I brought this on
myself, didn't I?

498
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,129
Look at this.

499
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:32,163
"The 100-year-old doctor
just tried to buy me off.

500
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,035
"Pro-tip: want a better review?

501
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,233
"Don't give me the scratchiest
sheets on the planet.

502
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,537
"One star."

503
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,305
She is insufferable.

504
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,176
Isn't she in the
Presidential Suite?

505
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,306
Yes, and she's still displeased.

506
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:46,580
Wait, we use 600 thread-count
Egyptian cotton in there.

507
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,711
Nothing will ever be good
enough for this woman.

508
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,732
It's hard to believe she's
a woman of refined taste

509
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,725
given her screen
name is @NancyPants.

510
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,191
I don't know what more to do.

511
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:59,259
Wait, what if she actually
had incredibly sensitive skin?

512
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:02,164
It has to be the most
sensitive skin on this planet,

513
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,728
or...

514
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,737
Oh, dear. Exactly.

515
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,714
Max, we should talk.
Not really a good time.

516
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,013
What is this?

517
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,851
A fool's errand.

518
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:38,033
If we look at the patient's heart,
we see the chambers intact.

519
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:39,932
Normal in appearance.

520
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,701
But let's turn to
the cardiac injury.

521
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,640
Even after this dramatic
free wall rupture,

522
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,706
the actual cardiac tissue
itself is amazingly normal.

523
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:52,877
No thinning?

524
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,814
None. No?

525
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,915
No, uh, infiltrative process
like amyloid or fibrosis?

526
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,460
No, no abnormalities whatsoever.

527
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,660
Dr. Reynolds, what about
your, uh, mental state

528
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,232
during the surgery?

529
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,260
Nothing of particular
note. Really?

530
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:14,272
Because I know for a fact on
that day that you were distracted.

531
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,069
No, I was fine.

532
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,168
If you recall, you spent the entire
morning going over your budgets.

533
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,546
It's unrelated and you know it.

534
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,759
Not if it compromised your
concentration during the surgery.

535
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,162
You honestly believe I was still
thinking about your stupid budgets?

536
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,430
I don't know.
You tell me, Floyd.

537
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,855
The woman died on your
table. You know what? That's it.

538
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:34,122
This M&M is over.
Everyone back to work.

539
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,621
Now!

540
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,292
Except for you. We got business.

541
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,834
You were way out
of line. Not if I'm right.

542
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,135
Well, you're not right,
and that wasn't an M&M.

543
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,642
That was a public shaming.

544
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,371
I am only asking
the tough questions.

545
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,645
No, you are undermining
my credibility at this hospital.

546
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,149
In front of my staff. In
front of my colleagues.

547
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,379
Are you really making this
patient's death about you?

548
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,697
No, you made it about me when
you brought up my mental state.

549
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:07,056
The whole point of this exercise
was to determine, once and for all,

550
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,220
if Officer Marie McNeil's
death was preventable.

551
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:13,231
We have sifted through
every notation, every scan,

552
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,028
every piece of recorded imaging.

553
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,830
Hell, 50 people just watched you
poke and prod at the poor woman's heart.

554
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,372
There's nothing
else to investigate!

555
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,997
Then we start over! Max.

556
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,242
You are unbelievable,
you know that?

557
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,335
Yeah, no, we start
over. We dig deeper.

558
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,903
We keep looking
until we find... No!

559
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,412
What did you say?

560
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,980
In what world do you think I'd
stick around for more of this?

561
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,690
I was so excited when
you offered me chair.

562
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,029
To build a department that...

563
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,526
That we could both be proud of.

564
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,504
An environment based
on mutual respect.

565
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,269
But in one afternoon you
managed to tear it all down.

566
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,586
In one afternoon you
showed how little you trust me,

567
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,272
and you did it in
front of everyone.

568
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,952
You can expect my resignation.

569
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,466
Do you want to tell me
what this is really about?

570
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,773
You're not my doctor, remember?

571
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,448
We must examine you right away.

572
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,415
I'm trying to sleep, here.
You're on your phone.

573
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,249
That's how I get to sleep.

574
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,038
Blue light disrupts the
production of melatonin,

575
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,394
but we'll talk about that later.

576
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,261
Do you mind showing
me your legs, please?

577
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,060
Um...

578
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,494
Dr. Kapoor believes your discomfort
has nothing to do with the sheets.

579
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,170
Okay, sure.

580
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,270
Ugh.

581
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,151
How long have you had this rash?

582
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,311
I've never noticed it before.

583
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,982
Can I have that glass?

584
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,132
The rash doesn't
blanch under pressure.

585
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,931
We must get her to the
procedure room now.

586
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,767
Wait, why?

587
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,869
Ms. Nan, it appears you have
contracted meningococcal meningitis.

588
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,876
If we don't treat you
now, you could die.

589
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,148
I need a procedure room, stat.

590
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,490
Dr. Sharpe.

591
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,325
Something I can help you with?

592
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,499
I need to talk to you

593
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,002
about Max.

594
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,698
Somewhat irregular.

595
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,738
I know.

596
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:14,806
Come in.

597
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,350
Hey, Avi. Hi.

598
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,086
Yeah, come in. Come in.

599
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,992
My mom's waiting.

600
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,590
I just wanted to, you know...

601
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,329
Say goodbye real quick.

602
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,096
You have my number, you know.

603
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,907
You can call me
anytime. Anytime.

604
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,370
Thank you...

605
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,177
For, you know...

606
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,012
Trying to fix me.

607
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,006
I know I let you down.

608
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,204
I'm really sorry for that,
Doc. You never let me down.

609
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,352
But you couldn't fix me, so...

610
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,449
Hey, stop, stop. Listen to
me, listen to me. "Fixed"...

611
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,625
That's not a thing.
It doesn't exist.

612
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:06,221
Nobody leaves
this hospital fixed.

613
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,596
Do you understand?

614
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,033
My job is to give you the
tools to get through the day.

615
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:14,735
That's it.

616
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,477
I wish I could just stay here.

617
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,104
Hey, hey.

618
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,705
You're gonna
make it to Missouri.

619
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,415
But that's just the beginning.

620
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:27,643
Don't forget about
Table Mountain.

621
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,282
The Parthenon. Right?

622
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,617
Gonna hike all
the way to the top.

623
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,387
Right to the top.

624
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,956
Yeah.

625
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,593
Use the tools.

626
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,938
Use the tools. Every day.

627
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,500
Every day.

628
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:50,970
Come on.

629
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,636
You're gonna be great.

630
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,411
Avi.

631
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:00,611
Hi.

632
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,420
It's time to go.

633
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,652
All right.

634
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,662
Bye, Doc. Bye, Avi.

635
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,436
Pulse ox 97, BP 100 over 60.

636
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,272
When you feel the pop...

637
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,806
You know you're in.

638
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,648
There. HR normative range.

639
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,120
Nancy? Here you go.

640
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,290
You okay?

641
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:44,223
I guess so.

642
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,191
We are collecting the fluid

643
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:50,235
to identify which bacteria
is making you so sick.

644
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,031
Additional LP tubes on the tray.

645
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,297
I just came in for a
simple sleep study.

646
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,202
Nancy?

647
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,648
She's unresponsive.
Heart rate is up to 124.

648
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,048
BP's down to 80 over 40.

649
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,414
She's going into septic shock.

650
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,680
Deliver to the lab. Hurry.

651
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,219
Rapid response,
procedure room number two.

652
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,663
What the hell was that?

653
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,398
I did everything in my power
to save this patient's life.

654
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,701
I did everything right, and
now it's gonna bury my career?

655
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,434
This doesn't need
to land on you.

656
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,835
Max was... I don't
know what that was.

657
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,436
Out of control.

658
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,377
Insane. Tyrannical.

659
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,212
Babe, you have
legal recourse here.

660
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,208
I have a friend
at Adler & Morgan

661
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,829
who would take on this
case at the drop of a hat.

662
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,015
Yeah?

663
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:47,624
Not the best time.

664
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,753
We should talk.

665
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,869
Text me later.

666
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,986
This better not be
you defending him.

667
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,281
Not after what he did.

668
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,147
No, I can't defend that.

669
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,754
But, uh... But?

670
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:18,750
But?

671
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,589
Max's cancer.

672
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,325
It's not responding
to chemo or radiation.

673
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,510
How bad?

674
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,645
It's bad.

675
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,687
When did he find out?

676
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,922
Stauton told him this morning.

677
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,115
Got enough light on the keyhole?

678
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,176
Passing through
the cerebral cortex.

679
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,522
The center of the infection's
in the third ventricle.

680
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,489
I don't think you'll
be able to hit it.

681
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,222
Keep looking at the CT.

682
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,208
Go ahead and remove
the trap set from the tray.

683
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,667
Four centimeters to
the lateral ventricle.

684
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,169
You're too close.

685
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,671
I can make it.

686
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,642
If you clip that, she'll
never walk again.

687
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,679
Just imagine that review.

688
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:53,081
Advancing caudal to
the corticospinal tract.

689
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,687
You're clear.

690
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,684
And I am into ventricle.

691
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,096
Injecting

692
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,363
Cephillicam.

693
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,677
Heart rate and blood
pressure are stable.

694
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,451
Check that bone flap
cover. See if it needs sealing.

695
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:33,125
Forty-three years ago, I
made a decision to be a doctor.

696
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,192
Dedicate my life to
the service of others.

697
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,432
It was never about reviews.

698
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,916
I heard.

699
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,324
Yeah, well, what can you do?

700
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,722
I get why you pushed hard.

701
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,593
I'd want answers, too.

702
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,802
How do we just
accept that her death,

703
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:30,845
or anyone's death, was random?

704
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,180
Life, death.

705
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:37,278
It can't be arbitrary.

706
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,921
It's not.

707
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,289
I just thought maybe
there was something...

708
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,089
That we missed.

709
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,663
You know, maybe
there was something

710
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,496
that we could have
done differently.

711
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,503
Maybe... Maybe I could
have done a lot of things...

712
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,033
Differently.

713
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,143
Sometimes you
do everything right.

714
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,475
You know?

715
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:03,174
And get the same result.

716
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,548
As though you've done nothing.

717
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,180
I'm sorry, Floyd.

718
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,486
I don't know

719
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:16,226
what else to say or
how else to say it. I just...

720
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,529
I don't know who that...

721
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,726
Who that was today.

722
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,008
I mean, I look in the
mirror and then I...

723
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,666
I don't recognize that person.

724
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,240
What's happening
to you is not fair.

725
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,878
There's no reason behind it.

726
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,006
No answer that
will make it better.

727
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,141
I know.

728
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:40,913
I just don't want my life...

729
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:45,917
Or my death...

730
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:48,921
To be...

731
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,257
Arbitrary.

732
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:53,924
Okay.

733
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,168
Okay, well, the way I see it,

734
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,765
you got a choice.

735
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,934
You either let the
randomness of this

736
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,041
beat you down

737
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:10,679
or you pick yourself up
and you just keep fighting.

738
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,383
Endings be damned.

739
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,625
Hey.

740
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,694
I know what you're gonna say.

741
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,699
I like your hat.

742
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,541
<i>I have been sitting
here all afternoon</i>

743
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,951
researching alternative options.

744
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,285
Have you heard of the
Norton-Simon model?

745
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,757
No. It's called DDC.

746
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,260
Dose-dense chemo. "Dose-dense"?

747
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:01,057
Essentially, it's the same
dose of cisplatin that you're on,

748
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,601
but we would administer
it twice as frequently.

749
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,334
By amping up the quantity
and frequency of your treatment,

750
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:11,432
we could interrupt
the rapid growth phase

751
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,507
of your malignant tumor cells.

752
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,013
What's the catch?

753
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:21,518
If you were experiencing side
effects from your normal dose,

754
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:26,647
DDC is the equivalent of
napalming your internal organs.

755
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:31,662
Essentially, it's a human
scorched-earth policy.

756
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,332
Take time to think it
over. It's a big decision.

757
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:40,503
So read that article,
and then tomorrow...

758
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,834
Can we start tonight?

759
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,710
I wanna keep fighting.

760
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,345
Endings be damned.

761
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,186
Hey. Still here?

762
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,024
I had a lot of
paperwork to finish,

763
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,827
given everything I saw today.

764
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,829
Yeah, yeah.

765
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:14,236
Days like today,
they hit hard, man.

766
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,741
Don't always get the time
you need with a patient,

767
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:22,542
so we do what we can, and we find solace
in knowing that our contribution helped,

768
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,047
if even just a little bit.

769
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,149
Dr. Frome, I wasn't
filling out paperwork

770
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,680
for Avi Mantell.

771
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:29,846
No?

772
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:32,186
I was opening a formal
investigation on you.

773
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,162
I don't understand.
What I witnessed today

774
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:44,225
was a therapist
actively and knowingly

775
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:48,171
forming non-therapeutic
alliances with his patients.

776
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,002
No, that's not right.

777
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,770
The physical exchanges with Avi?

778
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,379
The emotional boundaries
you overstepped with him?

779
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,278
It crossed a line, Dr. Frome.

780
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,618
This is my official report.

781
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,052
I wanted you to hear it from me.

782
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:10,957
I'm sorry...

783
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,862
But our patients
must come first.
