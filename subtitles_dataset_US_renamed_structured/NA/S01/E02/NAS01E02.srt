1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,232
Look, I know we haven't
talked in a while, but...

2
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,242
I have to tell you this, and...

3
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,574
I don't know, you
might not like it.

4
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,745
What do you get when you

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,923
cross an elephant

6
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,487
with a rhino?

7
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,265
Hell if I know.

8
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,863
Yeah.

9
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,870
That's my first dad joke.

10
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,208
Did you just kick?

11
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,503
Hi, Luna.

12
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,372
You know,

13
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,508
three months from now,
we get to do this in person.

14
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,978
It's pretty cool.

15
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,623
Time for our song.

16
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,853
<i>Your love</i>

17
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:07,327
<i>Is lifting me higher</i>

18
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,669
<i>Than I've ever</i>

19
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,674
<i>Been lifted before</i>

20
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,237
<i>So keep it up</i>

21
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,970
<i>Quenching my desire</i>

22
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,477
<i>And I'll be at your
side forever more</i>

23
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,253
<i>You know your love...</i>

24
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:28,378
How can I help?

25
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,548
Well, there's candy
machines in the pediatric ward.

26
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,335
You know what's not good
for kids before 9:00 a.m.?

27
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,726
Does it start with C and
end with childhood obesity?

28
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,319
Yes. Consider them gone.

29
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,703
I'm hiring six new therapists
with training in CBT and DBT.

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,079
And I'm starting a
patient advocacy division

31
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,914
because when I say
things like CBT and DBT,

32
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,250
patients have no idea
what I'm talking about.

33
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,855
Will this cost more money?

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,285
Yes, but...

35
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,357
Who's with me?

36
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,029
Ooh. We need to talk
about my waiting room.

37
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,409
Thought we got rid
of your waiting room.

38
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,959
Well, the plan was for nurses
to move patients straight to beds.

39
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,367
Okay, I'm not seeing a problem.

40
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,700
The plan requires nurses.

41
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,741
Got it. More nurses.

42
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,875
<i>And you know he never
showed his face again...</i>

43
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,230
Health care is the number one
cause of bankruptcy in America.

44
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,915
Wow, you really know how to
bring things down, don't you?

45
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,101
Patients should know that their

46
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,768
hospital bills are negotiable.

47
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,312
We should revise our
Patient Bill of Rights.

48
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,605
Love that idea. Way to
bring things back up again.

49
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,686
We need to provide better
care with fewer resources.

50
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,285
But I need your help.

51
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,757
I need your ideas.

52
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:16,290
Okay, I'm just gonna do
this until somebody speaks.

53
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,992
Is this jogging
anybody's... Anyone?

54
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,910
I'm gonna go ahead, it's
gonna become a robot now.

55
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,278
It's just gonna go
downhill from here.

56
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,497
I'll just keep on doing this.

57
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:28,007
Does anybody have
anything? Just one idea?

58
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,174
What about group appointments?

59
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,038
Thank God. Yes. Please, share.

60
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:38,619
You give people with related issues
like diabetes or high blood pressure...

61
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,622
<i>and I'm so glad I
finally found you</i>

62
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,960
<i>Yes, my one in a million girl</i>

63
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,556
<i>So I wrap</i>

64
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,199
<i>My loving arms around you</i>

65
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,803
<i>And I can stand up</i>

66
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,200
<i>And face the world</i>

67
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,145
Time to go to work.

68
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,549
Thirty-two-year-old
woman collapsed

69
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,924
with extreme shortness
of breath and chest pain.

70
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,656
Heart rate 140, respiration's
34, BP 90 over 60.

71
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,256
Took 100% O2 to
keep her sats over 90.

72
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,044
Where's Reynolds? Did
anyone see what happened?

73
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,367
I'm her father. We
were at a fund-raiser.

74
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,372
Jozette was accepting an award.

75
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,031
Then she just shook and fell.

76
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,769
We didn't know what to do.

77
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,374
What you got?

78
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,208
Holosystolic blowing
murmur at the apex.

79
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,673
What took you so long?

80
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,342
Well, I'm the department
chair now. I've got stuff to do.

81
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,440
Like what?

82
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,918
As soon as I figure
that out, I'll let you know.

83
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,080
You're right. Acute
mitral regurgitation.

84
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,090
Trauma One. REYNOLDS:
Get a central line kit.

85
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,887
Lisa, prepare me a Levo drip.

86
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,928
Titrate to systolic at 90.

87
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,519
On the count of three.

88
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,794
One, two, three.

89
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,231
Watch out.

90
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,902
Yeah, oh, my
gosh, my girls tested

91
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,804
for their orange belts
last night in karate.

92
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,966
They're complete
savages. I had no idea.

93
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,716
I looked at... I took
a video of it. Here.

94
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,572
I'll show you.

95
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,057
Or wait, did I email
it to myself already?

96
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,572
That's okay, I can imagine it.

97
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,561
Okay. Well, remind me
to show it to you later,

98
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,144
because it is intensely cute.

99
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,719
Gosh, I'm always talking
about my kids. What about you?

100
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,190
How come you never
talk about yours?

101
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,556
I don't have any.

102
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,904
I'm sorry, I just
assumed that you...

103
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,955
Life had other plans for
me, and then it got too late.

104
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:35,297
Okay, well... Speaking of which,
based on your extensive experience...

105
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,927
You mean to say "old."

106
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,231
Yes. Exactly.

107
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:40,883
How long do you
think this Max guy

108
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,001
can shake things up
before the Dean steps in?

109
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,079
Not long. Dean of medicine
does not like things shaken up,

110
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,606
based on my
extensive experience.

111
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,182
All right.

112
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,153
How you doing? I'm Dr. Frome.
But you can call me Iggy, all right?

113
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,752
No need to be so formal.

114
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,633
All right, so...

115
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,527
I had a chat with your mom,

116
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,037
and she told me that you're
having a hard time staying awake

117
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,766
and that you've
been wetting the bed.

118
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,468
Is that right?

119
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,535
Okay.

120
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,373
No big deal, you know?

121
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,505
We can get to the
bottom of this, easy-peasy.

122
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,181
Okay?

123
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,394
Let's see what
we're looking at here.

124
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,717
All right, says here you've been
on Zotepine for the last few years?

125
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,154
Is that right?

126
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,295
Did something happen at school?

127
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:44,465
No? You sure about that?
'Cause zotepine, my friend, that is...

128
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,137
That's big-time.
That is no joke.

129
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,811
Nothing happened that
you want to tell me about?

130
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,409
No.

131
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,477
Okay, cool. Fair enough.

132
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,142
All right. They've
also got you on

133
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,842
Sertraline. Huh.

134
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,090
And Zolpidem.

135
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,562
Oh, my gosh, they have
you on Atomoxetine as well.

136
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,894
Okay. I mean, uh,

137
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,501
who needs breakfast, am I right?

138
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,401
Fistful of pills like
that every morning?

139
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,840
Yeah. And I see
that, um, you also...

140
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,573
You lost your dad
a few years back?

141
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,347
Yeah.

142
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,521
Yeah, that's really
tough. I'm sorry.

143
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,558
You know what, Leo?

144
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,893
I want to try
something different.

145
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,795
Instead of adding more medication
to your already impressive roster,

146
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,402
why don't we try
this for a plan?

147
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,275
Let's take you off all
of your medication.

148
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,417
I just want to know how
much this is gonna cost me.

149
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,944
I'm sorry, but I
can't tell you that.

150
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,218
So I can compare prices on my Subaru
and not on my wife's double bypass?

151
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,235
You know, it's funny,
Congress actually made it illegal

152
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,057
for hospitals to
disclose prices to you,

153
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,239
so it's the only industry in
America with a non-compete clause,

154
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,789
but, hey, call your
congressperson. Resist!

155
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,397
You're running late. - For what?

156
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,302
For everything. Dora,
I'm educating patients.

157
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,896
You're inciting riots.

158
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,067
Dean of medicine
called again. Pass.

159
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,134
You can't keep
ignoring him, Max.

160
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,589
When you fire half the staff,
disembowel an entire hospital,

161
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,573
you have to expect your
boss is gonna be on you...

162
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,447
To what? Re-bowel it?

163
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,752
Sounds gross, doesn't it?

164
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,117
Max!

165
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,913
Dr. Sharpe, back in the
trenches. How's re-entry?

166
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,014
I wouldn't know.

167
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,235
You didn't show up to your
appointment this morning.

168
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,956
Well, I had a department chair
meeting. Which you missed, I believe.

169
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,622
Because we had an appointment.

170
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,074
What? How... Did
I forget something?

171
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,465
No, no, just, Dr. Sharpe
and I have a little thing.

172
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,002
Very informal.

173
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,798
It's not informal.
It's quite serious.

174
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,039
How serious? Not
very. I'm taking care of it.

175
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,164
Are you? Mmm-hmm.

176
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,298
Have you eaten today?

177
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,638
Does espresso count?

178
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,421
Dora, would you mind
getting him an apple?

179
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,209
An apple? Mmm.
He'll be in my office.

180
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,872
I can't. I got a full schedule.

181
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,541
Your 2:00 p.m. just canceled.

182
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,150
Thank you, Dora.

183
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,317
Thought you were
getting me an apple.

184
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,052
Max. You have can...
We have 1,500 patients.

185
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,321
I don't have time
to be one of them.

186
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,392
You better find the time
before you run out of it.

187
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,681
One of the valves that
controls the flow of blood

188
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,230
through Jozette's
heart is broken,

189
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,538
and blood is backing up into her
lungs, which is why she can't breathe.

190
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,580
But how could this
happen? Jozette is strong.

191
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,146
She's an aid worker
for the people of Haiti.

192
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,048
I have to get to Jean-Rabel.

193
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,718
This week, a
mudslide hit our village.

194
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,881
So many people have died.

195
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,150
That might explain
what happened.

196
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,361
You thinking takotsubo
syndrome? Yeah.

197
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,486
That sounds bad.

198
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:58,361
Another name for it is,
uh, broken heart syndrome.

199
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,534
The mudslide may have
caused Jozette so much grief

200
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,728
that it actually made her
heart beat so hard that

201
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,035
it tore the muscles
that hold it together.

202
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,040
I hate to feel helpless.

203
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,268
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,071
Well, the good news is,
I can fix a broken heart.

205
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,222
Now, we're gonna get
you prepped for surgery

206
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,238
and get you home
as fast as we can.

207
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,245
First may we perform a Gad Ko?

208
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,182
I'm sorry, a what?
It's a protection ritual.

209
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,018
We make a cut in
the skin, rub in herbs.

210
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,770
Oh, no, that's... That's
out of the question.

211
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,525
Any cuts to the skin can
introduce infection, so...

212
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:34,557
Gad Ko attaches Lwa to me.
Protects me from accidents.

213
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,198
Okay, look, Jozette, there
won't be any accidents, all right?

214
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,968
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to prep for surgery.

215
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,912
It's true. He used
to be energetic.

216
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,777
Silly.

217
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,722
But you can't just take him
off of all of his medications.

218
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,760
Doesn't he need them?
Honestly, I don't know.

219
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,090
I don't know what he needs.

220
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,405
He's on so many
counterintuitive drugs,

221
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,398
I can't see the real issue.

222
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,260
I want to try
behavioral therapy.

223
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,826
Talk therapy.

224
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,267
He had, um,

225
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,469
outbursts at school... Physical.

226
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,975
And when the school psychiatrist
started him on the Zotepine,

227
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,271
they completely stopped.

228
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,813
That drug may have succeeded
in curbing your son's behavior,

229
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,281
but it did nothing to address
the underlying issues.

230
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,251
Zotepine also causes
lethargy, apathy.

231
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,153
So when he was prescribed a
stimulant, that led to his sleep issues.

232
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,848
And accelerated his weight gain,

233
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,858
which developed
into Type 2 diabetes.

234
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,136
That's why he's wetting the bed.

235
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,526
He has diabetes

236
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,763
because of the
drugs that he's on.

237
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,430
My God, I didn't...
I didn't know.

238
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,234
I mean, they told me
that he needed them.

239
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,613
I was just... I was
trying to help him.

240
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,815
Of course, you were. That's
what we all would have done.

241
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes, absolutely.

242
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,102
I'm sorry, I just...

243
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,506
Let me pull him off the meds.

244
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,108
You know, let me talk to him.
I really just want to talk to him.

245
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,722
When was the last time
you saw your son smile?

246
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,223
Dora, are you stalking me?

247
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,677
It's definitely beginning to feel
that way, isn't it? Mmm-hmm.

248
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,795
Dr. Sharpe's office
called. I got pulled into OB.

249
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,498
Tell that to Dr. Sharpe.
I got you an apple.

250
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,850
You know, I'm really more of
a Golden Russet kind of guy.

251
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,286
Maybe keep that to yourself. What
do you have against Golden Russets?

252
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,822
Nothing, my issue is with people
who can identify Golden Russets.

253
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,007
Dr. Reynolds. What up?

254
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,572
Now eat the apple.
Got you an apple.

255
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,878
Also, I got a call from
Jozette Pampil's family?

256
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,295
Apparently they're upset
that you won't let them

257
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,345
perform some kind
of protection ritual?

258
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,865
That's correct. Even
though they believe

259
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,324
it's gonna help keep your
patient safe from harm?

260
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,486
You fired the entire
cardiac surgical department

261
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,257
because of the
high infection rates,

262
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,974
and now you want me
to let a family member

263
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,331
cut open my patient
and put dirt in her wound?

264
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,766
Well, a superficial wound with a
sterile blade under your supervision.

265
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,337
Is this my call, or are
you overstepping me?

266
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,332
It's your call. Good.

267
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,070
Then no one's cutting open
my patient but me, okay?

268
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,747
Hello. BLOOM: She's ready to go.

269
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,374
All right. Wow.

270
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,249
Expeditions to the North
Pole traveled lighter, huh?

271
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,217
Looks like V-fib.

272
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,895
There's no pulse. Defibrillator.

273
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,524
200 joules.

274
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,601
All clear.

275
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,543
Okay, got her back. I'll
back off the Levophed.

276
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,141
That should stabilize her.

277
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,879
You're good? Yeah.

278
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,426
Back in V-fib!

279
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,432
I don't have a
pulse. Let's go 300.

280
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,794
All clear.

281
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,404
Okay, I got her back.

282
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,145
What the hell?

283
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,915
She's too unstable
for transport.

284
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,185
Maybe you should do the ritual.

285
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:23,488
Because Leo is on multiple medications,
we must devise a regimented detox program.

286
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,643
The stimulant should
leave his system overnight,

287
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,930
but the psychoactive medication
will require gradual tapering.

288
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,704
What, you don't
agree? No, no, I do. I do.

289
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,301
Just, um, for
whatever it's worth,

290
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,175
I think you would have
made a really good dad.

291
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,844
No, I wouldn't have. Why
do you say crazy things?

292
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,866
A word, you two? FROME:
Let me ask you something.

293
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,326
Don't you think Kapoor would
have made, like, a totally rad dad?

294
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,511
Come on, please...

295
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,262
Dr. Villarreal, this is...
Look at this dad face.

296
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,848
Hey! This is Dr. Kapoor, head
of our neurology department,

297
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,935
and this is Dr. Frome, head
of our psych department.

298
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,791
Gentlemen, this
is Dr. Villarreal.

299
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,660
She's the psychiatrist for all
the public schools in Queens.

300
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,528
Including Leo Chen's.

301
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,000
His mother alerted me to the
changes you're making to his treatment.

302
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,698
Yes, we were just
discussing his detox schedule.

303
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:09,469
Well, you should know that if Leo
Chen stops taking his medication,

304
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,168
he'll no longer be admitted
back into his school

305
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,905
or for that matter, any
New York public school.

306
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,581
I'm sorry, how can you force
a child to take medication?

307
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,481
Easy, it's the law.

308
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,465
Prohibition on Mandatory
Medication Amendment.

309
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,355
It passed in 2004.

310
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,656
It is illegal for public
schools to force a student

311
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,992
to take a controlled
substance to attend class.

312
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,930
Unless the mother signed an
Individualized Education Plan

313
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,591
agreeing to the medication.

314
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,759
She did? It's right there.

315
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,046
Not only are these medications
causing Leo physical harm,

316
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,505
but nobody has even studied
their long-term side effects.

317
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,418
Well, the school board
doesn't seem to agree with you.

318
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,254
Max, I can get through to this kid,
just not with all the drugs in the way.

319
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,907
Okay, okay. You really feel
that you can help this kid?

320
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,209
I do.

321
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,093
And you think you can
wean him off the drugs safely?

322
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,346
He does.

323
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,209
What? You gotta
talk faster. I do.

324
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,415
Then present your
evidence to a judge.

325
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,116
If you believe this is the best
thing for your patient, prove it.

326
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,454
Take the New York public
school system to court.

327
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,595
This pacing wire should get her
stable long enough to get her to the OR.

328
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,530
Or you could do the ritual.

329
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,230
If I believed in rituals, I
would have become a shaman,

330
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,935
not a surgeon.

331
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,204
You're about to
fix her heart valve.

332
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,189
If I were you, I'd take
all the help I could get.

333
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:24,878
You know, if a patient feels like
they've got to chant or knock on wood

334
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:29,116
or get their prayer warrior to lay
hands on them before I operate,

335
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,214
then that means they
don't trust me, you know?

336
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,770
They don't have
faith in my abilities.

337
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,820
Normal paced
rhythm with capture.

338
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,397
See? Pacing wire
is all the faith I need.

339
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,997
O2 sats are falling!

340
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,837
She's tanking.
Pulse ox dropping.

341
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,296
Jozette, I'm gonna sit
you up so you can breathe.

342
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,576
I need to intubate.

343
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,341
I hear rales.

344
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,417
Edema? Backing up in her lungs

345
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,611
because of that valve.

346
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,154
Here, toss me the
furosemide. I'm already on it.

347
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,599
The pulmonary are compromising.

348
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:04,989
Monitor.

349
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,969
You know, that's gonna take
a while to dry out her lungs.

350
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:10,452
Well, I can't operate until
I get this under control.

351
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,264
So then maybe you
do the ritu... Don't.

352
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,598
Don't even say it.

353
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,447
Normalizing. Standing back.

354
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,111
Administrating
now. Okay, look...

355
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:24,667
The ritual isn't even about you or
what you believe or your abilities.

356
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,938
It's about her.

357
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,811
It's about what she believes,
what she needs. I mean,

358
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,343
why can't you
just give her that?

359
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,155
So, Millie, I've read your file.

360
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,822
Not so good, huh?

361
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,487
Well, your chemotherapy hasn't
been as effective as everyone hoped.

362
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,697
Starting tomorrow, I'd like to
put you on a different regimen.

363
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,898
I wish I could
offer better news.

364
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,370
No.

365
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,672
It's okay.

366
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,978
Well, at least I
got to meet you.

367
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,811
Sorry? I've seen you on TV.

368
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,309
Oh.

369
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,978
If I had known I was gonna
meet the real Dr. Helen today,

370
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,851
I would have done my nails.

371
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,847
Your nails look fine, Millie.

372
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,393
No.

373
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,423
None of me looks fine.

374
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,233
I look like a cue ball.

375
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:29,373
Like a little, shrunken,
nubby-nailed cue ball.

376
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,506
Hell, I tried to wear a wig.

377
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,069
It just kept falling off.

378
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,714
That was embarrassing.

379
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,610
Even my kids made fun
of me, which I let them,

380
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,689
because it blows off steam, and

381
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,785
I figured if

382
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,549
they were laughing,

383
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,289
they wouldn't be thinking
about me keeling over dead.

384
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,091
I just wish that everything
didn't make me nauseous.

385
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,092
Food makes me nauseous.

386
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:00,070
<i>At first, I thought, "Well,
I just won't eat anything,</i>

387
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,231
<i>"so what could I throw up?"</i>

388
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,470
But I was wrong. I'm sorry.

389
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,569
Will you excuse
me? I need a moment.

390
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,445
You okay, Dr. Helen?

391
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,921
Yep, I just need...

392
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,754
I just need my diary.

393
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,933
Please tell me you're joking.

394
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,276
Green Jell-O?

395
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,743
Well, yeah, but we make
the food this bad on purpose

396
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,610
so that nobody wants to stay.

397
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,309
Well, it's working. Yeah.

398
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,180
Tell you what. I have an apple.

399
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,020
What about you?
I'll be all right.

400
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,450
How are you?

401
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,235
Don't you have more
important patients to see?

402
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,353
Nope. Max. Go.

403
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,692
Look, I just wanted to tell
you that I'm not the same

404
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,530
as that last job. I can be here

405
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,603
for you, with you.

406
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,137
Max.

407
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,800
It's not just...

408
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,978
Look, even when you
were there, you weren't.

409
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,780
I, um...

410
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,640
Sorry, I have to... Go.

411
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,553
But when you come back,

412
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,047
let me in.

413
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,790
Promise.

414
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,726
Thank you for doing this. I had
no idea this was even possible.

415
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:33,891
Yeah, yeah. You know what?

416
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,544
New Amsterdam was
actually the first hospital

417
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,161
to put a courtroom
in the building

418
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,330
so we could, um, advocate for
our patients in real time, you know?

419
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,897
Which is pretty neat.

420
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,407
Leo, come on through here.

421
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,341
You know, in the 1940s,

422
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,623
uh, New York was having a bit of
a mental health moment, if you will,

423
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,140
and this psych department was
completely overworked and underfunded

424
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:55,985
and, uh, exactly like it is
today, come to think of it.

425
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,215
Dr. Frome. Please. Yeah.

426
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,349
Oh, right, sorry.
Time to shut up now.

427
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:02,828
Mr. Bishop, as
Dr. Frome already knows,

428
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,194
I like to keep my
court informal,

429
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,257
so we're just going to jump in
unless you have any objections.

430
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,560
None, Your Honor.

431
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,001
Dr. Kapoor, we'll
start with you.

432
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,730
I've read the file.

433
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,367
You have a course of treatment
you want me to rule on. I get that.

434
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,378
Tell me why all
this is necessary.

435
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,409
Good morning, Your Honor.

436
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,381
Leo Chen is only 10 years old,

437
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,081
and he's on four different medications,
many with very damaging side effects.

438
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:32,589
But none of the medications are
actually treating his root problem.

439
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,590
Which is what? KAPOOR: Uh...

440
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,691
We don't know. I mean...

441
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,424
We won't until Dr. Frome can
provide the therapy Leo needs.

442
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,934
And you don't think that's
possible while he's medicated?

443
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,432
Over-medicated.

444
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,064
I don't envy
Dr. Villarreal's position.

445
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,100
She's responsible for the mental
health of more than 3,000 students.

446
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,310
Prescribing medication is faster
than painstakingly evaluating

447
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,111
each individual student's needs.

448
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,977
That's quite an indictment.

449
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,147
It's not meant to be. It's
simply the reality of the situation.

450
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,768
There are too many children
in the public school system

451
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,317
in need of psychological help

452
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,828
and not enough mental health
professionals to help them.

453
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,392
But you think you
and Dr. Frome can.

454
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,792
Yes.

455
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,300
In a way that won't further
endanger Leo's physical health.

456
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,484
We shouldn't have
to choose between

457
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,841
the physical and mental
well-being of our children.

458
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,272
Thank you.

459
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:47,921
Let's get her to the OR.

460
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,494
Let's go slow.

461
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,606
There we go.

462
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,838
Easy. Okay.

463
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:18,952
The ritual worked.

464
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,956
Just don't tell Bloom.

465
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,398
Hey, how's it going?

466
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,868
Oh, my gosh, it's so good.

467
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,801
Kapoor nailed it, man. He was
like a slow, bald ninja out there.

468
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,902
Nice. Ready, Your Honor.

469
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,606
Okay, let's start with

470
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,871
the treatment plan

471
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:44,576
Dr. Kapoor lays out in Leo's
file seems very reasonable.

472
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,879
What's wrong with it?

473
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,819
I'm sure it sounds reasonable,
Your Honor, on paper.

474
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,319
But I'm sorry, if Leo Chen
is taken off his medications,

475
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:56,486
he poses a significant threat to
the rest of the student population.

476
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,121
- That's an exaggeration.
- If I may, Your Honor,

477
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,496
this is video footage
of an incident at school

478
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,298
prior to Dr. Villarreal prescribing
the medications in question.

479
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,686
<i>Hey!</i>

480
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,615
<i>No!</i>

481
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,456
<i>No! Stop him!</i>

482
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,098
You're right about
one thing, Dr. Kapoor.

483
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:44,108
I am responsible for
over 3,000 children,

484
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:48,045
and I have to protect the
physical well-being of them all.

485
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,151
Hey. They told me
there was a fight.

486
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:09,566
But I have never seen that
video before, and I just, I don't...

487
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,328
I know. It's okay.

488
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,835
I know this looks bad.

489
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,945
I'm not sure "bad" is the
right word to describe it.

490
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,870
But what we saw on
that tape was rage.

491
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,405
Okay, and there's
usually a reason for rage.

492
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,413
It's situational.
It's not chemical.

493
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,073
How will you prove that?

494
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:25,515
Well...

495
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,411
Just give me a second,
okay? I'll be right back.

496
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,154
So listen.

497
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,685
Do you think maybe you could
tell the judge what you felt that day?

498
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,477
You know what I mean? You can
tell her why you did what you did

499
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,365
in your own words.

500
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,901
Okay. He can't.

501
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,844
Not on all these
meds. There's no way.

502
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,405
There's just... There's no way.

503
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,274
There may be one.

504
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,915
"Thank whatever gods may be

505
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,852
"for my unconquerable soul.

506
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,688
"In the fell clutch
of circumstance...

507
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,262
"I have not winced,
nor cried aloud."

508
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,094
I heard you did the ritual.

509
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,401
I'm glad it helped.

510
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,902
I'm pretty sure it was the
Levophed, the pacing wire,

511
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,908
and the furosemide that helped.

512
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,374
How many times did
you scrub each finger?

513
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,379
What? How many times?

514
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,779
Ten.

515
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,540
Why not nine or eleven?

516
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:34,413
Superstition?

517
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,647
Routine.

518
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,720
What was that thing
you were just reciting?

519
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:40,821
<i>Invictus.</i>

520
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,122
Oh. Do you always recite
<i>Invictus</i> while scrubbing in?

521
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,996
I do. Hmm.

522
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,594
Kinda like a prayer.

523
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,667
Habit. Ritual.

524
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,975
Loosen up, Dr. Reynolds. Not everything's
gonna go according to your plan.

525
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,587
Or everyone.

526
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:17,857
Wanna tell me what's going on?

527
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:19,261
Rapid detox dialysis.

528
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,664
I heard that. I can see
that. And then I thought,

529
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,601
"Surely, they can't be crazy
enough to do something like that

530
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,110
"in the middle of
court proceedings."

531
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,834
It's the fastest way to get
psychotropic drugs out of Leo's system.

532
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,221
Right, but if we lose this case,

533
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,335
they are not gonna let
Leo back into school.

534
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,589
You told us to put the patient
first. That's what we are doing.

535
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:36,658
Off these medications, Iggy
will be able to work with him.

536
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,810
Yeah, if he can't,
do you have any idea

537
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:42,218
the kind of liability you are
opening this hospital up to?

538
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,449
Oh, I see. What?

539
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,382
It's about now the new
medical director gets his first visit

540
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,553
from the Dean of medicine.
Or did the Dean already come?

541
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,858
There you are. They
need you in Hematology,

542
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,729
and you owe Dr. Sharpe a call.

543
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,392
So patient first or job first?

544
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,465
I think we broke him.

545
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,922
If you're looking for a
hideout, this one's taken.

546
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,992
Who are you running from?

547
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,893
Patients.

548
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:27,496
You?

549
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,561
Doctors.

550
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,403
One in particular.

551
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,043
I shouldn't be here.

552
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,081
Well, that makes two of us.

553
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:48,410
I really didn't expect
to care this much.

554
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,748
That's exactly why
you should be here.

555
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,529
What about you?

556
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,533
I made a promise

557
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,369
to my wife

558
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,570
that I would slow down.

559
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,376
Before this, I ran a clinic in
Chinatown, and it almost broke us.

560
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,911
I mean, Georgia...

561
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,208
Georgia couldn't go
through that again.

562
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,052
And I promised that

563
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,716
she wouldn't have to.

564
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,294
I promised her that
I would be there...

565
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,659
So we could start a family.

566
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,934
So I asked Georgia if she
would slow down with me,

567
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,974
to stop dancing, a
career that she loved,

568
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:46,442
that she's really,
really good at.

569
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:50,814
She did

570
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,115
for me

571
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,648
to be a mom, you know.

572
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,851
So we got pregnant,
and then I got the call

573
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,657
about New Amsterdam.

574
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,468
If Chinatown was K2,
then New Amsterdam was

575
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,668
Everest.

576
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,973
Who can resist climbing Everest?

577
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:19,975
Lots of people.

578
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,038
I wish I were one of them.

579
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,978
But I said yes

580
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,018
without telling Georgia.

581
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,291
She didn't like that.

582
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,959
You betrayed her.

583
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,797
But that doesn't mean
that you don't belong here.

584
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,502
The changes you've made are
gonna help thousands of people.

585
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,902
What about the one I married?

586
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,705
Oh, Max. You haven't told her
that you have cancer, have you?

587
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,642
What are you waiting for?

588
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,242
To not have cancer?

589
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,681
You can't carry
this load by yourself,

590
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,654
not as a medical
director, not as a patient,

591
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,818
certainly not as a
husband or father.

592
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,094
You've been telling
everyone, "Put the patient first,"

593
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,097
so why don't you
take your own advice?

594
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,857
Consider this your
first appointment.

595
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:20,495
And your first order of business is
to tell your wife that you have cancer.

596
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,228
Dr. John, how am I doing on
my suction? Capillary leak only.

597
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,686
Good. Okay.

598
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,219
Can you give me a
2-0 polyester on a stick?

599
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,690
Suture.

600
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,886
All right.

601
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,221
There we go.

602
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,264
Snip.

603
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,762
That should hold
nicely. That's the goal.

604
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:54,362
Okay, go ahead and restore blood flow
from the bypass machine through the heart.

605
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,908
Valve open. Unclamping the aorta

606
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,241
now.

607
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,142
Hmm.

608
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,575
Sutures holding.
Blood flow should

609
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,362
stimulate the heart to
start beating on its own.

610
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,878
Vicky, D-fib. I'm not
seeing anything on monitors.

611
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,888
Okay, let's give
it a little help.

612
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,726
Okay, here we go.
Charge to 20. Charging.

613
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,325
Clear. Clear.

614
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,492
No visible beat.

615
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,001
Let's do it again.

616
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,106
Clear. Clear.

617
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,317
Still no heartbeat. Gonna
need something stronger.

618
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,740
Intracardiac high-dose EPI.
Give me 10 mls and a syringe.

619
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,507
Dr. Reynolds... I
need it now, people.

620
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:40,818
Ten mls cardiac needle.

621
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,613
Where does she stand with gas exchange?
- Producing adequately.

622
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,186
Leo, can you tell Judge
Hayashi what you told me?

623
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,793
It's okay.

624
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,162
She's a friend.

625
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,298
It was my fault.

626
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,205
What was your fault, Leo?

627
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,208
My dad died.

628
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,607
My fault.

629
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,048
Can you tell us the rest?

630
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,450
We were going to Sheep's Meadow

631
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,723
in the park.

632
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,119
That's where we
went to build LEGOs.

633
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:24,990
Then what happened?

634
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,526
Forgot them...

635
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,358
The LEGOs.

636
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,295
So my dad went back to get them.

637
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,199
And he didn't come back.

638
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,880
You live on a
fifth-floor walk-up, right?

639
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:48,718
Yeah, sometimes it was hard
for his dad to walk all those stairs.

640
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,545
He had asthma

641
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,647
and a heart condition.

642
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,590
And that day when
he reached the top,

643
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,353
he had a heart attack.

644
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,398
And Leo found him.

645
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,933
And the video?

646
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,033
Can you tell me what happened?

647
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,208
Ryder...

648
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,211
He always said I should
be dead like my dad.

649
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:18,145
That day, I finally...

650
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,980
I had to make it stop.

651
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,490
What are you
proposing, Dr. Frome?

652
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:35,127
Well, Leo needs to be able to
process all this displaced guilt.

653
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,263
And he can't do that when he's
buried in a drug-induced haze.

654
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,667
He needs to be able to feel.

655
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,832
He needs to be able
to talk to somebody.

656
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,167
Let him talk to me.

657
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,503
Let me help him.

658
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,329
Charged to 20. Charging.

659
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,582
Clear.

660
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,500
All right, paddles in place.
How long do we keep this up?

661
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,084
Paddles in place! Nurse, loupes!

662
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,595
Charged to 20. Clear!

663
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,794
Still nothing.

664
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,830
Dr. Reynolds.

665
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,537
Do we call it?

666
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,140
What are you doing?

667
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,280
Trying cardiac massage.

668
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:32,380
That's not going to work.
All I need is one beat.

669
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,618
Just one.

670
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,353
Dr. Reynolds.

671
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:40,988
Dr. Reynolds.

672
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,500
Hold on.

673
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,559
I think I feel something.

674
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,199
I feel something.

675
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,484
She's back.

676
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,186
You did it.

677
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:06,816
Pulse ox 97.

678
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,107
So...

679
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,578
The Gad Ko worked.

680
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:10,088
<i>Back down</i>

681
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,924
<i>Down to the downtown</i>

682
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:21,825
<i>Down to the lockdown</i>

683
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:26,004
<i>Boards, nails lie around</i>

684
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,501
<i>I crouch like a crow</i>

685
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,806
<i>Contrast in the snow</i>

686
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,908
<i>For the agony</i>

687
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,854
<i>I'd rather know</i>

688
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,191
<i>'Cause blinded</i>

689
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,693
<i>I am</i>

690
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,295
<i>Blindsided</i>

691
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,206
<i>Peek in</i>

692
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:20,623
<i>Into the peer in...</i>

693
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,092
<i>Please leave your message.</i>

694
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,071
I know it's been a long time.

695
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,401
Too long.

696
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:42,805
Please call back.

697
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,820
I'm here.

698
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,158
<i>I am</i>

699
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,521
<i>Blindsided</i>

700
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,911
<i>Would you really rush out?</i>

701
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,414
Max. Hi.

702
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:21,514
How is she?

703
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,284
Better, but I'm still concerned.

704
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,949
She needs to be on bed
rest until she stops spotting.

705
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:28,918
Okay.

706
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:31,394
She can't be put
under any stress...

707
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:36,364
Physical or emotional. It
could hurt her and the baby.

708
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,595
Understand?

709
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,701
Yeah.

710
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:46,802
<i>Would you really
rush for me now?</i>

711
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,911
<i>Taut line</i>

712
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,882
<i>Down to the shoreline...</i>

713
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,119
Hey.

714
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,423
Hey, what's wrong?

715
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:15,438
<i>The moon is a cold light</i>

716
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,909
I, um...

717
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,914
Hey.

718
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,419
Remember?

719
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,480
You promised

720
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,187
to let me in.

721
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,688
<i>'Cause blinded</i>

722
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,832
Just tell me one thing.

723
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,538
Just one true thing.

724
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,379
<i>Blinded</i>

725
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,006
I love you.

726
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:01,812
<i>I was</i>

727
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,153
<i>Blindsided</i>

728
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:14,698
<i>Blinded</i>

729
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:18,327
<i>I was</i>

730
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:23,569
<i>Blindsided</i>
