1
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,952
<i>I gotta get this hospital ready for
the worst storm that we've seen in</i>

2
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,308
<i>I don't know how many years.</i>

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,541
If you pull me off, won't I die?

4
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,809
If we stay here,
you definitely will.

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,715
Help me.

6
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,044
Get me a gurney!

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,364
If people can't
get to this hospital,

8
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,220
then we need to bring
this hospital to them.

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,787
<i>Max, as your doctor,</i>

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,793
I cannot let you
traipse through a storm.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,488
<i>And I will take care of myself</i>

12
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,656
because I love my doctor.

13
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,960
<i>Honey, I'm sorry,</i>

14
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,331
but it's never gonna work
out between you and Max.

15
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,664
<i>We need to talk.</i>

16
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,637
This thing between us...

17
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:46,505
Max.

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,378
We lost power.

19
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,569
Shouldn't the generator
be coming on? Any second.

20
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,219
What's happening?

21
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,880
Uh, sorry folks. Uh, it
appears we lost power,

22
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,083
but the generator should
be kicking in shortly.

23
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,318
Is everyone all right?

24
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,157
My baby's cold.
Can I get a blanket?

25
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,672
All right, everybody
huddle up. Newborn?

26
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,757
My husband couldn't get here for
her birth, and we've been discharged.

27
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,767
The insurance company
wouldn't let us stay.

28
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,245
It's okay. Here,
just take my coat,

29
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,397
and I'll get you a blanket
as soon as possible.

30
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,001
Is the heat coming
back on? Yeah, shortly.

31
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,840
Come on in, guys. Just
head right over here.

32
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,072
We're gonna fix this.

33
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,205
Max. Yeah?

34
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,859
The generator should
have kicked in by now.

35
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,561
The circulatory
machines, the ventilators...

36
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,383
Okay, just do a
quick status run,

37
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,864
check all the wards, and
I'll meet you in the ED.

38
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,789
No... should someone
else... I'm fine.

39
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,590
You wanted to tell me something.

40
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,289
It can wait.

41
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,581
Henry. Dr. Goodwin.

42
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,265
How many on maintenance
tonight? You're looking at him.

43
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,566
Why isn't the
generator coming on?

44
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,101
I'm on my way to find
out, but it looks like

45
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,060
the entire lower
Manhattan grid is down.

46
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,487
Every minute we're
without power...

47
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,292
No, I get it. Patients will die.

48
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,096
Status? Improvising.

49
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,629
Call it out, April.

50
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,073
Mr. Ayers, blood
pressure: 130/75.

51
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,339
Pupils sluggish to react.

52
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,757
We have someone on
each of the ventilator patients

53
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,309
working an AMBU bag, taking pulses,
visually monitoring stats and meds...

54
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,647
Uh, what do you need?

55
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,619
Besides power? More people.

56
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,953
Since the storm, we've been
working with a skeleton crew.

57
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,856
Thermal socks. We
have to clean the feet.

58
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,861
Keep his clothes
on for the time being.

59
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:45,455
No monitor. No suction.

60
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,966
No cautery.

61
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,700
But you still have me, right?

62
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,704
Oh, yeah, holding firm.

63
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,774
Hey, can we get a
battery-powered fan?

64
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,807
Reynolds.

65
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,469
It's all good, Dr. Sharpe.

66
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,981
I'm holding Hugh's heart
together with my fingers,

67
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,685
but without power, we've got
no cardiopulmonary bypass...

68
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,185
No way to titrate anesthesia.

69
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,720
We can't operate without them.

70
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,149
Max is working on the generator.

71
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,483
All right.

72
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,151
How are you doing, sir?

73
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,022
Uh, you know... Eh...

74
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,298
Can I get another
micro-insertion kit?

75
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,893
On it.

76
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,330
Hey. How you
doing in there, Burl?

77
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,503
Get me out of here.

78
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,307
It's tight! Yeah.

79
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,381
Hey, guys, is there any way to
slide this out while the power's off?

80
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,974
We're safer with
him in the machine.

81
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,384
Danny, come on. He's here
'cause he attacked a guard.

82
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,532
No, he's not. He's here because
a guard bashed his head in.

83
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,800
In self-defense.
Oh, give me a...

84
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,726
The guard is my friend.
Your patient went off.

85
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,521
Hey, hey, Burl. Burl, listen.

86
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,499
Take a few deep breaths
for me, okay, buddy?

87
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,729
Deep breaths? We're
all in this together.

88
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,031
All right? Burl?

89
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,868
Iggy. Yeah.

90
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,883
It's midnight. Why wasn't
this scheduled for earlier?

91
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,002
We only bring the prisoners at
night, ma'am, for everyone's safety.

92
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,511
Can you handle this?

93
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,609
Sure, we're all
in this together.

94
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:10,844
Yeah.

95
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,218
Okay, Burl.

96
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,020
Get me out!

97
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,616
Um, where's that sound
coming from? Elevator?

98
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,661
Can you tell everyone to get
to ED? I'll be there in a minute.

99
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,270
Hello? KAPOOR: Helen?

100
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,406
Vijay?

101
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,173
Yes, I'm here with Dr. Hartman.

102
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,908
You know my name's Clint, right?

103
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,951
Are you okay? Yes, we are fine.

104
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,149
You don't look fine.
Are you claustrophobic?

105
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,653
Hardly. It's been
a very long day,

106
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:28,786
and I'm stuck in this
very small box with you.

107
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,660
Helen, why hasn't the
generator kicked in?

108
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,267
We're working on
it. Keep working on it.

109
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,332
What? Talk to me, Henry.

110
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,104
I mean, this thing took a big
hit during Hurricane Sandy.

111
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,155
A lot of these parts, they
should have been traded out.

112
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,977
And they weren't?
It doesn't look like it.

113
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:52,816
I mean, this fuel oil pump is failed,
this main pipe, it's still cracked...

114
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:53,945
So?

115
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,956
So, I could really use
some more light down here.

116
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,484
Wait. Wait.

117
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,027
I just remembered something.

118
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,963
I hope it's still here.

119
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,638
This. This could
buy us some time.

120
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,731
What is it? Emergency battery.

121
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,138
They got it after Sandy.

122
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,568
Is it enough to
power the hospital?

123
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,075
No way, but it could
cover a floor for an hour.

124
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,814
Okay, we got a
battery. That'll buy us

125
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,912
a little breathing room
while Henry keeps working.

126
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,013
Reynolds is literally
holding a man's heart

127
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,701
together with his fingers.
Yeah, I understand.

128
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,237
And we got a NICU full of babies
getting colder by the minute.

129
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,857
I can buy us a little juice
for one floor for one hour.

130
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,196
Okay, so ICU,
ventilators, IV pumps?

131
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,826
Yes. SHARPE: Yes?

132
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,497
What do you mean "yes"? We
need to pick one. We need to triage.

133
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,597
Nope. Shouldn't
we be evacuating?

134
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,265
No. CANDELARIO: To where? How?

135
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,253
In this storm, we can't
even get across the street.

136
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,677
Yeah, it's true. She's right.

137
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,425
We're one of the only
hospitals with the...

138
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,773
I was gonna say "with
the lights still on," but...

139
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,617
We could move
everybody to the same floor.

140
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,210
Yes. KAO: That's crazy.

141
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,018
Well, why? We're
not at capacity.

142
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,124
Look, it's Helen's idea.

143
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,602
But that's only because
you won't let me triage.

144
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,221
No triage. Look, Henry
is having difficulty seeing.

145
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,940
Would you grab a flashlight
and meet us down there?

146
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,296
Yeah, yes.

147
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,560
Max.

148
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,965
We cannot... Huh? We will.

149
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,107
Yo, hand me those soft-grip
pliers. Yeah, yeah, you got it.

150
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,148
Going with the
soft-grip. Here you go.

151
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,718
So, are you gonna check
those rotors or what?

152
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,811
Yeah, I'm doing
it now. Yeah, cool.

153
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,880
Boom.

154
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,050
I'm very impressed.
Yeah, are you?

155
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,244
Well, that's what growing
up on a farm does for a man.

156
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,319
Teaches him to say
"boom" a lot? Mmm. Yeah.

157
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:45,092
These rotors seem fine, but
the connections are damaged.

158
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,599
Tweak the rotors.
If I could just

159
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,645
get them to turn a little bit, there might
be enough power left inside the system...

160
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,728
Whoa!

161
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,104
Henry!

162
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

163
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,938
One, two, three... Nothing.

164
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,909
Come on, Henry. Stay with me.

165
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,282
Stay with me, come
on. Three, four...

166
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,150
Come on, Henry. Five, six...

167
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,119
Seven, either, nine, ten.

168
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,748
No, nothing. Let
me get an AED...

169
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,293
No, no, no. There's
no time. Here we go.

170
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,162
All right. Yeah?

171
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,754
Come on, Henry. Going again.

172
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,526
Yeah?

173
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,125
Nothing. No, Max, that's enough.

174
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,603
No, one more try, one more try.

175
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,969
Come on, Henry.

176
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,938
NICU and ICU are priority zones.

177
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,501
But they're different floors.

178
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,770
We could move the
babies to the ICU.

179
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,315
And everyone else?

180
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,216
Yeah, move everyone to
the ICU, all the patients.

181
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,878
Keep the NICU separated, and
bring the people up from the lobby.

182
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,465
We can turn off
all nonessentials,

183
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,617
convert IV drips to
subcutaneous injections.

184
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,125
What about Reynolds'
man in the OR?

185
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,432
I can help with that. Go ahead.

186
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,687
What...

187
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,059
What happened?

188
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:55,625
He was electrocuted, V-fib arrest
with ROSC after pericardial thump.

189
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,213
He should be okay,
but we need to monitor

190
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,035
his rhythm and treat
the burns on his hands.

191
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,007
All right, okay.
So, no generator?

192
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,805
Uh, not unless you can fix it.

193
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,370
Guys, I may know
someone who can.

194
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,006
Who? Well, he's, um...

195
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,642
He's currently stuck
in an MRI machine.

196
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,982
The Rikers patient?
Yes, the Rikers patient.

197
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,580
But he used to work
for DWP, he's smart...

198
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,180
Okay, great. Yeah.

199
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:22,352
Full disclosure, though, he
sort of murdered his coworker.

200
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,091
Oh, my God. Right.

201
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,166
But it wasn't premeditated.
He's not a psychopath.

202
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,825
He just has behavioral issues.

203
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,870
A rather big one,
don't you think?

204
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,200
Yeah.

205
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,934
I'll take full responsibility.

206
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,872
Plus, there's a
guard there, so...

207
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,670
It's our best shot.

208
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,418
Keep this tray in place.

209
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,249
His blood pressure's
dropped down to 90/64.

210
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,880
Hang in there, Hugh.
Is that a fence joke?

211
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,220
Just keep talking.

212
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,736
Make a list of all the
things you're gonna do

213
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,353
with your husband
when you get home.

214
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,626
Scrub the baseboards,
fold the towels...

215
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,133
though, Eric always
says three folds is overkill.

216
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,432
Eric can have an opinion on three
folds when he starts doing laundry.

217
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,733
Good point.

218
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,970
You have to help me remember
to tell him all this if I make it.

219
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,242
You're gonna make it.

220
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,304
BP's dropped to 82/40.

221
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,246
We need to do something now.

222
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,912
Hypothermic coma.

223
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,477
Lower his body temp to near
freezing and slow his metabolism.

224
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,284
Wasn't I freezing outside?

225
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,948
No, no, no, this
will be controlled.

226
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,424
I'm afraid it's our only option.

227
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,394
Respectfully disagree.

228
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,396
You bring me some power?

229
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,125
No, but we can do
his surgery right now.

230
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,667
With what? We have all
the equipment we need here.

231
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,770
I worked in far worse
conditions in Afghanistan.

232
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,773
Dr. Candelario, this
is my patient, my OR.

233
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,275
Your OR has decent
lighting and electricity.

234
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,472
We can save this man, but
I'm gonna need you to let go.

235
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,647
Literally.

236
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,808
Go ahead with the
IV, it'll help BP...

237
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,676
We'll have battery
power at any moment.

238
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,264
It's all right. We're
all gonna get there.

239
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:58,417
Will you just take your time,
please? And don't panic!

240
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,360
Will you hurry up?

241
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,530
Take your time.

242
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,262
I just wanna get out of here.

243
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,496
What's going on here?

244
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,166
Do you know what's
going on here?

245
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,674
Calm down, okay?

246
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,510
Everyone...

247
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,012
Hey! Hey!

248
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,049
We have light. Heat will follow.

249
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,123
I know that the circumstances
are less than ideal, but we...

250
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,392
Hey, there's something
wrong with this woman.

251
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,023
Help that lady. Help that lady.

252
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,792
It's a baby.

253
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,328
Agnes.

254
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,228
I'll hold her.

255
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,980
She was complaining
of a headache earlier.

256
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,131
Want me to get Dr. Kapoor?

257
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,370
He's stuck in an
elevator... With Hartman.

258
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,172
You're gonna have
to take care of her.

259
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,919
It's all right,
Dr. Sharpe. I've got her.

260
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:11,394
You can write .6 mg per minute.

261
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,523
Confirming he said
he was 162 pounds?

262
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,095
Confirmed.

263
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,000
I've never managed anesthesia
levels without a monitor before.

264
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,369
Hold my beer.

265
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,999
That's okay.

266
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,352
Though neither of you learned
these techniques in medical school,

267
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,504
I can assure you they've
been practiced for ages.

268
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,911
That said, you may
wanna stand back.

269
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,861
Hello, Agnes.

270
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,422
Hi, Dr. Kapoor.
Are you all right?

271
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,058
I'm fine. Better now.

272
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,395
I'm here, too.
Yes, he's here, too.

273
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,932
I need your help. BOTH: Mine?

274
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,442
Both of you, I think.

275
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,757
What's the matter with her?

276
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,046
She gave birth yesterday,
complained of a headache,

277
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,095
then collapsed when we
moved everyone up to the ICU.

278
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,384
Have you assessed her reflexes?

279
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,982
She has a motor deficit
of the left upper extremity

280
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,424
and left lower
extremity, sensory intact.

281
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,225
It sounds like an amniotic
stroke. What do I do?

282
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,665
Nothing. There's nothing you can
do, not until the power comes back on.

283
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,835
Get a 60cc syringe,

284
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,495
a 7 French catheter with
a metal tip, and a magnet.

285
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,899
A magnet? Yes. Hurry.

286
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,270
Okay, you're kidding, right?

287
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,954
The woman will die if
we don't try to help her.

288
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,913
Yeah, but we
don't have the tools.

289
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,173
You don't have the tools.

290
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,798
Where are your
maintenance people?

291
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,917
Uh, all but one were
sent home, and he's hurt.

292
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,288
Hurt trying to do the
job you want me to do?

293
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,921
Afraid so.

294
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,927
Is this your idea? Not remotely.

295
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,130
I'm gonna need a set of plans.

296
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,433
For the generator?

297
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,771
For the hospital.

298
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,114
Not exactly state
of the art. Yeah.

299
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,885
What exactly do you need
the plans for? He doesn't.

300
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,192
Hey, nothing gets
fixed in a vacuum.

301
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,330
An old building...

302
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,863
Could be a wiring issue.

303
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,837
Your man get fried on the pump?

304
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,034
Honestly, I'm not sure.

305
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,071
If you want me to, I can fix it.

306
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:42,638
I'm gonna need a
set of plans and, um...

307
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,381
And a reduced sentence.

308
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,485
Burl... Pardon from
the governor works, too.

309
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,318
Okay, we're done here. Let's go.

310
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,401
Hey, hey, hey. Hold on. Well,
how much longer do you think

311
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,635
the guards and the
prisoners are gonna play nice

312
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,371
if they're freezing to death?
- Look, Burl,

313
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,921
I'm not in a position
to negotiate terms.

314
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,162
Well, then I guess
people are gonna die.

315
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,032
Hold on. No, but you
don't want that, Burl.

316
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,162
None of us want to lose anyone.

317
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,868
Now, this man, whom I
know to be a good man,

318
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,068
he doesn't trust you.

319
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,771
But that's a familiar
scenario, isn't it?

320
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,516
You could be a
hero tonight, Burl.

321
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,388
I'm trusting you to come
through for everyone.

322
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,953
Has anyone ever
said that to you before?

323
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,288
Has anyone ever given
you that opportunity?

324
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,757
Burl, you said you
wanted to change, right?

325
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,364
This is it. This
is where it starts.

326
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,201
Okay.

327
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,973
I'll help.

328
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,774
But I need those plans...

329
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,616
And these off. No way.

330
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,978
Can't work tied up.

331
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,455
Okay, there's a set of
plans in my office closet.

332
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,592
Okay.

333
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,596
He's playing you, man.

334
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,433
Maybe, but tonight's not
gonna end well for anyone

335
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,803
if he can't get this
thing fixed, so Reyes,

336
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,234
please remove his restraints.

337
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,669
Right ventricle's exposed.
- Lung sounds bilateral.

338
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,267
In a traditional surgery, this is
where I'd stop the heart from beating.

339
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,371
But we can't do
that. No, we can't.

340
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,650
But you've been holding
the heart for a long time.

341
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,709
Perhaps you've got
the rhythm down right.

342
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,721
You want me to time each
suture to the relaxation phase.

343
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,222
Exactly.

344
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,527
Time to let go.

345
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,498
Um...

346
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,378
Can you slow him
down a bit more, Alicia?

347
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,640
Give me time to sew? I'll try.

348
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,083
Kat, I'm gonna need a 3.0
Prolene on a needle driver.

349
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,206
You're doing great.

350
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,379
It's not much
different, actually.

351
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,745
I mean, it is, but
I never realized

352
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,783
how much I relied on machines.

353
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,244
Doing it old-school like this

354
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,048
makes me think I might be a
better surgeon than I thought.

355
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,672
- Oh, no.
- Alicia?

356
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,062
What...

357
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,860
What are you...

358
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,544
Alicia... Alicia, get
him back under!

359
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,530
Sir?

360
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,632
Sir, we need to be
able to get through here.

361
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,943
She's hungry. I tried
giving the formula,

362
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,608
but she wouldn't take it.

363
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,414
She needs her mother.

364
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,286
His heart's racing!
Uh, I'm trying.

365
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,726
We need blood, O-neg.

366
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,509
There isn't any. We exhausted
the supply earlier tonight.

367
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,837
Then find some.
We're not losing him.

368
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,124
Sorry, can I have
everyone's attention?

369
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,244
Um, we have a, uh, medical
emergency in one of our operating rooms,

370
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,847
and we need, um,
type O-negative blood.

371
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:20,950
So, the process is quick
and relatively painless,

372
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,656
and, uh, you can
help save a life.

373
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,824
So if anybody knows that
they are O-negative already,

374
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,424
go ahead and,
um, raise your hand,

375
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,198
and we'll, um...

376
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,797
Uh...

377
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:45,484
Sorry, guys, but, um, I need
your attention just for a minute.

378
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,378
Would everybody look down?

379
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,790
Just look directly below you.

380
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:53,951
Um...

381
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,620
If you had X-ray vision,
what you would see

382
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,463
is our second-floor OR.

383
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,291
You would see a man
on the table in the dark.

384
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,393
His name is Hugh. Hugh is
having open-heart surgery right now,

385
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,165
in a no-electricity setting,
and he is running out of blood.

386
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,899
So however difficult
you're finding today,

387
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,911
I promise you, Hugh's
day is going a lot worse.

388
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,175
So, here, I will go first.

389
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,085
We're in the middle of a night

390
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,228
that we're gonna remember
for the rest of our lives.

391
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,722
We're gonna tell
the story of how,

392
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,756
in the worst blizzard New
York's seen in a century,

393
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,766
we were trapped in a hospital.

394
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:38,031
And it can be a story
about how tired and hungry

395
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,199
and cold and angry we were.

396
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,077
It can be a story
about how we couldn't

397
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,739
stop fighting with each other or
how Dr. Sharpe kept yelling at you.

398
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:53,678
Or it can be a story of how,

399
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,917
when every instinct
told us to be at our worst,

400
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,957
we were at our best.

401
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,083
And if we do that,

402
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,795
then maybe Hugh
gets to stick around

403
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,426
and tell that story, too.

404
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,530
So... would anyone
like a blood test?

405
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,136
Yeah, I will.

406
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,812
- Yes? Thank you.
- Yeah, me too.

407
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,439
Yeah? Great. Thanks.

408
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,486
You just see Casey right
here, and he'll help you out.

409
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,385
Thank you. Thank you.

410
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,953
Nice work, except
for the yelling part.

411
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,960
Mmm. You need to sit down.

412
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,828
Max, as your doctor... I'm fine.

413
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,165
You're not well. Thank
God for adrenaline.

414
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,663
Dr. Sharpe, the baby...

415
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,621
The introducer's in place.

416
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,522
Good. Now thread the
catheter into her arteries.

417
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:10,956
Done, now what?

418
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,624
Oh!

419
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,861
Dr. Kapoor?

420
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,799
What's wrong with you?

421
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,338
Oh, God, my foot is cramping.

422
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,005
I spent too long in the snow.

423
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,840
I need you to apply acupressure

424
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,279
to K-6 point, please.

425
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,945
On your foot?

426
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,882
Dr. Hartman, as you
often enjoy pointing out

427
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,853
that I'm not a young man,

428
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:40,154
I cannot contort
myself to do this.

429
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,770
So that's why you
treat me like garbage?

430
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,695
Because I made a couple
of jokes about your age?

431
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,624
More than a couple.

432
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,532
Okay, I got into neurosurgery
so I didn't have to touch

433
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,694
my patients' bodies,
much less their feet.

434
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,202
Dr. Kapoor?

435
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,301
If you don't help me,
I cannot help Agnes.

436
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,144
All you have to do is to
apply pressure between

437
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,240
the second and third metatarsal,

438
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,348
one third the way between
the MTP joint and calcaneus.

439
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,552
Please.

440
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,418
Oh, God. Yeah.

441
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,554
Open the laces, please.
Yeah, I have shoes.

442
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,491
Just calm down.

443
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:27,204
Without the socks, please.

444
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,005
There.

445
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,842
Gently.

446
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,755
- Put some pressure, no?
- Oh, my God.

447
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:43,948
I'm ready with the magnet.

448
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:47,925
Agnes, the baby needs to be fed.

449
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,028
Station her here. But
she's unconscious.

450
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,794
Well, I don't think
we have a choice.

451
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,473
When was this
place built? Uh, 1766.

452
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,108
You know, there used to be an
old swimming pool in the basement?

453
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,311
Uh...

454
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,578
No, I didn't. No, I did not.

455
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,714
Neat.

456
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:21,590
Damn it! Whoa, whoa! Wait!

457
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,889
Hold on. Burl?

458
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,157
Burl, are you all right?

459
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:27,664
What?

460
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,126
Well, you screamed.
Yeah. I got frustrated.

461
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,597
Okay.

462
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,301
Anyway, I think I
know what to do.

463
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,855
I'm gonna need
welding equipment.

464
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,172
Yeah, we can get that for you.

465
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,918
It shouldn't take me
more than 10 minutes.

466
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,278
All right.

467
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,841
Problem is, it's gonna
suck up a lot of your juice.

468
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,564
You said you had a portion of
the hospital running on a battery?

469
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,749
The ICU.

470
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,353
I'm gonna need that power.

471
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,584
If you can't fix it...

472
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,326
Then we'd all be done.

473
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,922
No more juice for anybody.

474
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,831
It's your call.

475
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:16,392
How can you put your faith
in this man, a violent man?

476
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,982
Well, his violence was
triggered by abuse at work

477
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,195
and years of beatings as a kid.

478
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,120
The guard will be
with him at all times.

479
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,816
He gets the power he needs, we
get New Amsterdam back on its feet.

480
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,655
It's the only way. No,
it is not the only way.

481
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,160
The latest emergency
bulletin said

482
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,561
the storm should
break around 5:00 a.m.

483
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,875
With the wind down, we could
get a helicopter on the roof

484
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,610
and a new generator. Yeah,
but there's no guarantee

485
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,829
the storm's gonna break.

486
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,304
As opposed to the iron certainty of
us trusting a homicidal electrician?

487
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,832
Uh, in a half an hour, the
battery will be dead regardless.

488
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,002
We may not be able to keep

489
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:47,569
our most critical patients
alive until 5:00 a.m.

490
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,013
Right, so your prisoner uses up
all of our existing power and fails,

491
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,228
and that's a half an hour
less time that we have to try.

492
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,863
Not to mention all the
people that we'd be putting

493
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,379
back into the cold. Just think
about the greater good, Max.

494
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,082
Yeah, I am, Helen. Okay?

495
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,751
I'm not signing off on any
plan that requires me to triage,

496
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,089
to give up on anyone.

497
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,027
Well, then you are
risking everyone's life.

498
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,498
I'm trying to save
everyone's life.

499
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,501
That is not possible.

500
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,263
Dr. Sharpe, please inform
everyone that in a few moments

501
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,740
the power will go down for
approximately 10 minutes.

502
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:20,370
After which, God willing, New
Amsterdam will be fully back online.

503
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,748
Okay?

504
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,588
What are you...

505
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,428
Kira...

506
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,568
What happened?

507
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,772
My arm. You've
had a mild stroke.

508
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,576
And my baby? How did she...

509
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,547
She's fine.

510
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,414
Agnes, it's time to
place the magnet

511
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:03,047
on the right side of
the patient's temple.

512
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,585
Okay.

513
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,816
And surely your
foot is better by now.

514
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,766
Of course, but you seem
to be happy holding it.

515
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:15,332
Okay, Agnes, now when you
feel the tug on the catheter,

516
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:18,404
you will know when
it's in the right place.

517
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,174
I feel it. It's working.

518
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:33,309
Good. You have Hartman
and his youthful fingers to thank.

519
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,661
Okay, this is all the welding
gear that we could find.

520
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:49,201
Yeah, we got this thing
and whatever this thing is.

521
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,669
I thought you grew up on a
farm. Yeah, I can make that work.

522
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,164
How can we help?

523
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,140
Run the cables
up to the battery.

524
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,441
Okay. Yeah, I'm on it.

525
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:03,015
And then you should all go
out in the hall before I light this.

526
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,614
So you don't, you know, blow up.

527
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,484
Thank you. No, thank you.

528
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:14,356
The minute you're
done with this little game,

529
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:17,019
I'm dragging your ass
off to a cold, dark corner.

530
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,192
You understand me? Reyes.

531
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,820
All right, everybody,
here we go.

532
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,524
<i>Think about it</i>

533
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:54,032
<i>There must be a higher love</i>

534
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,396
<i>Down in the heart</i>

535
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,699
<i>Or hidden in the stars above</i>

536
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,533
<i>Without it</i>

537
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,900
<i>Life is wasted time</i>

538
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,546
<i>Look inside your heart</i>

539
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:10,412
<i>I'll look inside of mine</i>

540
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:15,110
<i>Things look so bad everywhere</i>

541
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:20,082
<i>In this whole world What's fair?</i>

542
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,022
<i>We walk blind, we try to see</i>

543
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,096
<i>Falling behind in what could be</i>

544
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,907
<i>Bring me a higher love</i>

545
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,943
<i>Bring me a higher love</i>

546
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,606
<i>Bring me a higher love</i>

547
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,949
<i>I could rise above</i>

548
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,452
<i>On a higher love</i>

549
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,457
Is he done?

550
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,895
Yeah, I guess.

551
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,101
Hey, Burl, you okay
in there, buddy?

552
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,131
Burl?

553
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,806
Burl, hey, buddy. How you doing?

554
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,279
Uh...

555
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,957
Damn it. I told you.

556
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,364
Max. Max!

557
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,995
Where you going?

558
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,987
Where's Henry? In the ICU.

559
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,851
Where's his notebook?
He had a notebook.

560
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,221
He was making notes.
We can wake him up,

561
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,468
he can look at
them with fresh eyes,

562
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,484
and then we can come
up with a different plan,

563
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,553
a better plan, and
we can fix it. Okay?

564
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,863
'Cause there's
still time to fix...

565
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,456
Damn it! Max.

566
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,900
Just stop.

567
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,979
It's nearly 2:00 a.m.

568
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,178
Hopefully the
storm breaks at five.

569
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:33,147
And that gives us at least three hours
to disburse extremely limited resources,

570
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,194
but you and I need to
decide which patients

571
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,388
are gonna get them
and which ones aren't.

572
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,930
That's not who we are.

573
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,697
No, but it's where we are.

574
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,330
Helen... Max.

575
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,572
We have no power,
no blood, it's freezing...

576
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,838
That doesn't mean
someone has to die.

577
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,342
But someone will.

578
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,753
That's just a fact now.

579
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:06,082
Your job is no longer
to save everyone.

580
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:09,389
It's to try and minimize the
damage. Do you understand that?

581
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,092
I thought it would work.

582
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:22,469
I just couldn't see a
scenario where it didn't.

583
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:26,938
I know.

584
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,809
But now we have to choose...

585
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,817
who to let go.

586
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:40,785
I can't...

587
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,424
Choose.

588
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,230
I won't.

589
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,270
Then I will.

590
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,650
The city's still out.

591
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,281
That means the generator...

592
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,362
We got power. Hook him up.

593
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,031
Assess the ABCs.

594
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,342
Continue monitoring
manually until...

595
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,883
Come on, man. You just
have to hang on a bit longer.

596
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,681
Okay, the catheter's
all the way in.

597
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,340
End of the line.

598
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,328
Good, Agnes. You're
doing a wonderful job.

599
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,516
All you have to do now is
to attach the syringe and...

600
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,853
Dr. Kapoor?

601
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,485
Agnes?

602
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,791
And what?

603
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,072
I've got this.

604
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,611
Where's the blood?

605
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:57,026
Kira, try to move
your left arm for me.

606
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,602
Thank you.

607
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:08,799
Thank you.

608
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,643
Hey. Hey.

609
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,947
How'd you get us
the juice? I didn't.

610
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,653
Okay.

611
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:29,956
Hey.

612
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,988
Did you fix the...

613
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,209
Welding wasn't gonna fix that.

614
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,668
I couldn't tell you that or Reyes
would have dragged me off.

615
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,081
I just figured if this place
had an old swimming pool,

616
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,631
it might have a fuel pump
system I could switch out.

617
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,239
It did.

618
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,673
What do you want?

619
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,949
Anything. I'll make it happen.

620
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:57,954
I wanna get better.

621
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,849
<i>Think about it</i>

622
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,862
<i>There must be higher love</i>

623
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:06,959
<i>Down in the heart</i>

624
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:09,866
<i>Or hidden in the stars above</i>

625
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,793
<i>Without it</i>

626
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,338
<i>Life is wasted time</i>

627
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,768
<i>Look inside your heart</i>

628
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,641
<i>I'll look inside of mine</i>

629
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:25,679
<i>Things look so bad everywhere</i>

630
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:30,545
<i>In this whole world what's fair?</i>

631
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:35,459
<i>We walk blind, we try to see</i>

632
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:40,697
<i>Falling behind in what could be</i>

633
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:45,469
<i>Bring me a higher love</i>

634
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,667
<i>Bring me a higher love</i>

635
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:52,973
Oh, and the baseboards...

636
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:56,709
Never another speck of dust.

637
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,681
Did you tell him about
the towels? Three folds?

638
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,381
How do you know about
that? You wanted to tell him.

639
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,358
And I'm gonna
fold all the towels

640
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,418
just the way you
don't like them.

641
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,262
Uh, I was brilliant
last night, wasn't I?

642
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,858
Oh, yes, exceptional

643
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,370
with all your
years in the field.

644
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,436
Thank you.

645
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,233
You were bloody
magnificent last night.

646
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,297
I just said "bloody."

647
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,904
I could think of a better
expression under the circumstances.

648
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,870
It's a UK thing.

649
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,073
So I've heard.

650
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,405
Mmm-hmm.

651
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,742
Really.

652
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:10,044
There's no way I would have
gotten through it without you.

653
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,153
We make a good team.

654
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:22,159
That's what I wanted to
speak to you about, actually...

655
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:25,637
before the power went out.

656
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:35,110
This thing where I am your
deputy and your doctor...

657
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,015
and your confidante
and your friend...

658
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,014
That is a lot. Yeah, it is.

659
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,518
And it's not working.

660
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:55,157
All last night, we needed
to choose who to save,

661
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,129
and every time, you
chose all of the above.

662
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,935
Yeah, I... No,
that's not a criticism.

663
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,168
I'm glad you did.
You saved everyone.

664
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,137
We saved everyone. Yes.

665
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,014
It worked out, but
sometimes it doesn't.

666
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,553
Sometimes you have to choose...

667
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,618
And you couldn't.

668
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,686
You just said it all
worked out, and...

669
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,293
I don't see what me not
triaging patients has to do with...

670
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,570
with us.

671
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,008
It's what you do with
your cancer as well.

672
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,015
You wanna stay
healthy for your family,

673
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:48,925
but you want to stay in
charge of the hospital.

674
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,148
You want the chemo,
the strongest that we have,

675
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,589
just not any of the side
effects that come with it.

676
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,751
From the day this began,

677
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,488
from the day we met,

678
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,089
you have refused to choose.

679
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,159
I'm not refusing,
it's not that easy.

680
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,064
Look, Helen, all I want is...

681
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,369
Max.

682
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,379
You want everything.

683
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,278
It's who you are.

684
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:26,515
You are all of the above.

685
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:30,889
And then you come to
me with these demands,

686
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,761
these inspiring...

687
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,432
completely impossible demands,

688
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,128
and I don't know who
I'm supposed to be.

689
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,569
You're supposed to be you.

690
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:41,936
I've tried.

691
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:46,203
I have tried to be
all of the above.

692
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,773
I can't.

693
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,615
I can't be your
friend and your doctor

694
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,620
and your deputy,
so I have to choose.

695
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,782
I have to triage us.

696
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,417
I'm gonna ask Dr. Stauton

697
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,224
to take over for me. No.

698
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,629
She's an exceptional
oncologist. No, no! You don't...

699
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:08,876
She'll be your new doctor, Max.

700
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,062
She'll handle your care,
effective immediately.

701
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,403
But what if I want you?

702
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,151
Well, I'm afraid that's
no longer an option.

703
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,487
Because we all want you.
