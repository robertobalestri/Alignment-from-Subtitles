1
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,431
<i>Previously on</i> New Amsterdam...

2
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:08,373
His name was Muhammad.
He asked me to marry him.

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,441
You broke up? Brain aneurysm.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,070
I still miss him.

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,757
I told you about the songs I'm
writing? Well, I'd love to make a demo.

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,682
I was wondering if you
could... Give you money?

7
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,079
I don't think it's a good idea.

8
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,116
I have plans with Ella.

9
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,116
Ella? Thanks for introducing us.

10
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,856
I've been taking a little bit
more Adderall than prescribed.

11
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,191
I think that I need to report
an impaired physician.

12
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,400
Don't forget to go over the rib.

13
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,102
The vein, the artery and
the nerve run under, okay?

14
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,006
All right. Here we go.

15
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:19,803
What you got?

16
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,246
EMS notification,
diabetic coma on the way.

17
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,144
Ooh, sounds interesting.

18
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,947
I thought you had a VIP patient.

19
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,231
Ah, that's after my shift.
I've got time to take one more.

20
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,348
Of course you do.

21
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:34,085
Allison Medrano, 68-year-old
fishing boat captain

22
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,097
with type two diabetes. Rescued
by Coast Guard, unconscious.

23
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,996
Finger stick blood sugar, 745.

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,536
She's received 10 units sub-Q
times four, but she's still unresponsive.

25
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,934
Found these in her pocket.

26
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,830
Diabetes meds prescribed
by a Dr. Jessica Medrano.

27
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,303
She's a primary
care doctor here.

28
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:51,872
This could be her mom.

29
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,211
Let's page Max and Dr. Medrano,
and let's get her into Trauma One.

30
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,325
What are you doing?

31
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,032
Do you see that man?

32
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,165
He's my son.

33
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,542
And you hiding all the
way over here because?

34
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,671
If you believe two people are
together for the wrong reason,

35
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,014
it's your responsibility
to... Oh, no, no, no.

36
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,848
No. No. I'm gonna
stop you right there.

37
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,150
See, as a rule, I
don't do family drama.

38
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,750
So, if you wanna talk about
that, I recommend you talk to Iggy.

39
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,522
Iggy is busy all day, and
there is no family drama.

40
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,924
Then why are you hiding?

41
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,864
Because I need
to see if my son is...

42
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,163
No, no. No family drama, man.

43
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:51,865
Look, my only advice for you,
stay out of your boy's dating life.

44
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,434
Hey, you want a coffee, Vijay?

45
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,777
Blood pH of 7.19.

46
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,282
Blood sugar still over 700.

47
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,011
Injecting 10 more
units of insulin.

48
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,682
Mom. Hey.

49
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,882
Can I get some water?

50
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,621
Uh, absolutely.
Uh. Casey? On it.

51
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,222
Ms. Medrano, you're at
New Amsterdam Hospital,

52
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,856
and I will be happy to answer
any questions you might have.

53
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,059
Where's my boat?

54
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,902
Except for that one. I... I
don't know what that means.

55
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,381
Ah, she's captain
of a fishing boat.

56
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,566
Seriously?

57
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,539
What? You expecting
a peg leg and a parrot?

58
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,273
No, but, uh, that'd be cool.

59
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,979
I just didn't realize there were
any of you left in New York City.

60
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,717
There's not. Industry
moved on, she didn't.

61
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,579
Huh.

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,112
Fishing boat captain in
New York City. That's...

63
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,255
That's a throwback.
What an interesting job.

64
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,588
Mmm-hmm.

65
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,286
Excuse me.

66
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,962
He, uh, does that sometimes.

67
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,298
Nourishment Consultant,
Media Distribution Officer,

68
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,739
pneumatic tube repair?

69
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,248
What do these people even do?
Aren't you the Medical Director?

70
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,677
Aren't you supposed to know?

71
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,273
Oh!

72
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,638
Hello.

73
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,282
<i>Has anyone here
ever met a chiropodist?</i>

74
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,896
Of course you haven't,
because they don't exist.

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,355
But 100 years ago, there
was a whole department

76
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,516
full of them cutting
people's toenails.

77
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,187
But the field evolved and
chiropody was absorbed into podiatry.

78
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,355
Chiropodists became obsolete.

79
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,193
Why are we talking
about chiropodists?

80
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,528
Because you're firing us?

81
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,093
No.

82
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,801
We're talking about chiropodists

83
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,534
not just because it's a
really fun word to say,

84
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,200
but because I'm willing to bet
that right here, at New Amsterdam,

85
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,440
there are people whose jobs
are obsolete, bogus, wasted.

86
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,345
Jobs that aren't
really jobs at all.

87
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:45,180
But just because your job is
obsolete, doesn't mean you are.

88
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,287
Wait. Are you firing us? No.

89
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,317
I wanna find people whose
talents are being wasted

90
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,690
and give them meaningful work. I
wanna give them jobs that matter.

91
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,729
Every time a patient
walks out our doors,

92
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,457
our people should
feel like they contributed

93
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,967
to that patient's
success. And no...

94
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,500
I am not firing anybody.

95
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,698
Every department is
gonna try this experiment.

96
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,900
Just for one day, stop working.

97
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,035
Just sit there, stand
there, don't do anything.

98
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,874
And if nobody misses what you do

99
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,414
or needs you to do
something for one whole day,

100
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,347
then your job may be obsolete.

101
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,545
Clearly not talking
about those people.

102
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,488
But if it is you, come to me.
I wanna find you a new job.

103
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,051
A job that inspires you, a
job that makes a difference,

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,155
a job that makes you an integral
part of New Amsterdam's mission.

105
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,938
Dr. Panthaki?

106
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,869
Dr. Sharpe.

107
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,272
Fancy meeting you here.

108
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,944
Yeah. Well, no.

109
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,071
No?

110
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,148
Uh, I came here to see a patient,
and I thought I'd stop by and say hi.

111
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,396
I walked by your office, but
they said you were on the floor,

112
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,854
so here I am,

113
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,751
casually bumping into you,
accidentally on purpose.

114
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,716
I see.

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,520
I can also accidentally
on purpose leave.

116
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,062
No, I'm glad that you
decided to stop by.

117
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,929
Accidentally on purpose.

118
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,436
And would you consider
joining me on an adventure?

119
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,735
An adventure?

120
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,099
It's a small adventure.

121
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,602
Do you like Radiohead?

122
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,140
Yes. Love them.

123
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,910
Then we'll need to be on a train
from Penn Station in a few hours.

124
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,745
Why? Where are we going?

125
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:27,712
Philadelphia.

126
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,079
So, we'd be staying overnight?

127
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,718
We would be.

128
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,156
You know, yeah, no, I can't
do that right now, with you.

129
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,062
Okay. I mean,

130
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,667
I want to eventually,
but I'm just...

131
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,235
Helen, I'll make you a bootleg.

132
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,577
Well, I'm still not 100% sure

133
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,618
as to why Ms. Medrano
collapsed on the ship.

134
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,620
Did her blood sugar spike
before or after her fall?

135
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,087
That's the million
dollar question.

136
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:05,520
So, this must be some VIP for
you to drag me all the way up here.

137
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,251
It is.

138
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,324
So, who's the patient?

139
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,023
You are.

140
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,337
Yeah. Hey! Dora!

141
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,274
Hold on.

142
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,679
I just wanna take in this
momentous occasion.

143
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:35,446
What... What occasion?
The day you chased after me.

144
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,014
I wanna remember
everything. What I was wearing.

145
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,924
Where I was standing...
You haven't texted me.

146
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:41,556
Nope. Or paged me.

147
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,685
Did you miss me?

148
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,940
Well, I just figured
by now people would...

149
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,208
People would admit that they
were getting paid to not work?

150
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,511
That's not exactly... And that
they would ask you for work,

151
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,299
when they could just
keep on doing nothing.

152
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,635
That's not really in the
spirit of what I'm trying...

153
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,572
If it was me, no
way I'd tell you.

154
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,065
Max.

155
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,143
What's going on
with, um, you know?

156
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,146
She's with Iggy.

157
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,553
I think I'm gonna be sick.

158
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,046
You did the right thing.

159
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,327
As a doctor, sure. But as a
friend, I absolutely did not.

160
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,657
You absolutely did.

161
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:19,260
As a doctor, and as a friend.

162
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,845
All right. Feel free to sit.

163
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,569
I'm fine.

164
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,272
Okay.

165
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,245
All right.

166
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,754
So, it says here

167
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,191
you went to Whitman College.

168
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,616
Yep.

169
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,559
All the way up in Walla
Walla, Washington, huh?

170
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,055
Did you like it?

171
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,691
Loved it.

172
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,625
Why there?

173
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,734
Well, I guess it's because I
thought that they would prepare me

174
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,741
for a career in
lifesaving medicine.

175
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,211
One which I would love
to get back to right now,

176
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,277
unless you're gonna tell
me what this is all about.

177
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,438
Okay.

178
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:12,245
Somebody reported that you
have a problem with Adderall.

179
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,546
Sharpe.

180
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,867
I'm not at liberty to
discuss that with you.

181
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,915
Please.

182
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,052
So, do you?

183
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,419
Do I what?

184
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,292
Do you have a
problem with Adderall?

185
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,927
No. Okay.

186
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,455
Do you have any idea why
someone would suggest that you do?

187
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,074
Look, I spoke to Sharpe
about a personal matter,

188
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,632
a minor personal matter,

189
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,269
and she has blown it
way out of proportion.

190
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,603
Right, well,

191
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,306
can you tell me about
the personal matter?

192
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,440
No.

193
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,610
Why not?

194
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,319
Because it's personal.

195
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,785
And because quite
frankly, this whole ambush

196
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,453
is unbelievably insulting, and
I'm done pretending like it isn't.

197
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,357
I wouldn't do that.

198
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,971
I have been empowered
by the hospital to determine

199
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,269
if you've been operating
as an impaired physician.

200
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,622
And if you have a problem with Adderall,
I will tell Max and he'll report it

201
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:14,670
to the medical board.

202
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,775
So, what, if I leave,
I'm suspended?

203
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,049
No, if you leave, you're fired.

204
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,689
Dr. Reynolds. Dr. Goodwin.

205
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,027
I need a consult.
What's the case?

206
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,643
Allison Medrano, let's just call
her a "non-compliant diabetic."

207
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,226
Hemoglobin A1C off the chart?

208
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,848
Yeah, and I wanna make sure her collapse
wasn't due to a silent heart attack.

209
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,683
Okay, I'll stop by after
the rounds. Thank you.

210
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,618
Oh, by the way, heard about
your speech this morning.

211
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,019
You got someone for
me in your department?

212
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,978
No, everyone in my
department is on overdrive.

213
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,557
But did you know there's a guy in
the basement who still prints X-rays?

214
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,708
X-rays?

215
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,411
Went digital a decade ago.

216
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,346
Well, that's why you
should check on him.

217
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,251
Hello?

218
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,553
Need an X-ray?

219
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,324
Does that thing still work?

220
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,227
What, the XR180? Oh, yeah.

221
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,999
And I like to keep it nice
and shiny, just in case.

222
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,032
When was the last time someone
ordered an old-fashioned X-ray from you?

223
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,570
Uh, 2008, give or take.

224
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:24,582
So, you just been
down here since 2008?

225
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,543
Doing what?

226
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,548
Am I about to get fired?

227
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,117
Do you like your job?

228
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,689
Oh. I used to.

229
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,928
I loved it, actually.
Everybody needed me.

230
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,295
Docs used to say nobody handled
radiograph paper better than I did.

231
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,430
I'm Max Goodwin, I'm
the Medical Director here.

232
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,561
Oh, nuts.

233
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,232
I am gonna get fired. No.

234
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,436
No, I'd like to
find you a new job.

235
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,877
A job that makes
you feel needed again.

236
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:54,971
Would you be interested?

237
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,549
It's like you can
see right through me.

238
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,093
It's an X-ray joke. X-ray joke.

239
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,420
It's great. What do you say?

240
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,828
You know, with technology being
what it is and me being as old as I am,

241
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:13,961
I think I'm just gonna
ride it out until retirement.

242
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,002
I mean, if you're not firing me.

243
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:20,997
Rohan.

244
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:23,666
Papa.

245
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:27,641
You came all the way down here
and won't say <i>namaste</i> to your father?

246
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,147
I didn't wanna bother you.

247
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,411
Bother? No, no.

248
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,682
I want to apologize
to you, <i>beta.</i>

249
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,012
For what?

250
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,650
I, know I've hurt
your feelings before,

251
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,486
when I refused to
support your music.

252
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,158
I should have been
more supportive of you.

253
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,770
That doesn't mean that you
use Ella to get back at me.

254
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,361
What?

255
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,579
Yeah, she doesn't need to be
dragged into our family business.

256
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,099
Is that what you
think is going on?

257
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,213
That I'm using her? I
am trying to protect her.

258
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,673
Excuse me.

259
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,143
I'm hanging out with Ella
because I actually like her.

260
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,928
Not that it's any
of your business.

261
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,096
I think you are
misunderstanding me.

262
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,055
No, I'm understanding
you just fine.

263
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,482
And I know it's hard for
you to comprehend, Papa,

264
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,388
but the reason I could stay
sober for a year was that

265
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,897
I didn't have to
deal with this. I...

266
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,066
I didn't have to deal with you.

267
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,342
Jessica, you should move
back to Sheepshead Bay.

268
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,182
Mom, I'd love to,
but my job is here.

269
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,892
You know, most parents would
be proud their kid's a doctor.

270
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,219
Well, there's something
to be said about tradition.

271
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,264
Our family has a tradition...

272
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,095
Of diabetes, heart
disease, lung cancer.

273
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,997
People gotta die of something.

274
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,735
Allison Medrano, I need
you to get back inside.

275
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,100
Who the hell are
you? Your doctor.

276
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,911
Since when? Well,

277
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,105
since you had to be
evaluated for heart disease.

278
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,714
Dr. Medrano. Dr. Reynolds,

279
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,093
thank you for taking
care of my mom.

280
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,348
I don't need taking care of.

281
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,530
We're gonna do a full workup,

282
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,682
but I need you to get
back inside first, all right?

283
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,084
Yeah, yeah. Mom.

284
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:24,855
Mom! Hold on. Hold on.

285
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,562
I need a stretcher out here!

286
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,859
Okay.

287
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,438
You get what's
ironic about this?

288
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,945
No. Help me out.

289
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,780
I have a prescription
for Adderall.

290
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,815
I mean, the risk would be in
me not taking my medication.

291
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,250
You know, I'd be, like,
mid appendectomy,

292
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,055
getting distracted by
how the appendix looks

293
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,390
like a giant shrimp.

294
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:57,823
So, you find it ironic

295
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,434
that you've been placed in jeopardy
by a tool that helps you succeed?

296
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,831
No. No, I find it ironic
that I'm being persecuted

297
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,499
by a psychiatrist for taking a
medication prescribed by a psychiatrist.

298
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,504
That was harsh. I know
you're not persecuting me.

299
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:15,775
It's okay. It's fine.

300
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,241
It's just...

301
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,411
I've got ADHD.

302
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,818
I've taken Adderall, as
prescribed, since I was 12.

303
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,416
It's a nonissue.

304
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,084
Yeah.

305
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,488
And you've never taken more
than your prescribed dose?

306
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,998
I'm sure I have doubled
up by accident, okay?

307
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:38,866
Double shifts, the days,
they can just run in together.

308
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,439
But you've never
taken it just to...

309
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,352
You know, just to
get through the day?

310
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,277
No. Hard no.

311
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,370
You sure about that?

312
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,147
You can't run an ED
propped up on pills, okay?

313
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,982
It's unethical and
I wouldn't do it.

314
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,683
So, your drug use has never
led to the harm of a patient?

315
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,656
Oh, you know what?
I've killed thousands.

316
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,154
I just... I get high and I start
stabbing people with my scalpel.

317
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,370
This isn't personal, Bloom.
I'm not trying to insult you.

318
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,296
You're asking me if I've ever risked
a patient's life because I'm stoned.

319
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,502
Yeah, and you haven't
answered the question.

320
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,574
Because if I had, we
wouldn't be here right now.

321
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,068
I would have turned
in my license, okay?

322
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,913
No, I have never harmed a
patient because of Adderall.

323
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,720
Do you remember LaDavius Powell?

324
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,391
LaDavius Powell?
That ring a bell?

325
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,430
It's a patient of yours that
came in, allergic to Cephalkem.

326
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,569
You prescribed it anyway.

327
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,586
If your nurse hadn't
have caught the mistake...

328
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,102
No, that's not the whole story.

329
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,680
So... No?

330
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,520
Earlier you assumed that
it was one single doctor

331
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,525
that voiced concern.
That's not the case.

332
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,158
Multiple people have complained
that you're having problems.

333
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,905
You're making mistakes
on your patient reports.

334
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,804
Your reaction time has slipped.

335
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,307
Your behavior has been erratic.

336
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,107
And this mistake you made
with LaDavius Powell could have

337
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,113
very easily cost him his life.

338
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,647
And now, you've sat there
and looked me in the eyes,

339
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,778
and you've lied to me about it.

340
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,559
What part of the
story am I missing?

341
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,454
What have I got wrong?

342
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,667
You said, in your own words,

343
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,799
if your drug use ever led
to the harm of a patient,

344
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,669
you would turn in your license.

345
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,411
So, what are you waiting for?

346
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,349
It's okay. I've got this.

347
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,785
Right.

348
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:22,859
Oh, boy. She was smoking.
Collapsed with a blood sugar of over 700.

349
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,029
It took 100 units of
insulin to bring her back.

350
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,337
So, it's the high blood sugar.

351
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,279
Well, we still don't know
why it keeps spiking.

352
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,476
What if it's the smoking?

353
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,647
Yeah, smoking's bad for you.

354
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,008
What if she has a carcinoid
tumor being stimulated by nicotine?

355
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,517
Just now when she
collapsed, she was smoking.

356
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,186
On the boat when she
collapsed, she was smoking.

357
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,268
What if the nicotine from the
cigarettes is squeezing the tumor,

358
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,936
making it kick out huge
amounts of glucagon,

359
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,486
and that is what is driving the
blood sugar through the roof?

360
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,624
Well, I did a CT on AI's abdomen
and her chest, and no tumor.

361
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,327
But all of her
symptoms point to it.

362
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:56,828
Except it's not there.

363
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,896
So, do exploratory
surgery and find it.

364
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,066
Who does exploratory
surgery anymore?

365
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,845
We do when we know
something's wrong.

366
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,140
Mr. Harris.

367
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,185
Pardon me? Ah, you're from
the Med Co-Op Group, right?

368
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,686
Actually, I'm just...

369
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,423
Uh, I've been
here for nine years.

370
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,991
I kept you waiting that long?

371
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,082
No.

372
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,858
Uh, I heard your speech today.

373
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,749
I think I've got one
of those obsolete jobs.

374
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:31,568
So, uh, what's your
job? To sit there.

375
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,940
Before the arm showed up, I sat
in a booth and checked badges.

376
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,834
I was the guy you
said good morning to,

377
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,878
asked about the traffic
down from Westchester.

378
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,277
Always packed on the FTR,
no matter what time of day.

379
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,508
But go down Second
Ave before 7:00 a.m.,

380
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,210
not so bad. Good to know.

381
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,516
But since the arm, people
don't even notice me.

382
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,247
I wanna do more than
sit in a chair all day.

383
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,757
I know I can do more.

384
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,384
See, you're exactly
who I'm looking for.

385
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,121
Uh, Dr. Goodwin...
No, you are the reason

386
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,858
I started this
search. Dr. Goodwin.

387
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,195
Yeah? You're in her way.

388
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,869
Sorry. So what's my
new job gonna be?

389
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,199
I have no idea.

390
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,775
So, now what?

391
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,387
Well, now I'd like to
hear about your life before

392
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,754
your Adderall use began.

393
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,087
Are you seriously asking me
to talk about my childhood?

394
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,427
Or I could just file
my report right now.

395
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,796
Fine.

396
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,675
Well, my mom was a disaster,

397
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,642
my sister, worse, and
my dad was a saint.

398
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,274
There you go.

399
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,610
There you go.

400
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,086
Okay, well, how was
your mom a disaster?

401
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,797
She was an alcoholic.

402
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,193
I'm sorry.

403
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,836
Yeah, well, "boo-hoo," right?

404
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,470
She was, uh...

405
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,278
She was part of this...

406
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:26,146
This tacky nouveau riche
Upper East Side crowd.

407
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,279
Everybody knew she drank.

408
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,347
But it didn't matter,

409
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,117
'cause Jeanie was so fun.

410
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,354
Her parties were fabulous.

411
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,223
Yeah, but then the
party ended, right?

412
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,490
Yeah.

413
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,330
That it did.

414
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,301
Then she'd start complaining.

415
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,170
About how Mr. Benson
wouldn't flirt with her,

416
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,343
or how the Dover sole was dry.

417
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,715
Always something.

418
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,853
And she'd get mean.

419
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,388
Was there physical abuse?

420
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,818
No.

421
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,363
Would she get sick
after she drank?

422
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,094
Yeah?

423
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,568
Who'd take her to
bed? Who'd clean up?

424
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:24,404
That'd be me.

425
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,403
What about your
sister? She help?

426
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,341
I didn't need help.

427
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,718
Someone had to clean
her up, so I cleaned her up.

428
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,553
How old were you the
first time that happened?

429
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,849
I don't know.

430
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:40,919
Ballpark.

431
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,859
Seven, maybe.

432
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,093
Oh.

433
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,261
You've been taking care of people long
before you became an ED doctor, huh?

434
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,264
Yeah.

435
00:22:56,408 --> 00:23:01,312
Well, that's the silver lining of
having Hurricane Jeanie for a mom.

436
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,376
You learn how to
be good in a crisis.

437
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:07,643
Yeah, I bet.

438
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,588
Sounds like your dad left
you in quite a tricky situation.

439
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,225
I didn't say that.

440
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:21,892
No.

441
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,726
You didn't say
much about him at all.

442
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,260
My dad...

443
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,605
My dad took a two-bit
dermatology practice

444
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,008
and he turned it into a
million-dollar business.

445
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:34,803
That's amazing.

446
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,938
Yeah, he was gone a lot,

447
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:39,176
but when I called,

448
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,652
he always answered. Every time.

449
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:47,623
So, you can dial back the
Freudian horse-crap, okay?

450
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,492
There's nothing Freudian about
saying that he neglected you.

451
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,455
He was an amazing dad.

452
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,265
He wasn't the alcoholic.

453
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:01,099
He wasn't the one
pissing on the carpet.

454
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,664
He wasn't the one
vomiting on himself.

455
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:07,172
No, he was the one who left a
second-grader alone to deal with it.

456
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,209
Because he knew what
you already told me.

457
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,547
Someone always
has to clean it up.

458
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,390
You just described him as an
emotionally closed-off workaholic

459
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:22,392
who was in complete denial
that his personal life was on fire.

460
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:26,460
Who does that sound like?

461
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,574
Dr. Goodwin. Yeah?

462
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,457
I've been emailing the powers
that be at New Amsterdam

463
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,246
about my useless job for
years. And nothing. No response.

464
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,695
I don't even feel bad
about taking a paycheck

465
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,880
for doing nothing anymore,

466
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,831
but you should know that
because I tried to contact someone,

467
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,881
New Amsterdam legally
can't take that money back.

468
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,535
I wouldn't even try, but
what's your obsolete job?

469
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,583
Tech. Cool.

470
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,804
In the accounting
department. Ah!

471
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,539
Whenever FlashPay has
any kind of software update,

472
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,523
it's my job to install it
on every single computer

473
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,876
throughout the whole hospital.
That sounds like a very important job.

474
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,064
It was five years ago, when New
Amsterdam still used FlashPay.

475
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,915
Now only one person in
the whole hospital uses it.

476
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,032
Who's that? Me.

477
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,584
When I update it
on all the computers.

478
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,270
I'll find you a new job. Great.

479
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:13,005
So, what'll that be? No idea.

480
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,710
Systolic 140, pulse ox 97.

481
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,732
Popcorn on a stick.
- Lap sponge.

482
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,356
Wet wrap the whole tip.

483
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,783
You see anything?

484
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:33,024
Nothing. We visualized
the entire abdomen.

485
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,389
Yeah.

486
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,378
I can't believe we let
Dr. Goodwin talk us into this.

487
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:39,634
He thought a carcinoid
tumor fit all her symptoms.

488
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,370
Well, he was wrong.

489
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,638
Fresh ESU pencil on the tray.

490
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,407
I'm gonna run the bowel.

491
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,040
All 23 feet of it? Yep.

492
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,545
Then you're crazier than he is.

493
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,921
Hey, man of the hour.

494
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,122
Your son is the sweetest.

495
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,543
We have been
having the best time.

496
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,092
We're gonna go to
Battery Park tonight.

497
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,395
Yes.

498
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,735
About Rohan...

499
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,737
It appears I may have hurt
my son's feelings this morning.

500
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,340
Oh.

501
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:25,312
Unintentionally, of course,
but I wanted to clear things up

502
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,513
before you heard
his side of the story.

503
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,114
There are sides?

504
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,189
Not exactly. It's just...

505
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,127
I was looking out
for you, you see?

506
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,964
Uh, trying to protect you.

507
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,999
Why would I need protecting?

508
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:48,171
I was concerned that my son had
taken an interest in you simply to...

509
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,433
To hurt me.

510
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,107
Why would you think that?

511
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,517
Because of a
disagreement we had.

512
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,446
Or because you don't think

513
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,649
your son could be interested
in someone like me?

514
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,715
Well, no, I just...

515
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,025
Because you actually thought
the only reason Rohan would

516
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,895
ever be interested in me is if he
was using me to get back at you?

517
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,863
No, that's not what I meant.

518
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,373
Well, you must have meant it on
some level or you wouldn't have said it.

519
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,305
I fear there has been a
profound misunderstanding here...

520
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,740
No, I think I heard
you loud and clear.

521
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,411
Hi. Welcome to Pain
de Vie. Excuse me.

522
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:27,702
Hi.

523
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,645
I'll get a small latte.

524
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,717
Sure. Is whole milk okay?

525
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,488
You know, this is why
no one likes therapists.

526
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,192
You're taking my
life and you're...

527
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,501
You're twisting it around.

528
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:52,538
Okay, well, then help me
out. Tell me a different story.

529
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,062
Help me understand.

530
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,504
All right, how about this?

531
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,743
Dad saved himself from
an impossible situation.

532
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,446
No, he was not perfect,

533
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:04,073
but I never doubted
that he loved me.

534
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,712
So, you can come at me all day, but
I'm not blaming him for my mistakes.

535
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,588
I'm not blaming him
for your mistakes, either.

536
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,182
He did the best he could,
for as long as he could.

537
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,404
Did you hear me? I'm not
blaming him for your mistakes.

538
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,693
Okay, so why the hell are
we still talking about this?

539
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,757
Because you went to Whitman
College in Walla Walla, Washington.

540
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,678
You literally could have
gone anywhere else,

541
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,534
but you went all the
way across the country.

542
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,470
Family psychological histories
are a lot like genetic ones,

543
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,237
and you have the
gene for running.

544
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,471
So, I'm asking you,

545
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,611
what are you running from?

546
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:46,982
You're right.

547
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,088
I'm like my dad.

548
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,321
We both ran.

549
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,766
And yeah, he was
running from my mom.

550
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,502
But I am not running
from, I am running to.

551
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,265
I'm an ED doctor.

552
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,969
I run to crisis.

553
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,772
I mean, I run to help people.

554
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:12,748
And yeah, you know what?
My childhood, it sucked.

555
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,252
But it made me who I am.

556
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:18,988
And this hospital
is lucky to have me.

557
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,759
Okay.

558
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,130
Thank you for that.

559
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,457
Do you think you can get
your Adderall under control?

560
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,138
Yes.

561
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,449
And do you think that
practicing medicine

562
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,143
is the best thing
for your recovery?

563
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,315
I know it is.

564
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,021
Okay then.

565
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,857
Get back out there.

566
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,395
You're clear.

567
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,736
Go show them how it's done.

568
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,263
Lauren?

569
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,870
Lauren.

570
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,508
I didn't know what else to do.

571
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,623
No problem. I was cleared.

572
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,795
Clevidipine infusion rate,
one milligram per hour.

573
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,131
Balfour retractor standing by.

574
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,603
She is so stubborn.

575
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,756
Show me a kid who doesn't
think their parents are stubborn.

576
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,581
She's overweight, diabetic and
spends most of her time chain-smoking,

577
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,448
eating fried foods and drinking.

578
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,215
Hmm. And she has no
intention of ever changing.

579
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:34,419
That's problematic.
That's a recipe for disaster.

580
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,560
I'm the only one
telling her to stop.

581
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,264
The rest of her buddies
out in Sheepshead Bay,

582
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,330
they all have the
same bad habits.

583
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,023
Maybe they all
need a little attention.

584
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,232
They need a swift
kick in the pants.

585
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:54,738
You know, I go out
there often as I can,

586
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,907
prescribe them what
they need, but it's just...

587
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,579
It's not enough.

588
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,745
Found it.

589
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,459
Yeah, I can feel an
abnormal nodule right here.

590
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,357
I'm gonna cut it out,
send it to pathology.

591
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,362
Is it crazy I'm happy
Dr. Reynolds found a tumor

592
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,799
in my mom's bowel?

593
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,427
No, you're not crazy.

594
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,998
Come with me. You
gave me an idea.

595
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,792
- Thank you all for coming.
- He is canning us.

596
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:31,977
Hmm?

597
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,161
It's just like that
scene in <i>Goodfellas</i>

598
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:34,662
when they tell Joe Pesci
he's gonna get made

599
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,331
and he's all excited and dressed up,
and then he goes in the room, and whack!

600
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,689
They whack him. I
am not whacking you.

601
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,557
I'm hiring you. All of you.

602
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,561
We're opening a new
clinic in Sheepshead Bay.

603
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,656
And since you're
all on payroll already,

604
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,395
this will actually be the first
profitable thing I've done.

605
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:53,028
Sheepshead Bay? New
Amsterdam runs satellite clinics

606
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,539
all over the city, but we've
neglected this part of Brooklyn

607
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,372
and the people who live there.
And that ends today with your help.

608
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,045
Sounds great, but I'm kind of
over the parking attendant thing.

609
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,348
Good, because you'll be
running our reception area.

610
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,387
Greeting people, making
sure they feel at ease.

611
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,546
That I can do.

612
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:13,058
Anna, you'll be installing
our new computer systems.

613
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,218
Linux or DOS? No idea.

614
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,627
And, Jessica, you'll be caring
for the community who raised you

615
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,789
and who needs you now.

616
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,127
Thank you, Max.

617
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,533
Hello. I hope I'm not too late.

618
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:28,040
Everyone, meet our
new radiology department.

619
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,069
You're gonna need the suture kit.
- Yeah.

620
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:45,807
Ask me again.

621
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,319
What are you running from?

622
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,973
I told my mom that
I was going to NYU.

623
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,542
That I'd be here
in town, close by.

624
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,842
Dad had died the year
before, and things had gotten...

625
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,580
I didn't even tell her
that I applied to Whitman.

626
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,692
I didn't tell
Vanessa, my sister.

627
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,252
And I knew.

628
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:34,722
I knew

629
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,063
that they wouldn't
be okay without me.

630
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,402
I mean, I protected Vanessa.

631
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,173
She thought I was a rock star.

632
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,111
But she was 12.

633
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:53,517
I mean, I couldn't... I
couldn't take her with me.

634
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,584
I wanted to,

635
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,921
but I knew if I didn't go,

636
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,185
then I was never gonna get out.

637
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:09,957
One night, I...

638
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,701
I tucked her up in bed,

639
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:18,869
and I left.

640
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,474
I left my little sister.

641
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:30,420
She, uh, she's in rehab now.

642
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,216
Again. Fourth time.

643
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,082
That is not on you.

644
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,931
I could have saved her, you know? I
mean, I could have saved my mom.

645
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,143
You were a kid.
That is not your job.

646
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,260
Then whose was it?

647
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:47,135
I mean, I was all they had,
and then I just... I just left.

648
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,002
Listen to me.

649
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:54,936
There are people all over the
world with families just like yours.

650
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,009
All over the world.

651
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,055
And many of them,

652
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,644
most of them,

653
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,614
they never get out.

654
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:09,492
You saved the only person that
you could save. You did not fail.

655
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,187
What you did was an
act of incredible strength.

656
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,768
I don't feel strong.

657
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,538
You only need to be strong
enough to do one more thing.

658
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:33,512
I need help.

659
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,112
Okay.

660
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:39,347
We can do that.

661
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,450
Okay?

662
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,730
Were you really clearing
me to go back to work?

663
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,515
And let a drug addict
loose in the ED?

664
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,798
God, no.

665
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,536
You kidding me?

666
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,717
<i>Oh, wake me please
When this is over</i>

667
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:17,891
<i>Oh, when the ice Is melted away</i>

668
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,900
<i>And the hunger returns</i>

669
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,597
<i>I will feel the same but older</i>

670
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:27,728
Hey.

671
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:29,897
Hey.

672
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,911
I wasn't expecting to see you.

673
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,512
Because I cut you off at the
knees? I came on too strong.

674
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,677
It's a personality defect.

675
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:43,278
No, you didn't, and it's not.

676
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,514
It was spontaneous and fun

677
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,720
and completely lovely.

678
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,398
And that's what made it
utterly terrifying for me.

679
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,037
I haven't wanted to take a
chance on something, um...

680
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,769
On someone in
a really long time.

681
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,314
I mean, I used to be a
person who took chances,

682
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,043
and I really wanna
be that person again.

683
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,482
You don't have to explain.

684
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:14,746
No, I want to.

685
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,815
You make me want to.

686
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,418
I have baggage.

687
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,726
And it comes with
me wherever I go.

688
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,567
And to be honest, I'm so tired

689
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,328
of dragging it around with me.

690
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,269
Is that an overnight bag?

691
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,802
Yes.

692
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,609
I have literally brought
my baggage with me.

693
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,986
But only 'cause there's a
Radiohead concert in Philadelphia.

694
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,184
Any interest in going with me?

695
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,919
<i>I took care for longer</i>

696
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:59,192
<i>At least something beautiful</i>

697
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:06,097
Out of all the windows in all
the hallways in this hospital,

698
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,635
you had to stand
in front of mine.

699
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,002
Get your own window.

700
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,035
I needed your advice
today, my friend,

701
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,370
but you were busy.

702
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,814
Yeah, I mean, that
happens sometimes.

703
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,610
As a result,

704
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,847
I managed to
lose my only friend,

705
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:28,892
and my only son.

706
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:31,793
I'm sure it's not that bad.

707
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,061
It is that bad.

708
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,194
Oh.

709
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,299
Okay, sorry.

710
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,336
So, what do I do now?

711
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:52,316
Iggy, I need you to help me.

712
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,479
Okay.

713
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,692
<i>Where have you been?</i>

714
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:07,321
<i>And what have you done?</i>

715
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,361
How's the VIP?

716
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,596
Not feeling very important.

717
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,237
Well, you are.

718
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,502
To me, to everyone.

719
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,178
It's gonna be hard,

720
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,578
but when you make it,

721
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,695
your job's gonna be
right here waiting for you.

722
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,187
My job means
everything to me, Max.

723
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,529
I know the feeling.

724
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,868
<i>Moving pictures</i>

725
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:54,739
<i>Silent films</i>
