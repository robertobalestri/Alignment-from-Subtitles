1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,475
Hmm. Interesting sign.

2
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,175
Thank you. Yeah.

3
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,013
Kinda dark. Kinda true.

4
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,171
Hmm.

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,347
Hear me out: same
sign, but in a wacky font.

6
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,050
Right? 'Cause nothing says
"You're doomed" like Comic Sans.

7
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,190
Nothing says...

8
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,687
You know, when Sharpe
was my oncologist,

9
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,287
I at least got pity laughs.

10
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,299
I won't be doing that.

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,233
Mmm. Well, this'll be fun then.

12
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,737
Uh, I'm gonna go, and maybe once
you've read that, you can call me.

13
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,307
Sit. Okay.

14
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:45,579
I can't help but notice
inconsistencies in your treatment.

15
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,980
Missed chemo sessions,
erratic radiation schedule.

16
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:51,811
That won't work.

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,796
Virginia, I've never seen
you with a patient before,

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,550
but I gotta say, very impressed.

19
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,251
This whole scary-principal
thing you got going on,

20
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,382
it's very effective.

21
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:04,727
But I am not your normal patient
because I have a huge hospital to run,

22
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,562
and so when it comes
to things like scheduling,

23
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,432
I gotta keep it flexible.

24
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,232
But you'll learn to love it.

25
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,202
Radiation is set for
this afternoon, 2:00 p.m.

26
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,744
Great. See? Easy.

27
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,877
As long as there's no hospital
emergency, then I will see you there.

28
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,610
Max, you are the emergency.

29
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,083
Radiation is set for
this afternoon, 2:00 p.m.

30
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,676
2:00 p.m., I heard
you. But listen.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,014
No, you start listening.

32
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,259
Your treatment's
impact is cumulative.

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,586
Your brain is going to operate

34
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,722
at half the capacity
you're used to.

35
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,630
You're going to
be in a lot of pain.

36
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,702
And that is if the
treatment is working.

37
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,795
But you're not
letting it work. Why?

38
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,773
Why? Because I have
a million things to do.

39
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,467
I have a child on the way.

40
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,087
If I'm too far gone by
the time it gets here...

41
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,137
Dr. Sharpe said
you'd make excuses.

42
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,737
Did she? Really?

43
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,945
It's time to get ready,
Max. Yeah, for what?

44
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,154
To step down as
medical director.

45
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,533
We'll see about that.

46
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,587
Hang in there, Lyn.

47
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,661
Doctor? What you got?

48
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,648
An overprotective dad-to-be
who needs to chill out.

49
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,483
Her back's been sore and
she's had these awful headaches

50
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,419
and she's, like, forgetting things.
She nearly fainted at the coffee shop.

51
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,754
It's called having
a baby, Michael.

52
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,337
Vitals? Found
them right outside.

53
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,406
We didn't have time. All
right, we got it. Thanks.

54
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,750
How far along are
you? Thirty-nine weeks.

55
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,581
Do you have a birth plan? Yeah.

56
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,087
Any allergies? - No.

57
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,521
Complications? Just having
these really bad headaches.

58
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,524
Mom's blood pressure: 290/160.

59
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,153
Heart rate 130 and fetal
heart rate 90 and falling.

60
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,407
All right. Trauma One. We have
to do an emergency C-section.

61
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,366
- Call OB, but I'm not waiting.
- What, now?

62
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,128
What's happening?
What? Is the baby okay?

63
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,430
Michael? Just breathe.

64
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,183
Michael! MICHAEL:
Should I call her doctor?

65
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,948
Clamps and forceps, please.

66
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,209
We won't need the Metz.
Get them off the tray.

67
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,778
Your name's Michael
Archer? Uh, yes.

68
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,212
Lift your arms.

69
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,475
Turn around.

70
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,484
Your date of birth
is May 28th, 1988?

71
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,611
Patient intubated and sedated.

72
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,280
How we doing?

73
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,347
- Almost prepped...
- Guys, please.

74
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,934
I need to be in there. I
need you to lift your foot.

75
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,603
What are the last four
digits of your social?

76
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:17,064
0501.

77
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,284
And the other foot.

78
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,709
Fetal heart rate still falling.

79
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,477
Preparing to
sterilize incision site.

80
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,867
Let's go. - Let's go.

81
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,814
You cannot touch anything in
there unless we say it's okay.

82
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,204
You got it? Yeah.

83
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,638
Okay. Let's go.

84
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,237
PGA and polyglactin
910. Is she okay?

85
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,891
She's sedated to help
with the hypertension,

86
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,660
but we need to get your baby out
now for both of their sakes. Retractor.

87
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,028
- Richardson.
- Where's OB?

88
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,418
Okay, need a little help here.

89
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,681
Is everything okay? Got it?

90
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:42,899
Okay, hold it nice
and wide for me.

91
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,357
What's wrong? Doctor?

92
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,416
The cord? - I'm trying.

93
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,824
Doctor. Suction.

94
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,760
Just a little more.

95
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,603
Time of birth, 10:23 a.m.
You have a strong baby boy.

96
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,574
Give me those Apgar scores.

97
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,319
Yes, Doctor. All
right, I see that.

98
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,452
Birth weight, uh, 7.6 pounds.

99
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:16,614
Apgar of nine.
He's very healthy.

100
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,554
Let's close her up.

101
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,288
How's Lyn? She okay?

102
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,556
No signs of hemorrhaging
or excess bleeding.

103
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,599
She's still hypertensive.

104
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,861
Wanna hold him, Daddy?

105
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,737
There you go. Support his head.

106
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,300
Hi, Robin.

107
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,772
Hey, there!

108
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,238
Ta-da!

109
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,810
You amaze me.

110
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,886
I wear paper very well.

111
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,648
I'm not talking
about how you look.

112
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,398
I'm talking about how
you're tackling this.

113
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,789
All by yourself.
Freezing your eggs.

114
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,718
Lots of women do.

115
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,820
Lots of women aren't
chair of oncology.

116
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,623
I knew there was a
reason I invited you.

117
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,502
So, that nurse earlier,
thinking I was here to fertilize...

118
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,008
Oh, my God. I mean,
can you imagine?

119
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,510
We've only been
together a month.

120
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,308
So awkward. So awkward.

121
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,117
That said, I...

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,488
I know the biological
pressure you're under.

123
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,317
So what if...

124
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,694
That's not a reason to...
No, no, of course not.

125
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:34,464
I just... Here I
am, able to help.

126
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,836
Not helping feels... No, yeah.

127
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,640
I get it.

128
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,940
I mean, I have thought about it.

129
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,770
You have? Oh, no.

130
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,424
I mean, I've thought about it,
but I haven't, like, thought about it.

131
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,643
Right.

132
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,550
Yeah, it's just a lot to put
on this and on us at this time.

133
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,947
Hopefully we'll get there. Yeah.

134
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,520
I just don't wanna
lose our chance.

135
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,632
It's E-day, Helen. Ready to go?

136
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,995
Um...

137
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,640
Actually, I think I just
need a little bit more time.

138
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,210
You can have till 5:00 p.m.

139
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,679
Any longer, we'll miss
our chance to retrieve

140
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,910
any eggs at all,
fertilized or not.

141
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:26,881
I'll see you at 5:00?

142
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,994
Sandra Fall from
billing. How goes it?

143
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,430
Uh... My husband
filed for divorce,

144
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:42,001
and he's taking the
dog. Oh, I'm sorry.

145
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,559
Don't be. They
deserve each other.

146
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,502
Signature, please. Sure.

147
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,667
You know, I would sign just about
anything you put in front of me,

148
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,711
but out of curiosity,
what did I just sign?

149
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,137
Permission for
the hospital to sell

150
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,990
delinquent medical
bills to the highest bidder.

151
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,778
To do what now?

152
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,408
Orders from Karen
Brantley. Excuse me.

153
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:02,747
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

154
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,222
Forgive me, sorry. Yeah.

155
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,760
"Approval to institute
a trial program

156
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,455
"known as 'the asset
reclamation commitment.'"

157
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,856
ARC, for short.
Love a good acronym.

158
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,594
Oh, well, that's an
even better euphemism.

159
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,793
Asset reclamation.

160
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,030
This program sells our patients'
debt to collection agencies.

161
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,605
Yes, so that we may be reimbursed
for their delinquent medical bills.

162
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:26,442
The thing is, people come here for
care, and this is what bankrupts them.

163
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,812
This hospital currently holds
six figures in outstanding debt,

164
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,196
and we're steaming
towards seven.

165
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,584
It's time to do something
about it. Not this.

166
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,788
We found an agency that
can get five cents on the dollar

167
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,984
for our debt. That's
real money, Max.

168
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,318
Think of all the good
you can do with it.

169
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,498
What if I can do better?

170
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,066
Six cents on the dollar guaranteed,
and nobody goes bankrupt.

171
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,069
Just let me try.

172
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,738
Start with this batch.

173
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,910
You have 24 hours. Thank you.

174
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,852
Look at what Harper
made for cool Uncle Kapoor.

175
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,183
Oh, God.

176
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,981
What are you doing?
Is it an ashtray?

177
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,184
Oh, yes. Yes, Vijay.

178
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,170
My five-year-old daughter
made you an ashtray in school

179
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,993
for all your cigarette butts.
It's a paperweight, man.

180
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,756
Why does it have grooves? It...

181
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,533
I don't know. Maybe
it is an ashtray.

182
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,313
But you know, that... That's
the beauty of Harper's work.

183
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,636
The functionality of
each piece truly does lie

184
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,938
in the eye of the beholder.
My desk is really very messy.

185
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,003
I have four kids all dabbling
heavily in the arts, all right?

186
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,673
My desk is 99% paste
and pasta. Come on.

187
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,946
Plus, you can't pass
on a gift from a child.

188
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,481
Actually, it sounds that you
can't pass on a gift from a child.

189
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,218
Hey, Dr. Eagan!

190
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,849
You're still a big
smoker, right?

191
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,792
<i>Bonjour</i> from... <i>Pain...</i>
Good morning, Ella.

192
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,198
What would you like?

193
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,861
I would like to again apologize.

194
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,838
I never meant to imply
that you and my son...

195
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,575
$2.75.

196
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,662
Isn't he amazing?

197
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,861
I don't usually play favorites,

198
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,999
but your son is perfect.

199
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,040
Sabrina, would you
just give us a minute?

200
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,369
Hi.

201
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,605
Mr. Archer, I'm Dr. Goodwin.
Medical director of this hospital.

202
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,038
Is everything okay?

203
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,276
Your paperwork said
that Lyn is your surrogate?

204
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,907
She's also my best friend.

205
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,952
But you paid her
to carry the child?

206
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,351
Yes. Uh, we have a contract.

207
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,848
Yeah, I'm afraid that
surrogacy contracts

208
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,404
aren't valid in the
state of New York,

209
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,793
so by law the baby
belongs to the birth mother,

210
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,024
and we can't legally give him
to you without her permission.

211
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,201
Then just ask
her. She'll tell you.

212
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,567
What?

213
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,402
We thought delivering
the baby would relieve

214
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,909
Lyn's hypertension,
but so far it hasn't.

215
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,706
We're doing
everything that we can,

216
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,374
but she hasn't
regained consciousness.

217
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,278
Wait. I'm sorry, Michael.

218
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,252
I know this is hard, but the nurses
here are gonna take amazing care of him.

219
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,916
You can't be serious.
You're taking him now?

220
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,458
Michael, listen to me.

221
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,721
I'm gonna do everything
that I can to help you.

222
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,061
But right now, we
need to take him.

223
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,709
I don't need a shrink.
I have a contract.

224
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,480
I signed it. Lyn signed
it. It was notarized.

225
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,751
See, she wanted me to have
Robin. Well, I know she did.

226
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,158
But the fact remains that
this is a New Jersey contract.

227
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,990
I know that but, okay, here.

228
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,264
"The parties agree
that the jurisdiction

229
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,028
"for resolution of
any custodial dispute

230
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,262
"shall vest in the court in
the state of New Jersey."

231
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,864
Not New York. Jersey,
okay? Okay, okay. I hear you.

232
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,436
Slow down.

233
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,640
Michael, take a breath.

234
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,106
I'm sorry. It's okay.

235
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,513
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

236
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,277
I understand.

237
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,945
It's just, I mean,
that's New Jersey.

238
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,386
It's right there. I can see it.

239
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,489
Yeah.

240
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,491
Five miles west, I'd
be holding my son.

241
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,388
They won't let me hold him.

242
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,741
I guess you got kids?

243
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,641
Yeah.

244
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,904
My little girl made that
masterpiece right there.

245
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,148
I have zero idea what it is.

246
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,188
Everyone who looks at it sees
something completely different.

247
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,314
It's kinda cool, actually.

248
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,926
I see a little girl
that loves her dad.

249
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,187
Yeah.

250
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:17,701
What would you do if someone
tried to take her away from you?

251
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,237
Is this my cystic
fibrosis patient?

252
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,336
Dania Constantin, 12 years old.

253
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,591
Collapsed on a school field
trip with shortness of breath.

254
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:32,211
Hey, Dania. I'm Dr. Reynolds. We're
gonna take good care of you, okay?

255
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,753
I need the stat chest.

256
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,764
All right, let's go ahead
and get her to Trauma One.

257
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,689
Dania, are you all right?

258
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,522
I just got the call
from school. I'm sorry.

259
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,120
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

260
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,857
I'm so sorry, Mom.

261
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,299
Go ahead and give me a big,
deep breath. Deep as you can.

262
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,797
And out.

263
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,766
That's great.

264
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,267
Good job.

265
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,240
Is she having a CF exacerbation?

266
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,644
Don't be afraid to throw it at
me, Doctor. We've seen it all.

267
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,817
Mrs. Constantin, in a
standard CF exacerbation,

268
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,444
we'd see one impacted
area, maybe two.

269
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,546
But this is multifaceted.

270
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,821
Her platelets are down.
Low red and white cell counts.

271
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,417
Infiltrates on her chest.

272
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,126
So this isn't about her CF?

273
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,325
I believe something
else triggered this.

274
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,903
Arthroscopic shoulder surgery,

275
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,433
$4,650 still outstanding.

276
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,002
I'm real sorry.

277
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,013
I was in such a hole
from all the time I missed.

278
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,480
I just don't have the money yet.

279
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,313
No, that's okay, because
today I'm proposing

280
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,355
a new way to settle your debt.
Says here you're a plumber.

281
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,924
Yeah. Plumbers I've
met know how to barter.

282
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,659
Anything that you can
do for New Amsterdam,

283
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,857
we'll take it.

284
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,428
I'm an electrician
by trade. Perfect.

285
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,968
Wait till you see what
that last storm did to us.

286
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,833
What's the scam,
man? This is New York.

287
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,100
There's always a
scam. It's no scam.

288
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,506
Just barter and trade.

289
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,119
It's worked like
gangbusters for centuries.

290
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,543
So why don't we bring it back?

291
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:09,013
So I patch up the cracked drywall
around here and rip up my bill?

292
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,260
You patch up the cracked
drywall and you will have paid

293
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,995
your bill every bit as much
as if you wrote us a check.

294
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,647
This isn't charity.

295
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:18,283
This is just us recognizing
the real-world tangible value

296
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,621
of what our patients can offer.

297
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,227
So the question is,
"How can you help?"

298
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,724
It's a cocker spaniel.

299
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,302
Look at that.

300
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,865
Kids'll love it.

301
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,740
Cough if you need to.

302
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,375
Hi, thanks for jumping
in. It's my pleasure.

303
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,704
So, Dania, has anyone
been sick at school?

304
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,810
Not really. Any new pets?

305
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,346
Just my bacteria-covered
lizard monster.

306
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,547
His name is Lungy. She's
kidding. Cut it out, goofy.

307
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,489
You're on top of your
meds and your CPT, right?

308
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,994
Her father and I handle therapy.

309
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,655
Dania's in charge
of her own meds.

310
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,164
She's a model patient.

311
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,495
You're okay.

312
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,400
Honey, you're
okay. I'm right here.

313
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,830
Any recent travel?

314
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,832
I wish. We've had to cut back.

315
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,603
We're remodeling,
adding a nursery.

316
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,844
Did this new construction have
any leaks in the recent storms?

317
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,744
Oh, God.

318
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,682
You're thinking mold?

319
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,619
Aspergillosis fungal infection
could explain her symptoms.

320
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,182
Some of them. Her white
blood cell count's low.

321
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,691
You'd expect
high with infection.

322
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,250
But if it is black mold,
there's no time to waste.

323
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:33,522
Okay, we're gonna give you
voriconazole, ceftazidime and tobramycin.

324
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,534
If it's fungal,
that'll wipe it out.

325
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,695
But how could this happen?

326
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,373
We need to prep Lyn for surgery.

327
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,539
We should know in an
hour or two if the clipping

328
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,276
has lowered her
intracranial pressure.

329
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,375
Dr. Kapoor will
be overseeing it.

330
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,944
And our grandson?
Can we see him?

331
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,317
Uh, this is Dr. Frome.

332
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:01,155
I've asked him to consult on this
case in his role as a child advocate.

333
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,272
Forgive me for asking,
but you are aware that Lyn

334
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,322
was not the egg
donor for this baby?

335
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,427
Yeah, that since she
was just the carrier,

336
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,129
she and this child are not
genetically related in any way?

337
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,569
Yeah. Okay, good.

338
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,573
Um... I apologize for
having to discuss paperwork

339
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,167
at such a painful
time. I really do.

340
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,575
But if you'd take
a look, please.

341
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,910
What is this? That's a waiver.

342
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,317
Although Lyn and
Michael shared a contract,

343
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,444
surrogacy is still currently illegal
in New York, but the good news is

344
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,149
as Lyn's parents, you
can sign on her behalf

345
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,122
to allow the father
to take custody.

346
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,618
No.

347
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,596
Mrs. Sackhoff,
this baby's father

348
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,260
is sitting in my office
waiting to hold his son.

349
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,304
I am not giving him
to some stranger.

350
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,429
Mrs. Sackhoff...

351
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,168
Some man who pays
women to carry children?

352
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,706
Ma'am, I know this is
a complicated situation,

353
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,804
but this child is not yours.

354
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:59,050
He's the... He's the last
piece I have of my daughter.

355
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,610
He's our grandson, and
we're taking him home.

356
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,792
Thank you.

357
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,897
Help! Help!

358
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,499
She's in V-tach. We
need to defibrillate.

359
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,563
Found some blood.

360
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,707
Charging. Clear.

361
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,405
Going again. Clear.

362
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,819
She's back. Normal sinus rhythm.

363
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,479
You see this?

364
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:39,383
We were wrong.
This wasn't fungal.

365
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,426
I'm gonna get her
down to the OR,

366
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,223
find out where the
blood is coming from.

367
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,729
What is it? What's
wrong with her?

368
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,856
We're doing everything
we can to find out.

369
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,401
I'll be right back.

370
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,621
Advancing through the
pylorus into the duodenum.

371
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,769
I don't see it yet.

372
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,442
Why did I push for
the voriconazole?

373
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,411
All the signs pointed
in that direction.

374
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,350
Yeah, well now she's being
compromised by antifungal meds

375
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,685
she didn't need on
top of her cystic fibrosis.

376
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,886
There. Right there.

377
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,188
Bleeding ulcer.

378
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,787
Cauterizing now. Good find.

379
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,863
Well, I'll take the compliment when
we figure out what's hurting this girl.

380
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,902
It's the low white
blood cell count.

381
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,268
That's the piece
that's never fit.

382
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,272
You thinking a
myelodysplastic syndrome?

383
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,933
That's the best angle
we have right now.

384
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,304
Once she's recovered,

385
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,071
I'll obtain a bone
marrow biopsy.

386
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,736
We're missing something.

387
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,300
Dr. Stauton, who
are you waiting for?

388
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,963
Dr. Goodwin. He
has a session now.

389
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,568
Oh, no, his session
was rescheduled.

390
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,413
Rescheduled? By whom?

391
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,679
By Dr. Goodwin.

392
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,919
The cost of treatment
for multiple sclerosis

393
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,016
has tripled since
1993. I've noticed.

394
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,925
Yeah, big pharma just
keeps jacking up the DMTs.

395
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,021
Sadly our current system refuses

396
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:28,590
to limit these increases,
which is why I'm trying

397
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,638
a new thing where
we barter for your debt.

398
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,870
Like a yard sale? Kind of.

399
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,099
What are your skills?
What do you do?

400
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,507
I'm a painter. Mmm. Perfect.

401
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,548
Well, the lobby could use a
fresh coat. Not that kind of painter.

402
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:47,177
Uh, Less Sherwin-Williams,
more Georgia O'Keeffe.

403
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,211
Oh.

404
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,346
Huh.

405
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,653
So much for the
easy way out, huh?

406
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,659
I can't tell you how many gigs
I've lost because of my condition.

407
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,997
All right, Georgia O'Keeffe.
Here's your canvas.

408
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,471
I think I need to
buy a lot more paint.

409
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,511
Um, yeah. Then, well,
you better get to work.

410
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,840
But you're gonna be great.

411
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,681
Well, if it isn't my
former oncologist.

412
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,811
Aren't you peppy.
You sound surprised.

413
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,685
Well, after all your emo
misgivings about working

414
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,247
with Dr. Stauton,
I feared the worst.

415
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,087
Oh, she's been
a delight. Really?

416
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,559
Like a summer
breeze, that woman.

417
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,871
You do realize I
know her, right?

418
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,659
Yeah, you know,
it's not too late

419
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,411
to take me back, and
I would think about it

420
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:37,402
if I was you 'cause this offer
will expire in, um... Never.

421
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,937
Please, please
take me back. Max.

422
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,507
Yeah. Friends, colleagues.

423
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,372
Friends and colleagues is...

424
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,404
Clear delineation
till you get better.

425
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,876
Right, but she is so mean.
I mean, she's, like, crazy.

426
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,781
She's like a werewolf or
something. Okay, I'm on board. Fine.

427
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:54,451
So as my colleague, would
you take a look at this, please?

428
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,680
Mmm-hmm. It's my CF patient.

429
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,451
Everything's failing
at the same time

430
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,082
and we can't see why.
These numbers are atrocious.

431
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,388
That's the only place that
she's not overachieving.

432
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,862
She's top of her class, highly
involved in extracurriculars.

433
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,523
Volunteers in the community.

434
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,727
I mean no one deserves
such a nasty disease,

435
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,702
but such an inspiring girl.

436
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,932
Well, maybe she's
getting a little help.

437
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,537
What, you mean drugs? She's 12.

438
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,186
Yeah, sounds like she
has more on her plate

439
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,644
than most 12 year
olds can handle.

440
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,554
Hi.

441
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,889
Um...

442
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,629
Rohan just told me
this was a family piece

443
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:42,963
when he gave it to me.

444
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,593
But from the look on your face,

445
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,434
I'm guessing it
belonged to your late wife.

446
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,654
I don't know what's going
on between you and your son,

447
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,943
but I have no intention
of being in the middle of it.

448
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,645
But I certainly never
meant to hurt you, so...

449
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,528
I know we're not great,

450
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,630
but I hope you know
I'd never do that to you.

451
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,282
Hey, how's it going?

452
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,851
Uh, well, legal put in an emergency
injunction request for Michael.

453
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:47,124
They've all made statements
so now we're waiting.

454
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,966
Mmm. And Lyn? Still in surgery.

455
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,198
Yeah.

456
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,844
<i>Frankly Lyn Sackhoff's
intentions are clear.</i>

457
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,246
The contract's
claim is compelling.

458
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:08,253
However, the interstate dispute
here is beyond this court's remit.

459
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:12,689
So I'm bound to issue an
injunction I take no joy in making.

460
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,094
Until the conflict is
resolved by a higher court,

461
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:17,993
neither party may have custody.

462
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:21,928
The legal guardian will be the New
York Department of Social Services.

463
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,003
The baby is to be
placed in foster care.

464
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,005
Your Honor, uh, this
child's genetic father is here

465
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,233
begging to take him home,

466
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,070
as are the birth
mother's parents.

467
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:34,010
And this court's answer is
to send this wanted newborn

468
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,015
into foster care? JUDGE
HAYASHI: It's the law.

469
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:40,617
I'm sorry, Dr. Goodwin.
My hands are tied.

470
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:54,397
This isn't over yet. Our legal team
can file an appeal by tomorrow.

471
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,031
No, we'll lose. No,
you don't know that.

472
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,937
Max, do you think this
is the first case like this?

473
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,632
This is not unique.

474
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,940
And while we're appealing,
Robin will be in foster care.

475
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:08,908
Not for days, for months. I
know. It's unfair, and it's cruel.

476
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,888
Michael.

477
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,920
If you let your son
go to foster care,

478
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:26,625
you will be introducing him to
a world that is cruel and unfair.

479
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,061
Far more cruel than this.

480
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,399
So, what are you saying?
I should just give up?

481
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,802
I'm saying you should fight.

482
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,673
You should fight to
give your son the best life

483
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,004
that he could possibly have.

484
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,679
Even if it's not with you.

485
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,493
Did you find anything
in her bone marrow?

486
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,831
I'm afraid that's
not the culprit.

487
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,865
Sabra, um...

488
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,437
Is it possible that Dania's
been experimenting?

489
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,507
With drugs? No.

490
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,315
Opioids attack
white blood cells.

491
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,194
And if she's taking street pills,
the cutting agents could account

492
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,345
for all her other symptoms.

493
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,284
But Dania would never do that.

494
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,949
Are you sure? I
know my daughter.

495
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,226
Go ahead. You
won't find anything.

496
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,171
Those are all her
standard CF meds.

497
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,145
I told you, I know my daughter.

498
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,378
This was refilled two weeks ago.

499
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,526
There should only
be four pills left.

500
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,322
Dania stopped taking her
pancreatic enzyme pills.

501
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,827
Her body's not digesting fats.

502
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,989
Leading to a
vitamin A deficiency.

503
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,397
I'll go order the IV.

504
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,065
She stopped on purpose.

505
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,201
Why would she do that?

506
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:25,011
Oh, wow. Looking
great. It's... It's a horse.

507
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,612
No, it's a field of
corn? I don't know.

508
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,266
But you know what? Don't tell me
because I'm a big believer in the process.

509
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,555
Art is life. "Art is life."

510
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,787
Should I be getting medical
treatment at MoMA now?

511
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,556
Hey, did you rip
that out of the wall?

512
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,599
This came from your
"electrician" working in the hallway.

513
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,010
There's no need for
the "air quotes," okay?

514
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,798
Fran is fully bonded
and licensed.

515
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,701
But she was engaged under
your "bartering" agreement.

516
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,263
Again with the "air quotes."

517
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,442
So, your answer to our
debt issue is bartering?

518
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,741
Look, I promised to get
six cents on the dollar

519
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,716
for our debt within 24 hours. That's
what I did. Mission accomplished.

520
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,982
The only thing you've accomplished is
turning this hospital into a flea market.

521
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,398
Yeah, and who doesn't
love a good flea market?

522
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:04,822
Sorry, I'm not
seeing the problem.

523
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:08,724
The problem is you're
paying $4,800 to Fran

524
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,729
to fix five light fixtures.

525
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,161
The only people who
can justify a cost like that

526
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:14,961
are the military and the mafia.

527
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,762
On the books this looks
like money laundering.

528
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,747
We'll be audited. Yeah,
but if we just explain...

529
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,262
No, no explaining.

530
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,340
This is not how
you run a hospital.

531
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,240
This is over. End
it. I can't do that.

532
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,437
You can. You will.

533
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,504
This is a public hospital.

534
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,940
We care for people at the
lowest points in their lives.

535
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,452
And we do it no matter who
they are or where they're from

536
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,285
or whether or not they
can pay. That's the gig.

537
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,622
And yes, I understand
everything costs something.

538
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,786
But these people, they trust us.

539
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,194
And that trust is sacred.

540
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,565
So believe me when I tell you,
there is no way that I'm gonna

541
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:51,934
let you hound them for money.

542
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,532
The bartering you've done
today, I'll let it stand. Fran is golden.

543
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,009
Thank you.

544
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:02,306
But that will be the
end of this billing system

545
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,780
built on rainbows
and magical thinking.

546
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,183
Bills exist.

547
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,513
And it's my job to
make sure we pay them.

548
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,121
I want you to succeed, Max.

549
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,392
If we work together, I'll
be your greatest advocate.

550
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:24,459
But if you work against me, I'll
bury you before your cancer does.

551
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,476
What are you, five?

552
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,079
Just give me my keys
and I'll be on my way.

553
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,159
Sure, right after you finish
your course of radiation.

554
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,971
Yeah, well, I would, but my appointment
isn't for another several hours.

555
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,054
That's strange.

556
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:54,065
I could have sworn it was
supposed to have already started.

557
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,931
It was, and then I had
an emergency come up

558
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,368
requiring me to switch
it. So you switched it?

559
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,031
Correct, to later today.

560
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,337
Know any other patients
who go into the system

561
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,172
and switch their
appointments on a whim?

562
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,008
It wasn't a whim.

563
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,378
It was a real emergency
that I was dealing with.

564
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,349
So your cancer isn't
a real emergency?

565
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,884
I didn't say that.

566
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,877
Max, when you tell
me you missed radiation

567
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,618
because people need
you, I don't hear a good man

568
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,455
making a hard choice.

569
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,290
I hear somebody choosing to die.

570
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:26,261
Today you had a choice.
And you chose to die.

571
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:31,734
I'll ask you again tomorrow and hopefully
you will have your head in the game then.

572
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,799
Because frankly I don't know
how many tomorrows you've got.

573
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,371
Hear this.

574
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:42,107
People who treat cancer the way
you're treating cancer do not survive.

575
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,908
Do you want to die, Max?

576
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,550
No.

577
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,731
Radiation is expecting you. 3B.

578
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,666
3B.

579
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,773
Max.

580
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,454
This is how you get better.

581
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,598
I'm afraid the clipping
procedure has not relieved

582
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,828
Lyn's intracranial
brain pressure.

583
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,336
Is there a cure?

584
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,438
Surgery to place
a ventricular shunt

585
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,808
- in her head, but...
- Excuse me.

586
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,448
How is she?

587
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,618
We must prepare for the worst.

588
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,667
You, uh... You've raised
an amazing woman.

589
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,294
Thank you.

590
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,304
That's why I'm, uh,
withdrawing my case.

591
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,149
He can't grow up in foster care.

592
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,021
My son...

593
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,095
He needs to be with
people who love him,

594
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,091
even if that's not with me.

595
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:46,371
And if you do as good a job
with him as you did with Lyn,

596
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:47,997
then he's gonna be...

597
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,720
You hang in there,
okay? I'll see you soon.

598
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,070
Someone please tell Robin

599
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,440
that his daddy loves him.

600
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:53,266
Sweetie. Mom?

601
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:01,177
Why?

602
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,744
Why did you stop
taking your pills?

603
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:09,118
I didn't mean
for it to go so far.

604
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:13,417
Did something happen at
school with your friends?

605
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,193
Dania?

606
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,429
Is this about the baby?

607
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,834
What if you have another me?

608
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,978
Then I'd be the luckiest
mom in the world.

609
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,040
I'm so much work.

610
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,747
And when I stopped
taking the pills,

611
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:40,217
you didn't even notice.
I wanted you to see.

612
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,347
See what?

613
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,480
That if you're taking
care of the baby,

614
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,889
you can't take care of me.

615
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,563
Dania, do you know why I waited
12 years to have another baby?

616
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,233
'Cause you weren't
ready after me.

617
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,230
I've been ready since
the day you were born.

618
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,733
I waited until you were ready.

619
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,670
Until you could
advocate for yourself.

620
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:10,409
And, kiddo, look at your life.

621
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,081
You're amazing.

622
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:17,888
Am I in trouble?

623
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,821
So much trouble.

624
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,221
Come here, baby.

625
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,698
Think they'll be
okay? Yeah, yeah.

626
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,878
Me and my mum
fought all the time,

627
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,914
but we always made up.

628
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,654
Think it'll be the same
with your own kid?

629
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:45,907
How's that going?

630
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,547
Uh, it's a...

631
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,116
It's complicated.

632
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,388
You having doubts?
On so many levels.

633
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,094
Well, don't.

634
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,714
'Cause you would make
an incredible mother.

635
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,051
You were right.

636
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,428
The bracelet did
belong to my wife.

637
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,559
It was part of a set
of heirloom jewelry.

638
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,632
Mothers pass on
these to their daughters.

639
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:44,141
It's one of the only things I
kept of my wife after she died.

640
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:47,604
To remind me of her.

641
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,144
It's been incomplete
for the last two years.

642
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,448
Just missing the bracelet.

643
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,952
I'm so sorry.

644
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:02,789
All this time I thought that
Rohan had sold this for drugs.

645
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,527
At the funeral I accused
him of it and he denied it.

646
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,465
And I called him a liar...

647
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,495
At his mother's grave.

648
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,373
I see.

649
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:22,504
So seeing you with the bracelet
showed me how wrong I was.

650
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:27,046
How wrong I have
been about my own son.

651
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,816
I should have listened
to him, what he told me.

652
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,650
That he wanted something
of his mother's to cherish...

653
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,358
As much as he cherished her.

654
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:44,860
So give this to Rohan.

655
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,335
His mother would
want him to have it.

656
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,304
Please tell him that
his papa is sorry.

657
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,717
Hey. Oh, hey.

658
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,156
Ready?

659
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,736
Today you offered me
the most amazing gift

660
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,705
that I could ever hope for.

661
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,908
But I can't take you up on it.

662
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:30,742
I am crazy about you.

663
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,549
But we're not there yet.

664
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,946
And I really like where we are.

665
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,852
Totally agree.

666
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,894
Just, I got caught up
in the possibility of...

667
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,128
Us.

668
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:51,694
Me, too.

669
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:55,905
But there's no rush.

670
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,634
We can wait until we're ready.

671
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,777
Will you join me at my harvest?

672
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:10,147
It's cool that it turns me on
when you talk like a farmer, right?

673
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,050
Michael!

674
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:18,659
What you did back there,
Lyn's parents want to talk to you.

675
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,676
We just wanted
to hold onto our girl

676
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,143
in case she doesn't wake up.

677
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:40,150
But we need to honor what
she did while she was here.

678
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,120
And what she did,
she did for you.

679
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,948
Here you go.

680
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,284
Are you...

681
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,536
Yeah.

682
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,279
Thank you.

683
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,942
Hey, little guy.

684
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,519
Hi!

685
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,071
Um... I'll meet you
downstairs. Okay.

686
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:46,379
Now that is a face I've seen
on many a patient of Dr. Stauton.

687
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:50,186
I may have jumped the gun on
that summer breeze comment.

688
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:51,689
Yeah.

689
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,922
She prescribed an
attitude adjustment.

690
00:39:56,027 --> 00:40:00,397
Apparently I need to
prioritize my treatment.

691
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,696
That's why I sent you to her.

692
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,434
The cancer has to come first.

693
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,175
She says I need to
focus on my cancer,

694
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,841
stop moving so fast,
but everything in me says

695
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,217
when I stop moving,
the cancer will catch up.

696
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:25,949
So just keep moving.

697
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,555
'Cause I'm not...

698
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,197
I'm not done yet.

699
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:39,027
I wanna leave something
behind, you know? I wanna...

700
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,207
Do something that matters.

701
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,937
But everywhere I look,
all I see is everything

702
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:52,643
the cancer is
trying to take away.

703
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:59,047
Then you're not looking
in the right places.

704
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,461
Almost done. What'cha think?

705
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,403
I'd say it's not a bad
thing to leave behind.

706
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,304
<i>So today I wrote a song for you</i>

707
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,805
<i>'Cause a day can get so long</i>

708
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:23,109
<i>And I know it's hard
to make it through</i>

709
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:26,117
<i>When you say there's
something wrong</i>

710
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,823
<i>So I'm trying</i>

711
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,086
<i>To put it right 'cause I want</i>

712
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,652
<i>To love you with my heart</i>

713
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:39,856
Sorry about that, sir.

714
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,827
Whoa! Whoa!

715
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,266
What's this? You
put it on your head.

716
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,463
Uh... Yeah, I do.

717
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:51,537
<i>And all of this life</i>

718
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,142
It's okay. It's okay.

719
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,842
Oh, my gosh! Look at you guys!

720
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:58,715
Whoa!

721
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,882
Oh, my gosh! Look at this one!

722
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,647
Holy cow!

723
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:05,321
<i>For all that you claim</i>

724
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,221
<i>I will move with you</i>
