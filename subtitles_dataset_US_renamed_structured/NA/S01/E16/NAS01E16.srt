1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,681
Okay.

2
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,018
Max, snow day! Yeah.

3
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,459
Heck yeah, snow day. Uh-huh.

4
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,174
I mean, technically
it's snow evening,

5
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,989
but that kinda lacks
poetry, don't you think?

6
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,141
Sure. There's nothing quite like

7
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,997
the sheer magic of
the words, "snow day."

8
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,194
Say it with me. Yeah.

9
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,479
Yeah, maybe later,
cause right now I gotta get

10
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,631
this hospital ready
for the worst storm

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,049
that we've seen in I don't
know how many years.

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,235
Seventy-two years.
Yeah, it's a long time.

13
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,368
But, you know, we had
comparable snowfalls

14
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,046
back in 2010 and 2016,

15
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,844
but this one's gonna be a lot
more like the great blizzard of 1947.

16
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:51,041
Why do you know all this?

17
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,996
Well, you know, I have a
passion for weather. Yeah.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,864
Check this out. Look. I put
an anemometer on the roof

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,399
seven years ago and it
remains the best decision

20
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:57,567
I ever made in my life. Look.

21
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:58,902
I mean, look at the
fluctuations in the storm.

22
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,637
We can track it by its
geolocation, you know?

23
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,839
Oh, gosh, she is
all over the place.

24
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:03,887
Yeah, well, that explains

25
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,057
why half the hospitals in
this city have shut down.

26
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,032
Can y'all take those,
go to oncology.

27
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,160
On it. Thank you.

28
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,836
Private hospitals are wimps.
Public hospitals don't get snow days.

29
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,397
Laura, can we turn the heat
up two degrees? Two degrees.

30
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,875
Thank you. I stocked up
on food, meds, supplies.

31
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,321
I discharged every
patient I safely could,

32
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,656
and I pared down
to a skeleton crew.

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,257
Well, what about you?
You going home to Georgia?

34
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,512
I convinced her to go
to her parents' house,

35
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,213
where she'll be enduring a much
more judgmental type of storm.

36
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,515
Oh, right, I got ya. Yeah.

37
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,716
Looks like you got this <i>amigo.</i>

38
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,250
Oh, you know what,
this isn't so bad.

39
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,950
Ah, this is nothing.

40
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,434
The great white-out of 1888,
they had to shut down Maine.

41
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,103
Literally closed it
like it was a Denny's.

42
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,190
Safety first.

43
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,235
Well, 400 people
still died that day.

44
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,795
But we will be fine.

45
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:45,929
Move it!

46
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,635
Snow day, Dora!

47
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,399
Snow day!

48
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,620
No, I hear you. - Look it!

49
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,237
Look, I've got this
cool weather app.

50
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,801
Lauren, a patient
overdosed in her room.

51
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,036
Dr. Thomas got caught
in the storm. What?

52
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,930
Is she breathing or responsive?

53
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,918
Respiratory rate's low,
but she's oxygenating okay.

54
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,434
BP? 90/60, heart rate's 92.

55
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,575
Okay, well, if she's oxygenating
okay, then she'll be fine until morning.

56
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,348
Can't you help her?

57
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,581
You're a doctor.

58
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,954
I'm here because I'm not
allowed to be a doctor, remember?

59
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,995
She is better off
waiting for Dr. Thomas.

60
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:55,341
One perfect Manhattan with a
twist or one Paloma with Mezcal?

61
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,466
Both.

62
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,102
How about one at a time?
Snow's not going anywhere.

63
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,382
No. MAX: <i>I didn't
even ask anything yet.</i>

64
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,667
But I know what
you were gonna ask.

65
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,159
<i>No, that's impossible.</i>

66
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,452
Go on, then. Ask.

67
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,826
I need you to come
in. <i>No, see, I knew. No.</i>

68
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,228
But it wasn't
actually a question.

69
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,798
This blizzard is gonna be bad

70
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,460
<i>and I need my deputy
medical director here.</i>

71
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,062
But she only just left.

72
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,164
And she's about to get legless.

73
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,032
<i>Legless?</i>

74
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,576
Hammered. Sloshed. Sozzled.

75
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,674
Great, so then I
caught you just in time.

76
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,039
I hate you.

77
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,507
<i>What?</i>

78
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,145
Hello?

79
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,245
Sharpe?

80
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,847
Max?

81
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,651
How did you know?

82
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,222
I could tell. You
have to go back in?

83
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,265
Unfortunately. I am his deputy.

84
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,845
Turn in your badge, Deputy,

85
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,394
and be an outlaw with me.

86
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,173
But he is my boss.

87
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,937
Mmm-hmm. And your friend.

88
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,851
Isn't it hard for him to
see you as his doctor?

89
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,111
You play so many other roles.

90
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,863
Max is very respectful of my
role as his doctor, thank you.

91
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,054
I apologize.

92
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,294
I would never question your
effectiveness as a doctor.

93
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,634
I just wondered if the...

94
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,034
The thing you guys
have made it difficult.

95
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,970
Excuse me, Max and
I don't have a thing.

96
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,906
The vibe?

97
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,641
What are you talking
about? There is no vibe.

98
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,413
Then how did I know it
was him on the phone?

99
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:51,917
Maybe you're psychic.

100
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,725
Just use my phone
to call the kids.

101
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,233
Why do you need yours?

102
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,734
You know that they won't pick
up now and then when you leave,

103
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,065
I won't have a phone
in case they call back.

104
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,168
I will leave mine with you.

105
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,799
What if they wanna talk to you?

106
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,071
Chrissy, our Airbnb
is five full blocks away,

107
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,636
I am exhausted.

108
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,979
And it's snowing cats,
dogs, and reindeer out there.

109
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,185
It's good you got in from
Vermont when you did.

110
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,148
See?

111
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,284
No, sorry, I meant,
because we need to start

112
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,829
Chrissy on an immune
checkpoint inhibitor tonight.

113
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:33,525
It will make her glioblastoma
respond better to her clinical trial.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,697
That sounds like something I
should probably tell the kids.

115
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,431
Tell them.

116
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,107
You sound exactly
like me and my wife.

117
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,671
Always arguing
about silly things.

118
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,148
I'm going back to our Airbnb,
so I can get a few hours sleep.

119
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,944
I will bring you your
phone in the morning.

120
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,782
Shouldn't having cancer mean
that I get to win every argument?

121
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,203
Hey, there's my deputy.
Wait, where's your hat?

122
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,661
Oh, I forgot it
because, you know,

123
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,278
I was forced out of the
warmth quite suddenly.

124
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,670
Yeah, but not wearing a hat
in this weather is a little insane.

125
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,717
Yeah, I'm your doctor, Max.
Not the other way around.

126
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,800
Hey, are you okay?

127
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,037
Um...

128
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,809
I'm fine, I just...

129
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,549
I just had to walk four
blocks in a blizzard because

130
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,679
my cab couldn't get
past this big accident

131
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,275
that's happened up
the street... Where?

132
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,327
35th and 1st, but
there's no casualties,

133
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,988
just people thought
they could drive in this.

134
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,488
Wait, what is it?

135
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,396
That's right in
front of Station 27.

136
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,812
I was just coming to find you.

137
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,347
When's the last time you
got an ambulance in here?

138
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,566
Forty-seven minutes ago.

139
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,767
This is Max Goodwin
at New Amsterdam.

140
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,108
I need to talk to EMS
Division Chief Molinari.

141
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,270
<i>I'm on.</i>

142
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,421
What's going on out there?

143
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,211
<i>There's a huge pileup on 35th.</i>

144
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,083
<i>Snowplows can't get through
to Murray Hill or Kips Bay.</i>

145
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,381
Are calls coming in?

146
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,424
<i>Many, but without snowplows,
our vehicles can't get to them.</i>

147
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,140
Chief, send me a log of
all your incoming calls,

148
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,357
and keep them coming. <i>Copy that.</i>

149
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,871
If people can't
get to this hospital,

150
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,095
then we need to bring
this hospital to them.

151
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,970
I know being stuck at the
hospital during a blizzard sucks,

152
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,239
but do you know what's worse?

153
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,081
Needing 911 in a blizzard and
being told that no one is coming.

154
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:35,714
So I have here a list of 911 calls
within a half-mile of New Amsterdam.

155
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,156
Ambulances can't get
to them, but we can.

156
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:41,387
And, yes, conditions are bad
out there, but we have got parkas,

157
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,091
and we have got emergency
packs, and we have got chutzpah.

158
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,757
Everybody is gonna
pair up for safety

159
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,668
and we're gonna give you a
GPS Locator, so we can track you

160
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,295
from right here in the hospital.

161
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,670
And to be clear,
nobody has to go.

162
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,470
But we're their only shot, so...

163
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,569
Any volunteers?

164
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,915
Sweet. I've missed
field medicine.

165
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,010
I'll go with you.

166
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,247
Casey and Flores, yes.

167
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,780
You guys have a doorman who's
arm was sliced by a snow blower.

168
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,850
1891 East 23rd street.

169
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,273
Nottingham, Moreland, you've
got a college kid who OD'd.

170
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,765
32nd and 1st.

171
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,109
Let's make sure
we have naloxone.

172
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,078
Great, Levy Park we have
a man who has fallen down,

173
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,342
can't move, may be unconscious.

174
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,460
On it. Thank you.

175
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,596
I'll go with you.

176
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,836
And calls keep pouring
in so just find your patient,

177
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,419
treat them, and get back
here so we can send you

178
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,854
right back out to
treat the next person.

179
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,541
And, guys, let's
be careful out there.

180
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,779
Always wanted to say that.

181
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,616
- Hi, everybody.
- I'm here.

182
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,527
Okay, hey, raise your hand if
you find the storm scary right now.

183
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,357
Big kids, I know it's
not cool to be scared,

184
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,374
but I bet the younger kids
will feel a lot better knowing

185
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,042
they're not the only ones
who are spooked right now.

186
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,364
So, hands up. I got mine up.

187
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,525
I'm scared.

188
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,327
But guess what, guys.
I have good news.

189
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,530
We got games. We
got games galore.

190
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,801
We got hot cocoa
and we got Gladys.

191
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,519
How bad could it be if
we got Gladys, right?

192
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,703
Everyone, follow me. Come on.

193
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,542
I'm gonna take you
into the fun room.

194
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,807
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

195
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,543
And even though
it's scary out there...

196
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,876
Avi, that's not helpful.

197
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,821
No, actually, it is
kind of helpful, Avi.

198
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,915
Thank you. Because
that freaked me out.

199
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,502
Right? My heart
jumped out of my chest.

200
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,324
But now that I
know it was just Avi,

201
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,420
I don't have to be
scared anymore. Right?

202
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,707
Because the more
you understand things,

203
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,994
the less scary they are.

204
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,930
Which brings me to
the star of this evening,

205
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,266
the world's most comprehensive
and cool weather app.

206
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,395
Look at this thing.

207
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,305
We're gonna learn all about the
storm through the majesty of satellite.

208
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,177
Oh... Skimbleshanks.

209
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,440
My anemometer
is not transmitting.

210
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,904
Okay. Uh...

211
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,917
Okay. Listen, Gladys,
why don't you go in there,

212
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,178
break out <i>le</i> cocoa.

213
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,244
Everybody, make me a mug, okay?

214
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,415
Extra marshmallows for me
and I will be right back, I promise.

215
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,850
I'll be right back.

216
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,453
Candelario, what you got?

217
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,127
EMS just got a call.

218
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,745
A man on East 21st Street heard
a crash in the adjacent apartment.

219
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,237
Older woman lives there alone.

220
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,636
He's been knocking,
but no answer.

221
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,849
No, no, I'll go. No,
I think I should go.

222
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,250
No, stay here, track
everyone in the field,

223
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,902
and manage them
when they get back.

224
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,308
Okay.

225
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:12,871
Whoa!

226
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,746
Hang on, I thought that
you were staying here.

227
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,878
Older woman,
unresponsive, needs a doctor.

228
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,945
Max, as your doctor, I cannot
let you traipse through a storm.

229
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,887
Then come with me.

230
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,983
Everyone needs a
partner, be my partner.

231
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,420
What?

232
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,495
You have a compromised
immune system and you shouldn't...

233
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,797
I'm not abandoning her.

234
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,904
Mrs. Calloway
suffered a massive MI.

235
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,843
She's in cardiogenic shock.

236
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,277
I will page Dr. Reynolds.

237
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,646
There's nothing you can do.

238
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,275
I'd be surprised if
she lasts the night.

239
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,521
I'm very sorry.

240
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,843
Please tell me you're kidding.

241
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:23,212
My patient is dying, her husband
needs to know what's happening.

242
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,641
But can't you call him?

243
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,051
His phone is here, and he's
not answering her phone.

244
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,679
Okay, but it's - 10 outside,

245
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,623
plus with the wind chill,
Vijay, you're not young.

246
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,537
I don't want Chrissy and
Connor's last few words

247
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,539
to be about some silly
argument about a cell phone.

248
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,031
Okay, wait, here. Take this.

249
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,497
So I can keep track of you.

250
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,467
Mrs. Gallagher?

251
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,640
There she is.

252
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,320
I can't feel a pulse. I got you.

253
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,679
Starting compressions.

254
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:05,915
Clear.

255
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:12,191
I don't feel a pulse.
Going again. Clear.

256
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,433
I got a pulse. She's back.

257
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,707
Have you seen our guy?

258
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,170
I can barely see you.

259
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,541
What's that?

260
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,214
Oh, God. That's him!

261
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,927
Sir, can you hear me?

262
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,068
Equal round, reactive to light.

263
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,196
His heart rate's around 30. Cold
weather really slowed him down.

264
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,763
I can't move. It's okay.

265
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,398
You fell and hit your head.

266
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,775
- What's your name?
- Hugh Torone.

267
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,074
I'm Dr. Reynolds,
this is Dr. Jessup.

268
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,742
We're from New Amsterdam.
We're here to help you.

269
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,444
Go help my husband.

270
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,548
Your husband?

271
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,148
I was running home from the
pharmacy when I slipped and fell.

272
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:18,155
His glucose was
monitoring 475 when I left.

273
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,657
Mr. Torone, where do you live?

274
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:28,072
Just a few blocks from here
on 29th, 464. Apartment 1043.

275
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:32,112
Okay, and the prescription?
It's in my left pocket.

276
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,771
Got it.

277
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,573
Run!

278
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,949
29th, 464. Apartment 1043.

279
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,454
Okay. Don't worry,
I got you, all right?

280
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,581
You're gonna be all right.

281
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,010
Jessup!

282
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,540
Jessup!

283
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,651
You really shouldn't
have come all this way.

284
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,493
Unfortunately, Marlene, no ambulances
can get through the snow right now.

285
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,532
Please, don't waste
your time with me.

286
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,177
Her blood pressure is dropping.
We're gonna need Levophed.

287
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,136
That's back at
the hospital. Yeah.

288
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,568
I'll go.

289
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,810
No, I will. No, I got it.

290
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,970
I'll be really fast.

291
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,357
You're not supposed to be fast,
you're supposed to be taking it slowly!

292
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,381
I came to keep an eye
on you, but it doesn't matter

293
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,146
because the only doctor
you ever listen to is yourself.

294
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:51,090
I am going to the hospital, you
are staying here, end of story.

295
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,317
Excuse me, please.

296
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,259
Ugh!

297
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,529
Okay.

298
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,699
She's very good
at what she does.

299
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,332
She's... Dr. Sharpe
will be right back.

300
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,740
Thank you, but it
really doesn't matter.

301
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,675
You're gonna be fine.

302
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,271
No, I won't. I'm a clairvoyant.

303
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,077
I've seen the future.

304
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,675
Today's the day
I'm going to die.

305
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,448
Whoa!

306
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,059
Oh!

307
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,581
All right, come
on. I can do this.

308
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:52,710
Wisconsin Strong. Let's
go, Iggy. There you go.

309
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,292
Oh, God! Jesus!

310
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,887
Oh, God, no!

311
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,510
Hey! Hello?

312
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,153
Heart rate's down to 48
and weak. I can barely feel it.

313
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,925
She stopped
breathing on her own.

314
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,760
O-2 sat down to 89%.

315
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,325
Grab the Ambu bag.

316
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,011
O-2 sats still in the 80s.

317
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,989
I'm gonna tilt her head
back to get a better seal.

318
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,253
She's going to aspirate.

319
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,043
Move.

320
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,812
Turn her on her side.

321
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,274
Keep working the bag.

322
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:07,453
One, two, three.

323
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,457
Okay.

324
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,370
Just give it a minute.

325
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,823
Get a message to Dr. Thomas.
She's gonna need to bring charcoal.

326
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,881
Got it. Thank you, Lauren.

327
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,774
Mr. Torone,

328
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,368
you need to stay
absolutely still.

329
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,778
Can't you just
pull me off of it?

330
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,942
No, not without risking
injury to other organs.

331
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,917
I gotta find a way to
get you to the hospital

332
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,954
without removing
you from the spike.

333
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,921
How do you know
it didn't hit my heart?

334
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,053
Because we wouldn't be having
this conversation, Mr. Torone.

335
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,290
Feels like you're about to become
an important person in my life.

336
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,365
Just call me Hugh.

337
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,025
All right, Hugh.

338
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,432
Right now I'm just trying to

339
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,613
figure out exactly how
this spike is penetrating you.

340
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,868
Well, it definitely doesn't
feel like missionary.

341
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,867
Oh, God. Apologies.

342
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,775
Eric says I should
know people a little better

343
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,642
before I make
those kinds of jokes.

344
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,040
Lift up a little.

345
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,715
Oh, God. Thank you.

346
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,482
I'm not cold.

347
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,985
You're not?

348
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,400
Hey.

349
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,808
You were asleep. You feel okay?

350
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,306
Oh.

351
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,807
I thought maybe I was dead.

352
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,009
No, Marlene. You are
not gonna die today.

353
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,848
Not on my watch.
Let's sit you up.

354
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,649
What do you know?

355
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:19,089
You're a doctor, you
believe in science.

356
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,650
Facts. The known.

357
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:25,129
Well, yeah. Me and
most other people.

358
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,031
I believe in the hidden.

359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,195
I believe there's

360
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:33,170
a deeper spiritual reality that
extends beyond pure reason.

361
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,106
And while that's fascinating,
it doesn't have to kill you.

362
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,205
Why don't we ask the cards?

363
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,839
Split the deck.

364
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,511
And show me the top
card of the bottom half.

365
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,482
Uh...

366
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,549
Yeah, okay. Okay.

367
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,130
Ask the cards.

368
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,064
Here we go, split these.

369
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,664
What do you... What do you see?

370
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,639
King of swords. Mmm.

371
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,899
Reversed.

372
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,342
A very powerful card.
But one to be wary of.

373
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:23,251
Hmm. You help people,
sometimes at a detriment to yourself.

374
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,386
Yes, because I'm a doctor.

375
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,987
I see a woman.

376
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,725
But there have been
some bumps recently.

377
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:45,611
Okay. It's true, but
that's every marriage.

378
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,371
You try to meet her needs,

379
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:53,284
but sometimes
it's just not enough.

380
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,117
You're going to lose her.

381
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,555
Yeah, okay.

382
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,555
Why don't you try to
get some rest, Marlene.

383
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,267
Look,

384
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,240
my wife and I have been
through a lot this year,

385
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,072
but we are good now,

386
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:21,774
so I'm not gonna lose her.

387
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,106
I'm not talking about your wife.

388
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,052
You and your wife are fine.

389
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,112
There's someone else.

390
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,953
Someone you care for, deeply.

391
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,763
And you are going to lose her.

392
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,372
Hang in there, Hugh.

393
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,269
How you holding up?

394
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,334
You know, stabbed.

395
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:28,971
Ah! Found it!

396
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,945
There's a screw
attached to the spike.

397
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,013
If I could just loosen
it, I could remove you

398
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,386
and the spike together.

399
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,820
Oh, like a couple.

400
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,490
Sorry. Even with painkillers
you're gonna feel some stuff.

401
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,163
Stop!

402
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,031
Nope.

403
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,631
No, no. I'm sorry.
Keep going, keep going.

404
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,870
Why don't you
tell me about Eric?

405
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,470
What's he like?

406
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,573
We've been
married for six years.

407
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,653
Together since 1987.

408
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:14,020
Eric is smart and funny.

409
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,355
Oh, yeah?

410
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,398
So loving.

411
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,560
He's also the world's
best procrastinator.

412
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,335
He promised he would
refill his insulin two days ago.

413
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,870
I should have
just done it for him.

414
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,437
Yeah, look where
that literally landed me.

415
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,018
Yeah, my mom
forgets to do things.

416
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,179
Simple things, you know?

417
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:47,591
Like I told her, before the storm
hit, to go to my sister's and she forgot.

418
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:52,196
But she's old, you
know. It's not her fault.

419
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,790
I still get mad at her.

420
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,459
I don't even know why.

421
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,963
Maybe you're scared

422
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:03,270
that she's starting to decline.

423
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,075
I don't know, I never really
talked to anyone about it.

424
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,814
No!

425
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,317
Damn thing broke.

426
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,622
You have to leave
me now, don't you?

427
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,727
No.

428
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,905
You're coming with me.

429
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:38,472
I thought that wasn't an option.

430
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,307
Well, now it's our only option.

431
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,508
If you pull me off, won't I die?

432
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:49,917
If we stay here,
you definitely will.

433
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,688
Hey!

434
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,656
Hey!

435
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,159
Hello! Hello!

436
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:07,472
I fully recognize that
I'm probably yelling

437
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,871
at nobody right now,

438
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,806
but if you can hear
me, I'm up on the roof

439
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,811
and I would rather
not die of exposure.

440
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,437
Thank you!

441
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,107
Whoa! Hey, hey.

442
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,617
Don't let that door shut.
Don't let the door shut!

443
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,051
Damn it.

444
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:25,847
Avi?

445
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,385
Avi!

446
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,554
Avi!

447
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,295
Hey, Avi!

448
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,390
Avi!

449
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,175
Okay, Marlene, this should
be making you feel better.

450
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,073
It doesn't,

451
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,148
but that's because
I'm gonna be dead.

452
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,240
Marlene, what did
we say about that?

453
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,410
Hey, can I...

454
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,012
Can I talk to you
for a second? Sure.

455
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,592
Look, I know that
we can't leave her,

456
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,671
but Candelario really
needs us back at the hospital.

457
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,755
Hang on.

458
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,532
I know that I haven't
always been...

459
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,581
You've been so...

460
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,543
You've always...

461
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,920
Never mind. I forgot.

462
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,768
Yeah, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

463
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,125
Yeah, no, sorry.
I forgot. It's just,

464
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:39,062
chemo brain strikes
again, so, yeah.

465
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,123
I know that we need to
get back to the hospital,

466
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,464
but we really need
to monitor Marlene.

467
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,270
Mmm. Um...

468
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,601
Yeah. Telemetry.

469
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,969
We could get the equipment

470
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,771
from New Amsterdam
and monitor her from here.

471
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,539
Telemetry. Helen,
you are the best.

472
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:02,249
I think that's kinda what
I was trying to tell you.

473
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,914
Um...

474
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,720
Marlene, Dr. Sharpe
has saved the day.

475
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,939
We are going to monitor you
remotely from New Amsterdam.

476
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,831
I will be right
back. No, no, no.

477
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,628
No, you look wiped
out from your last trip.

478
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,445
You stay, I'm gonna get
the equipment this time,

479
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,903
but I am gonna go slow,

480
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,798
and I will take care of myself.

481
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,274
Because I love my doctor.

482
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:41,125
Have the two of you been
working together for a long time?

483
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,997
No. Why?

484
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,665
I just sense a very strong vibe.

485
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,539
Okay.

486
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,940
Honey, I'm sorry,

487
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,315
but it's never gonna work
out between you and Max.

488
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:22,665
I don't need it to work
out between me and Max.

489
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,398
Max is married, I
have a boyfriend.

490
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,906
And most importantly,
I am his doctor.

491
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,080
How you doing, Avi?

492
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,547
I don't want to talk about it.

493
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,651
Storms, man.

494
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,822
It's just pressure
and precipitation,

495
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,697
but, man, they make
us feel stuff, don't they?

496
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,730
Riddled with the
feels right now.

497
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,936
What about you?

498
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,238
How's the storm make you feel?

499
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,200
I don't know.

500
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:06,336
Yeah, you do.

501
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,041
Why'd you kick
that door earlier?

502
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,446
Let's start there.

503
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,913
I was just being stupid.

504
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:18,218
No, no, no. I mean, it
wasn't nice, but stupid?

505
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,191
Nah, I don't think so.

506
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,003
In fact, I think it may have
gotten you exactly what

507
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,893
you needed, am I right?

508
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,123
Come on, level with me.

509
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,131
What were you thinking
when you kicked the door?

510
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,777
That no one cared
that I was there, okay?

511
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,045
That's a tough way
to feel, no doubt.

512
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:46,142
So what were you thinking?
Why'd you come up here?

513
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,413
What was this all about?

514
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,622
Everyone was just playing games
and watching movies, you know?

515
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,786
And I was...

516
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,906
I just left the classroom to
see if anyone would notice

517
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,559
and be, like, you
know, "Where is Avi?"

518
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,899
But, you know, no one did.

519
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,407
So I just kept going
and waiting for someone

520
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,773
to freakin' notice
that I wasn't there.

521
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:17,477
No one did and when I
got all the way out the door,

522
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,813
that's when I started thinking,

523
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,114
would anyone notice if I was...

524
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:32,157
There are people that wouldn't
just notice if you were gone, Avi.

525
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,665
There are people that
would be heartbroken.

526
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,293
You're talking to
one of them right now.

527
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,598
We are not alone.

528
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,974
Avi.

529
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:49,137
Even when it feels that
way the most, I promise you,

530
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,307
we are not alone.

531
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,545
I'm really cold.

532
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:56,952
I know. I know
you are. I'm cold.

533
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,825
Here, here, here.

534
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,497
Okay?

535
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,450
Loaded you up with morphine.

536
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,720
The hospital's about
six blocks away.

537
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,252
Here's what we're gonna do.

538
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,999
We gonna go on three. All right?

539
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,563
Okay, all right.

540
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,106
Wait, wait a minute.

541
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:08,314
If I don't make it, you
tell Eric it isn't his fault.

542
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,787
I would have ventured out
into a million storms for him.

543
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,159
Okay?

544
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,591
All right. You stay with me.

545
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,862
Just look at me, okay?

546
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,528
Uh-huh. All right, I got you.

547
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:26,969
All right, here we go.

548
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,466
One.

549
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,935
Two.

550
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:33,703
Three.

551
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,184
Okay.

552
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,884
Marlene, we're going to
be monitoring you remotely,

553
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,819
so if anything happens, we'll
be able to get to you quickly.

554
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:08,041
Yeah. And as soon as the roads are clear,
we're gonna send an ambulance for you.

555
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,874
Marlene?

556
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,917
Marlene, are you feeling okay?

557
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:14,842
I'm fine.

558
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,322
See? What did we tell you?

559
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:24,886
But I really thought I
was going to die today.

560
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,828
Well, we're very
sorry to disappoint you.

561
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,357
It's okay, but I should
probably tell you both.

562
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,732
Since I was wrong about dying,

563
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:37,071
maybe I was wrong
about my other predictions.

564
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,844
I guess time will tell.

565
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,885
The roads will be clear soon.

566
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,266
Get me a gurney!

567
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,293
We've got a bleeder.

568
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:06,764
Let's go!

569
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,630
Get me to the OR!

570
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,138
Dr. Frome!

571
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,544
Gladys! Hi!

572
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,215
Oh, God!

573
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,375
I assumed you were
doing something important,

574
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,446
then of course I realized you just
had to fix your ridiculous gizmo.

575
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,653
Thank you.

576
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,117
Thank you.

577
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:30,961
Let's get you boys some cocoa.

578
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,203
Think I might need something
a little stronger than that.

579
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,256
Oh, boy.

580
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,108
Just be with her.

581
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,612
Tell her what she means to you.

582
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,159
Chrissy...

583
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,499
I'm here.

584
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,429
I'm here, sweetie.

585
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,168
Chrissy, my love.

586
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,805
My love.

587
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,371
I'm here.

588
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:27,644
Lauren?

589
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,065
Did you take any?

590
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,807
No, but I really,
really wanted to.

591
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,544
I'm never gonna
be a doctor again.

592
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,752
I can counsel people.

593
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,519
I can support them,

594
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,686
but the one thing that
I can't do for anyone

595
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,592
is make them want to get better.

596
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,595
And the only way you get better

597
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,500
is if you really, truly want it.

598
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,709
I know you want it.

599
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,181
I do.

600
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:40,885
I really do.

601
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,801
Oh, man.

602
00:37:58,143 --> 00:37:59,543
Sorry, I can't.

603
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,105
You were right.

604
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,544
I am tired.

605
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,917
Okay. It's okay.

606
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,059
That's why I'm here.

607
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:22,495
Maybe...

608
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,963
Maybe I should listen
to you more often.

609
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,135
Okay, just lean on me.

610
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:33,935
Come on.

611
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,626
Vijay, my friend.

612
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:51,922
Hey.

613
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,995
Heard about what
you did. That was...

614
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:55,156
They were fighting.

615
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,768
It made me think of the
night my wife passed.

616
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:06,005
She had made
<i>bhindi sabzi</i> for dinner.

617
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,311
We were about to watch
her favorite soap opera.

618
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,518
Instead, we fought because

619
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,286
Rohan had not come back
home and she was worried.

620
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:28,530
I told her not to be
because Rohan was

621
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,200
a lost cause.

622
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:38,568
We both went to bed angry.

623
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,848
And then she didn't wake up.

624
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,343
All these years, I thought that

625
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:53,484
I was hurting because I
didn't get to tell her I'm...

626
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,354
I'm sorry.

627
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,229
But now I know it's because

628
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:07,904
I didn't get to tell her that

629
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,439
I loved her smile.

630
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,240
Her mischief.

631
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,714
Her heart.

632
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,840
Let's get you upstairs
so you can lie down.

633
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:33,957
Yeah.

634
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:35,958
Right over here.

635
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:37,960
Right here's fine.

636
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,763
Max?

637
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:42,365
Are you feeling okay?

638
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,535
Yeah, I'm just...

639
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,304
Just tired.

640
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,780
Yeah.

641
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,883
Well, it's almost midnight.

642
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,556
The witching hour.

643
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:10,292
Do you believe
in all that stuff?

644
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:20,803
I don't know.

645
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,011
Do you?

646
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,088
I don't know, either.

647
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,155
Max?

648
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,934
We need to talk,

649
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,102
about us.

650
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,508
Okay.

651
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,518
This thing between us...

652
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:12,796
Get this jacket off me.
