1
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,664
<i>Previously, on</i> New Amsterdam...

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,265
You have cancer.
Squamous cell carcinoma.

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,436
I want to try precision
targeted therapy.

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,022
Chemo's gonna take the life out of me
and I wanna keep running this hospital.

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:14,344
It's too big a risk.

6
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,316
<i>Dr. Bloom asked me to
consult on a hematology patient.</i>

7
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,877
Her file says that she received
her heart from a "Luna Goodwin."

8
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,617
Your sister... She
gave me a beautiful life.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,353
She had me arrange this.

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,553
Max?

11
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,292
Baby!

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,628
Oh, my God. Help!

13
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,227
Help!

14
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,224
We've got Marina
Latimer, mid-60s.

15
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,623
Been down for three minutes.

16
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,119
It's her third time
here this week.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,356
She went back into V-fib
right after I shocked her.

18
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,624
Charge to 200.

19
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,896
Clear.

20
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,730
Okay, I've got a pulse.

21
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,003
Her heart's a ticking time bomb.

22
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,166
Let's put V-fib pads on
her and find Reynolds.

23
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,767
He needs to put
in an ICD, today.

24
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,413
Yo, Dora. Where's Max?

25
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,509
Out of pocket for
a few hours. Oh.

26
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,622
Okay. Well, I have a patient
who needs an ICD surgery.

27
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,333
Her insurance won't cover
it so I'm just gonna charge it

28
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,586
to the Community Care Fund.

29
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,684
Max is the only one who
can approve surgeries

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,921
from the Community Care Fund.

31
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:37,028
He's out of pocket
for a few hours.

32
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,965
Can this wait until it
doesn't get me fired?

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,797
Um... Look, whenever there's
a surgery that needs to be done

34
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,814
I just give Max a heads-up
and I do it, all right?

35
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,416
He dots the "I's" and
crosses the "T's" later.

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,806
We got a whole system.

37
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,274
He's been here
for like three weeks.

38
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,540
Yeah, that's how
efficient we are.

39
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,906
Dora, hi.

40
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,712
Just on my way to
Max's office right now.

41
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,378
Yeah, he's out of
pocket for a few hours.

42
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,580
He's what? Oh, shoot.

43
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,883
No, really?

44
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,753
Uh, as the nurses'
union liaison,

45
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,602
I need to tell him that
the hospital-wide walkout

46
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,288
was authorized
just now, for today.

47
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,588
No, no, no. It's a good thing.

48
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,155
Max gave them the idea.

49
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,509
Of course he did. Yeah, yeah.

50
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,973
I probably should
have led with that.

51
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,813
Did you know that insurance
has covered over-the-counter

52
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,931
emergency
contraception since 1996,

53
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,550
and now all of a sudden,
out of the blue, they're like,

54
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,304
"No. Uh-uh. Not
without a prescription"?

55
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,571
That's not fair, right?

56
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,477
There's no way we're
gonna let that slide.

57
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,876
And yes, for the record,
<i>Norma Rae</i> is my favorite movie.

58
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,207
Go, girl.

59
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,010
Dora, uh, I've been texting
Max, but he's not responding.

60
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,123
He's out of pocket
for a few hours.

61
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,715
But I need to talk to him.

62
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,022
I've basically authorized

63
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,173
a surgery that's not covered
by insurance, and I'm about

64
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,995
to endure a walkout
from the nurses,

65
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,628
so whatever you need right
now, I'm sure I can handle.

66
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,137
It's private. Dora.

67
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,173
Dora, I've been looking for Max.

68
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,937
Okay, I'm only gonna
say this once more.

69
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,035
Max is out of pocket
for a few hours.

70
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,444
Please, save your
news, questions,

71
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,380
mysterious personal
requests, or whatever it is

72
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,079
that you need, for
his return. Thank you.

73
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,647
<i>Code Grey, Northwest
Tower. Code Grey.</i>

74
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,125
Dr. Panthaki. Thank you for
picking up Max's samples in person.

75
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,561
But to be clear, this cooler
is full of Miller Lites, right?

76
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,723
Yes.

77
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,097
Yes, because I'm the
type who drinks domestic.

78
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,665
So tell me, will this
be your first time

79
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:23,846
seeing Lauryn Hill in concert?

80
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,896
Actually, no. I've
seen her several times.

81
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,402
But never on a date.

82
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,971
So in your head,
this is a date, huh?

83
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,275
That's interesting.

84
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,744
Just give me my ticket.

85
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,651
Actually, let's
do this properly.

86
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,916
Get dressed up. Dinner.

87
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,719
Okay. Great.

88
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,529
Well, I should go now.

89
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,156
Me, too.

90
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,568
Oh, and we're going Dutch on dinner,
so make sure you bring some cash.

91
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,237
Max, are you on your way back?

92
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,247
<i>Helen! Helen!</i>

93
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,181
Helen, can you hear me?

94
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,378
Georgia? What's wrong?

95
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,682
It's Max. He collapsed.

96
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,620
He's not moving.

97
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,918
Does he have a pulse?

98
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,249
Okay.

99
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,618
Yes. Did you call 911?

100
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,593
They're coming but,
um, the call dropped

101
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,975
and I just didn't
know what to do.

102
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,228
Put your cheek over his mouth.

103
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,791
<i>Do you feel air moving?</i>

104
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,398
Uh...

105
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,635
There is a whistling,
raspy sound.

106
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,439
<i>Put the phone
next to his throat.</i>

107
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,251
Georgia? Yes?

108
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,752
Georgia, Max's
throat is blocked.

109
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,152
What? <i>You need to make</i>

110
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,213
a new path so
that he can breathe.

111
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,987
Okay. You're gonna
cut a small hole

112
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,550
<i>in his throat...</i> What?

113
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,563
No. No, I can't.

114
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,622
Yes, yes. Yes, you can.

115
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,291
You can, because
I'm gonna help you.

116
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,247
<i>Find something that
can cut a hole in his throat</i>

117
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,513
<i>and a tube to slide through it.</i>

118
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,472
Find something. Okay.

119
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:17,976
Oh.

120
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,245
Uh, I have a...

121
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,311
I have a pocket knife. Oh, God.

122
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,820
And a plastic straw.

123
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,257
<i>Use the knife to
cut, um, three inches.</i>

124
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,624
<i>It doesn't have to be exact.</i>

125
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,718
Okay.

126
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,562
Here we go, Georgia. Okay.

127
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,829
<i>Use your index finger.</i> Okay.

128
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:39,797
<i>Find Max's Adam's apple.</i>

129
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,501
Okay, I found it.

130
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:45,012
<i>Feel down from there until
you come to a little indentation.</i>

131
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,708
Make a half-inch, horizontal
cut through that indentation.

132
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,444
What if it's... What
if it's not clean?

133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,216
What if I give him an infection?

134
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,523
Georgia. Georgia,
Max can't breathe.

135
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,116
You need to help him breathe.

136
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,127
You can do this.

137
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,225
Okay.

138
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,793
Oh, God.

139
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,700
I did it. I did it.
<i>Good girl. Good girl.</i>

140
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,072
<i>Now, pinch the
far edges together.</i>

141
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,304
<i>Use your finger to
keep the hole open</i>

142
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,109
<i>and slide the tube halfway in.</i>

143
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,713
Oh, God. Okay.

144
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,219
Air should be coming
out of that tube.

145
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,252
It's... It's not...

146
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,452
It's not working.

147
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,324
<i>God, it's not working!</i>

148
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,228
It didn't work! It didn't work!

149
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,767
You might just need to
help his lungs expand.

150
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,168
Blow into the tube.

151
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,940
Come on, come on.

152
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,738
Oh, come on, come on.

153
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,483
Come on. Come on. Come on.

154
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,014
Oh, he's...

155
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,016
He's breathing. He's breathing.

156
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,254
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

157
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,298
Oh, good.

158
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,863
Oh, good.

159
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,870
How long was his
airway obstructed?

160
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,240
How long was he
not breathing, ma'am?

161
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,218
Six or seven minutes, maybe.

162
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,213
We got a possible
cerebral hypoxia.

163
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,157
Let's pick up speed!
What does that mean?

164
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,024
Means there's a big difference
between six and seven minutes.

165
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,670
Mr. Mokrani? Yes.

166
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,340
How are you? Not great.

167
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,906
Yeah, let's have a look.

168
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,651
Does that hurt,
right there? Yes.

169
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:06,914
Yeah. Fell during a show?

170
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,752
No.

171
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,791
At the after-party. Ah.

172
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,951
I challenged another dancer
to a fouetté competition.

173
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,586
Mmm-hmm. I can
fouetté in my sleep,

174
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,460
but in my sleep,
I'm neither wasted

175
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,022
- nor on a pool table.
- Oh, please.

176
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,264
I was just as drunk and
on-a-pool-table as you were.

177
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,669
Know that you did
not out-dance me.

178
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,208
Basem, I out-danced you so bad,

179
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,106
you're in a hospital.
Yeah, well, I don't know

180
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,511
if it counts as out-dancing
if he fell off a pool table.

181
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,385
Yeah, but I didn't.

182
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,113
So, I out-danced him.

183
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,018
Dancing is the
art of not falling?

184
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,019
I'm sorry, who are you?

185
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,988
Uh...

186
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,087
Yeah, I'm...

187
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,863
Just a guy
challenging you to a...

188
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,097
Fouetté rematch.

189
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,533
Don't worry, I took
dance all through...

190
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:01,631
Never.

191
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,247
Hello? Yeah.

192
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,843
Don't you have some
medicine to practice?

193
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,910
Mmm-hmm. Uh, so, you
have a dislocated elbow.

194
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,354
Go ahead and take this
pen with your left hand.

195
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,767
Now, grab it tight. Hang on.

196
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,851
Okay?

197
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,690
Better? Yeah.

198
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,596
Yeah, good. Okay, he's okay. I
was thinking loser buys dinner.

199
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,491
Really?

200
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,730
I mean, yeah. I'm not
scared if you're not scared.

201
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,840
That's good.

202
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,178
That's very, very
good. Okay, you go.

203
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,716
My turn? Yep.

204
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,494
This is embarrassing,
'cause I actually thought

205
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,282
"fouetté" was a French dessert,

206
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,193
so I didn't know that it
was that spinny thing.

207
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,455
That was way better
than what I thought it was.

208
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,221
But, uh...

209
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,728
Excuse me.

210
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,556
Uh, you're gonna go ahead and ice
that elbow and you're gonna be fine.

211
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,633
Are you coming?

212
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,460
Um...

213
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,699
It's 2:00 in the morning.

214
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,973
Yeah, but I gotta be back here

215
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,485
in three hours anyway,
and full disclosure,

216
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,909
I can't afford a
real restaurant,

217
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,811
so we were just headed
to the cafeteria regardless,

218
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,008
but the Jell-O is phenomenal.

219
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,014
You in?

220
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,702
Hey.

221
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,173
What's with the T-shirts?

222
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,674
You said you were gonna take
time off to take care of yourself.

223
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,651
I am, and I will.

224
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,484
I tried to talk to Max this
morning, but he's not here.

225
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,989
He's always here.

226
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,491
Well, right now he's
not, and I can't just

227
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,721
stop running the ED, can I?

228
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,993
I feel so bad, all the
work you do on me.

229
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,363
I've become this
burden to everyone.

230
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,129
No, no, you're not a burden.

231
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,262
It's just that you have
mediocre insurance,

232
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,915
and I think you should
be treated like you have

233
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,636
Cadillac insurance, so
we're gonna cover you

234
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,609
for an ICD implant.

235
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,441
Today. For the whole surgery?

236
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,810
What about the anesthesiologist?

237
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800
Sometimes they get you
with the anesthesiologist.

238
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,441
For the whole surgery.

239
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,046
So glad Gertie is doing better.

240
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,213
Bye.

241
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,050
Hello. Oh, nice T-shirt.

242
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,683
Thank you. Power
to the people, Vijay.

243
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,885
Ella was telling me
that I helped her save

244
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,396
her crazy Chihuahua. Oh.

245
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,192
All right, Ka-pooch.

246
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,359
I didn't know you
did work on canines.

247
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,697
That's cool. I don't.

248
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,398
I gave her a little
money for the vet.

249
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,234
How much? $2,000.

250
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,132
American?

251
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,643
I gotta go, but I'll
see you in prep.

252
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,550
Sharpe! What's the code?

253
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,424
It's Max. FROME:
I'm sorry, what?

254
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,553
What happened?

255
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,825
I don't have all the
details, but he's collapsed.

256
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,526
He's in a medevac
on his way here now.

257
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,694
Is it serious? I should
get the trauma team.

258
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,293
They'll be here in two minutes.

259
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,036
There's something else, something
that you all need to know in order

260
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,042
to treat him properly
when he arrives.

261
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,737
All right, Sharpe,
what's going on?

262
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,082
Max has squamous cell carcinoma.

263
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,354
Advanced stages.

264
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,060
The trauma team's
gonna meet us here.

265
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,686
No, whoa, hold on a second.

266
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,906
How long have you
known about this?

267
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,455
Since his first day.

268
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,227
Since his first day?

269
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,780
Look, I know that this is shocking,
but whatever we're feeling,

270
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,117
we're gonna have to put it
aside because we need to focus.

271
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,197
Hey, clear a path!

272
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,903
O2 sat's dropping. Okay,
let's up oxygen to 100%.

273
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,135
Push more fluid.

274
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,552
Does anybody know
how long he was out for?

275
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,045
Okay, everybody
out of my ED, now!

276
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:42,284
Should I page
Dr. Candelario? No.

277
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,416
Yes, yeah. Page her, please.

278
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,892
On three. One, two, three.

279
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,196
Monitor for ischemic cascade.

280
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,635
Why hasn't he started chemo?

281
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:04,007
In two weeks he starts
an immunotherapy trial.

282
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,602
What? Huh?

283
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:06,872
Well,

284
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,504
that's what he wanted.

285
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,641
That's what he
wanted? Yes, Floyd.

286
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,515
He's the patient.
Yeah, but he's also

287
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,851
the medical director
of this entire hospital.

288
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,983
Am I the only one who's
wondering what happens next?

289
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,459
What... What... What
are you doing out here?

290
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,960
Candelario is working on him.

291
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,221
Why?

292
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,198
Because I just got off
of back-to-back doubles,

293
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,204
and Candelario is
an excellent doctor.

294
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,137
You pull doubles all the time.

295
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,870
Max deserves to have
a doctor with fresh eyes.

296
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,468
Do you disagree?

297
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,148
How is he?

298
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,641
We don't know yet.

299
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,448
Might be hypoxia.

300
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,689
So, like most of you,
Dr. Sharpe told me

301
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,159
about Max's condition,
and needless to say,

302
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,321
I was a bit shocked,

303
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,730
but we don't have
time to be shocked,

304
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,266
or angry, or upset.

305
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,892
We all have a hospital to run,

306
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:05,427
and while Max is in there,
we need a leader out here,

307
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,497
and that's gonna be me.

308
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,839
Until further notice, I am
the new medical director

309
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,436
of New Amsterdam.

310
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:23,354
I need surgery schedules, staff
rotation. I need the minutes from the last

311
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,016
department chair meeting.

312
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,856
That's gonna take a
little while to put together.

313
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,489
Okay, then let's start with
what Max was overseeing today.

314
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,463
His hot list. Yeah.

315
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,594
What's the hot
list? It's his to-do list,

316
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,468
but with a cooler name. Ah.

317
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,299
I'll call it something
else. Thank you.

318
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,808
Don't worry, I'm only temporary.

319
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,912
I have several calls out for
more permanent replacements.

320
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,980
Dean Fulton, all this
is incredibly premature.

321
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,992
When Max wakes
up... If Max wakes up,

322
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,755
he will still have cancer.

323
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,668
He certainly didn't
expect to continue this job

324
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,721
while undergoing chemo.

325
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,695
Ah-ha.

326
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,830
Of course he did.

327
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,504
So all you care
about is business.

328
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,976
Let me tell you something.

329
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,606
Every single day, 10,000 patients
walk into this hospital and its clinics.

330
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,015
Our annual budget
is $1.5 billion,

331
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,519
and the governor is
demanding that we cut it by 10%,

332
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,079
which is really tough,
because our expenses come in

333
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,681
well over $1.8 billion.

334
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,454
Our infrastructure report
after Hurricane Sandy

335
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,447
told us that we were
sinking into the East River,

336
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,591
and will need $100 million

337
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,430
infused within the next two
years so that we don't end up

338
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,961
like Bangladesh after a monsoon!

339
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,439
And the one guy who's in
charge of this whole show

340
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,376
is lying in Trauma One
with a tube down his throat.

341
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:56,178
And what about a
succession plan?

342
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,684
He knew he was sick.

343
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,720
You knew he was sick.

344
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,780
Someone should have
had a plan in place.

345
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,256
Right?

346
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,288
What?

347
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,661
I just made us the greatest...

348
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,966
Max has had a set-back.

349
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,033
<i>His throat closed up.</i>

350
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,666
Where is he?

351
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,506
<i>In the trauma unit.</i>

352
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,910
Well, is he responsive?
Still unconscious,

353
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,675
but at least he's
breathing again.

354
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,080
How long was he down?

355
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,879
Six or seven minutes.

356
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,852
<i>I need to ask a favor.</i>

357
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,718
Anything. I need you to move up

358
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,552
Max's start date.

359
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,083
To when?

360
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,421
<i>To tomorrow.</i>

361
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,753
Helen, I just got the cells.

362
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,231
I know, I know I'm asking
a lot, but if Max is gonna

363
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,166
keep running this hospital,
then he needs to be

364
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,669
<i>in your trial.</i>

365
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,131
Let me see what I can do.

366
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,152
Monitoring.

367
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,353
Decompression.

368
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,958
Dr. Candelario is
suctioning Max's lungs.

369
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,018
He's really lucky
you were there.

370
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,757
Stand by.

371
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,196
Hey, you want to step outside?

372
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,393
Get some fresh air?

373
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:25,199
What's the difference
between six and seven minutes?

374
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:28,941
"Six and seven minutes"?

375
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,001
EMT said he might have hypoxia.

376
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,977
I don't know how to pray.

377
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:44,450
I'm not religious, but I
wish I knew how to pray.

378
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,888
We've got blood.

379
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,927
What's happening?
What's happening?

380
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,296
Could be ARDS.

381
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,527
Oh, God!

382
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,874
Hey.

383
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,686
Oh, you're seriously
taking me to the theater

384
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,278
in your scrubs. I'm on call,

385
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:19,155
but when I put this
jacket on, like so...

386
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,239
You're looking at me
like you can't quite believe

387
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,256
you're dating
somebody so stylish.

388
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,029
Just like looking at you.

389
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,397
Mmm.

390
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,041
So, are you excited to see
Pina Bausch's company?

391
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,341
My God, I can't stop saying
it. Pina Bausch. Pina Bausch.

392
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,972
Pina Bausch.

393
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,059
Hey, you wanna know an
interesting thing about Pina Bausch?

394
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,346
Pina Bausch?

395
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,513
It's super rare for her company
to be performing on a Monday.

396
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,180
Oh, is it? Weir-sch. Mmm-hmm.

397
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,919
Theaters are dark on
Monday. Did not know that.

398
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,358
You wanna know
another thing? I sure do.

399
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:58,523
Her company performed just
last night at the Kansallisooppera.

400
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,463
And that's even more fun to say.

401
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,900
It's also in Finland. Really?

402
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:07,164
Mmm-hmm. Now, it sounds
like you don't think we're going

403
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,265
to see Pina Bausch.

404
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,837
What is this?

405
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,745
What's that? What? Oh.

406
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,582
Uh...

407
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,423
Yeah, you got me.
There's no show.

408
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,431
Just a guy who can't
quite believe his luck.

409
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,413
Really?

410
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,009
Really.

411
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,600
Will you marry me?

412
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,443
Not even gonna check that.

413
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,576
I'm not even gonna look
until you say something.

414
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,880
No rush.

415
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,196
Someone could be dying...

416
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,347
Right now.

417
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,384
Yes, I'll marry you.

418
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,983
Yes.

419
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,662
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

420
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,802
So beautiful.

421
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,169
Dang, I gotta go. I gotta go.

422
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,787
Go, go, go. Jacket.
Yeah, but I... Yeah.

423
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,211
I'll make it quick, I promise.

424
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,182
She said yes!

425
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,543
You know... Hey, hey, I've
been thinking about this.

426
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,365
This kind of explains
a lot, don't you think?

427
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,533
What? All the crazy changes

428
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,475
he made around here.
That explains a lot of it.

429
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,513
Yeah, I mean, like, who...
Who forms a cardio unit

430
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,014
that doesn't care about money?

431
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,983
Or who puts fruits and
vegetables in vending machines?

432
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,350
Who encourages their
own staff to stage a walkout?

433
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,616
Do you know what I
mean? It's... It's a dying man

434
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,124
saying "screw you" to
the system, that's who.

435
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,188
What do you want me to say?

436
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,340
I don't... Anything. Just
join the conversation, man.

437
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:44,940
Or are you just gonna
stand there staring at me

438
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,023
like the old Kapoor?

439
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,862
I was not aware there
was a new Kapoor.

440
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,993
Oh, yes. No, there are
two very distinct Kapoors.

441
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:53,062
The old Kapoor was this solemn
fellow who rarely spoke to people,

442
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,633
and then Max comes
on the scene and bam,

443
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,336
all of a sudden
you're smiley-face guy

444
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,969
who randomly lends
$2,000 to the coffee girl

445
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,037
for her quote-unquote dog.

446
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,913
You have no right to
talk about Ella's character.

447
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,713
Except I do, because
she took $2,000 from you.

448
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,186
I gave it to her,

449
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,986
and for the records, there
is no old or new Kapoor.

450
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,719
There is only Kapoor.

451
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,066
Doctor...

452
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,533
So I see that your
patient, Marina Latimer,

453
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,506
is scheduled for an ICD.

454
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,236
Yes.

455
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:33,507
Why is it being charged to
the Community Care Fund?

456
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,810
Because her
insurance is garbage.

457
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,075
Oh. Mmm-hmm.

458
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,744
I don't see Max's signature
anywhere on the document.

459
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:42,515
Right, yeah, he would have
approved that had he not collapsed.

460
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,114
Right. Is she stable?

461
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,018
Yes.

462
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,925
This is not a necessary surgery.

463
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,564
Okay, Mrs. Latimer
has been in and out

464
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,327
of this hospital more
than her own home.

465
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,262
This ICD will completely
change her life.

466
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:03,635
Doctor, a public hospital's job
is not to change people's lives.

467
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,144
It's to save people's lives.

468
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,376
We will not be
paying for this surgery.

469
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,154
Oh, Dean. Hey, Dean,
hi. You wanted to see me?

470
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,318
Yeah. Hi. What's up?

471
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,727
How you holding up,
kiddo? Uh, you know.

472
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,890
Terribly.

473
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,225
We go way back,
don't we? Mmm-hmm.

474
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,301
Am I fired?

475
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,804
Ignatius, come on.

476
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,649
Well, usually when people
say "we go way back,"

477
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,471
it's because you're
not going way forward.

478
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,238
This is about the
nurses and the walkout.

479
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,370
Oh. Oh, good, right. Yes.

480
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,778
Um, HCC needs to come back to the
table so we can make some progress.

481
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,943
They're not coming
back to the table.

482
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,996
Well, if the nurses stand
together, we have a shot.

483
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,460
They're not coming
back to the table.

484
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,956
HCC wouldn't tell
Max, but they told me.

485
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,357
If the nurses walk,
then I have no choice.

486
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,156
I just have to replace
them. You can't.

487
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,322
You can't replace 1,600 nurses.

488
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,408
So I'll have to close the
wards that we can't staff.

489
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,266
I'm gonna have to send the
doctors home, send custodial home.

490
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,634
People are gonna lose
their jobs, and for what?

491
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,173
We work in healthcare,
and we can't provide

492
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,004
our own people with
comprehensive healthcare.

493
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,475
I want you to listen to me now.

494
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,637
With Max down, this
is not the right time.

495
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,113
Convince the
nurses to stand down,

496
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,049
or else everyone,
patients included,

497
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,383
everyone is gonna pay the price.

498
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,545
Fine.

499
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:25,721
All right, fine.

500
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:34,731
Hey, uh, can I get an update?

501
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,564
For Georgia?

502
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,069
He's still unresponsive.

503
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,137
We're having a hard time
getting his heart rate up.

504
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,400
Well, maybe I can help.

505
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,032
He's not your patient.

506
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,069
He's my friend.

507
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,451
Can I talk to you, please?

508
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,459
Then why did you pass him off?

509
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,427
Max...

510
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,990
Max needed fresh eyes.

511
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,168
I've known you six years

512
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:14,502
and I have never once heard
you refer to your eyes as not fresh.

513
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,166
My shift was over.

514
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,334
Lauren.

515
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,141
Why did you pass Max off?

516
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:36,587
I've been working at
Bronx General a lot,

517
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,927
and working here a lot.

518
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,732
I don't know, the last...

519
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:45,361
Last few weeks it was...

520
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,136
It was too much.

521
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:51,101
I hit a wall.

522
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,542
Okay.

523
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,603
And...

524
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,215
I've been taking
a little bit more

525
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,052
Adderall than prescribed.

526
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,552
How much more? I don't know.

527
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,061
Just more.

528
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,662
But I'm handling it, okay?

529
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,896
I'm gonna take some time
off, I'm gonna figure it out.

530
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,996
I was gonna talk to
Max this morning, but...

531
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,536
Anyway...

532
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,670
That's why I passed him off.

533
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,352
So, do you really think
Ella doesn't have a dog?

534
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,263
Are you serious right now?

535
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,967
Is that a serious question?

536
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:55,303
New Amsterdam is
upside down right now.

537
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,936
Max is in the ICU, the dean
wants me to tank the walkout,

538
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,708
and you're focused on
some woman's Chihuahua?

539
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,682
Come on, man. So you
do think she has a dog.

540
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,719
I don't care.

541
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,584
Dog, no dog, it doesn't matter.

542
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,855
It matters to me.

543
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,256
Why?

544
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,754
Why does it matter?

545
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,530
Because...

546
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,695
There is a new Kapoor.

547
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,397
I think there's a new Iggy, too.

548
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,968
So what do you think this

549
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,639
new Iggy and new
Kapoor should do?

550
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,562
Are you Dr. Goodwin's wife?

551
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,796
Yes.

552
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:02,298
I... I just want to say that your
husband is the first man in his position...

553
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,344
To care about the janitors.

554
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,415
We wait for good news.

555
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,926
Hey, hey! I come bearing

556
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,558
the sweetest cantaloupe
you have ever had.

557
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,933
I know your cravings
haven't started yet,

558
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,063
but when they do, I
feel like they're gonna be

559
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,130
really melon-heavy.

560
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,608
I don't know why,
I just get that vibe.

561
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,445
You okay?

562
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,950
What's wrong? Is it the baby?

563
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,614
When I came home there
was a FedEx waiting...

564
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:57,626
With contracts from New
Amsterdam Medical Center.

565
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,456
Good news.

566
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,128
You got the job...

567
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,195
That I didn't know
you'd even applied for.

568
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,102
I didn't... I didn't
apply, it just happened.

569
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,303
When was the interview?

570
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,945
A week ago... A week ago.

571
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,811
But, uh, look, the dean
of medicine called me

572
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:19,317
out of nowhere and he said,
"I need an answer right away."

573
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,182
And I figure why tell
you... "Why tell me"?

574
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,722
If I don't know... We
made a promise, Max.

575
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,215
Remember?

576
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,420
We were going to
raise this child together.

577
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,022
We were going to put
our careers second.

578
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,698
I gave up everything.

579
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,665
This job is the
opposite of that.

580
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,209
I'm gonna make it work.

581
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:46,773
Really?

582
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,337
It is the largest public
hospital in the country.

583
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,326
And I'm gonna figure out
how to squeeze everything in.

584
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,114
Oh, great. Will you, Max?

585
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,929
Will you figure out how
you can squeeze me in

586
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,182
and your child?

587
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,883
That's not what I meant.

588
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,117
Well, that's what's
gonna happen.

589
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,389
By the time this baby
gets here, I'm gonna have

590
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,294
this place running smoothly.

591
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,730
I can come home early.

592
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,324
I can take weekends.

593
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,835
You won't.

594
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,737
Not unless I'm sick, not
unless the baby's sick.

595
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,640
That is the only
way you will stop,

596
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,972
and just...

597
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,105
Be.

598
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,710
And just be what, Georgia?

599
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,478
This is... This is
the life of a doctor.

600
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,075
This is my life.

601
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,381
No, it's not.

602
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,816
It's not.

603
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,755
We know doctors, we
know dozens of doctors,

604
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,819
and this is not their life.

605
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,867
You're obsessed, Max. You are.

606
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,925
It's not healthy.

607
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,604
It's like an addiction.

608
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,339
I know you love me.

609
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,483
But when the hospital calls...

610
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,997
It always wins.

611
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,874
I can't let my daughter grow up

612
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:32,111
feeling like she's not the most
important thing in her father's life.

613
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,884
I can't do this anymore, Max.

614
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,313
Georgia.

615
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,575
With your permission, I
would like to provide Max

616
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,207
with a small prayer.

617
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,058
What is that?

618
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,466
Did I hurt him?

619
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,267
No.

620
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:06,403
I think you might
have just saved his life.

621
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,547
It's called a
paraneoplastic syndrome.

622
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,680
The way his skin got red and
swollen where you kissed him?

623
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,300
That's happening
everywhere in his body.

624
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,817
Everything's becoming red
and swollen, and shutting down.

625
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,489
From the cancer?

626
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,190
Yes.

627
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:30,633
But now that we know
what it is, we can treat it.

628
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,400
And he'll be okay, right?

629
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,099
Uh...

630
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,610
We'll have to wait and see.

631
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,429
Let's let the HCC
know what we want!

632
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,285
We'll march all day!

633
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:51,687
We'll march all night!

634
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,419
'Cause birth
control is our right!

635
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,758
We'll march all day!
We'll march all night!

636
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,627
Louder!

637
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,610
All right, come on! This
one's for the one and only

638
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,694
true Medical Director
of New Amsterdam,

639
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,432
Max Goodwin!
Let's make it bigger!

640
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,633
March all day! March all night!

641
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,320
You know, I just... I... I
think Max would have hated

642
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,245
to see a bunch of clever
homemade protest signs

643
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,543
go to waste, you know?

644
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,481
You look like you're
a small. Right, sir?

645
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,314
There. That's for you.

646
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,952
March all night!
'Cause birth control...

647
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,047
Forceps.

648
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,456
Suture.

649
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:31,954
<i>Reynolds?</i>

650
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,629
<i>Is that Marina Latimer?</i>

651
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,429
It is.

652
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,597
<i>So you're willing to risk
your job for one surgery.</i>

653
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,903
I'm willing to risk my
job for one patient.

654
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,136
Now, the ICD is
implanted, and I'm using

655
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,008
a 4-0 nylon suture for closure.

656
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,274
When I am done, she'll
spend 24 hours in recovery.

657
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,112
Then I am sending
her home without a bill.

658
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,675
If the hospital won't pay,

659
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,252
bill me.

660
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,632
<i>What if I'm wrong</i>

661
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,301
<i>What if I've lied</i>

662
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:23,007
<i>What if I've dragged you here</i>

663
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:27,849
<i>To my own dark night</i>

664
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,821
<i>And what if I know</i>

665
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,381
<i>What if I see</i>

666
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,121
<i>There is a crack</i>

667
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,493
<i>Run right down</i>

668
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,191
I'll give you a moment.

669
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:46,260
<i>The front of me</i>

670
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,208
So that's my wife.

671
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,610
What do you think?

672
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,145
Not bad, right? I did okay.

673
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,441
<i>She would have loved you.</i>

674
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,288
Thing is, I...

675
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,851
I almost blew it with
Georgia a few months ago.

676
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:11,055
She, uh, saw right through me.

677
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:15,191
<i>She figured out that everything
I do is because of you.</i>

678
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,735
<i>I just keep trying to save you.</i>

679
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,906
Over and over, that's all I do.

680
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,408
And I never...

681
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,111
Never will.

682
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,410
So now I have a wife...

683
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,046
<i>And a daughter
on the way, and...</i>

684
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,318
<i>I'm always gonna love you. I...</i>

685
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,590
Always...

686
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,792
Always...

687
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:54,204
But I need to start
living for them, too.

688
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:16,888
Georgia.

689
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:21,723
<i>Ten thousand cars</i>

690
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,291
Oh, my God.

691
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,196
It's okay.

692
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:35,312
<i>To run away</i>

693
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,507
Okay.

694
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:56,661
<i>Not Cohen's hound</i>

695
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,069
<i>If I be wrong If I be right</i>

696
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:06,302
<i>Let me be here</i>

697
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:11,543
<i>With you tonight</i>

698
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,873
Dr. Reynolds.

699
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,400
Is the dean looking for me?

700
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,912
I'm sorry, I can't seem to stop.

701
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,282
Max is awake.

702
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,988
I should have told

703
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,553
everybody from the beginning.

704
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,556
Um...

705
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,600
But I've been wrong before.

706
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,071
Sharpe.

707
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,338
I want to start chemo.

708
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,514
No clinical trials, no risk.

709
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,517
I don't want to risk...

710
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,447
Losing you again.

711
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,625
That's my priority.

712
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:32,020
Which means... SHARPE: No.

713
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,656
No, you're not resigning.

714
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,533
I have no choice.

715
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,161
You will if we help you.

716
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:44,903
I mean, if you're willing to
delegate, we'll all have your back.

717
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,877
Like you had ours.

718
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,107
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, count me in.

719
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,046
Me, too.

720
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,210
I don't mind putting
in the extra time

721
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,754
if it means keeping you around.

722
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,380
Guys...

723
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,288
You're not hearing me.

724
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,328
I think they're hearing
you just fine, Max.

725
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,754
These are your people.

726
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,095
This is your hospital.

727
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:11,159
For better or worse,
there's no going back, Max.

728
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,137
Georgia, help me out.

729
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:22,674
Max is about to start the
most intense fight of his life.

730
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,683
And above everything...

731
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:32,547
He has to take care of himself.

732
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,891
Which is why he's not quitting.

733
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:43,626
<i>Let me be here</i>

734
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,329
<i>With you</i>

735
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:47,201
<i>If I be wrong</i>

736
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,830
This job?

737
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,934
This job is who you are.

738
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,203
In some ways...

739
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,511
It's who you've always been.

740
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,443
I honestly believe

741
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:05,279
that by staying here,

742
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,554
working, helping...

743
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,621
Will keep you alive.

744
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,659
<i>If I be right</i>

745
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,533
<i>Let me be here</i>

746
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:22,131
<i>With you</i>

747
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,038
<i>Tonight</i>
