1
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,817
<i>Start spreading the news</i>

2
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,827
<i>I'm leaving today</i>

3
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,428
<i>I want to...</i>

4
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,571
Uh, Dr. Candelario.

5
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,669
Max. Either you're
getting faster

6
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:41,798
or I'm getting slower.

7
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:42,949
Huh. Since you're my boss,

8
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,320
let's just say
I'm getting faster.

9
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,455
Oh, that's very kind of you.

10
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,072
Thank you, by the
way, for taking charge

11
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,227
while Bloom is on vacation.
I know it's short notice.

12
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,363
Bloom is on vacation? Yeah.

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,330
About time. They took
Dr. Bloom off the schedule

14
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,081
for two weeks.
It's not a problem.

15
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,986
Uh, maybe add another two weeks.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,625
She's acquired
a lot of vacation.

17
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,132
In that case, I'd like to make a
couple of changes around here

18
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,820
to make things more efficient.

19
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,092
Efficient? I love efficient.
What kind of efficient?

20
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,100
First, I wanna switch
the nurses' scheduling

21
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,432
to a seniority-based
point system. Good.

22
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,703
It rewards loyalty. MAX: Nice.

23
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:14,640
Second, I want ED to start using
a supply chain tracking software

24
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,268
for instant restocking
of critical items. Smart.

25
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,939
And third, no more
double and triple shifts.

26
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,039
Personnel need
rest or people die.

27
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,669
Sounds like you
should be doing my job.

28
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,609
Jumper off a six-story building.

29
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,987
Landed on a parked
minivan. 160 over 90, 158.

30
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:32,185
Intubated in the field
but with continued trouble.

31
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,851
Oxygenating on 100%.

32
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,328
Jumper landed on his chest.

33
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,365
Obliterated the
integrity of the chest wall.

34
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,301
Absent breath sounds on the left

35
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,701
with tracheal deviation.
Grab me a blood gas kit.

36
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,739
I need a chest tube
set up. Thank you.

37
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,117
Punch through the intercostal
muscle and get a tube in.

38
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,200
And...

39
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,671
Got it. Run an i-STAT ABG.

40
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,079
Thank you. Do we know who
this guy is? Cell phone, wallet?

41
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,960
Go ahead and start
antibiotics prophylaxis.

42
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,008
Another vet.

43
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,709
It's a Marine.

44
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,749
Alex Demos.

45
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,650
War never ends.

46
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,084
Battlefield rules.

47
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,893
Treat now, mourn later.

48
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,101
We need to know the volume
of the evacuated wound.

49
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,936
<i>Free you act like
you want to be free</i>

50
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,929
<i>Yeah I could go
and let you be free</i>

51
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,667
<i>Do you really
really want to be free</i>

52
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,938
<i>Do you want me to make you free</i>

53
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,007
<i>Try it for myself and be free</i>

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,580
<i>See how it suits me</i>

55
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,409
Billy, leave those people alone.

56
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,047
We're gonna get
kicked out of here.

57
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,516
I hope we land
somewhere with a bed.

58
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,552
You were right. It's
nice to be spontaneous.

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,188
Nice enough to do it again?

60
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,922
Yeah, you can't
plan spontaneity.

61
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,100
People are staring.

62
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,140
<i>Free you act like
you want to be free</i>

63
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,639
Yeah, you're right.

64
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,436
We should probably
take this somewhere else.

65
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,415
<i>Do you really,
really want to be free</i>

66
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,545
Absolutely not.

67
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,013
<i>And you'll wipe your slate clean</i>

68
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,457
<i>Take me to your river</i>

69
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:51,494
<i>I wanna go home</i>

70
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,198
Was I too loud?

71
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,114
Where have you
been hiding that voice?

72
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,539
In the shower.

73
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,873
We gotta take more
showers together.

74
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,705
Sheesh.

75
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,007
Thank you.

76
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,713
Where did you come from?

77
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,181
Uh, Chicago.

78
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:13,618
No, I mean, like, how
did you end up in my life?

79
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,489
Our friend Lauren introduced us.

80
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:17,683
Our friend Lauren?

81
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,118
I forgot.

82
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,055
"I," what?

83
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:27,960
Uh...

84
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:35,339
Am going to take you to
the greatest dinner tonight.

85
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,809
Can't wait.

86
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,105
Don't. What?

87
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,436
Don't say it.

88
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,901
I'm just gonna
say this one thing.

89
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:15,081
I tell Martin I love him,
like, 97 times a day.

90
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,116
That's it. I'm out.

91
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,711
Have a good one.

92
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,693
Dr. Kapoor.

93
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,903
Neuro consult's in Bay 24.

94
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,306
Something feels
different around here.

95
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,565
Calmer.

96
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,801
Dr. Bloom's on vacation.

97
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,941
I have a strict policy
of calm efficiency.

98
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,813
No hysterics, no yelling.
Just simple patient care.

99
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:56,055
Nothing makes me happier
than the words "calm efficiency."

100
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,819
Good. Then you and I are
gonna make a great team.

101
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,655
Very good. Uh, just one thing.

102
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,991
I have a ten D or D policy.

103
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,998
You have ten minutes per
patient to diagnose or discharge.

104
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,465
Keeps the patients
moving through.

105
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,896
Ten minutes? Ten minutes.

106
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,666
I don't think that's
possible because...

107
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,933
Rumination disorder,
six and a half minutes.

108
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,517
Ten minutes it is.

109
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,953
Ah, just the man
I wanted to see.

110
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,784
Really? I haven't
implemented any policies

111
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,790
that even slightly
resemble socialism today,

112
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,291
but it is still early.

113
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,519
What is that god-awful smell?

114
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,938
It's breakfast.
It's, uh, a bagel,

115
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,590
uh, cream cheese, lox, capers,

116
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,634
blended to perfection and about
all my throat can handle right now.

117
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,759
Max. Yeah.

118
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,033
I need you to help me. Yeah,
well, how can I, you know?

119
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,300
So, Karen Brantley
is out of control.

120
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,484
The new chair of the board?

121
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,272
Yeah. She's just
another billionaire

122
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,936
who thinks that her
business acumen

123
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,175
makes her an
expert on healthcare.

124
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,481
Well, who better to make
decisions for a public hospital

125
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,760
than somebody who will
never step foot in one?

126
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,548
Right, but she's trying
to push the board

127
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,350
into restructuring New
Amsterdam into a profit center.

128
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,118
Ah, yeah, kinda goes against
our whole being a patient center.

129
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,802
Exactly. And I'm the
only one on the board

130
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,106
who's willing to
stand up to her.

131
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,721
Well, I would have your
back if I was on the board.

132
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,197
Max, you are on the board. I am?

133
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,860
You are, you just
never attend meetings.

134
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,529
So I need you to
talk to Karen Brantley.

135
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,036
I need you to give
her the full Max.

136
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,539
Just turn this around.

137
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,165
Yeah, consider it turned. Done.

138
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,301
Okay. Yeah.

139
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,571
Don't take the smoothie.

140
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,210
Miss?

141
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,987
It's kinda cold out here.

142
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,086
Do you wanna come
inside the hospital?

143
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,884
Miss?

144
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,026
Excuse me.

145
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,165
Excuse me!

146
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,777
Found down, unresponsive,

147
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,609
pinpoint pupils,
respiratory rate of five.

148
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,241
Looks like an opioid overdose.
I need an intranasal Narcan.

149
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,351
Rashes and blisters
all over. Are you on it?

150
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,445
Get a tube in.

151
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:13,950
Where am I?

152
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,220
My bag. Where's my bag? Whoa!

153
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,540
She's probably
looking for her stash.

154
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:18,793
What did you do with my bag?

155
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,026
Calm down. All right. I
have to get out of here!

156
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,627
Ma'am! No, I need
my bag! Please!

157
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,295
Please.

158
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,465
She can't be more
than a week old.

159
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,064
Neonatal Abstinence
Syndrome. How bad?

160
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,066
Finnegan score
is through the roof.

161
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,101
Good thing you found
her when you did.

162
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,268
She wouldn't have lasted
more than an hour out there.

163
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,971
Is she gonna be okay?

164
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,781
Go and talk to the
mother. I'll take it from here.

165
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,788
Wendy, your baby is suffering
from opioid withdrawal.

166
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,262
You're gonna be
feeling it soon, too.

167
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,765
Is there someone that
we can call for you?

168
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,635
And your baby?

169
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,308
Are you sure?

170
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,876
I didn't mean to hurt her.

171
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,186
I just couldn't...

172
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,224
I couldn't quit.

173
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,963
I tried.

174
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,501
I swear I tried.

175
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,147
What's her name?

176
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,918
I never gave her one.

177
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,505
Ah, another vet. MAX: Yeah,

178
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,994
Alex Demos was lucky
surviving a six-story fall.

179
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,658
Uh-huh, and appears to be
heavily sedated for surgical transport.

180
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,165
Bit of an obstacle when
it comes to talk therapy.

181
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,261
So, what's going on?
What am I doing here?

182
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,929
We need answers he can't give.

183
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,338
We found these on him
and this is not his first rodeo.

184
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,432
Yeah.

185
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:44,943
See, these fractures
are from today,

186
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,513
but these are all
healed fractures.

187
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,673
Oh, yeah.

188
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,842
He's undergone
massive, repeated trauma.

189
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,783
That is some rodeo.

190
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,752
This guy is intent
on hurting himself,

191
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,255
and he's gonna keep trying
unless we can help him.

192
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,614
Yeah, okay.

193
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,537
All right, let me reach out
to my contacts at the VA.

194
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,790
See what I can find out.

195
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:03,920
Okay.

196
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,195
Headaches started around
the time my in-laws moved in.

197
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:10,965
Maybe it's psychosomatic.

198
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,772
But joint pain is not.

199
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,770
Hi, hon. You doing okay?

200
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:15,898
Can I get you anything?

201
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,102
I'm fine, Irene.

202
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,770
I don't think you're
supposed to be back here.

203
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,582
Oh, sorry.

204
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,373
I'm around if you need me.

205
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,346
Oh.

206
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:03,813
Yes.

207
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,151
One second, please.

208
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,521
Sorry, I need more time.

209
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,489
You've had ten minutes.

210
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,965
But Mrs. Laghari's
tests are inconclusive.

211
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,634
I need a more
detailed medical history.

212
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,499
So, ten more minutes, please?

213
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,275
In the spirit of
calm efficiency.

214
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,016
Ten more minutes. Thank you.

215
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,278
But not more.

216
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:36,712
Someone page me?

217
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,314
Yeah, jumper in trauma one.

218
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,451
And heads up. Night
shift rules today.

219
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,358
Candelario's in
charge. Where's Bloom?

220
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,486
Vacation.

221
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,361
Bloom is on vacation? I know.

222
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,491
I hope it's not a sign
of the apocalypse.

223
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,631
Sort of sudden.

224
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,204
She say where she
was going? Nope.

225
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,966
Nor is it any of my concern.

226
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,871
Neither is the color of
her favorite swimsuit,

227
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,375
or whether she packed
an appropriate sunscreen.

228
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,206
What is my concern
is my patients.

229
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:01,804
Here in the ED.

230
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,848
Was just curious.

231
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,084
All I know is that Max asked me

232
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,317
to take her off the schedule
for the next four weeks.

233
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,216
Four weeks?

234
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,386
"Out of the night
that covers me,

235
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,755
"black as the pit
from pole to pole,

236
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,577
"I thank whatever gods may
be." Six units of B-positive.

237
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,069
You mean A-positive, right?

238
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,506
His chart says A-positive from
the dog tags we found on him.

239
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,700
Then his dog tags are
barking the wrong tune.

240
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,937
Type and cross says B-Positive.

241
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,670
Hey. Hey. That
is not Alex Demos.

242
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,425
It's definitely starting
to seem that way.

243
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,693
Yeah, I called my
friends at the VA,

244
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,879
and Alex Demos is a woman.

245
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,577
That's not a woman.

246
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,690
Guess that explains why
this guy isn't A-Positive.

247
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,781
Yeah.

248
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,139
So then, what the hell is
he doing with her dog tags?

249
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,972
Karen Brantley. Max.

250
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,234
Thanks for meeting me.

251
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,633
I appreciate the
lunch invitation.

252
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,243
I'm not familiar with
Le Chariot du Chien.

253
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,712
Is it new?

254
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:13,150
Uh, see, they use these croissants
instead of hot dog buns, so...

255
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,750
Nice touch. Yeah.

256
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,923
You're not joining me?

257
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,427
Mmm-mmm.
Drinking mine, actually.

258
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:26,057
It's chili cheese fries and it's
a little bit of chocolate shake.

259
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,293
It's not bad.

260
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,935
So, I thought maybe
we should discuss

261
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,802
some of your
proposed, uh, changes

262
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,965
for New Amsterdam.

263
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,274
I'm going to assume you
already talked with Dean Fulton,

264
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,030
so let me save you
the trouble of delivering

265
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,570
the rousing speech
you no doubt prepared.

266
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,958
I don't know if I'd say rousing.

267
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,349
It was stirring, maybe, but...

268
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,249
I believe we can
turn New Amsterdam

269
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,256
into a profit center while
still putting patients first.

270
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,850
You do?

271
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,624
The Dean sees everything
as black or white, good or bad.

272
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,998
Which is why the board thinks
it's time for a different Dean.

273
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,325
They what?

274
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:06,372
The board's calling a vote
to terminate Fulton's contract.

275
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,599
Tonight's meeting.

276
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,100
Well...

277
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,275
Wow, when were you planning
on telling Dean Fulton this?

278
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,370
Tonight.

279
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,848
Look, Max, I like you.

280
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,849
You think outside the box.

281
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,513
Renting an apartment
for that homeless person,

282
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,558
reallocating obsolete resources to
service the Sheepshead Bay area,

283
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,126
you're actually making money.

284
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,993
And helping people. See?

285
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,960
We can do both.

286
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,968
You, me and a new Dean.

287
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,163
What do you say?

288
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,700
Mmm.

289
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,880
Miss Birdwell, it's...

290
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,383
Uh, where's Wendy
Birdwell, the baby's mother?

291
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,213
Nobody told you? She left.

292
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,421
Wait, her baby
is still in the PICU.

293
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,215
It's not her baby anymore.

294
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,054
She Safe Haven surrendered her.

295
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,838
How's she doing?

296
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:21,403
Well, she's deficient in
almost every category.

297
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,449
And she can't keep
any formula down.

298
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,749
Jenny says that it's the worst
case of NAS she's ever seen.

299
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,180
They think that she
might lapse into seizures.

300
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,088
We'll get her through it.

301
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,720
How?

302
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:43,596
How does she get through withdrawal
and recovery without her mother?

303
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,067
Her mother didn't
even give her a name.

304
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,705
Maybe Safe Haven
surrender was a good choice.

305
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,943
No choice here is good.

306
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,817
She's just so tiny and helpless.

307
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,248
Baby Doe isn't
responding to treatment.

308
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,790
To any of it? If anything,
it's making her worse.

309
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,420
Jenny, what about rooming in?

310
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,090
It'd be worth a try, but
not without the mother.

311
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,223
What is that?

312
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,234
NAS babies are
sensitive to stimulus

313
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,293
and the PICU's a noisy place.

314
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,634
Rooming in is skin-to-skin
contact in a calm environment

315
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,106
to soothe the baby.

316
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,318
But it requires constant holding

317
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,062
and frequent feeding
from the baby's mother.

318
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,470
I'll do it.

319
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,842
Helen... I can't let that
baby suffer anymore.

320
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,588
Yes, he's right there.
Okay, thank you.

321
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,759
Uh, Dr. Frome? Yes?

322
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,298
Uh, I'm Alex Demos.

323
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,357
The VA told me you
found my dog tags.

324
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,267
Yes, we did, um...

325
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,666
Yeah, I have them.

326
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,831
Here.

327
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,374
Mustafa wasn't a soldier.
He was our Iraqi interpreter.

328
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,460
Interpreters aren't...
They're not part of the unit?

329
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,283
Uh, not officially, no. But
he went everywhere with us.

330
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:09,947
Took enemy fire with us.

331
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,556
Saved the whole
unit more than once.

332
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,881
Hmm.

333
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,484
I mean, that's why I gave him
my dog tags when we pulled out.

334
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,857
So, he'd always
know he was one of us.

335
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,830
Uh, Mustafa's body, um,

336
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,628
had seen a lot of trauma.

337
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,867
A lot of broken bones.

338
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,470
Do you know why he
would want to harm himself?

339
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,536
Mustafa didn't do that.

340
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,405
Al-Qaeda did.

341
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:33,805
Ah.

342
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,006
After we left, they found
out he'd been working for us.

343
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,143
They killed his father
and then they took him.

344
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,348
Oh, my God. Okay, all right.

345
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:48,359
So, after he was released,
he became suicidal?

346
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:49,852
No.

347
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:52,088
I mean, he was
different for sure.

348
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,822
They took something from him.

349
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:58,432
I could see he was in
pain, but he was just focused

350
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,905
on getting out of Iraq,
coming here, starting over.

351
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,735
It took five years
and all of us writing

352
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,221
letters of recommendation
for his visa,

353
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,269
but we got him here.

354
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,178
What was he like
once he got here?

355
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,272
Happy.

356
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,215
We all went to the
airport. The whole unit.

357
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,085
And he seemed so
excited to start his new life.

358
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,414
So then, why did he jump?

359
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,276
How's that headache
diagnosis coming?

360
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,946
Dr. Kao gave me her ten minutes.

361
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:04,760
Tell me about it.

362
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,412
Strawberry banana. I promise.

363
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,473
This is quite the consolation
prize for losing my job.

364
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,651
Oh, it hasn't happened yet.

365
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,246
Doesn't matter.

366
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,652
Tonight is fait accompli.

367
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,260
You know, Max, this can't
be good for you, either.

368
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,661
With me gone, they could
just as easily bench you

369
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,291
before your cancer does.

370
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,530
Wow.

371
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,837
I'll be damned.
It's not like that.

372
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:43,999
What did she offer you?

373
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,620
Brantley said she likes
the changes I've made

374
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,942
and she wants me to...

375
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,139
Keep making them.

376
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,948
Of course, she does.

377
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,278
The knife twists
better that way. Peter.

378
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:02,056
Okay, let me just ask you
something, just out of courtesy.

379
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,830
Are you gonna vote with her?

380
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,135
I'm gonna do what's
best for this hospital.

381
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,668
Hey, let me talk
to you for a second.

382
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:25,242
All right, so Bloom
is on vacation?

383
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,042
Yeah.

384
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,849
That's it? She just...

385
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,316
She just dropped everything?
What do you expect?

386
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,324
She's been pulling doubles.
Doubles on top of doubles.

387
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,113
And she wouldn't
chill it with the Adderall.

388
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,391
It was out of control.

389
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,529
My girl, she just
needed a break.

390
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,157
I just thank God
they finally made her.

391
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,565
Whoa, whoa.

392
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,863
Who made her?

393
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:48,697
Wait, you thought she
was actually on vacation?

394
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,229
She's not crying or
shaking anymore.

395
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,639
I'd call that progress.

396
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,902
She looks almost peaceful.

397
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:29,438
Almost.

398
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:39,892
What's going on in there?

399
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,586
Oh, it's just...

400
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,126
I was just thinking
about this morning.

401
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,394
How nothing was normal.

402
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,235
What's ever normal around here?

403
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,102
My mornings usually are.

404
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,499
But today everything was...

405
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,303
It was out of whack.

406
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,645
I was coming back from Philly.

407
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,851
Totally different schedule.
Different subways.

408
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,046
I didn't even come into
the hospital the same way.

409
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,682
Hmm.

410
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,101
Well, you can't
think about that,

411
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,650
the "what if you
hadn't found her?"

412
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,023
Well, no, it's not that.

413
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,423
Do you ever feel like...

414
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:23,535
Like the universe is trying
to tell you something?

415
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,306
Only all the time.

416
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:32,108
You know how much
I want to have a baby.

417
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:38,144
And my body hasn't
exactly been cooperating.

418
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,787
What if the universe

419
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,551
brought us together? Helen.

420
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:47,957
What if Zuhrah is the baby
that I was meant to have?

421
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,190
Zuhrah?

422
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:54,028
I couldn't keep
calling her "Baby Doe."

423
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,829
She needed a name.

424
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,165
She did.

425
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,702
I've always loved "Zuhrah".

426
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,004
For a girl.

427
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,682
If I had a girl.

428
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,366
I'm giving Dr. Kapoor
my ten minutes.

429
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,036
You.

430
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,378
I've tried to be very
patient with you, Dr. Kapoor.

431
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:53,290
Ten minute consults.
It's not that complicated.

432
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,924
It's not enough time.

433
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,427
Well, it is for everyone else!

434
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,793
My ED, my rules.
Not Dr. Bloom's.

435
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:07,102
For someone who does not
want to run things like Dr. Bloom,

436
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,199
you sound exactly like her.

437
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,479
Incoming!

438
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,077
What the hell happened?

439
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,697
Janitor says the Dean just
collapsed in the hall outside your office.

440
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,898
Dean, we're gonna
take good care...

441
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:24,946
I got this, I got this.

442
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,801
Board meeting. I have to
go to the board meeting.

443
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,470
Don't worry about that. Let's just
worry about getting you healthy.

444
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,895
Give me nitro and
let's set up an IV, stat.

445
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,056
Okay? Thank you.

446
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:38,260
Max,

447
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,170
we were wondering
what was taking so long.

448
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,968
Peter had a heart attack
at New Amsterdam.

449
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,772
What? But he's
gonna be all right.

450
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,473
We expect him to make
a quick and full recovery.

451
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,280
Oh, well, that's good to hear.

452
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,261
Honestly, there was no better
place for him to have had it

453
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,119
than right here surrounded
by an amazing staff

454
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,487
who appreciate
him almost as much

455
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,525
as the esteemed
members of this board.

456
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,256
I mean, I know I do.

457
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,663
He never backs down
from a fight, does he?

458
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,695
Always pushes
me to do what's best

459
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:11,862
for our hospital.

460
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,801
I can't be the medical
director I am without him.

461
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,776
Anyway, uh,

462
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,308
he sends along his heartfelt
thanks for your ongoing support.

463
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,456
How's your pain?
How's your pain level?

464
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:33,784
I've learned to live with it.

465
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,888
Alex told me about
what happened in Iraq.

466
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:40,798
You've been through a lot.

467
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:46,971
Mustafa, what doesn't Alex know?

468
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:48,798
Nothing.

469
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,199
I can't...

470
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,713
She can't ever find out.
She'll think it was her fault.

471
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,010
She's done so much
for me. Okay, it's okay.

472
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,146
It's all right.

473
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,918
Anything you say,
it's between us.

474
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,514
All right? This whole thing.

475
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,089
I thought everything would
be better when I came here.

476
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,524
Some things were.

477
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:20,398
Alex, her family, they tried
to make me feel at home.

478
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:25,238
But, when I'd go out...

479
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,741
To the movies, the store,

480
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:31,950
to look for a job...

481
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:39,519
People just looked at
me like I was a terrorist.

482
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,520
Some even said it to my face.

483
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,923
So much for "support
our troops," huh?

484
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,766
What about going home?
You ever think of doing that?

485
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,202
I can't.

486
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,571
There, I'm a traitor.

487
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,976
Because you worked for us.

488
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:10,621
I thought maybe here in the
city I could meet other Iraqis.

489
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,156
Be part of a community.

490
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,492
But they don't...

491
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:24,931
They weren't in the war.

492
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,768
They don't understand.

493
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,141
There's no one that I can...

494
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,787
I don't belong anywhere.

495
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,624
Alex.

496
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:56,992
Hey. Hi.

497
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,126
How is he?

498
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,471
You know, I'm not gonna lie.
He's got a long road back from here.

499
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,877
But, the good news is, I can
get him into a program here

500
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,355
at our clinic for
torture survivors,

501
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,473
and they will be able
to provide him with a lot

502
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,609
of the therapy he needs,
both mentally and physically.

503
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,342
But...

504
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,290
He's gonna need
more than that, isn't he?

505
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,215
Yeah.

506
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,119
Well, just tell me
what I need to do.

507
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:32,898
You finished?

508
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,198
Hmm?

509
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,468
Oh.

510
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:39,839
Okay.

511
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:43,145
Well, you don't have
to be so bossy about it.

512
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,052
Actually...

513
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,556
Be bossy.

514
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:02,426
You tell me what you
want, when you want it.

515
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,432
You tell the world, little one.

516
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:12,677
You deserve to be heard and
I promise to hear you, always.

517
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,452
Jenny was just in
to take her vitals.

518
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,756
She told me.

519
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,554
Treatment seems to be working.

520
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,690
Yeah.

521
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,232
You wouldn't believe
how much calmer she is.

522
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,629
She's syncing to my heartbeat.

523
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,703
Like I'm her mom.

524
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,744
Please, don't look
at me like that.

525
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,213
I mean, would it really be so
crazy if I wanted to adopt her?

526
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,222
What?

527
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,299
There's someone
here to see the baby.

528
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,504
Wendy gave her up.

529
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,732
It's not Wendy.

530
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,002
It's the baby's father.

531
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:31,981
Do you understand that Zuhrah
was born addicted to opioids?

532
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,260
That her mother was doing drugs

533
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:36,818
while she was pregnant with her?

534
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,462
Why didn't you get her help?

535
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:40,955
I tried.

536
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,759
She didn't listen.

537
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:47,201
We broke up, like,
uh, eight months ago.

538
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,002
Moved up to Poughkeepsie.

539
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,942
I didn't know about the baby.

540
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,645
Not till three hours ago.

541
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,477
And, uh, why did
Wendy change her mind?

542
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:59,347
Because this morning, she didn't
want Dr. Sharpe to call anyone.

543
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:01,882
Maybe she came
down off the drugs?

544
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,150
Maybe she actually
realized what she'd done.

545
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,623
Wendy's not a...
She's not a bad person.

546
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:15,892
She just got
caught up in all this.

547
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,336
She had a bad fall.

548
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,805
Uh, doctors prescribed her Oxy.

549
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,901
She never got off it.

550
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,011
I didn't know that
she was pregnant.

551
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,515
Or I'd have stayed.

552
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,684
I'd have made her get help,

553
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,716
so that things could be
better for my daughter.

554
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,757
And I want to step up.

555
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,393
I wanna do, uh, the right
thing. I want to take her home.

556
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:45,520
Yeah.

557
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,031
It's not that easy.
You got hoops?

558
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,160
I'll jump through them.
Whatever it takes.

559
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:55,667
Yeah, okay.

560
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,507
We'll set you up with a social
worker and get things started.

561
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,168
Awesome. Thank you.

562
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,914
And thank you, Doc.

563
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,848
For everything that
you've done for her.

564
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,011
I'll be a good dad
to her. I swear.

565
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,297
You're all set, Ms. Laghari.

566
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,034
Thanks for
listening, Dr. Kapoor.

567
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,245
Okay, after that
marathon, I gotta know.

568
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,210
What was your final diagnosis?

569
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,113
Lyme disease.

570
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:44,281
Lyme disease?

571
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,655
300,000 people get diagnosed
with Lyme disease every year.

572
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,759
Why did it take you all
shift to come up with that?

573
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,919
I let her complain
about her in-laws.

574
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,932
She talked about
her trips to Minnesota

575
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:55,467
to help them sell their home.

576
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:59,095
I learned of their
affinity for fly-fishing.

577
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:03,237
Near a breeding
ground for ticks.

578
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,808
Well done. Agreed.

579
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,571
You know,

580
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,344
when Dr. Bloom is in charge,

581
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,285
my methods go unnoticed.

582
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,621
But your ED ran
so efficiently today

583
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,249
that those same
methods stood out.

584
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,494
Was there a compliment in
there somewhere, Dr. Kapoor?

585
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,496
There might have been.

586
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,801
Oh, man.

587
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,131
You should have
seen their faces.

588
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:37,938
Totally bought it.

589
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,942
I'm sure you gave
them the full Max.

590
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,990
I know you thought that
the fake heart attack thing

591
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,382
was a little over the top,
but go big or go home, right?

592
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:47,777
Right.

593
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,268
I gotta tell you, I
think you're doing

594
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,383
amazing things at the hospital.

595
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,183
Staff loves you.

596
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,886
Patients thank God
for you every day.

597
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:01,160
And I think for me, hiring
you is the smartest thing

598
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,134
I've done in 50
years of medicine.

599
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,483
All right, you're gonna
give me a fake heart attack.

600
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,167
No, but I'm just glad I got
you here before it's too late.

601
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,041
Too late? What are you...
She's gonna call any second

602
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:17,013
with the terms of your new contract.
I... Max. Max. She already called.

603
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:19,407
I'm out.

604
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,481
No, let me call her. Max.

605
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:24,981
It's done.

606
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,714
I'm out.

607
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,561
I know where Bloom is.

608
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,699
Floyd, we can't talk about that.

609
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,498
Look, I know there
are processes in place,

610
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,715
and I don't wanna
compromise you.

611
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,264
Okay, so then what
are we doing here?

612
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,232
Well, you're a
therapist, aren't you?

613
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,102
You could listen.

614
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,440
Okay, yeah, I can.

615
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:51,873
Come here.

616
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,888
I am struggling
here, man. I just...

617
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,949
I can't help but
feel that I'm...

618
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,791
You know, I thought
I was her friend.

619
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,027
But then I don't
see this coming.

620
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,698
I mean, how is
that even possible?

621
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:14,430
I just keep thinking that had
I asked the right questions,

622
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,550
you know, or if I had said
the right thing and not...

623
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,133
No, Floyd, this is not on you.

624
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,902
Yeah, but she's my friend
and she needed my help.

625
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:22,242
And I wasn't there.

626
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,781
You need to trust the process.

627
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,894
You need to let her have the space she
needs to work through this on her own.

628
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,410
That's it. This is not
something that you can fix.

629
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,614
Do you understand?

630
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,458
Okay, good.

631
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,236
She's beautiful.

632
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,941
Do you want to hold her?

633
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,479
Oh.

634
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,156
Hey there, little one.

635
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,759
I'm your dad.

636
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,696
<i>Been traveling these
wide roads for so long</i>

637
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,126
Uh, I hope you don't mind
if she keeps the name.

638
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:18,431
Kinda suits her.

639
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,537
What's it mean, anyway?

640
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,037
<i>Oh I wanna come here</i>

641
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,441
It means brightness.

642
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,712
<i>Every part of me</i>

643
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,212
Because that's what
she'll bring to your life.

644
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:36,814
<i>And my lips aren't clean</i>

645
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,789
<i>In my darkness I remember</i>

646
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,783
Hey, you up for some visitors?

647
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,190
<i>Surrender to the good Lord</i>

648
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,225
<i>And he'll wipe your slate clean</i>

649
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,905
<i>Take me to your river</i>

650
00:37:56,007 --> 00:38:00,172
<i>I want to go</i>

651
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:02,737
For you, brother.

652
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,312
<i>Oh go on</i>

653
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,583
<i>Take me to your river</i>

654
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:14,254
<i>I want to know</i>

655
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,592
You're one of us.

656
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,188
Always.

657
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,225
<i>Dip me in your smooth waters</i>

658
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,499
<i>I go in</i>

659
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,506
<i>As a man with many crimes</i>

660
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,372
<i>Come up for air</i>

661
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,502
Hi.

662
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,545
I owe you an apology.

663
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,609
I wasn't honest with
you this morning.

664
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:43,779
So, you are not taking me
to the greatest dinner tonight?

665
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,921
<i>But there's blood on my hands</i>

666
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:50,251
I love you.

667
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,198
And I just, uh...

668
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,363
I just can't leave
anything unsaid anymore.

669
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,607
You are the person I
never thought I'd find.

670
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,979
The person I
want to travel with.

671
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:11,046
Build things with.

672
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,308
Learn things from.

673
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,416
What do you need to learn?

674
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,955
How to be a better friend.

675
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,153
Look, I, uh...

676
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,128
I can't go to dinner
with you tonight.

677
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,259
There's someone going
through something and...

678
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,565
I have to be there.

679
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,600
A friend?

680
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:41,971
A mutual friend.

681
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,273
<i>Wanna know, wanna
know, wanna know</i>

682
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,317
Go be a good friend.

683
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,920
<i>Wanna know, wanna
know, wanna know</i>

684
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:53,623
For both of us.

685
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:01,259
<i>Wanna know, wanna
know, wanna know</i>

686
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,635
<i>Ooh oh whoa</i>

687
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,032
<i>Take me to your river</i>

688
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:14,678
<i>I wanna go</i>

689
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,676
Are you okay? I came
as soon as I could.

690
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,518
Oh.

691
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,693
I need to ask you something.

692
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,360
And you're gonna think
I'm crazy for asking you now.

693
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,226
Just ask.

694
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,737
I know that we haven't been
seeing each other for very long

695
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,976
and it's way too soon to
be having this conversation

696
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:56,511
but I am getting too old not
to have this conversation.

697
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,417
Oh.

698
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,085
I want to have a child.

699
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:10,032
And I need to know how
you feel about kids because...

700
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:15,331
I've been trying to find a way to
talk to you about the same thing.

701
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:17,933
You have?

702
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,014
I love kids.

703
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,385
I wanted to tell you sooner.

704
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,050
I just...

705
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,457
Had to be sure.

706
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:38,556
About?

707
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:40,888
Us.

708
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,987
There's someone here to see you.
