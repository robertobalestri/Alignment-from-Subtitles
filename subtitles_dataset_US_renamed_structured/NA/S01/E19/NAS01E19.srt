1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,968
So, I've got this friend and
great guy, a little stubborn,

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,840
but, as life would
have it, he's got cancer.

3
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:11,968
Is that so? Don't worry.

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,156
He's keeping his head
up, staying positive.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,480
And here's the thing...
Oh, there's a thing.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,143
I assumed cancer
was the big twist.

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,029
No, see, my friend
recently got this new doctor

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,954
who, as it turns out,
is making it really hard

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,650
for my friend to stay positive.

10
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,034
Hang on, this sounds
like somebody I know.

11
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,185
Really? Weird.

12
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:29,354
Not only did she put my friend on
an impossible to maintain schedule,

13
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,661
but now she's insisting that
my friend get a feeding tube.

14
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,135
So he was really hoping that
he could get a second opinion.

15
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,114
And your friend wouldn't also
happen to be the medical director

16
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,016
of a major public hospital
in New York, would they?

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,509
Well, he asked me to
keep his name out of it.

18
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:43,703
Max, I... No, no names.

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,155
That would be a huge betrayal
to my incredibly private friend.

20
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,909
But my friend was wondering

21
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,417
if maybe you could talk to
Dr. Stauton and change her mind?

22
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,010
I will do no such
thing. I'm this way.

23
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,318
Which is why I'm going this way.

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,690
Okay. But she's
totally gone rogue.

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,924
Okay? She peppers all her
diagnoses with basketball analogies.

26
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,541
Sometimes you've just
got to shoot from mid-court.

27
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,726
No. Not you, too.

28
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,211
Max, you're on the fourth foul
and there are no timeouts left.

29
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,146
Okay, this basketball thing
is spinning out of control.

30
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,810
Just a second opinion
on the feeding tube.

31
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,170
That's all I'm asking for. Okay.

32
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,708
You want my second opinion? Yes.

33
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,006
You need to listen
to your actual doctor.

34
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,778
I see what you did there.

35
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,086
If it makes you feel
better... I'm sure it won't.

36
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,250
Think of the feeding
tube like the sixth man

37
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,726
coming off the bench when
the starters need a break.

38
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,889
Really? 'Cause I
see it more like a pipe

39
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:40,025
protruding from my stomach,
spilling my morning coffee.

40
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,296
The chemo has left you
with frequent nausea.

41
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:46,362
The radiation has burned your throat.
As a result, you have been eating less.

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,035
You've lost five
pounds in one week.

43
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,136
Malnutrition negatively
affects your treatment.

44
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:56,580
It can also impair muscle
function, decrease immunoresponse,

45
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,315
and amass dangerous
toxicity levels within your body.

46
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,914
Max, inserting a feeding
tube would mitigate that.

47
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,895
Okay, yeah.

48
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:16,070
Put me in, Coach.

49
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,586
These site visits are really more
of a formality at this point, so...

50
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,511
I've been looking
forward to it. Oh?

51
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,405
What's in the bag?
Oh, here we go.

52
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,780
These are Jemma's favorites.

53
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,570
They're from a little
Trinidadian restaurant

54
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,814
near the hospital the
kids order from sometimes.

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,652
Once, no joke, Jemma
ate four of these.

56
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,402
I mean, I might have
helped a little bit, but...

57
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,503
Hope you brought
enough to share.

58
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:41,738
No, no. There
will be no sharing.

59
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,043
Once I put these down in
front of her, watch your fingers.

60
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,798
Hey, Jemma. Hey, kiddo.

61
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,358
How you doing, Jemma?

62
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,037
I'm fine.

63
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,775
Well, I hope you're
ready to be awesome

64
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,870
because I brought doubles and
kurma from Leelee's Roti Shop.

65
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,004
Boom.

66
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,213
I'm good.

67
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,160
Okay, well, I'll leave
them here on the counter

68
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,986
if you want them later, okay?

69
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,489
Everything's okay?

70
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,501
Oh, she's just
cramming for a test.

71
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,300
Things have been great.

72
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,947
So everything's
okay with school?

73
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,736
Yeah, her teachers at
Jefferson say she's catching up.

74
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,401
And her friends? I
met most of them.

75
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,912
Good kids. Creative,
misfits, like Jemma.

76
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,506
But they really seem
to get each other.

77
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,143
Seems to me she's
settling in just fine.

78
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,710
So Dr. Christiansen

79
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,915
will finish up with
the low pitches now.

80
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,425
As before, raise your right
hand if you hear a sound.

81
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,518
If you don't, it's okay.

82
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,995
This is to help us diagnose

83
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,498
what's wrong with
the cochlear implant.

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,829
Margot?

85
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,363
Do you need a break?
Is everything all right?

86
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,702
She doesn't like tests.

87
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,575
It's the device we
are testing, not you.

88
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,740
And if it makes you feel
better, I will give you an A+.

89
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,847
Tori and I will be
just outside the door.

90
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,079
Okay.

91
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,919
Okay, let's start.

92
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,416
So, it's been nine months.

93
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,225
We're still having problems.

94
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,059
It's almost
impossible to predict

95
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:28,034
the rehabilitation period
after a cochlear implant.

96
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,938
I mean, we weren't expecting
her to talk on the phone

97
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,373
but she can't even take the
subway without getting dizzy.

98
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,810
She seems confused and sad.

99
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,314
I know how it feels to see
your loved ones in pain,

100
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:46,876
but once we diagnose the
issue with the device, we can fix it.

101
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,456
Is everything okay? The
implant seems to be functional.

102
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,293
Basal electrode
responses? All normal.

103
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,998
So it's not the device,
then what's the matter?

104
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,106
Dr. Reynolds. Max.

105
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,668
Dr. Reynolds.

106
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,623
Why do I feel like the two
of you are getting ready

107
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,115
to throw me into
an unmarked van?

108
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,913
Your quarterly budget
is three weeks late.

109
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,182
Oh... Yeah. See, what
had happened was...

110
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,567
Yeah, and if it's
not done today,

111
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,489
then cardiothoracic is going to
have no budget for next quarter.

112
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:28,323
Which means no surgical supplies,
no surgeons, and no surgeries.

113
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,695
Luckily for you, we have a Dora
and Dora is going to help you.

114
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,667
And by help you, I mean
torture you until it's finished.

115
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:40,139
Every line in perfect order,
back-to-back. She's really kind of tough.

116
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,540
So you are here by
sequestered to this office

117
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:48,775
until it's done or, um, you're
dead, whichever comes first.

118
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,141
Wait, you mean now? Mmm-hmm.

119
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,814
No, but... but they need me on the
floor. Can't somebody else do this?

120
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,517
It's your department.
Your budget.

121
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,355
You get everything you want.
You just have to ask for it.

122
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,225
In a properly formatted
Excel-generated spreadsheet.

123
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,129
And Dora really excels at this.

124
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,360
No, it's not funny? Okay.

125
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,197
Well, smile and nod
or pay the price later.

126
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,895
Max, come on! I'm a doctor!

127
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,336
Yeah, not without a budget.

128
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,374
Shall we, Dr. Reynolds?

129
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,710
Can I at least go to the
bathroom first? Mmm...

130
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,836
I think you know
the answer to that.

131
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,507
Everybody out of the
way. Yo! Clear the way!

132
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,348
Jeez, Marie. I turn my
back for two seconds...

133
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,481
It should've been you. Nice.

134
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,001
All right, what do you
got? Marie McNeil.

135
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,256
40-year-old female police
officer on foot when struck...

136
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,405
By a drunk driver. Hit and
run. All right. We got it. Thanks.

137
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,762
Motor vehicle struck right
leg fracturing the femur.

138
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,476
She bounced off the
hood followed by the road,

139
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,765
resulting in thoracic
abrasions and contusions.

140
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:43,980
She's going to
be all right, right?

141
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,081
Why don't you alert her family?

142
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,316
Let them know where she is.
I'm her partner. I'm her family.

143
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,719
All right, let's get her to bay
29 and get Max down here now.

144
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,507
Hang in there, okay?

145
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,410
Be okay. Please.

146
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,712
Give us some room. She's okay.

147
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,886
Yeah, I... I hear you, Commissioner.
Of course. No, you have my word.

148
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,861
Officer McNeil will receive
the very best care possible.

149
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,557
We've got everything
under control.

150
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,895
Yes. No, thank you, sir.

151
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,867
Police Commissioner?
The one and only.

152
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,904
You ever experienced
a blue wave?

153
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,370
Uh... Sure. In Chinatown.

154
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,100
Then you haven't
experienced a blue wave

155
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,617
at New Amsterdam,
when a cop is brought in,

156
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,119
it's like his whole
family comes with him,

157
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,476
only that family is
three-quarters of the NYPD.

158
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,614
As advertised. I
see what you mean.

159
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,878
Everyone? I'm Max
Goodwin, the medical director.

160
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,030
Hi, I appreciate that you
want to support your colleague,

161
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,046
but this is still a
functioning ED. Go ahead.

162
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,615
So we need to keep this area
clear and calm, if at all possible.

163
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,592
I'd like to ask everyone
to move this vigil

164
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,630
outside these doors.
We really appreciate it.

165
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,667
Leon Hargrow. 68. Probable
DUI. Lacerations to left forearm.

166
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,847
Chemical burns on his face
and hands from the airbag.

167
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,064
I didn't see. Where...

168
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,432
Where... Where am I?

169
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,806
Any sign of head injury?

170
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,088
Witnesses saw him swerving all
over the road before the accident.

171
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,603
That's him!

172
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,447
That's the DUI who hit Marie!

173
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,451
Someone call security. I
think security is covered.

174
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,358
You're going down for a
long time, you hear me?

175
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,166
Easy, easy. ANGELO: I
know you can hear me!

176
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,126
I'm gonna make sure you're locked
up for the rest of your sorry-ass life!

177
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,162
Easy! Get him
back! Get him back!

178
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,786
Back up! Back up, now!

179
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,697
You're not getting away!
Get him back! Get him back!

180
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,439
Angelo's been Marie's
partner going on eight years.

181
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,000
Those two are like
sister and brother.

182
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,609
He's messed up, but he was
never going to do anything

183
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,842
to that driver. You
sure about that?

184
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:39,442
What can I say? We
take care of our own.

185
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,263
Yeah, well, as long as
you take care of Angelo,

186
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,927
I got no problem with
you guys being here.

187
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,481
I'm sorry for the disruption.
It won't happen again.

188
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,687
Our full focus needs to be on Marie.
Her recovery is what's important.

189
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,855
Not to worry. He'll
get it together.

190
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,798
Thanks. I'll, uh, keep you updated
as I learn more about her progress.

191
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,495
Thank you. You got it.

192
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,196
Hey, how's she doing?

193
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,367
Stable-ish. She's
pretty banged up.

194
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,169
I'm waiting on a cardio consult.

195
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,154
What about the
driver? How's he doing?

196
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,204
Waiting on lab results
from his tox screen.

197
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,306
We need to put some distance
between him and Marie's partner.

198
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,515
Driver's stable. He can move.

199
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,687
Do it.

200
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,885
Where should we put him?
I cleared a bed in the ICU.

201
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,015
He's still out.

202
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,527
It is going to be one
hell of a rude awakening.

203
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,248
There he is! Just the
boss I was looking for!

204
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,686
Can I get an autograph on this?

205
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,349
You bet. Thank you.

206
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,335
Not everyone would sign
their kidneys away like that,

207
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,670
but I really need the
money, so thank you.

208
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,560
Give me that. Another
site visit for Jemma?

209
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,840
I thought you just
had one of these.

210
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,389
Yeah, I thought you had cancer.

211
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,627
Only on the inside.

212
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,965
Okay, well, yeah, so I'm a little
worried Jemma might be isolating.

213
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,595
She literally said
three words to me,

214
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,283
went back in her room, and
didn't come back out again.

215
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,869
Can I give you my completely
unqualified psychological diagnosis?

216
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,039
Sure, why not? She's a teenager.

217
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,605
Well, yeah...

218
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,892
Yo, can I get a
consult? Oh, thank God.

219
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,133
How can I help? You can
tell me who on your team

220
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,261
is available for a consult. Me.

221
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:41,775
Lab supplies and
consumables. $14,400.87.

222
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,470
Max, please.

223
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,507
What do you got for me?

224
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:47,911
This isn't fair.

225
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,416
Look, if I had known it was
going to be this much paperwork,

226
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,008
I would've never
signed up to be Chair.

227
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,829
You didn't. I kind of
forced you to be Chair.

228
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,515
Sorry about that.

229
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,085
Pull Hastings off
her VATS procedure.

230
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,184
Thank you.

231
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,930
Nice try. Next line item?

232
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,930
Is everything okay?
Are you all right?

233
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,476
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,711
I'm usually not like
this. Neither of us are.

235
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,372
No, it's, it's...

236
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,681
It's all right.

237
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:31,019
I don't know what happened.
We literally never fight.

238
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,784
We met at a meditation workshop.

239
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,494
Margo being able to hear,

240
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,799
this was supposed to
bring us closer together,

241
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,340
but it's just driving us apart.

242
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,206
Tori, I...

243
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,303
I know someone who could help.

244
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,316
Okay.

245
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,732
Margot.

246
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,107
Margot.

247
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,878
I believe there may be
issues that aren't related

248
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,943
to your cochlear implant.

249
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,090
This is my colleague, Dr. Frome.

250
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,953
Let's talk.

251
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,929
Max.

252
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,110
Okay, before you speak, you
should know that my friend,

253
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,193
the one with the cancer,

254
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,713
is getting a PEG feeding
tube installed today.

255
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:55,072
So this donut represents his last meal.
Assuming he can, you know, swallow it.

256
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,110
Leon Hargrow wasn't drunk.

257
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,974
The driver? I just
got his blood work.

258
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,377
There were no drugs or
alcohol in his system. None.

259
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,281
But people saw him swerving?

260
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,717
He had a stroke
behind the wheel.

261
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,778
- And that's not all...
- Dr. Goodwin.

262
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,483
I can't find Angelo. No
one knows where he went.

263
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,991
You don't think he went after...

264
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,259
Yeah, I do.

265
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,570
Angelo?

266
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,772
Officer, back away
from that bed right now.

267
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,748
Hey, let's talk about this.

268
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,986
Somebody's got to pay.

269
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,484
Angelo, I understand that you're
upset, but this wasn't his fault.

270
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,291
Don't give me that.

271
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,993
He was wasted. I
saw him swerving.

272
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,537
He had an embolic
stroke while he was driving.

273
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,604
He wasn't drunk. He's very sick.

274
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,876
He's a vet, have
some compassion.

275
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,883
Angelo, please.

276
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,885
Go back downstairs
to the waiting area.

277
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,820
Your partner? She
needs you right now.

278
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,690
Make sure that you
get him downstairs.

279
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,195
What... Wait, what is it?
It's Marie. She's coding.

280
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,899
O-2 sat down to 86.
Respirations up to 30.

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,866
Decreased breath
sounds bilaterally!

282
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,495
Heart rate's down to
48. Hang in there, Marie!

283
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,667
O-2 sat might drop again.
Respiratory rate climb.

284
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,214
I've got to get the pulmonary kit.
Dropping an intubation tray now.

285
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,313
Neck vein
distention. Both sides.

286
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,253
It's hard to see because of
the cervical collar but it's there.

287
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,516
Pneumomediastinum. Yeah.

288
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,867
Good call. There must be a
hole in Marie's esophagus.

289
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,269
We need to get her to the OR,

290
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,206
open up her chest and close
that hole before this happens again.

291
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,341
Is she going to be okay?

292
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,045
Mr. Hargrow... I
need to see her.

293
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,758
Look, sir... I need
to tell her I'm sorry.

294
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,220
Sir, you... You
need to remain calm.

295
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,952
But... I promise you,

296
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,721
she is receiving the
best care possible.

297
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,958
But right now, we
need to focus on you.

298
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,066
The stroke that you had was
caused by a malignant tumor

299
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,771
in your bladder.

300
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,112
I know that this is
distressing news.

301
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:52,310
We need to remove your tumor
immediately and start you on a regimen.

302
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,877
All I want to know is if
that woman is going to live.

303
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,754
Mr. Hargrow, your
condition is very serious.

304
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,727
I already know
what's wrong with me.

305
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,829
How long have you known?

306
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,927
If you knew, then why on Earth
haven't you gotten treatment?

307
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:17,102
I don't want treatment. I just
want to apologize for what I did.

308
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,338
I understand.

309
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:27,186
But right now, that is not a
good idea for either of you.

310
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,180
Then I guess there's
nothing else to talk about.

311
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,793
Dr. Kapoor thought
that it would be beneficial

312
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,838
if we sit down and talk
about what's happening

313
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,599
during the rehab process.

314
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,336
And that's sort of my job around
here is to create an environment

315
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:54,278
or space to explore what's
happening to you emotionally.

316
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,714
Both of you. The interpreter
will be here very soon.

317
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,182
I assure you.

318
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:03,614
I'm very sorry about the delay.
Should be any moment now.

319
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,635
Okay. We're just
diving right in. Um...

320
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,675
Angry? I... Uh...

321
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:32,341
Okay, can we just... Guys,
can we slow down just a touch?

322
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,581
Just... I'm getting some
of it. It's a little too fast.

323
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,522
I have never said
you were a burden.

324
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,323
Okay, time out. Time. Time out.

325
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,326
Um... Take a breath. Okay?

326
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,924
I need to catch up
here, but I'm assuming...

327
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,936
Tori, Margo said that
she feels like a burden.

328
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,666
Yeah. Is that right?

329
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,198
Okay, is that... Is that
how you feel about her?

330
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:02,015
No. I have never
thought of her that way.

331
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,779
All right, so why don't you tell
her how you do feel about her?

332
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,581
Margot has just always
had this spirit in her

333
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:16,720
that had to experience
the world, on her own terms.

334
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,861
Margot bungee jumped off the
Manhattan Bridge at 3:00 a.m.

335
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,562
when we were in college.

336
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,865
Are you kidding?

337
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,263
Wow!

338
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,373
Right.

339
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,570
I think that she's fearless.

340
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,547
So tell her.

341
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,594
"I feel so far away from
that person right now.

342
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,765
"I know I pushed us here
because I wanted the implant

343
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,936
"and you supported
me through all of it,

344
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:04,808
"with the money and the
surgeries, because I wanted it.

345
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,507
"And now I'm
afraid that I've risked

346
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:16,248
"the most important relationship
of my life because of them."

347
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,356
Why do you want the implant?

348
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,866
"So I can hear."

349
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,962
Well, okay. That's
what the implant does.

350
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,605
Why do you want the implant?

351
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,823
"I want it..."

352
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,812
Appreciate it. Thank you.

353
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,144
Throw it in there. Thanks, bud.

354
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,577
How you doing?
Hey, good to see you.

355
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,322
Thanks. Thank you.

356
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,320
Yo, Russetti.

357
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,329
You already taking
up for Marie's funeral?

358
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,335
Relax. It's for her recovery.

359
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,031
She's gonna be ordering
takeout for a while after this.

360
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,866
Thanks.

361
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,445
What's going on? How is she?

362
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,424
We stabilized her and we're
prepping her for surgery.

363
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,848
Now she's not out
of the woods yet,

364
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,511
but she does seem to be
responding to treatment.

365
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,551
Is that for Marie? Yeah,
it's something the PD does.

366
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,067
We have a fallen heroes fund
for officers hurt in the line of duty.

367
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,684
Then count me in.

368
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,187
I'll let you know
when she's out.

369
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,423
Hey.

370
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,859
Thanks, Dr. Goodwin.

371
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,195
Sure.

372
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,935
Guess who's back?

373
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,266
Is it legit or did you
"Shawshank" your way out of it?

374
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,311
Hey, you know what? After spending
the whole afternoon with Dora,

375
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,123
I finally know how the
lights stay on in this place.

376
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:24,413
What do we got? Boerhaave's
esophagus, surgical repair.

377
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,048
All right. Looks good.
Let's get to work.

378
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:36,456
Officer McNeil, I'm
Dr. Reynolds. This is Dr. Hastings.

379
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,554
We're going to be
performing your surgery today.

380
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:43,596
Two doctors? Must be pretty bad.

381
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,639
Vitals are good.
We'll see you in there.

382
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,242
You've had a morning.

383
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,271
Yeah, cops are supposed to
go down chasing the bad guy.

384
00:21:56,348 --> 00:22:00,285
I get clipped writing a traffic
ticket to a grown man on a scooter.

385
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,080
I'm never gonna
hear the end of it.

386
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,920
Hey, well, at least you
were out there, all right?

387
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,460
I spent my morning sitting
in front of a spreadsheet.

388
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,990
I hate desk work.
Tell me about it.

389
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,125
Put me on the street.
That's where I want to be.

390
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,137
In the action, right? Yeah.

391
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:22,938
My partner, he calls me "one direction"
'cause I always head straight in.

392
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,839
I don't even think about
it. I don't get scared.

393
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,506
Put me in the line of fire
when somebody needs help.

394
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,143
That's my happy place.

395
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:40,688
Well, if it makes you feel any
better, helping you right now?

396
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,219
That's my happy place.

397
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,463
I'll see you in there.

398
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,015
VA just sent over his records.

399
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,420
Oh, thank you.

400
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:16,151
You've got to be kidding me.

401
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,995
Kapoor. How did it go?

402
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:25,094
Well, it was good. Very optimistic.
You know a lot... A lot came out.

403
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,832
There was a definite
unearthing going on.

404
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,273
But ultimately, I do
believe that Tori and Margot

405
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,207
are going to be
stronger than ever.

406
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,007
That's wonderful news. Yeah.

407
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,546
I've discussed with
Dr. Christiansen,

408
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:37,674
and she's confident that we
can move forward with the MRI.

409
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,551
Well, actually Margot touched
on something really profound.

410
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,612
Powerful. What?

411
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,214
She would like to have her
cochlear implant removed.

412
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,952
Vijay, she wants
to be deaf again.

413
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:08,036
"It matters not how strait the gate,
how charged with punishments the scroll,

414
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:14,417
"I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul."

415
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,224
Cap refill less
than two seconds.

416
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,490
Patient induced.

417
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,505
Twenty micrograms of fentanyl.

418
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,403
T-probe and defib...

419
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,070
Standing by.

420
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,121
<i>I'm so tired of being alone</i>

421
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,316
<i>I'm so tired of on my own</i>

422
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,915
<i>Won't you help me, girl</i>

423
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,987
<i>Just as soon as you can</i>

424
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:03,994
You've tried to get treatment
two years ago, didn't you, Leon?

425
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,469
Tried.

426
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,174
I went and saw my doc at the VA.

427
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,833
They took me in right
away like they usually do.

428
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,703
Once they found out what I had,

429
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,924
they said they didn't have
the right doctor for me there.

430
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,780
Said that I had to
go somewhere else.

431
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,319
So they gave you a voucher
and sent you on your way.

432
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,649
Yeah.

433
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,990
But you didn't use it.

434
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,524
I wanted to. But the voucher
didn't cover everything.

435
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,703
I'm on my own.

436
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,002
Couldn't afford the difference.

437
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,078
I served my country with pride.

438
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,250
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

439
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,756
I did four tours.

440
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,389
Army Rangers.

441
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,029
You deserve better than this.

442
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,341
I never meant to put
anyone in harm's way.

443
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,210
Max, I am scheduling
Leon Hargrow

444
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:27,515
for emergency bladder
surgery and radiation.

445
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,714
Well, let's hope he needs
it. Turns out the VA closed

446
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,868
their urology department,
so instead of treating him,

447
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,393
they gave him a voucher to
use at a hospital of his "choice."

448
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,589
We'll take a voucher. The
voucher only covers 75% of the cost.

449
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,207
He's stuck with the
rest. We'll cover the rest.

450
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,255
What's the problem again?

451
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,529
Do they think that Leon only
gave 75% while he was in Vietnam?

452
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,213
Not to mention there's
compelling evidence

453
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,263
that urothelial carcinoma
is a directly related

454
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,601
to exposure to Agent Orange.

455
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,438
Helen, this is a public
hospital. This is why we're here.

456
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,876
If the VA won't
treat Leon, we will.

457
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,039
<i>No, you won't.</i>

458
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,812
HCC was notified of a payment
being submitted via a VA voucher.

459
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,886
That's right. We
can't accept it.

460
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:04,082
Why not? Then we'd have
to accept all VA vouchers.

461
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:07,092
As long as veterans are
getting the care they need,

462
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,787
I'm not seeing the problem.

463
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:12,262
The problem's the public health system
then has to potentially foot the bill

464
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,768
for thousands of veterans and
the 25% the VA doesn't reimburse.

465
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,100
We have a veteran in the ICU who
needs surgery or he's going to die.

466
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:23,506
I don't care who I have to call, but
Leon is getting that surgery today.

467
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,168
I understand your
intentions, Max,

468
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:28,247
but this is privatization
and we're playing right into it.

469
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,475
If we approve of Leon's
surgery and we foot the bill,

470
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,347
it sets a dangerous precedent
for the rest of the country.

471
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,584
Either we save Leon and hurt
the care for every other veteran

472
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,786
or we stand up for better
care for all veterans...

473
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,522
And let Leon die.

474
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,504
I respect your
wishes, of course.

475
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:59,702
And I'm aware that this is a
debate in the deaf community,

476
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:05,443
but removing an implant
is a very risky surgery.

477
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,156
"I just want the pain to stop."

478
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,291
I... I want that, too.

479
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,693
And... And... There are
different types of implants

480
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,697
we can use before we...

481
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,558
"Not that kind of pain.

482
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:28,005
"The migraines, the dizziness,
the strange tones, I expected that.

483
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,033
"My friends told
me that would come.

484
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:36,681
"That they all love their
implants, but I don't.

485
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,581
"I miss who I was.

486
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:49,061
"How I experienced the world.

487
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,555
"I don't expect you to understand,
but before the implant, music...

488
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:01,363
"Was something I felt and
now it's just weird words

489
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,375
"with weird textures.

490
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:07,072
"And my thoughts
used to be my own,

491
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,745
"and now they're just
cluttered with distractions.

492
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:15,717
"I thought I was
missing something.

493
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:20,418
"But really... I'm
missing what I had.

494
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:35,807
"I loved hearing Tori's voice.

495
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,776
"But I heard you better...

496
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,314
"When I couldn't
hear your voice at all."

497
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,106
Hey, kiddo.

498
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,975
So, I really messed up.

499
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,013
Big time.

500
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:25,247
I forgot to bring the Solo when
I brought the doubles earlier.

501
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,986
I'm a bonehead.

502
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,958
Yeah. Well, that's for you.

503
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,762
Thank you. You're welcome.

504
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,930
So listen, I, uh... I was
thinking a lot about before

505
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,799
when I came by with Sophia.

506
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,468
You know you can
tell me anything, right?

507
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:51,149
Yeah, that's kind
of the problem.

508
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,886
Why is that a problem?

509
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,630
'Cause I've told you everything.

510
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:11,403
Yeah. You know
everything about me.

511
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,402
You know every detail
of all of the homes.

512
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:21,409
Yeah. All of the
bad... The bad stuff.

513
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,350
You know, and now...

514
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:36,827
When I see you, I just... I feel
like... Like I'm still the same.

515
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,492
Like I'm still broken.

516
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:47,029
I don't want to be that anymore.

517
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:04,182
You know, Jemma,
I... I'm so proud of you.

518
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,687
So proud. You've come so far.

519
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,457
Look at you.

520
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,732
You don't need me anymore.

521
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,541
That's a good
thing. That is a...

522
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:26,473
That's a very good thing.

523
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,714
It's time for me to go. I've got
to go. Um... And that's all right.

524
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,317
Just, uh, just...

525
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,888
Just try to remember
one thing for me.

526
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,094
You were never broken.

527
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,240
Richardson.

528
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,986
Blood pressure 100/72.

529
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,922
Clamp. NURSE: Clamp.

530
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,619
Suction. Suction.

531
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,126
Lap pad. NURSE: Lap pad.

532
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,289
<i>Dance to the music</i>

533
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,465
Blood pressure is dropping.

534
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,432
Lap pad.

535
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,971
Femoral pulse diminished.

536
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,199
Where's all the
blood coming from?

537
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,346
- Uh, can't see anything.
- Gas exchange tanking.

538
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,835
Got it. Free wall rupture.

539
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,039
Right ventricle. Suture, hurry.

540
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,378
So the blood's just
pouring out of her heart?

541
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,652
Yes.

542
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,348
The surgery was going
well. I know. Keep sewing.

543
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,946
But why is the wall blown?

544
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:49,154
I have no idea, but we have about a minute
to suture it back up, okay? Just focus.

545
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,872
- We've lost carotid pulse.
- Gas exchange tanking.

546
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,139
The brain's not
getting any blood.

547
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,689
She's bleeding out. Keep sewing.

548
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,234
I'm trying but the
sutures keeps pulling out.

549
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,167
The heart muscle's too weak.

550
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,806
- Did you get it?
- She's cyanotic.

551
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,369
Well, her heart's
still in pieces.

552
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,510
There's no more blood to pump.

553
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,518
It's all gone.

554
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,320
<i>Hear my organ</i>

555
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,991
<i>I said ride Sally ride</i>

556
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,001
You gonna call it?

557
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,514
<i>Cynthia on the throne, yeah!</i>

558
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,745
<i>Listen to me</i>

559
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,849
Time of death, 4:16 p.m.

560
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,067
4:16 p.m.

561
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,077
<i>Listen to the voices</i>

562
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,678
Hi. Condolences. Thank you.

563
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,761
It shouldn't have
gone down like that.

564
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,667
She shouldn't have died.

565
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:13,830
I know. No. You don't.

566
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,711
Marie never should've
been out there.

567
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,717
But I had a migraine today.

568
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,318
A stupid migraine.

569
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,719
So she steps up to
point and I stay in the car.

570
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,961
Being a cop was
Marie's whole life.

571
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,834
She didn't have
a husband or kids.

572
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,500
We were her family and
that's all that mattered.

573
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,840
Living for this job.

574
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,077
She wanted to be a hero.

575
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,892
And she gets killed
at a traffic stop?

576
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:13,820
She was a hero the moment
she put that shield on.

577
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,121
<i>We found our place</i>

578
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,360
<i>On the branch of an old gum tree</i>

579
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,866
<i>Our feet would sway</i>

580
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,877
<i>To a voice in the breeze</i>

581
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,742
<i>And birds would sing</i>

582
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:11,119
<i>On the banks of a narrow stream</i>

583
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:21,458
<i>These memories will stay with me</i>

584
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,091
It's time.

585
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,071
<i>Ooh</i>

586
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,836
We're not going
to stop fighting this.

587
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,343
I promise you, we'll
figure it out, Leon.

588
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:39,140
Leon, this is Angelo
Russetti. Marie's partner.

589
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,620
<i>Ooh</i>

590
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,657
<i>Ooh</i>

591
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,327
The guys and I
have been talking.

592
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,135
Marie didn't have any
family and we figured...

593
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:03,102
She'd want the money they would've
gotten from the fallen heroes' fund...

594
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,039
To go to you.

595
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,844
Get you fixed
up. This is a start.

596
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,949
I can't accept that.
Marie's not here anymore.

597
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,616
But you are.

598
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,656
We want to pay for the surgery.

599
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,793
Why would you do that for me?

600
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,908
We take care of our own.

601
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:53,254
<i>These memories will stay with me</i>

602
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:00,025
It'll take a few minutes
for the anesthetic to kick in.

603
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:03,000
When it does, I'll bring
in the endoscopist.

604
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,365
Okay. Um...

605
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,530
Thank you.

606
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:15,078
<i>Now I'm far away</i>

607
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:20,548
It's like nothing
ever gets better.

608
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:26,783
I'm just like this broken
thing that nobody wants.

609
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,552
Nobody cares about.

610
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,197
I don't even know why I'm here.

611
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:40,134
<i>Ooh</i>

612
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,207
Hey...

613
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:49,976
Um...

614
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:55,112
Sorry, you know you're not
my doctor anymore, right?

615
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,053
Yes.

616
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,554
But I'm still your friend.

617
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:10,901
<i>These memories still remain</i>

618
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,938
<i>Now I'm far away</i>

619
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,936
<i>Ooh</i>
