1
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,357
Looking great.

2
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,127
Mmm. Yeah, well,
the secret is, uh...

3
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,968
Night sweats with
aggressive vomiting.

4
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,366
Dose-dense
treatment's a bear, yes.

5
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,440
But you can't
knock these results.

6
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,601
Hit me, coach.

7
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,738
Your tumor is regressing,
your polymorphonuclear cells

8
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,976
are over 1,000 for
the first time in a week,

9
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,750
and your hemoglobin's
in the normal range.

10
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,485
I'd stand and cheer but, uh,

11
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,055
I think I'd, you
know, fall over.

12
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,455
Max, you should
feel good about this.

13
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,128
Well, yeah. No, I do, I do.

14
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,910
I just didn't know that feeling
this good would feel quite this bad.

15
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,660
Uh, Virginia?

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,136
I'm, uh, cold all
the time. Is that...

17
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:15,834
Common side effect.

18
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:19,738
Here.

19
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,905
And we'll hook you
up to some fluids.

20
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,575
This is all good news.
The chemo is working.

21
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,816
Hmm.

22
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,858
Here looks good.

23
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,774
Sir, do you know what
floor your room is on?

24
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,221
I can call someone to get help.

25
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,008
Oh.

26
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,213
Sorry, Dr. Goodwin.

27
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,449
I didn't recognize you.

28
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,130
<i>Science is about progress.</i>

29
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:15,067
<i>Why are we still relying so heavily
on methods developed 60 years ago?</i>

30
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:19,170
<i>For the same reason we're still using
penicillin and aspirin. Because they work.</i>

31
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,517
<i>In the future, when new
techniques have taken hold,</i>

32
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,807
we will look back and cringe at
the barbarism of today's approach.

33
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,972
And immunotherapy is
one of these new techniques.

34
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,379
I think it will be. But when?

35
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,014
Cancer patients need
effective treatments now.

36
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,680
How much of the cancer population
are your therapies actually helping? 1%?

37
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,018
More like 5%. Oh.

38
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,751
But some clinicians
are doing even better,

39
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,759
like Dr. Valentina Castro.

40
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,453
She even practiced
at New Amsterdam

41
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,987
before Dr. Sharpe doubled
down on older treatments.

42
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,761
Because they worked.
And forced Dr. Castro out.

43
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:47,926
Because hers didn't.

44
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,327
Dr. Helen...

45
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,643
Dr. Sharpe, please. Dr. Sharpe.

46
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,373
Can you tell us how you
view Dr. Panthaki's methods?

47
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,366
With pleasure.

48
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,074
I can't believe how
much I missed that.

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,724
It used to be such
a big part of my life.

50
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:02,841
It was my life.

51
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,450
You should come
to Brussels with me.

52
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,779
What, now? 'Cause I kinda thought
we were in the middle of something.

53
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,857
No, next week. I'm
presenting at a conference,

54
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,357
but you should be
up there with me.

55
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,018
Presenting?

56
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,063
Doing what we just
did in that studio.

57
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,123
Debating.

58
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,797
More like wiping
the floor with you.

59
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,531
Pretty sure I just
eviscerated your life's work

60
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,628
with my life's work.

61
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,208
Then I challenge
you to a rematch.

62
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,771
In Brussels.

63
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,885
Only if we get to keep
making up like this.

64
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,750
Luke Bauer, previously
healthy 17-year-old,

65
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:45,884
status, post fall.

66
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,870
Now complaining of left arm
weakness and blurred vision.

67
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,453
Normal and stable
heart rate and BP.

68
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,791
Take him to trauma one?

69
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,921
Tell me which came first?

70
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,238
The blurred vision or the fall?

71
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,924
Uh, I tripped
because I couldn't see.

72
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,060
Take him to curtains.

73
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,246
We're gonna take
good care of you, Luke.

74
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,294
All right, let's go.

75
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,805
Yesterday, I was

76
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,899
handing out flyers,
but I kept dropping 'em.

77
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,672
Thought maybe I was just
hungry, so I got a hot dog.

78
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,906
Took one bite, and
I started choking.

79
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,395
You know, I could
barely swallow.

80
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,348
After I woke up,
everything looked blurry,

81
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,010
and that's when
I tripped and fell.

82
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,746
Botulism.

83
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,312
Back off, dude! Sorry.

84
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,323
Uh, Max Goodwin. I'm
the, uh, medical director.

85
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,124
Just grabbing a quick
thirst-quenching beverage.

86
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,160
Uh, all the symptoms
that you are experiencing

87
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,997
are from a toxin produced
by the botulism bacteria

88
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,847
that is growing somewhere
inside your body, and...

89
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,100
Wow.

90
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,763
Who knew talking
could be this tiring?

91
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,632
That adds up.

92
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,438
I'll order the antitoxin.

93
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,274
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

94
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,207
Who's gonna take care of you?

95
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,888
You're welcome to have a look yourself,
but the concerns are pretty clear.

96
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,557
You're being accused of
forming a nontherapeutic alliance

97
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,127
with your patient, Avi Mantell.

98
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,958
Yeah. As deputy
medical director,

99
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,827
all personnel complaints
come to my desk,

100
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,728
so I'll be conducting
the initial review.

101
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,233
Okay. And after that?

102
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,665
Let's hope there isn't
anything after that.

103
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,467
Yeah, okay. I trust the process.

104
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,376
I, uh, pulled all the case
files and therapy notes for Avi.

105
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,502
Everything's there.

106
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,377
Great, thank you.
Yeah, you got it.

107
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,505
We'll talk soon.

108
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,751
Helen, hey, hey.

109
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,550
I didn't, uh, you know...

110
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,047
I mean, I didn't
do anything wrong,

111
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,746
right?

112
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,083
We'll talk soon.

113
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,220
Okay.

114
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,923
What's wrong with you?

115
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,727
Uh, throat cancer. That sucks.

116
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,394
Really does.

117
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,533
Oh.

118
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:41,666
Here we go.

119
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,066
Cellulitis.

120
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,441
This is where the botulism
bacteria is, uh, growing,

121
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,605
and this cut is how
it got under your skin.

122
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,738
How'd you get this?

123
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,844
Uh...

124
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,113
Dumpster diving, a
couple weeks back.

125
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,882
Let's just say my execution
wasn't a perfect ten.

126
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,414
I see that.

127
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,549
Hey, what are you doing?

128
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,595
I'm just outlining the infection

129
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,798
so that we can track
its, uh, progression,

130
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,429
or hopefully lack thereof.

131
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,230
Why didn't you come in sooner?

132
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,298
Don't have insurance.

133
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,720
That shouldn't have stopped you.

134
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,185
Come on, you know how it works.

135
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,269
You walk up to the desk,
they ask you for a card.

136
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,043
Without one, no one
even looks at you.

137
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,412
It's embarrassing.

138
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,210
Being invisible is almost
worse than being sick.

139
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,658
Did you know Luke's had
that infection for two weeks?

140
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:33,987
Not surprised.

141
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,272
Back then, it could have been
treated in a clinic, you know?

142
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,424
A few stitches,
some antibiotics.

143
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,626
Cheap fix. But
instead, he waited.

144
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,169
He ended up much
sicker and in the ED

145
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,739
with inefficient, complex,
and very expensive care.

146
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,899
All solid points
I'd love to discuss

147
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,067
when I'm not slammed.

148
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,253
All because he
didn't have insurance.

149
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:53,406
I bet half the people in this
ED don't have insurance.

150
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,558
Probably more than half,
but there's nothing we can do.

151
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,074
You know what, there is. There
is something that we can do.

152
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,519
We can get every hospital
administrator down here right now.

153
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,518
Why would I do that?

154
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,668
So they can enroll everyone
in a proper insurance plan.

155
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,991
This is what the
ACA set out to do.

156
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,087
To give everyone access to
health insurance they can afford.

157
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,633
Isn't that complicated? Yes.

158
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:14,958
Very.

159
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,275
But it's hurting our patients,
and it's costing us money,

160
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,862
and this could maybe fix both.

161
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,170
Health insurance is
available to these people,

162
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,374
and we're gonna get each
and every one of them enrolled.

163
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:39,716
This is Dr. Helen Sharpe, Deputy
Head of Medicine at New Amsterdam,

164
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:43,524
presiding over an internal
investigation into Dr. Ignatius Frome.

165
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,899
Also present is Ms. Tiara Dobbs.

166
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:51,193
This inquiry alleges that you, Dr. Frome,
violated hospital policy ADMN-23.

167
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,864
This policy addresses
nontherapeutic relationships,

168
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,800
including ones where members
of staff are overly invested

169
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,640
in a child or family's care.

170
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,504
I've always tried to provide
the best care possible.

171
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,882
Your intentions
aren't in question.

172
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,252
Oh. Good.

173
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,410
Your methods are.

174
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,759
Have you ever shown favoritism
towards a particular patient?

175
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,152
No.

176
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,058
You've never bought
gifts for a patient?

177
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,829
Um...

178
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,061
Birthdays, maybe. Yeah.

179
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,066
And... And sometimes I
might see a little something

180
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,004
that I know a kid would
respond to really well

181
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,342
or like in particular. Uh...

182
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:31,905
But I wouldn't, um...

183
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,346
I wouldn't call it favoritism.

184
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,609
So your answer is yes.

185
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,676
Yes.

186
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,852
Have you ever brought special
food into the hospital for patients?

187
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,789
Mmm-mmm. No.

188
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,351
Wait, yes.

189
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,061
But the patient specifically
mentioned s'mores

190
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,294
in session, so...

191
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,126
That's a yes, also. Yes.

192
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,066
But... We all go the
extra mile around here.

193
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,707
This inquiry isn't about

194
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,470
everyone else, Dr. Frome.

195
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:05,468
It's about you.

196
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,812
Have you ever initiated
uninvited physical contact?

197
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,323
I've never made
anyone uncomfortable,

198
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,120
if that's what you mean.

199
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,959
That isn't a no.

200
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,490
Dr. Frome, have you ever hugged,

201
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,996
kissed, or otherwise touched
a patient without invitation?

202
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,834
No, I have never

203
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,268
kissed a patient.

204
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,141
Have you ever hugged or
touched a patient without invitation?

205
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,083
Yes.

206
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,164
And you understand that

207
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,754
that is outside the bounds

208
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,427
of a normal
therapeutic relationship?

209
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,329
Yes.

210
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,480
I'm looking for my
consult, a seizure patient.

211
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,380
Feng Shen? Follow the noise.

212
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,699
Please, Feng is very
sick. He needs you!

213
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,957
Yes, yes.

214
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,456
I see.

215
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,857
Excuse me.

216
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,696
Hello, Feng.

217
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,668
I'm Dr. Kapoor.

218
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,414
Has Feng lost weight recently?

219
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,086
One at a time. WOMAN: Yes.

220
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,062
Feng does not want to eat.

221
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,163
Not at all.

222
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,003
Prep Feng for a lumbar
puncture right away.

223
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,838
You are staring awfully
hard at that screen.

224
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,784
Yeah, this might be an
awkward time to tell you,

225
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,086
but I'm in love with coronary
artery bypass surgery.

226
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,589
Mmm. Mmm.

227
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,767
What are you doing out here?

228
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,521
I was actually
trying to see you.

229
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,960
Oh, that's cool. I was
on my way to see you.

230
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,389
Oh, do tell.

231
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,762
Well, I want you to
come to Sunday dinner.

232
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,192
Meet my family.

233
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,460
Or not?

234
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,436
I was gonna surprise you,

235
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,703
but I got invited to this salon in
Harlem to see Ta-Nehisi Coates,

236
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,369
and you were gonna
be my plus-one.

237
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,468
No way. Yes!

238
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,644
Oh, you know that's
my boy. I know!

239
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,874
That's why I was so excited.

240
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,578
But I can meet your
family next Sunday, right?

241
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,247
Oh, my mom will look at me
sideways if I miss Sunday dinner,

242
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,756
and then my
sisters will pile on.

243
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,156
So you've never
missed a Sunday dinner?

244
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,251
College.

245
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,557
Oh.

246
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:14,226
Then you deserve to have Ta-Nehisi
sign your <i>Black Panther</i> comic.

247
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,097
I do, don't I?

248
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,735
I'm in. Yes!

249
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,481
Phone number? No phone.

250
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,841
Address?

251
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,476
Wherever we are right now.

252
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,647
Do you have a PO
box or something?

253
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,122
Yeah, for all my
Amazon deliveries.

254
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,994
Well, then, I suppose there's
no way to mail you your insurance

255
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,321
card. Um...

256
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,827
I'll be right back.

257
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,335
Sorry to bother
you, Dr. Goodwin.

258
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,315
My patient doesn't have
a social security number,

259
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,864
and it's required for ACA.

260
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,353
The family I just tried to sign
up all gave me the same name.

261
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,436
They're a family.

262
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,535
The same first name.

263
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,376
Okay, give me...
Give me a second.

264
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,684
Curious? Is this better or worse
than what you had in mind?

265
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,721
Luke Bauer's cellulitis has
progressed to necrotizing fasciitis.

266
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,541
He may have already
seeded his heart valves.

267
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,268
I'll page Reynolds
and book an OR.

268
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,658
Okay. Mmm? Dr. Goodwin.

269
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,696
I can't tell if my patient is a
good fit for this insurance plan,

270
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,526
because I can't
decipher the plan myself.

271
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,569
I've gotta hand it to you, Boss.

272
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,866
You have outdone
yourself this time.

273
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:26,996
Did I?

274
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,474
The entire hospital, and I
mean the entire hospital,

275
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,636
has been talking
about your insane plan

276
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,840
to sign every single patient
up for health insurance.

277
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,676
Seriously, what
were you thinking?

278
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,650
Max. Max?

279
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,380
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

280
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,398
You want me to have someone
bring you up a wheelchair?

281
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,823
No, no, I'm totally
good. I'm just

282
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,887
much slower.

283
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,029
You got lapped by a
92-year-old with a walker.

284
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,027
Ouch. But you're not wrong.

285
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:56,832
The, um, insurance thing was
flawed, but you wanna know why?

286
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,598
Um, it's hard to narrow down
exactly which joke to make here.

287
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:01,917
This is a public
hospital, right?

288
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,274
Our help is free to the
public. That's the whole thing.

289
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,403
People don't need
insurance to be treated here,

290
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,277
and most people right
now don't know that.

291
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,617
Then, how do you
expect to fix that problem?

292
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:12,879
Um...

293
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,122
Ah.

294
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:26,859
This is how we fix it.

295
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:33,272
And what exactly is included in
the New Amsterdam Family Plan?

296
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,433
Um, just about everything.

297
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,371
And how much will
people pay for it?

298
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,379
Kinda like nothing. Yeah?

299
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,573
That's what I thought.

300
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,758
Yeah, I'm gonna need copies.

301
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,876
Maybe, what do you
think, 500,000 to start?

302
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,112
Yeah, sure.

303
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,415
And then what? We hide
them in chocolate bars?

304
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,594
No, I was thinking we might hand them
out to every resident of New York City.

305
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,776
Have you and Dr. Frome ever been
alone in the same room together?

306
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,501
Yeah, during session.

307
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,832
And during session,

308
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:09,174
has Dr. Frome ever
initiated physical contact?

309
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,209
Why are we talking about this?

310
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,176
Ms. Dobbs told me that
she witnessed Dr. Frome

311
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,444
touch you on your
head, neck, and face.

312
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,310
It's okay.

313
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,593
Like, a hand on my
shoulder, I guess.

314
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,494
Or on my knee sometimes.

315
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,356
How did it make you feel?

316
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:34,959
This is stupid.

317
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,327
I'm sorry.

318
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,870
I am sorry, but it's important.

319
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,637
How did it make you feel?

320
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,679
I don't want to talk
about that, okay?

321
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,844
Does physical contact make you
feel uncomfortable sometimes?

322
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,511
Avi?

323
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,051
Have you ever been
touched inappropriately

324
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,197
by Dr. Frome or anyone else?

325
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,193
Honey.

326
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,242
I didn't know how to tell you.

327
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,912
Avi, we're gonna protect you.

328
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,347
Can you tell us who?

329
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,556
I wanna talk to Dr. Frome.

330
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,393
Injecting dye.

331
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,065
Dye filling chamber.

332
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,672
Right there. You see that, Max?

333
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,503
Small vegetation on
Luke's bicuspid valve.

334
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:55,938
Got it.

335
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,615
You okay up there? Mmm.

336
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,382
Numbers have never
been better. Huh.

337
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,713
That's surprising, seeing as
you've never looked worse.

338
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,879
No offense.

339
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,384
None taken.

340
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:06,916
Dr. Reynolds?

341
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,517
Dr. Kapoor's
requesting a consult.

342
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,892
Okay. I'm done here.

343
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:12,955
Oh, Max?

344
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,267
I took a look at Luke's calf.

345
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,399
The, uh, general
surgeon's on the way.

346
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,371
All right, tell them he's
been injecting heroin

347
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,462
under the skin.

348
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,536
He said he got it
dumpster diving.

349
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,266
Then he lied.

350
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,220
Pulmonary and
meningeal tuberculosis.

351
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,621
Very troubling.
Well, TB happens.

352
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,454
We just gotta isolate the
boy, zap him with antibiotics,

353
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,619
and Bob's your uncle.

354
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,791
Yes, if only it was just Bob.

355
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,062
Their entire family lives in a
multi-family home in Queens.

356
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,496
I've asked them
to come for testing.

357
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,068
All of them.

358
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,339
Iggy!

359
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,917
You need to think about this.

360
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,895
What's there to think about?
A patient asked to talk to me.

361
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,319
He's no longer your patient.

362
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,320
Well, those darn
doctor-patient boundaries,

363
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,583
famously, a weakness of mine.

364
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,935
There's been hearings about it
and everything. You were there.

365
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,003
Iggy, you are a kind man,
but if you talk to this boy,

366
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,825
your kindness is gonna
be used against you.

367
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,922
Every word you say is gonna
be placed under a microscope.

368
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,010
I hear you. I understand, and I
know you're trying to help me,

369
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,479
but if I'm not there for my patients
when they need me the most,

370
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,268
what am I doing here?
Why even do this job at all?

371
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,374
Avi has something to say to me,

372
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,355
I am going to listen, no
matter the consequence.

373
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,468
Iggy... That's it!

374
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,604
End of story.

375
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,164
Please, everyone, let's...
Let's just stay calm, okay?

376
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,328
TB is a very treatable disease.

377
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,666
But when can they come home?

378
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,569
TB likes to play hide-and-seek,

379
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,006
so the process of
eradicating the disease

380
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,509
from the body can be lengthy.

381
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,843
Ann and Feng will need

382
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,576
to pass three negative
sputum tests in a row.

383
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,014
How long will that take?

384
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:48,921
Three to nine months.

385
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,584
<i>Surgery went well.</i>

386
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,558
We managed to
remove all the infection.

387
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,863
A few weeks of pills
and you should be...

388
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,222
You should be fine.

389
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,064
Um, this is...

390
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,263
Well, it's just like insurance.

391
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,601
And you can use this
to get follow-up care.

392
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,120
Here at New Amsterdam. You
just walk up to any of these desks

393
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,045
and you flash this baby,

394
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,307
and they'll honor it. And
they'll treat you with respect.

395
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,275
And you won't get a bill.

396
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:21,977
Seriously?

397
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,112
Yeah.

398
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,092
And you can use it also at...

399
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,286
At one of our
rehab clinics. What...

400
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,041
And you should, Luke, because
what you're doing to yourself...

401
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,431
I knew it. Luke, I'm just...

402
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,711
You can just forget
your stupid card.

403
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,579
I'm not coming back here,
so you can talk down to me,

404
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,765
accuse me of things I didn't do.

405
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,603
You're just like everyone else.

406
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:44,439
Wait... Just back off, okay?

407
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,419
Hey.

408
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,615
I know this is weird,
but... But it, um...

409
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,590
This is a bad idea.

410
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,956
You know what?

411
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,761
This is unusual. I get it.

412
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,597
Don't even look
at them, all right?

413
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,796
Just hang with me.

414
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,272
It's just me and
you, like always.

415
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,831
Okay?

416
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:20,002
What's up? How you feeling?

417
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,842
Messed up.

418
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,678
Okay, that's a good start.

419
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,946
What's messed up?

420
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,817
Like,

421
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,858
they asked if... If
you touched me.

422
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,153
And you do, right?

423
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,287
And that's, like,

424
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,128
okay, because when you do,

425
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:43,795
I feel loved or whatever. Good.

426
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,000
But then it's like,
what do I know?

427
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,299
Because, you know...

428
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:53,210
Times in my past...

429
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,975
Before you, I, uh...

430
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,912
Have you ever felt differently

431
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,218
when someone else touched you?

432
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,311
Well, no.

433
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,687
I don't know. That's
what's so messed up.

434
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:08,091
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
It sounds confusing.

435
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,389
Why don't we...

436
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,157
Let's simplify.

437
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,254
Where were you,

438
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,593
first time this happened?

439
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,395
I was in Missouri.

440
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,699
Watching TV. FROME:
What was on TV?

441
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,263
A soap. A soap?

442
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,399
She liked them. Okay.

443
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,603
Tell me about her.

444
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,510
She'd watch me while
my mom was at work.

445
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,277
You know, I'd sit on her lap,

446
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,216
and she'd scratch my back.

447
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,710
Oh.

448
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:38,053
And then one day,

449
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,354
she asked if I...

450
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,520
I wanted to kiss.

451
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:46,123
You know, like
they did on the TV.

452
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,130
And we did.

453
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,735
And then she asked
me to lie on top of her.

454
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,041
How old were you?

455
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,442
Five.

456
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,948
That must have
been really scary.

457
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,279
It wasn't.

458
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,978
She was nice to me.

459
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,417
I just...

460
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,789
I couldn't...

461
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,454
Uh...

462
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,121
You looked forward to it.

463
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,926
I'm sick.

464
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,228
I'm disgusting.

465
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,428
No. No, Avi, you
are not disgusting.

466
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,902
The only disgusting thing here

467
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,563
is a woman in a
position of power

468
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,074
taking advantage of a kid.

469
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,244
Of a child.

470
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,147
Not you.

471
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,114
Why didn't you tell me?

472
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,179
Why didn't you tell your mom?

473
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,252
It's okay.

474
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,023
You'll feel better
if you say it.

475
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,164
She's my aunt.

476
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,177
Care to explain
this latest scheme?

477
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,044
Um, I wouldn't really
call it a scheme.

478
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,049
Nothing on that card is a lie.

479
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,052
We are a public
hospital and, uh,

480
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,621
we do treat everyone,

481
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,816
whether or not
they have insurance.

482
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,519
So you're advertising.
Yeah, exactly.

483
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,470
I mean, do you know... Do
you know how many people

484
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,521
don't even know that they
can come to us for free?

485
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,566
How many of these did you make?

486
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,025
Um...

487
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,514
I don't think you
want to know that.

488
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:35,030
If everyone in the city knew
that they could just walk in here

489
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,008
without insurance, the
whole system would crumble.

490
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,979
Agree to disagree. I think the
more patients that we can help

491
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,480
and the earlier
we can help them,

492
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,143
then the better
the system will be.

493
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,981
A public hospital only survives

494
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:50,489
because so many people
don't realize they can use it.

495
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,549
If everyone started coming
in here when they were sick,

496
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,150
this hospital would
run out of money.

497
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,059
Well, good thing I'm
talking to the one person

498
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,393
who can actually
get us more funds.

499
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,491
Are you trying to single-handedly
socialize medicine?

500
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,504
Public hospitals are
socialized medicine.

501
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,836
It already happened,
it's already here,

502
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,169
and it had nothing to do

503
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,042
with me.

504
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,422
So why don't we just call
some things like we see it, right?

505
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,507
The U.S. military, largest and
most funded socialist program

506
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,778
in the entire world.

507
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,012
We have public schools
and public libraries

508
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,419
and the police department
and the fire department,

509
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,184
and we can all get
behind socialism there,

510
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:29,024
but just not in our hospitals.

511
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,393
Is this the hill you
want to die on?

512
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:40,968
Despite all appearances, I
am not dying anytime soon.

513
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,085
Dr. Reynolds.

514
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,121
So, how are things
with you and Evie?

515
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,056
What?

516
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:09,124
You just went right
there, didn't you?

517
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,827
I'm sorry, okay?

518
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,235
I just don't have the headspace
for small talk anymore.

519
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,241
All right, well, we're
good, you know?

520
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,142
We're really good,
thanks to you.

521
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,179
You taken her home
to meet the family yet?

522
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,976
Not yet. Why not?

523
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,142
You should get on that.

524
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,458
You know, it's good
to have you back.

525
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,286
"Back." Yeah. You're
back, aren't you?

526
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,824
I was actually here to talk to
Max about extending my leave.

527
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,693
Whoa, for how long?

528
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,630
Like, forever.

529
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,971
Is there any chance I
can change your mind?

530
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,269
No.

531
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:53,142
Any chance, I mean, Max
can change your mind?

532
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:57,547
No, which is why I wanted
to talk to him in person.

533
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,615
Have you seen him?

534
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,222
What, it's that bad?

535
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,558
It's way worse.

536
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,053
Jeez, I thought I
was the liability.

537
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,394
Hey, Lauren.

538
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:20,065
You know I got you, right?

539
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:32,184
Hey, whoa, is there a problem?

540
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,171
Caught this guy stealing
these from the hospital.

541
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,321
Uh, no, he didn't steal those.

542
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,565
Uh, I gave them to him. It was
part of a needle exchange program.

543
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,662
Luke.

544
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,841
Well, it's, uh...

545
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,108
It's all out in the open now.

546
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:05,514
Hannah told us that her sister
was a victim of abuse as well.

547
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:10,079
But she never imagined her sister
would do that to someone else,

548
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,351
let alone a member
of her family.

549
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,256
I'll call Child Protective.

550
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,624
Great, thank you.

551
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,862
Will they be okay?

552
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,059
Yeah, I think so.

553
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:24,592
Just... It'll take a
little time, you know?

554
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,276
Thank you. For what?

555
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,311
Being you.

556
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:41,151
Yeah, I'm not sure that's
a good thing anymore.

557
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,415
Feng starts kindergarten
in two weeks.

558
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,050
- He was so excited.
- I understand,

559
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:05,340
but active TB is
highly contagious.

560
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,505
If you go home or
Feng goes to school,

561
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:11,243
you risk infecting a
great many people.

562
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,080
You can infect
your entire family.

563
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,949
I want <i>NaiNai.</i>

564
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,831
Will they get the best
care here at the hospital?

565
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,628
Yes.

566
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,712
<i>Bao Bao, NaiNai</i> is here.

567
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,782
And I'm not leaving.

568
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,734
Ann and Feng need
more than just antibiotics.

569
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,531
They need their family. Right.

570
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,557
Then their family can
come during visiting hours.

571
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,905
How long do you think that
80-year-old woman can sit on that stool?

572
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,376
Or for any one of them
can stare at their loved ones

573
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,639
through that glass wall?

574
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,911
The family will adapt. All
right? That's what I'm scared of.

575
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,247
They will adapt to a
life without each other.

576
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,321
Look, there's nothing
we can do, all right?

577
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,152
Ann and Feng have
to stay in isolation.

578
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,628
Dr. Goodwin, can I
get you a wheelchair?

579
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,863
Yes, thank you.

580
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,956
Max. Could you give me a hand?

581
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,359
I don't remember this
slope being so steep.

582
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,931
Max, you need to stop.

583
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,125
Why? No.

584
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,758
The Community Care
office needs these.

585
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,803
They're gonna
help pass them out.

586
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,360
How long has it been

587
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,031
since you could
swallow your own saliva?

588
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,007
Few days. Can you get dressed?

589
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,372
Shower by yourself?

590
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:26,775
Look, the chemo's working.

591
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,446
It's working. Stauton said

592
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,779
it could be as little
as three months.

593
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,285
"Three months"?

594
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,981
You won't make it three
weeks. You're wasting away.

595
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:40,025
Look, I just need to
hang on a little bit longer.

596
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,718
The numbers don't lie.

597
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:42,851
The cancer will be cured,

598
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,038
but we will run the
last course of chemo

599
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,121
into your dead body.

600
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,990
You are dying, Max.

601
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,970
Well, then, this may be
one of the last things I do.

602
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,736
Just. Max!

603
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,841
No, it's okay. We're
fine, thank you.

604
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,472
It's over, you are
done. No more chemo.

605
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,483
You're not my doctor. I am now.

606
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,677
I am your doctor, Max.

607
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,396
I'm taking you off the
chemo and radiation.

608
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,686
I'm gonna find you a different
regimen, and I'm gonna save your life.

609
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,590
But first thing I'm gonna
do is send you home.

610
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,426
It's time for you
to go home, Max.

611
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:28,206
You're going home to stay alive.

612
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,912
This is not the end.

613
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,992
Dr. Frome.

614
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,328
I'm sorry to have
put you through this.

615
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,161
Are you serious?

616
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,327
You put my entire medical
practice in jeopardy,

617
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,098
and now you're just gonna...

618
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,935
What? You're just
gonna let me off the hook?

619
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,498
I realize you were
just trying to help him.

620
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,271
But I didn't.

621
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,003
You were right about me.

622
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:43,838
Dr. Frome...

623
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,577
Do... Do you have any idea

624
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,916
how many patients
I've held in my arms?

625
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:51,149
How many kids I
bought clothes for?

626
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,349
Books for?

627
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:56,417
I try so hard to
make them feel safe...

628
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:58,653
Make them feel the love

629
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,474
that they should have
gotten somewhere else.

630
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:05,129
I can see that now.
What you did for Avi,

631
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,605
only you could do that for him.

632
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,141
That's the problem.

633
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,370
If you hadn't filed your report,

634
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,673
Avi would have gone
on to some therapist

635
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,123
and he would have
had a huge setback

636
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,845
because he couldn't speak
his truth to anybody but me.

637
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,477
If I'm only teaching
patients to speak to me

638
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:26,457
and not to deal with the world
after they leave my care, well...

639
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,317
The phrase I would use for that

640
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,989
is "nontherapeutic
relationship."

641
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,860
The rules exist for a reason,

642
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,835
and I broke them repeatedly.

643
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,035
Now the only thing for me to do

644
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,372
is to be a different therapist.

645
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:49,647
Different therapist
than I want to be.

646
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,713
Than I know how to be.

647
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,084
Vijay.

648
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:05,152
There's nothing more
to do for the Shens.

649
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,756
Ansuya and I were a

650
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:08,993
love match.

651
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,695
But my parents didn't approve...

652
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:18,573
So we saw them less and less.

653
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,679
Along the way, we made

654
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,878
many little decisions

655
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,548
that added up to

656
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:34,115
a big distance between us.

657
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,889
Soon

658
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,695
family meant only

659
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,931
me,

660
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,439
Ansuya,

661
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,100
and Rohan.

662
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,942
So you don't see them anymore?

663
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:01,083
We haven't spoken
to each other for a

664
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,950
long, long time.

665
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,793
We won't let that happen
to the Shens, will we?

666
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,568
No.

667
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,130
We won't.

668
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,025
Thank you.

669
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,510
Thank you so much. Thank you.

670
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,289
How long have you
been standing there?

671
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,794
I gotta come clean.

672
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,656
Okay.

673
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,131
Ta-Nehisi may be my boy,

674
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,636
but I have a whole family
who still thinks of me

675
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,568
as their boy.

676
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,004
So we won't go this Sunday.

677
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,218
Well, that's the thing. I'm
not saying no to this Sunday.

678
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,837
I'm saying no to every Sunday.

679
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,310
That's how important
my family is, and...

680
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:39,874
I think I was
afraid to admit that.

681
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:41,813
Why?

682
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:45,015
Well, there's a whole part of me

683
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,354
outside this hospital
that you don't know.

684
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:51,055
You know, like
church, my aging mom,

685
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,758
my sisters ganging
up on me, you know?

686
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,343
What if you didn't
like that part of me?

687
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,097
Or them?

688
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:00,434
How could I not? You
don't know my family.

689
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,200
Well, you're right. I don't.

690
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:06,335
So I'd better be meeting
them this Sunday.

691
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,939
I don't have an appointment,

692
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:14,349
but I'm hoping
you can fit me in.

693
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,514
Well, I will have
to check my books.

694
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:23,088
Our hotel, I can't
wait for you to see it.

695
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,028
It is in the center of
the historic district.

696
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,431
Three Michelin-starred
restaurants in walking distance.

697
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,036
But you won't be
joining me, will you?

698
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:42,937
I can't.

699
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,913
Akash, I am so sorry.

700
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,954
Right now, I can't imagine

701
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,390
sitting on a panel defending
traditional chemotherapy

702
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,760
when my day has been
one long crushing example

703
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,096
of precisely how traditional
chemotherapy can fail.

704
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:05,899
This is about Max.

705
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,973
Yes, it is.

706
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:17,113
Max helped me rediscover
my love of medicine

707
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,446
and got me back in the hospital.

708
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,418
And it's not just me.

709
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:25,446
You can see it on the
faces of all the doctors.

710
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,516
All the nurses. All the staff.

711
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:32,154
He has helped them all
so much, so profoundly.

712
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,198
And now

713
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:37,792
it's our turn to help him.

714
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:55,719
<i>Say it's here Where
our pieces fall in place</i>

715
00:40:57,055 --> 00:41:02,961
<i>Any rain softly
kisses us on the face</i>

716
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,997
<i>Any wind means we're running</i>

717
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,898
<i>We can sleep and see 'em coming</i>

718
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,868
<i>Where we drift
and call it dreaming</i>

719
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,066
<i>We can weep and call it singing</i>

720
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,574
<i>And we get a chance to say</i>

721
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:29,848
<i>Before we ease away</i>

722
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:35,383
<i>For all the love
you've left behind</i>

723
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,587
<i>You can have mine</i>

724
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,566
Max.

725
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,043
You're not answering
your phone so...
