1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:08,434
I'll be targeting your cancer directly
with stereotactic body radiotherapy...

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,445
With simultaneous intravenous
Cis-Platinum. Two-cycle regiment.

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,743
And I may throw in an
EGFR inhibitor like cetuximab,

4
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,373
depending on how
your tumor responds.

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:16,610
Works for me.

6
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,850
In English, please.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,782
It sounds very important,

8
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,488
but, um, all I care about is...

9
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,526
Could he...

10
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:31,958
What are his odds?

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,123
Georgia. No, Max.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,169
I need an answer
from your doctor.

13
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:41,367
Georgia, with cancer,

14
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,077
the odds are
difficult to quantify.

15
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,115
But I believe that this
is our very best option.

16
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,643
So, why haven't
we started already?

17
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,819
Yes, Max,

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,790
why haven't we started already?

19
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:03,086
Because there's a lot of pre-treatment
procedures I still need to get done.

20
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,257
Like, um, radiation tattoo,

21
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:06,994
oral surgery... Oral surgery?

22
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,662
Max's back molars will
fall into the field of radiation

23
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,830
and they'll need
to be extracted.

24
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,136
Um, so, why haven't
we done that yet?

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,305
Because I have been kicking
this thing down the road,

26
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,642
a little bit.

27
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,215
To try to buy myself
a little more time,

28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,553
you know, as medical director.

29
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,921
Which, now that I say out loud,
in front of my wife, does not sound

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,820
like the excuse it
sounded like in my head.

31
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:37,524
Mmm, ya think? Yep.

32
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,031
Could he have his
molars out today?

33
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,433
That's up to him.

34
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,300
We have the big
Domino Transplant today.

35
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,535
The run-through's in
30. I can't, uh, if I'm...

36
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:51,709
But I think I could
because once they start,

37
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,041
they don't really need me.

38
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,914
And I could probably be
free as early as tomorrow.

39
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,509
Today...

40
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,619
Early afternoon.

41
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,952
You're on board. I'm on board.

42
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,789
Just like that? Just like that.

43
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,027
Domino day. Yeah.

44
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,465
You excited? Oh.

45
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,799
Um, transplant surgeons
get to have all the fun.

46
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,600
I don't even get
to sing back-up.

47
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,217
You know, I had a
really good time last night.

48
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,732
And the night before.

49
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,544
I hope you did too.

50
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,302
Mmm.

51
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,639
What?

52
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,316
I did.

53
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,047
I really like where
this is going.

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,986
You know, you and me.

55
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,648
You sound so surprised.

56
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,490
No, no, um, I
just didn't think...

57
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,154
I don't know.

58
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,664
I don't know what I thought.

59
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,935
Well, when Lauren
introduced us I had a feeling.

60
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,127
Yeah.

61
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,367
So, uh, what do you say?

62
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,273
We probably shouldn't
walk in together, right?

63
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,006
Oh, yeah. It's way too soon.

64
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,776
I don't know about you, but
on our side of the building

65
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,680
we're real gossipy.

66
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,454
I'll see you later.

67
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,235
What have I told you
about drinking those things?

68
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,820
You end up bouncing off the
walls and annoying the other nurses.

69
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,437
Yeah, that's part of my charm.

70
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,810
Besides, I need it.

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,906
Pull another double?
Bronx General.

72
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,213
"Knife and Gun Club?"
A guy's gotta eat.

73
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,277
Man, their ED never stops.

74
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,548
They need docs?

75
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,112
Since when are you
hard up for cash?

76
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,488
I'm not. It sounds like fun.

77
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,891
Don't you just ever wanna
go home and do nothing?

78
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,288
Now, where's the fun in that?

79
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,824
Hi, I'm Dr. Bloom.

80
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,132
Diego. My daughter, Gianna.

81
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,638
Hi, Gianna.

82
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,833
So, you're having
some trouble breathing?

83
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,739
It's getting worse.

84
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,971
I waited too long.

85
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,738
We can't... Papa is...

86
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,339
Worried...

87
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,884
You can't help us. You
don't have insurance?

88
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,678
Undocumented.

89
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:20,157
Well, we treat everyone
here. You're safe from ICE.

90
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,358
If that's what you're
worried about.

91
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,421
They won't even
know you were here.

92
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,657
Come on. Pop up,
Gianna. Let's have a listen.

93
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,264
<i>"Sandstorm,"</i> huh?

94
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,105
You, know it?

95
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,578
Obsessed. Been collecting
single issues since the '90s.

96
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,778
Deep breath.

97
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,717
Again.

98
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,362
You, uh... Have you
seen the platinum issue?

99
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:02,259
Gemini, she steals the Halter Cross
from the fourth dimension. It's wicked.

100
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,100
Gemini's my favorite.

101
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,475
I'll be right back.

102
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,311
Casey, I need a chest x-ray,
and I need you to page Reynolds.

103
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,716
I need him now.

104
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,054
You got anything that
will anchor the roll?

105
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,429
Ooh. Science project?

106
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,224
Yeah, living that
extra credit dream.

107
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,168
Yeah, I can see that.

108
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,261
Domino run-through.

109
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,034
No time for
chitchat. Yes, I know.

110
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,575
Do you always have
to be such a buzzkill?

111
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,240
How is she being a buzzkill?

112
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:48,077
Oh, um... Well, do
you remember how

113
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,016
I said I was gonna try to
pull some strings for Blanca?

114
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,112
You couldn't do it. Figured.

115
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,850
Mmm, you figured, did you?

116
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,482
Yeah, well, figure this,

117
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:03,027
my friend at Family Services got Blanca
named an Emergency Foster Provider.

118
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,796
Boom.

119
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,129
She had a site
visit this morning.

120
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,431
Boom.

121
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,937
Guess what else.

122
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,965
Something that ends in "boom?"

123
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,374
Uh, yeah. She passed
with flying colors.

124
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,046
You got a home.

125
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,947
Really? Yes.

126
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,157
They can't take it back?

127
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,354
No, there are no
backsies on this boom.

128
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,888
Okay, by this time tomorrow,

129
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,297
you're gonna be moving
into your brand-new digs.

130
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,228
Trust me, it's good. All right?

131
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,138
Okay, I better go
before I have to relocate.

132
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,472
I'll see you later.

133
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,776
Dr. Albert? ALBERT: <i>Here.</i>

134
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,679
Dr. Franz? FRANZ: <i>We're here.</i>

135
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,609
We've got Pittsburgh and Newark.
Morning. Uh, Max Goodwin here.

136
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,020
I'm the new Medical
Director at New Amsterdam,

137
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,651
and just to confirm, you are both in
charge of your respective harvest teams?

138
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,887
<i>Yes.</i> FRANZ: <i>Correct.</i>

139
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,294
Great. Dr. Sharpe here has been

140
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,559
working on this project
for the last seven months,

141
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,125
so it is our job to not
screw it up for her.

142
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,398
To that end, I would like
to take everyone through

143
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,230
the Domino Transplant
Chain one last time

144
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,402
set to the illustrious
tunes of Mr. Van Morrison.

145
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,536
Max.

146
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,189
I'm just getting everyone
pumped for the dry run.

147
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,647
Am I right, Newark?

148
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,709
Not a Van Morrison fan.

149
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,616
What about Pittsburgh?

150
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,479
Yeah, all right, moving
on. We have six patients

151
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,684
receiving partial liver
transplants today,

152
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,989
and, uh, six living
donors from three states.

153
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,030
Our first donor surgery
will be Tanya Mayer.

154
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,895
She just arrived at JFK.

155
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,866
Dr. Kapoor, you are
running point on her.

156
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,335
Except Tanya isn't a match
for her brother, Matthew.

157
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,498
So, a lobe of her liver
will be going to Aminah Ali.

158
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,600
My patient. Aminah
is the anchor patient.

159
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,372
Her HLA factors
were difficult to match.

160
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,284
That's why it took so
long to find her a donor.

161
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,991
Each of our recipients
couldn't find a donor match

162
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,959
within their own families,
so their families agreed

163
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,543
to donate to someone else
who would be a match for them.

164
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,579
Aminah's husband, Tariq,
will donate to Francis Potter.

165
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:47,058
His mother, Lily Potter, will
then donate to Beck Newman.

166
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,962
Omar Kahn in Newark
will donate to Lisa Verdad

167
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,624
here at New Amsterdam.

168
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,964
Mina Verdad
donating to Gil Hess.

169
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,561
And last but not
least, to close the loop,

170
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:02,200
Peter Stern in Pittsburgh will
donate to our very own Matthew Levy.

171
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,944
It's like Hands Across
America, but with livers.

172
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,311
Yeah. I'll be here all week,
Newark. Thank you. Wow.

173
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,446
Um, all these surgeries
are time sensitive.

174
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,787
All right, let's, uh,
give this our best shot.

175
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,128
And, Dr. Sharpe, bravo.

176
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,158
Knock, knock.

177
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,031
How's the superstar doing today?

178
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,933
So happy the
waiting's finally over.

179
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,338
Dr. Sharpe, back when Aminah
was going through chemo,

180
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,569
I used to hate seeing you.

181
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,134
But now...

182
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,648
Tariq, she's a doctor.
Have some respect.

183
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,978
Sorry.

184
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,110
She's like family, <i>umi.</i>

185
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,179
Is the young lady who's donating
here yet? We would like to meet her.

186
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,417
Tanya should be
arriving any moment.

187
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,435
Hey, T.

188
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:05,999
You're looking good.

189
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,870
How are the kids?

190
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,970
You know, they each have
their own bedroom now.

191
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,015
So, they kinda love that.

192
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,950
Until they told
me you'd landed...

193
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,379
I wasn't sure you'd
get on that plane.

194
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:23,779
Me either.

195
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,952
But I got over it.

196
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,754
It's for a good cause, right?

197
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,303
Family.

198
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,971
So, this part of my liver, why
can't it go straight to Matty?

199
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,603
You're not a donor
match for your brother.

200
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,339
The same is true for
everyone in the chain.

201
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,384
Not a match for their own family

202
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,249
but a match for someone else's.

203
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,184
Sounds complicated.

204
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,848
It is.

205
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,915
But also very simple in the end.

206
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,117
Everyone lives.

207
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,191
Where's Reynolds this time?
We're not doing this again, are we?

208
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,599
He's busy.

209
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,332
He's been busy for the past three
days, whenever I need a consult.

210
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,797
Gianna, this is Dr. Flores.

211
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,308
She specializes in
cheekiness and lungs.

212
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,006
Cool.

213
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,048
Do you know what's
wrong with my daughter?

214
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,378
I do.

215
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,078
Scattered interstitial
infiltrates on the chest X-ray.

216
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,412
Mmm-hmm.

217
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,967
Dr. Bloom.

218
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,100
Hey.

219
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,073
<i>We miss you, Mommy.</i>

220
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,516
<i>Hope you have a good surgery.</i>

221
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,322
Hello, Ms. Mayer. I'm Dr. Frome.
We spoke on the phone.

222
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,621
You have to do some
kind of psych evaluation?

223
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:10,562
I do, yes. Just to make sure that
you understand what you're getting into

224
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,155
before you give your liver away.

225
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,201
Part of my liver.

226
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,293
Right, yes.

227
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,270
One step ahead of me. Good.

228
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:22,935
Okay, just a, um, few questions
that aren't on the forms you sent me.

229
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:26,605
Uh, first, I need to confirm that you
are doing this of your own free will.

230
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,409
Under no pressure
from anyone else.

231
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,417
I'm doing this because
my brother asked me to.

232
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,579
Siblings, am I right?

233
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,889
Do you have a
brother, Dr. Frome?

234
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,495
I did, yes. He passed away.

235
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:49,695
Would you have given him

236
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,004
part of yourself to save
him if you could've?

237
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,570
Yeah.

238
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,873
But you don't get
do-overs, right?

239
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,715
Okay, why don't we
talk about post-op care?

240
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,545
Tanya?

241
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,852
Are you all right?

242
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,359
What do you mean she's out?

243
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,559
I mean she's out, Max. I
can't clear her for surgery.

244
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,896
I don't believe this.

245
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,528
This house of cards is
built entirely on her consent.

246
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,130
Listen, Tanya Mayer is
nowhere near emotionally

247
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,917
or psychologically
capable of being a donor.

248
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,910
What... What
exactly did she say?

249
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,878
Well, she's got two small kids.

250
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,524
She's worried she won't be able to
take care of them while she's in recovery.

251
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,811
What's the real reason?

252
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,777
On a deeper level, on a more
emotional, personal level...

253
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,483
She's not convinced that Matty
would make the same sacrifice for her.

254
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,890
She can't be serious.

255
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,224
There are deep wounds
in this relationship,

256
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,888
Kapoor, old ones.
They're family.

257
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,329
Can't you talk to her? No.

258
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,643
Anything I say to her at this point
could be construed as coercion.

259
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,867
No one is suggesting coercion.

260
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,961
Stop. Look at this board.

261
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,401
Look at these people.

262
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,271
How do we fix this chain?

263
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,626
<i>Are you saying the
chain's in jeopardy</i>

264
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,085
<i>and we might need to pull the
plug on Omar Kahn's surgery?</i>

265
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,181
Well, let's just
call it a pause.

266
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,051
<i>We can't hold the OR forever.</i>

267
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,853
I know, just give us
some time to regroup.

268
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,123
If we can put this thing back together,
then we are gonna need your donor.

269
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,687
<i>Keep us in the loop.</i>
Thanks. Any luck?

270
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,290
We have been on the phone with
the Organ Transplant Foundation

271
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,630
for the last couple hours.

272
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,598
No match for Aminah.

273
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,639
The same with the
Living Donor Network.

274
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,832
Okay.

275
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,775
So, what now?

276
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,868
We keep looking. The
chain depends on it.

277
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,481
What if it didn't?

278
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,327
We might need a few more
words from you there, boss.

279
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,947
We can still move forward
with most of the surgeries today.

280
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,419
Don't even say it.

281
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,120
Tanya is gone, all right?
Aminah doesn't have a donor,

282
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,458
but the rest of
these recipients do.

283
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:58,825
Because of Aminah.

284
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,295
She's the anchor patient. We
started this chain to find her an organ.

285
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,395
Without her and Tariq,
there would be no chain.

286
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,498
I know, and we will
find Aminah a donor.

287
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,065
Just not today.

288
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,136
Will Tariq agree to donate
without Aminah having a donor?

289
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,748
It's the right thing to do.

290
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,349
The right thing to do?

291
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:23,855
That he should give up a piece of
himself while we take away his wife's hope?

292
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,987
This is the best option we have.

293
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,724
I'm sorry to cause so much
trouble. It wasn't you. It was Tanya.

294
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,530
No, I knew it was risky.

295
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,397
We haven't been
close in a long time.

296
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,303
She has her own family now...

297
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,969
She promised you, Matty.

298
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,706
She broke her promise.

299
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,448
And now because of her, a
woman across the hall is...

300
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,115
Would you give me a second?

301
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,856
Hey. Hey.

302
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,124
What kind of a person makes a
promise, gets on to a plane and then throws

303
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,357
that promise in your face?

304
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,559
Um, a mother who's scared
to die? A sister who feels used?

305
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,511
Where I come from, that's
not how we treat our family.

306
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,163
We don't turn our back on them.

307
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,672
Ooh. Okay, Vijay. This is
not about you and your son.

308
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,584
You can't make this about
him turning his back on you.

309
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:18,806
Iggy, you are most
welcome to play psychiatrist

310
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:22,212
with everyone else in
this hospital, not me.

311
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,252
So, no transplant today.

312
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,887
I am so sorry, Aminah.

313
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,694
Did the donor say why?

314
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,490
We can't ask those
kinds of questions,

315
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,758
but we are searching
for a new donor right now.

316
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,800
It took seven
months to get here.

317
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,430
Aminah doesn't have
another seven months.

318
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,404
Neither do the
others in the chain.

319
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,274
What happens to them?

320
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,672
Many of the other
recipients are very sick.

321
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,939
They're much sicker than you.

322
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,177
That's why we...

323
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,319
That's why we need to proceed
with the other surgeries today.

324
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,558
You're what?

325
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,357
We need to, um...
I need to ask you...

326
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,953
You can't be serious.

327
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,465
You would be
saving so many lives.

328
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,958
By sacrificing my wife's.

329
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,298
Tariq. No.

330
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,396
No, no, no. Hey, I love you.

331
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,532
I am not gonna let
them do this to you.

332
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:25,605
The Quran teaches
us that... Not now, <i>umi.</i>

333
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,112
I know that it seems
unfair... I won't do it.

334
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,013
Not unless Aminah has a donor.

335
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,868
This should relieve the pressure
building up in Gianna's lungs.

336
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,020
I'm through the right atrium.

337
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,463
So, is there a reason
you keep sending me

338
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,193
to do ED consults when
Dr. Bloom's on duty?

339
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,166
Do I need a reason?

340
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,468
I get the sense Dr. Bloom
thinks you're avoiding her.

341
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,566
That or she has no
confidence in my abilities.

342
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,639
She thinks you're
an excellent surgeon.

343
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,407
It's just that, uh,

344
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,881
she and I have a
bit of a situation.

345
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,448
Oh. No, no, no.

346
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,817
Not like that. Well,

347
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,618
whatever it is, may I suggest you
start answering your own pages?

348
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,561
Right Ventricular pressure's 35.

349
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,035
Draining the fluid didn't work.

350
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,604
I got your page.
What's happening?

351
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,249
Jemma had an impulsive
aggression episode.

352
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,969
How bad?

353
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,887
The other students said
it came out of nowhere.

354
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,005
She was screaming,
throwing things.

355
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,282
We put her in a quiet
room to calm down, but...

356
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,180
It's not my fault! Not so quiet.

357
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,121
Do you think we need to pump the
brakes on Jemma's home placement?

358
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,127
It's not my fault.
It's not my fault!

359
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:52,896
So, your daughter has a condition
called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,

360
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,231
and we couldn't tell how
advanced it was in the X-ray...

361
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,261
But she's going to
need a new lung.

362
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,904
You can do that?

363
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,638
You can give her a new lung?

364
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,236
Normally, yes.

365
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,074
But because you're
undocumented...

366
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,583
Dr. Bloom says you
treat everyone here.

367
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,747
We do. We do. But the Organ
Transplant Foundation, they won't put

368
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,722
an undocumented person
on their recipient list,

369
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,726
because post-operative
care requires...

370
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,987
Well, stability.

371
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,428
And they don't
think we have that.

372
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,931
Yeah.

373
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,736
What about me?

374
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:33,967
Give her my lung.

375
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,909
Well, we can check
to see if you're a match,

376
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,676
but there won't
be any guarantee.

377
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,740
Any chance is better than none.

378
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,309
Please.

379
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,228
That leaves only
four recipients.

380
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,456
And we still have
more donors to talk to.

381
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,226
Let's hope they stay in.

382
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,427
Why do you think any of them will
have a different reaction than Tariq?

383
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,812
They're good
people, but they're not

384
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,702
giving out of the
goodness of their hearts.

385
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,569
Quid pro quo.

386
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,609
Hey, how's the chain going?

387
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,611
Don't ask. So, uh, I have a
patient presenting with IPF.

388
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,238
She needs a lung, but
she's undocumented.

389
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,475
No family matches?

390
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,959
She only has her father,
but he's not a match.

391
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,628
I was hoping that maybe
you could call the Mayor,

392
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,678
get her a visa, so we
can get her on the OTF list.

393
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,452
Sharpe?

394
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,589
I don't see how this
helps. The HLA factors.

395
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,157
Uh, let's get the
whole team in here.

396
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,399
We might have a
way to save everyone.

397
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,173
The chain fell apart
when we lost Tanya Mayer,

398
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,439
but it looks like we have
a new match for Aminah.

399
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,743
And that is Diego Morales.

400
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:51,775
So, the chain is complete?

401
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,480
It will be if Diego agrees
to donate part of his liver.

402
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,181
Wait, how does
Diego donating his liver

403
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,985
help his daughter?
She needs half a lung.

404
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,334
That's where the chain comes in.

405
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,022
We need the families of the donors and
the recipients to reach out to their people

406
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:07,760
to find anyone who might be
willing to donate their lung to Gianna.

407
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,325
Why would anyone do this when
they weren't willing to before?

408
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,701
Because they weren't getting
anything in return before.

409
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,536
But now they would
be saving the lives

410
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,667
of everyone in the chain,
including their loved one.

411
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,176
It's a win-win. Win, win...

412
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,389
We don't have a lot of time. Some of
the recipients won't make it past tomorrow.

413
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,279
Then we better do it quickly.

414
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,884
You becoming part of this chain
is our best bet at saving Gianna.

415
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,015
We realize you may
need some time. I'll do it.

416
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,452
You understand
what we're asking?

417
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,588
Give me the knife
and I'll do it myself.

418
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,361
Well, let's hold off on that, but we
do appreciate the enthusiasm. Um...

419
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,969
Now the hard part.

420
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,506
Are you seriously asking
me to donate a lung, too?

421
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,371
No, you would just
be the liver donor.

422
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,052
What I'm asking for is
help finding someone

423
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,738
willing to donate a
portion of their lung.

424
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,144
A second donor.

425
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:55,977
So, we start this
all over again.

426
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,917
This girl, she is just a child?

427
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,316
Twelve years old.

428
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,749
The only person
she has is her father.

429
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:03,983
And he is not a match?

430
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,753
Gianna can only qualify for
a "directed organ" transplant.

431
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,385
Without it... No.

432
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:14,564
We've done everything you've
told us to do. We've done enough.

433
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,341
Is there anyone else?

434
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,573
Another family member?

435
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,806
We need a lung donor
to make this work.

436
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,749
My sister was all
the family I had.

437
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,474
And you know how that ended.

438
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:39,550
<i>Peter Stern is getting antsy about
donating, and frankly, so are we.</i>

439
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,355
<i>At some point we're
gonna have to move on.</i>

440
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,521
Just not yet. Please.

441
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:47,260
<i>I'll do what I can on my end, but at
this point, I can't promise anything.</i>

442
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,460
Okay, thanks.

443
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,060
Dora, get me Iggy. Oh.

444
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,331
Hey.

445
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,606
Hi. Hey.

446
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,267
Guess what.

447
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,210
Helen pulled some strings,
got us in with Dr. Britland.

448
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,277
Best oral surgeon in the city.

449
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,815
But something came up.

450
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,649
I'm not trying to
get out of this, okay?

451
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,554
I am just trying to rebuild
this transplant chain,

452
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,615
uh, one piece at a time.

453
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:18,528
Until each piece falls into place,
but it just keeps falling apart.

454
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,991
You know I'm on Team Max, right?

455
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,896
Of course, I do.

456
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:27,201
No, I mean I have banners
and hats and... You have a hat?

457
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,210
But sometimes it feels
like I'm the only one.

458
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,704
You're not. I promise. Look,

459
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:40,911
I want this cancer out of
my body more than anything.

460
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,785
I just have to push this
appointment a few hours.

461
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:47,725
Just until I can fix this chain.

462
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:55,058
Hey. Team Max.

463
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,104
Team Max.

464
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,105
I'm here to make it 100%
clear to you what happens

465
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,044
emotionally and physically
after organ donation.

466
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:11,447
Dr. Frome, Gianna and I
came here from Guatemala.

467
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,383
I was police there.

468
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:17,251
The gangs, they don't like
it if they cannot corrupt you.

469
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,021
They threatened our lives.

470
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,254
That's why you left? You fled.

471
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,531
When Gianna could not walk
and breathe at the same time,

472
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,363
I carried her.

473
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,797
And when we finally
got to New York...

474
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:37,732
I made sure we were hidden,
so they could not send us back.

475
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,474
And she got worse.

476
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,480
This is my fault.

477
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:44,773
And I'm going to fix it.

478
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,313
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

479
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:53,482
Okay.

480
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,261
That's all I needed to hear.

481
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:03,092
Hey, I was just about to head out. I
wanted to see if you needed anything.

482
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,260
Oh.

483
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,102
Are you okay?

484
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,133
I'm scared.

485
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,903
I don't like being alone.

486
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,580
You wanna know a secret?

487
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,291
I don't like being alone either.

488
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,198
What do you say, you and I, we

489
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,701
keep each other company
until your dad gets back?

490
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,362
Yeah? Yeah.

491
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,441
Okay. Come on, scoot over.

492
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,477
Okay.

493
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,814
Hey, you know, Gemini's
boyfriend was my very first crush.

494
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,115
But he's a one-eyed
meteor beast.

495
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,313
Yeah.

496
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,623
Yeah, I was a weird kid.

497
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:06,795
We shared Gianna's case with all the
families in the Domino Transplant Chain.

498
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,994
And it was a tough
ask of a perfect stranger

499
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,334
to donate a part of their lung.

500
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,297
I, uh...

501
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,671
I understand.

502
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,676
The thing is, Diego, um,

503
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,077
we don't have a
donor for Gianna.

504
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,574
We have 12.

505
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,284
Now with so many volunteers,

506
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:31,756
we are almost sure to find
a match for Gianna today.

507
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,262
What is it?

508
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,964
- She just stopped breathing.
- BP's dropping.

509
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,150
Got any room on
her dopamine drip?

510
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,802
Maxed out. So is the dobutamine.

511
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,053
Start levophed. Start levophed.

512
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,488
We've got this. NURSE:
Heart rate's up to 120.

513
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,023
Are you sure her heart
can tolerate the levo?

514
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,606
No, but do it anyway. Reynolds?

515
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,048
We've got this.

516
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,215
Come on, Gianna.

517
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,428
Come on.

518
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,390
Come on, come on.

519
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,204
Gianna's heart
is failing, Diego.

520
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:24,039
Her lungs are so scarred that her
heart can't pump blood through them.

521
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,499
We have to take her to the OR

522
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,482
to put her on an
aortic balloon pump.

523
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,917
That will stabilize her condition and
hopefully it will help her heart recover.

524
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,421
But until it does,

525
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:40,492
she's not strong enough to
withstand transplant surgery.

526
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,289
I'm sorry.

527
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,726
Take care of my little girl.

528
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,434
We'll give you
some time with her.

529
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,884
I really thought we were
gonna make this chain work.

530
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,547
You're giving up? There's
nothing else to do today,

531
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,181
except hope everyone hangs on.

532
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,763
Is Gianna okay?

533
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,831
We're getting her to the OR now.

534
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,903
Uh, can we talk?

535
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,770
I don't know, can we?

536
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,607
It seems like you've been doing
everything you can not to talk to me.

537
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:35,273
I deserve that. I got
more, you wanna hear 'em?

538
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:39,478
Okay, look, uh, Evie and I have
been spending a lot of time together.

539
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,453
And our history makes
that, you know, complicated.

540
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,955
And awkward.

541
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,283
Not for me. Really?

542
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,483
I introduced the two of you.

543
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,961
I mean, shouldn't that
prove that I'm fine with this?

544
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,464
Or do you think I just
like torturing myself?

545
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,626
I mean... Shut up.

546
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,699
Come on, stop being weird.
We're friends and we're fine.

547
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,864
Now, can you just
please go and fix Gianna?

548
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,903
All right.

549
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,325
You can't lock me in here!

550
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,057
Okay, we can talk about that,
but not while you're yelling.

551
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,602
It's not even my fault!

552
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,663
Janine was messing
with my machine.

553
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,700
And I told her to stop
it and she wouldn't!

554
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,089
Wow, you really... You really
cared about that project, huh?

555
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,206
Yeah. Okay.

556
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,944
So, then why did you break it?

557
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,359
All right, um...

558
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:58,857
Do me a favor and, uh, just
close your eyes for a second.

559
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,099
Jemma, close them.

560
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,537
Close them, please. Thank you.

561
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:09,234
All right, now I want you
to picture that machine.

562
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,603
I want you to see it broken
in pieces all over the ground.

563
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,469
How does that make you feel?

564
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,181
Sad, I guess. Okay.

565
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,684
Why sad? Because it's a waste.

566
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,413
All right, what else?

567
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:26,884
It's...

568
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,421
sad because...

569
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,393
it's useless now
and nobody wants it.

570
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,104
Jemma. I know what
you're gonna say.

571
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,168
You do?

572
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,175
Okay, all right,
smarty-pants. Then tell me.

573
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,744
What am I gonna say?

574
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:58,924
No one wants me.

575
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,853
Why would I say that?

576
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,126
It's not true. Yes, it is.

577
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,725
No, it's not. Blanca wants you.

578
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,531
Yeah, today she does.

579
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:15,464
Someday she won't.

580
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,248
Look, I'm gonna
mess it up. I always do.

581
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,614
No, I don't believe
that. Not for a second.

582
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:30,584
I know that trusting
people is scary.

583
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,124
That's the scariest thing.

584
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,457
But when it comes to family,

585
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,197
that's just the
price of admission.

586
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,465
That's the way it goes.

587
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:46,063
And nobody deserves a
family more than you do.

588
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,998
Nobody.

589
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,537
Trust me.

590
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,046
You don't have to go.

591
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,541
But...

592
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,351
If you do decide to
take that leap of faith,

593
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,654
I'll be there with you.

594
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,261
I hate feeling like I'm
giving up on these people.

595
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,426
Max, when have you
ever given up on anyone?

596
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,212
Right now, if you don't
take care of yourself,

597
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,514
how are you gonna
take care of them?

598
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,336
- Max.
- What's going on?

599
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,726
Is everyone okay?
Everyone's fine.

600
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,935
Diego?

601
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,935
May I still give to the chain?

602
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:46,725
What did he say?

603
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,864
The Domino Chain's a go.

604
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,373
Okay. I hereby bequeath unto you

605
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,413
the "Holy Sticky
Notes." Such an honor.

606
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,472
We're gonna be
late. Text me, okay?

607
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,347
I wanna know everything that's
going on, every step of the way.

608
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,683
Absolutely. That sounds
like a great use of my time.

609
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,656
I want a full play-by-play, right?
Leave no patient's condition un-texted.

610
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,659
Leave no surgeon's
incision un-communicated.

611
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,752
Max, you're headed into
quadruple molar extraction.

612
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,320
You'll be under anesthesia
for hours. I can multitask.

613
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,409
Just please say "okay," so I
can push him into a passing cab.

614
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,644
Okay. I'll text so frequently,
you'll need a new data plan.

615
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,069
That's what I'm talking about.

616
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:46,985
Donor Diego Morales' right liver
lobe has been isolated and extracted.

617
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,695
The donor liver has arrived for
transplant recipient Aminah Ali.

618
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:04,204
<i>And meet me there</i>

619
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:10,813
<i>Bundles of flowers We
wait through the hours of cold</i>

620
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,553
Good news? KAPOOR:
Your organ just landed.

621
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,383
I'll be here with you

622
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,121
every step of the way.

623
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:31,666
<i>Shelter as we go</i>

624
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,089
Go ahead.

625
00:34:54,993 --> 00:35:00,864
<i>And promise me this</i>

626
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:11,138
<i>You'll wait for me only
Scared of the lonely arms</i>

627
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:20,749
<i>Surface, far below these burn</i>

628
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,885
Welcome home, kiddo.

629
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:55,145
<i>And maybe</i>

630
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,590
<i>Just maybe I'll come home</i>

631
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,927
Matty's in recovery.

632
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,605
Congratulations.

633
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,077
Your chain is complete.

634
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,079
Our chain.

635
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,381
Do you know, in Oncology,

636
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,078
you get so few wins.

637
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:31,715
It becomes harder and harder to
believe that things will ever work out.

638
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,282
Oh, I thought for sure
this would not work out.

639
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,361
But it did.

640
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,030
Welcome back.

641
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:58,813
Gianna.

642
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,943
How is she?

643
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,954
Ask her yourself.

644
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,856
<i>Cómo estás, Papi?</i>

645
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:17,132
We were able to shore up her
heart enough to do her transplant.

646
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,032
She got her lung?

647
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:25,802
Your daughter is a fighter.

648
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,745
Just like Gemini.

649
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,479
She gets it from her mother.

650
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,716
I get it from you, <i>Papi.</i>

651
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,394
Thank you.

652
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:47,094
Thank you, Doctor. Ah.

653
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,659
I only saved one life today.

654
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,335
You saved six.

655
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,450
Now that was awesome.

656
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,782
Yes, it was.

657
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,152
Hey, you wanna have
lunch with me and Evie?

658
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,600
Her favorite spot's
this place on 23rd

659
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,957
where they literally put
everything on a donut.

660
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:23,258
As tempting as, uh, that sounds,

661
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,102
I think I'm just gonna
head home and chill.

662
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,628
Chill?

663
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,441
Later.

664
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,237
Don't keep her waiting.

665
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:49,291
Hey, what are you doing
here? So, the thing is...

666
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,962
I do wanna walk
into work with you.

667
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,975
Haven't seen you
in a while, Dr. Bloom.

668
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:06,472
Welcome home.

669
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,229
<i>Bronx General
Emergency Department.</i>

670
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,923
Hey, uh, it's Dr. Lauren Bloom.

671
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:28,125
Can I still pick up
that shift tonight?

672
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,248
Morning, sleepyhead.

673
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,816
Ready for breakfast?

674
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,681
Well, lunch.

675
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:26,847
Bone broth.

676
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,223
Yummy.

677
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,368
Oh, Helen texted you all right.

678
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,030
So many texts.

679
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,107
Lot of, uh,
complicated doctor talk.

680
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,187
But there's only one thing
you need to know right now.

681
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,737
"Our Domino Chain
was a complete success.

682
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,011
"Thank you for never
letting us lose hope."

683
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,522
You can read the rest after
you've had your bone broth.

684
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,129
<i>You can try and try</i>

685
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,099
<i>Even if it lasts an hour</i>

686
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:51,001
<i>With all our might We'll
try and make it ours</i>

687
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:54,840
<i>Because we're on our way</i>

688
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:59,282
<i>We're on our way to fall in love</i>

689
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:03,452
<i>Yeah, we're on our
way to fall in love</i>

690
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:05,617
We'll do it together.

691
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,620
One piece at a time.

692
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:12,926
Until each piece
falls into place.

693
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,162
<i>We're on our way to fall in love</i>
