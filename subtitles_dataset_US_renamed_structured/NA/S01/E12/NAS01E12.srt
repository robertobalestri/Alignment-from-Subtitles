1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,404
<i>Previously on</i> New Amsterdam...

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,338
Dr. Bloom. Dr. Bloom?

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,248
<i>The last few weeks,</i>

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,108
<i>I've been taking a little bit
more Adderall than prescribed.</i>

5
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,238
I think you may need
help. I'm just tired.

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,428
Mr. Powell could have died.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,189
Run the cardiac
surgical department.

8
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,533
There is no cardiac
surgical department.

9
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:24,581
Then build one.

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,418
When we aim high energy
external beam radiation

11
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,521
at the cancer in your throat.
If you move then, you die.

12
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,096
I don't want everyone
to see me so weak.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,566
The answer's yes, Max.

14
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,035
I'll be your deputy.

15
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,627
I don't even know what
some of this stuff is.

16
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,280
Babe, I didn't know
we had so many friends.

17
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,783
This is a return, right?

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,050
No way. No?

19
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,935
Cloth diapers are way
better for the environment.

20
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,639
Yeah, but disposable
diapers are way better

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,389
for sleeping in on Sunday.

22
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,658
Fine. "Maybe"
pile. "Maybe" pile.

23
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,590
It's very cute that you think
you're sleeping in on Sundays.

24
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,967
Yeah. Electric snot
sucker? Return.

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,938
How do you suggest we remove
snot from our baby's nasal passages?

26
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,065
The old-fashioned way.

27
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,318
You put your mouth
on that nose and you...

28
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:18,403
That's disgusting! Keeping. suck
up all this thing. No, it's fun, babe.

29
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:24,477
What about a baby...
A baby blender?

30
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,896
That's a maybe. I mean, we
don't have an adult blender.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,821
All right, well, the
Swedish here says, uh...

32
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,622
Oh! Well, in that case,
return. Hmm. Return. Yeah.

33
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,362
Mmm.

34
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,099
Oh, babe, more nausea?

35
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,672
Mmm-hmm.

36
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:50,277
Hey, I thought Helen said
that you wouldn't experience

37
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,006
chemo nausea so soon.

38
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,047
Well, maybe I'm...

39
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,842
Maybe I'm special.

40
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:00,120
Maybe you should stay home.

41
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,178
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-mmm.

42
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:04,848
I'm good.

43
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,650
I'm already over it.

44
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,525
It's fine. I'm raring to go.

45
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,888
I'm not gonna let a little
cancer slow me down.

46
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,723
I'm fine.

47
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,467
How can I help?

48
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,875
Figured out why the old
Cardio Department lost its way.

49
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,412
Our conflict of interest policy.

50
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,313
What's wrong with it?
Well, we don't have one.

51
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,326
Big Pharma could buy me an
island, and no one would know.

52
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,149
Could be fun. We should
mandate total transparency.

53
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,693
Uh, how many other
hospitals do this?

54
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,656
Zero. I guess
we'll be the first.

55
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,060
In clinical trials, do you know
what you want in ideal candidates?

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,719
Oh, I know this
one. Sick people?

57
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,023
Diversity. Yeah.

58
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,260
Our candidates need to be as diverse
as the country we're aiming to treat.

59
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,486
Yeah, so what's the problem?

60
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,162
The country I'm trying
to treat isn't Finland.

61
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,399
Hmm.

62
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,202
I can see that.

63
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,371
Yeah. I'll make some calls.

64
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,745
More glitter, right? Okay, yes.

65
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,612
So, New York has seen a
spike in Polynesian refugees

66
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,362
because their countries are, you
know, sinking into the Pacific Ocean.

67
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,911
Right. Not a lot of
them speak English,

68
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,400
like these little cuties right
here. From Tuvalu, aren't you?

69
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,368
Imagine I just said, "How
can I help?" in Tuvaluan.

70
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,519
I wish I could, but I can't,

71
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,755
because nobody speaks
Tuvaluan in New York.

72
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,422
Literally. Like, less than 20
people. I need a translator.

73
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,402
Oh. Okay. So, I just
learned the word for "potty."

74
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,580
Oh, did you? But
I'm gonna take off.

75
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,628
Okay.

76
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,935
Oh. Oh! Gladys!

77
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,775
My department was just flagged by HCC
for "disproportionately providing coverage

78
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,747
"to patients ineligible
for Medicaid and for..."

79
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,440
Solved.

80
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,530
Thought that was gonna go in.
Still solved. Pretend it went in.

81
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,420
But they said they
would cap my budget...

82
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,720
It doesn't matter. We
treat everybody here,

83
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,736
and if they're not covered, if
they're covered, it doesn't matter.

84
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,784
The price...

85
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,139
We treat everyone. That's
the power of New Amsterdam.

86
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,222
Excuse me.

87
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,233
Max, are you okay? MAX: Yeah.

88
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,069
Oh...

89
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,168
Max, you want
us to wait for you?

90
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,175
Oh, God, what is the medical
term for "barfed my face off"?

91
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,115
This isn't a great time.

92
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,563
You don't even know
what just came out of me.

93
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,284
I'm not just talking
quantity, I'm talking quality.

94
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,276
I mean, what the heck could I have
possibly eaten that's gonna come out...

95
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,658
Max. What?

96
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,130
This is a consortium of top oncologists
being hosted by a WHO facility in Haiti.

97
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,766
Everyone, this is Dr. Goodwin,
our medical director.

98
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,331
How you doing?

99
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,802
<i>Hello.</i>

100
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,104
Let's pick this up
in 15, shall we?

101
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,647
Sorry about that. It's fine.

102
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm consulting on a
very challenging case.

103
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,315
A digression about
the texture of your vomit

104
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,378
was just the mood-lightener
that we needed.

105
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,547
Happy to help.

106
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,318
And you need anti-nausea meds?

107
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,621
Mmm-hmm.

108
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,331
This is harder than I thought.

109
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,857
Silver lining?

110
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,169
When we start radiation tonight,

111
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,364
your throat's gonna be
too sore to eat anything.

112
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,669
Less nausea.

113
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,807
So, you'd walk by, and
you'd see all this smoke

114
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,315
seeping out from under the door.

115
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,050
But it wasn't a fire. It was the
cardiologists' smoking lounge.

116
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,180
In the hospital?
Yes, building C.

117
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,685
Third floor.

118
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,386
They had the fire department

119
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,894
called on them at
least twice a month.

120
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,907
I can't believe you've never
told me that one before.

121
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,901
It was a different time. Just a
wonder more patients didn't die.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,024
Yeah, no kidding.

123
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,729
Oh! No, it's okay.
It's okay, I got it.

124
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,790
No, no, no, I got
it. Henry, it's cool.

125
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,406
Thanks. I've been
trained for such situations.

126
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,406
Just got to get the
big chunks, right?

127
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,231
Yeah. Thanks. Kick
the rest under the table.

128
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,172
Clumsy.

129
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:53,850
You know, my intern
days were totally tame.

130
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,550
I don't have any crazy stories,
you know. Oh, don't be so sure.

131
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,627
Those memories will come
flooding back once you're my age.

132
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,793
For example, I have a temporal
bone surgery scheduled tomorrow.

133
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,029
Now, back in the day, we
wouldn't even consider operating

134
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,265
until we could see discoloration
in the neck and the jawline.

135
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,199
Oh.

136
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:14,933
That's crazy.

137
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,649
Okay. Thank you so much.

138
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,388
Lauren. I'm late.

139
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:29,479
Lauren.

140
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,386
I am deeply sorry. If you
would just hear me out...

141
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,760
You rooted through
my bag for drugs

142
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,990
after I explicitly told
you that I was clean.

143
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,594
You just couldn't
trust me, could you?

144
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,403
It's not that simple,
and you know it.

145
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,739
I was concerned.

146
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,737
I overstepped. What I wanted...

147
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,140
We were friends.

148
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,905
We still are. How?

149
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,181
You asked for help. You
admitted you needed help.

150
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,753
Let me help you.

151
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,481
How about this?

152
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,353
From now on, you stay on your
side of the hospital. I'll stay on mine.

153
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,188
Oh, hi.

154
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,794
Max?

155
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,337
Hey, Dora told me I
could find you in here.

156
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,272
Yeah. Oh. Okay.

157
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,341
That's all right. I can wait.

158
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,880
Oy.

159
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,219
Hey. How can I...

160
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,902
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I got it.

161
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,618
So, let's say, hypothetically, I
have a friend here at the hospital.

162
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,823
Let's call him, uh, Dr. Dre.

163
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:47,032
And what if he kind
of, sort of, maybe,

164
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,827
shouldn't, probably be
performing surgeries anymore?

165
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,867
We're not having an
unofficial conversation

166
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,009
about an impaired
physician, Iggy.

167
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,408
We have a system.

168
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,168
I know.

169
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,208
I just don't want to ruin
anyone's career, you know?

170
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,492
Well, if you're concerned enough

171
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,714
to bring it to me here,
then it has to be official.

172
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,981
All right? No half
reports, no pseudonyms.

173
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,321
By the way, maybe
pick a better one. I know.

174
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,226
Just tell me what's going on so I
can investigate the doctor properly.

175
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,352
Come on, man.

176
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,999
Can't we just hypothesize
about it for a little while longer?

177
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,366
Iggy, your name will be
kept confidential. I swear.

178
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,009
It's Dr. Maravich.

179
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,911
What's going on?

180
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,513
Do you speak
English? Yes, yes, yes!

181
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,162
Please, you have to
help him! He needs help!

182
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,210
Severe dehydration.

183
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,222
Okay, let's get him over
to Bay 27 for a workup.

184
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,751
What's your name? Ivan Velez.

185
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,191
Ivan, how do you know him?
Uh, Miguel, we are brothers.

186
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,855
You must help him, please!
He feels hot. Ivan, look at me.

187
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,464
How long has he
been sick like this?

188
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,690
Uh, about a week.

189
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,133
He started shivering, and he
couldn't drink or eat anything.

190
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,195
We thought he needed
sleep, but it only got worse.

191
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,697
Does it hurt to swallow?

192
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,918
You have to help him!
I'll do everything I can.

193
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,774
Bloom, lymphs are swollen.

194
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,902
Okay, open for me?

195
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,410
What? What do you see?

196
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,114
He needs an FNA, ASAP.

197
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,211
Who's on call for
oncology? Dr. Sharpe.

198
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,255
Daddy, who's that man?

199
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,261
My name is Dr. Kapoor.

200
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,334
I'm going to help your mom.

201
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,305
She can't see. Her
eyes are broken.

202
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,339
Then I'll try to fix them.

203
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,176
Let's find a healthy
snack, kiddo. Yeah.

204
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,610
We'll be just outside.

205
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,651
I see from your records, Maren,

206
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,445
you've had a rough time. Yeah.

207
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:51,750
My organs, they shut
down during Violet's birth.

208
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,625
I couldn't stop bleeding. I
was in the ICU for nine months.

209
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,327
Ian had to make
arrangements. Just in case.

210
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,993
But you survived. Mmm-hmm.

211
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,435
Well, most of me.

212
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,831
So, you developed an adenoma
at the base of your brain.

213
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:13,174
It's pressing on the optic chiasm
and causing your blindness.

214
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,874
Yeah, and everyone
says they can't remove it

215
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,508
because I can't have
anesthesia 'cause of my liver.

216
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,654
That's right. But there
is a new treatment.

217
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,856
Non-surgical. I won't
even need to break the skin.

218
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,219
How?

219
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,656
It's MRI-guided
focused ultrasound.

220
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,158
Non-invasive, no anesthesia.

221
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,561
Just one catch.

222
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,662
Yeah. There's always a catch.

223
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,335
Before I can address
your brain tumor,

224
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,343
we need to replace
one of your heart valves

225
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,804
also weakened by Violet's birth.

226
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,575
But I'm sure my colleague, Dr. Reynolds,
can do that without anesthesia as well.

227
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,079
Wow.

228
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,721
I would love to see
my daughter's face.

229
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,925
I would love to see
her eyes. I would.

230
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,507
Hi. I got your page.

231
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,167
Yeah.

232
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,349
Mr. Velez?

233
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,420
This is Dr. Sharpe.

234
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,187
She's gonna biopsy
your brother's throat,

235
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,062
so we can figure out
what's making him so sick.

236
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,452
Open up for me, Mr. Velez.

237
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,463
Arroyo. His name
is Miguel Arroyo.

238
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,312
I thought you
guys were brothers.

239
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,801
We're like brothers. You
know, we are <i>Boricua.</i>

240
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,461
We grew up a town
apart on La Isla,

241
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,731
but we never knew each other
until we came to New York.

242
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,065
When did you move here?

243
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,237
Hurricane Maria took everything.

244
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,380
My home was washed away,
and no one was coming to help.

245
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,148
So I left to find work, so
I could rebuild one day.

246
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,553
Took any job I could get.
Construction, picking apples.

247
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,912
And that's where I met
Miguel, on a farm upstate.

248
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,585
We both lost
everything but faith.

249
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,120
She brought us together
to protect each other.

250
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,594
You see? So, we
are more than friends.

251
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,782
Specimen cup.

252
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,434
Here.

253
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,086
Admin sent me about a nameplate?

254
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,817
Oh. Yes.

255
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,762
Great. Thank you.

256
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,462
I've been calling for a month.

257
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,293
Just tell me what
you need, Dr. Merritt.

258
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,365
No, actually, I'm Dr. Reynolds.

259
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,165
Oh. Nameplate says "Merritt."

260
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:54,441
Right, and I want it
replaced with "Reynolds."

261
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,998
"Dr. Reynolds"? Correct.

262
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,170
Okay, gonna have to get the
Chair of Cardiothoracic Surgery

263
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,713
to sign off on a
request like that.

264
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,373
Not a problem. I'm the Chair
of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

265
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,611
Dr. Merritt. No, Dr. Reynolds.

266
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,630
Well, it says
Dr. Merritt's the Chair.

267
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,452
Well, he's not. I'm the Chair.

268
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,151
Well, then why are you
in his office? This is my...

269
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,556
Um...

270
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,894
You see how confusing this is?

271
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,382
Well, I have this same conversation
with every patient that comes in here,

272
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,833
which doesn't help them to be confident
in the doctor they chose to cut them open

273
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,030
because he can't even
get his name on the door.

274
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,832
Yeah, I'm thinking you
might need a new nameplate.

275
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,233
Yeah.

276
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,206
Henry.

277
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,048
Chemo stomach. It's no joke.

278
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,020
You're telling me.
Thanks for coming.

279
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,148
Sure.

280
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,351
You know what this
room used to be?

281
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,187
Hmm, I think legal had it.

282
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,353
Well, the fun part is
who had it before legal.

283
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,498
In '67, we'd call this
the "Nookie Closet."

284
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,537
Did you? Now it's a
stone's throw from HR,

285
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,403
so why don't we let that one sail
right by? Mind if we get right to it?

286
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,431
Not at all.

287
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,171
I'd like to schedule you
for a medical evaluation.

288
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,376
Nothing wrong with
my health, Dr. Goodwin.

289
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,549
Just consider it
a formality. Okay?

290
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,949
This hospital requires a
medical eval every two years.

291
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,352
I passed my last exam
less than a year ago.

292
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,916
With flying colors, I might add.

293
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,464
I don't like it any more
than you do, but it is my job.

294
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,134
I've been in practice
for more than 40 years.

295
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,102
All of them here.

296
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,763
I can do my
surgeries blindfolded.

297
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,973
I appreciate that, Henry,

298
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,773
I do, but I would still like to
schedule you for a routine eval.

299
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,473
Tomorrow.

300
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,743
Of course.

301
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,047
You got to do your job.

302
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,929
So you need me to
perform a valve replacement,

303
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,933
so that you can do an
MRI-focused ultrasound.

304
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,060
It shouldn't be a
problem. Keep scrolling.

305
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,266
Oh!

306
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,569
Your patient can't
withstand anesthesia.

307
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,108
That's right, but
if I can perform

308
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,337
a procedure on the
brain without anesthesia,

309
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,436
you can certainly do the
same thing for the heart.

310
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:17,143
Yeah, the only noninvasive surgery
is catheter aortic replacement therapy.

311
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,274
Yes, do that.

312
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,446
Which requires a C-ART device,
which New Amsterdam does not have.

313
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,580
So we'll get one.

314
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,451
Yeah, sure. "So we'll get one."

315
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,822
A C-ART device costs $3 million.

316
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:31,320
I made Maren Thompson a promise
that I would help her see her daughter.

317
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,360
I'll get you this device.

318
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,758
Okay, guruji, look.

319
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:39,033
I can't even get my name
on my own door, all right?

320
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,835
They're not gonna just
buy you a $3 million device.

321
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,341
We will see about that.

322
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,793
Uh, remember when you told me

323
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,013
we'll treat everyone
here no matter the price?

324
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,196
That's the power
of New Amsterdam.

325
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,018
Yes, well, we need
a C-ART device.

326
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,784
Okay, I'll call HCC. Done.

327
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,883
Do you know what
a C-ART device is?

328
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,432
Will it help your patient? It's
the only thing that will help.

329
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,639
Good enough for me. Thank you.

330
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:04,961
Yeah? Hey, hey, hey.

331
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,109
I thought you were gonna
handle that whole Dr. M situation.

332
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,133
Yeah, handled. Medical
eval scheduled for tomorrow.

333
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,362
Well, he moved his temporal
bone surgery up to today.

334
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,676
Help! Help! He needs help!

335
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,839
What's happening to him?

336
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,573
Push two milligrams of Ativan.

337
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,486
Biopsy results? They just
came back. It's not cancer.

338
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,750
Must be an infection.

339
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,587
Given the ulcers,
it's got to be viral.

340
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,685
I'll start acyclovir. I
saw polys on the biopsy.

341
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,921
Bacterial's much more likely.

342
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,756
Or the polys are due
to a secondary infection

343
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,666
on top of the viral infection and
irrelevant. It's my ED, my call.

344
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,033
And if I disagree
with your call?

345
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,383
Bloom, we got four more!

346
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,202
Similar symptoms to Mr. Arroyo!

347
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,935
Visible ulcers in the
back of the mouth.

348
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,065
Four more?

349
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,008
Where did they come from?
- Watch out.

350
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,014
We all work together.
They were all sick, too!

351
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,221
Mind if I scrub in?

352
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,863
What are you trying to prove?

353
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,523
Nothing. Just here to observe.

354
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,698
I've done this surgery
hundreds of times, Dr. Goodwin.

355
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,896
I don't need the
hospital's medical director

356
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,372
standing over my shoulder
evaluating my every incision.

357
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,102
Then pretend I'm not here.

358
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,371
You trying to throw me
off my game, is that it?

359
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,710
I expect all the surgeons in my
hospital to perform at their best

360
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,813
whether I'm here
watching or not.

361
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,477
Anyone's not performing
at their best, it's you.

362
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,454
Running a hospital
while undergoing chemo?

363
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,219
You have no right to judge me.

364
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,658
This isn't about me.

365
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,559
I've helped thousands
of patients at this hospital.

366
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,133
Thousands. My
record is sterling.

367
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,401
My reputation impeccable.

368
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,993
Henry, you're a legacy here.

369
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,628
Damn right I am.

370
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,105
But what story do you
want told in the end?

371
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,842
That you were a
titan in your field,

372
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,745
or that you were a doctor who didn't
know when to lay down the scalpel?

373
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,941
There'll come a day, Max,

374
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,155
when you won't be able to
perform as well as you once could.

375
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,751
Maybe sooner than you think.

376
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,129
Well, they all work together out at
some vineyard out in Long Island.

377
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,850
And they're all exhibiting
the same symptoms?

378
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,001
To a T.

379
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,840
What at a vineyard could
have made them all so sick?

380
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,208
Let's find out.

381
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,773
The owners made us sleep
in this old, rundown barn.

382
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,785
All crowded together, cramped.

383
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,181
How many of you?

384
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,887
Seventeen, sometimes 18.

385
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,623
At night, I just tried to think
of my family back home.

386
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,172
Yes, there were so many rats.

387
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,392
I've been picking since
Hurricane Georges.

388
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,366
Been 20 years since
I've seen Puerto Rico.

389
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,694
Have you harvested
at this vineyard before?

390
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,863
No.

391
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,165
And I will not go back.

392
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,373
I will starve first.

393
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,470
The owner treats us like
animals. Pays us nothing.

394
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,644
And everything was
damp and wet all the time.

395
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,178
Mold everywhere.

396
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,761
I'm thinking pesticides led
to an autoimmune reaction,

397
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:31,497
erythema multiforme. EM
would explain everything.

398
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,430
Their kidney function is fine.

399
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,239
The rats and the close quarters

400
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,436
are the perfect breeding
ground for the hantavirus.

401
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,044
Something's off.

402
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,877
We're missing something. Really?

403
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,678
I think Sharpe may
have nailed it. Hanta.

404
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,378
No, it's not hantavirus.

405
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,284
Okay. Because?

406
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,245
Because...

407
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,714
I have a gut feeling.

408
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,428
Or you're just disagreeing with
me because it's my diagnosis.

409
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,624
Everything okay here?

410
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,131
Yes. It's fine.

411
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,463
Okay, at the risk of
stepping into something,

412
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:03,797
I'm gonna make the call.

413
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,427
Treat for hantavirus.

414
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,077
Suction. Suction.

415
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,721
I dropped a bottle, Iggy.

416
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,299
One stupid bottle.

417
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,258
I was...

418
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,494
I was worried.

419
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:43,609
You moved the surgery up
because you knew you wouldn't pass

420
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,735
the medical evaluation.

421
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,608
I moved up my surgery

422
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,148
to prove the evaluation
wasn't necessary.

423
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,840
No, Henry, come on.

424
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,748
I may not be a young
man anymore, Iggy,

425
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,652
but I am a surgeon with
over 40 years' experience.

426
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,420
And that counts for something.

427
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,954
At least, it should
count for something.

428
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,847
You really buried the lede on the
whole C-ART device, didn't you?

429
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,431
$3 million?

430
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,170
To be fair, you did say,
"No matter the price."

431
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,820
No, you're right. I
really should have asked

432
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,837
more prudent follow-up questions.
Like, "Does it cost $3 million?"

433
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,941
To be clear, New Amsterdam
will never get a C-ART device.

434
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:29,614
See, what'd I tell you? The
system can't handle the small things.

435
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,534
Why in the hell should we be surprised
when it can't handle the big ones?

436
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:33,719
Didn't let me finish.

437
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,504
New Amsterdam will
never get a C-ART device,

438
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:39,192
so you should do the surgery
at a hospital that does have one.

439
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:40,889
What are you saying?

440
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,231
University has a C-ART device.

441
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,873
We have a patient.

442
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,369
Peanut butter, jelly.

443
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,836
So, as our sister hospital,
they'll let us do the surgery there?

444
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,738
Not exactly. And
definitely not for free.

445
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,716
But her insurance
won't cover University.

446
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,378
Yeah, and then I
can't do the surgery.

447
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,685
No, you can't,
but Dr. Merritt can.

448
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,990
Last I checked, he's
still credentialed at Uni.

449
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,555
Okay, wait, wait.

450
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,602
Impersonating another doctor
is grounds for malpractice.

451
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,001
I can lose my license.
I can go to prison.

452
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,438
Nobody is suggesting
impersonating anyone, all right?

453
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,668
You are the Chair of
Cardiothoracic Surgery

454
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,176
at New Amsterdam. Just say that.

455
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,877
This is crazy.

456
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,746
Even for you. Do you
want to help the patient?

457
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:29,872
This is how.

458
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,043
Are you really
talking about this?

459
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,688
Sneaking a patient across
the city into University Hospital?

460
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,057
If the system can't
handle the little things,

461
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,057
then it certainly won't
notice the big ones.

462
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,561
Sure.

463
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,813
University Hospital.

464
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,768
Can I help you?

465
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,431
Dr. Nottingham.

466
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,939
I'm here to observe a C-ART
procedure as part of my residency.

467
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,603
I called earlier. Observe who?

468
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,974
The Chair of Cardiothoracic Surgery at
New Amsterdam. It's nice to meet you.

469
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,507
Dr. Merritt?

470
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,247
That's what it says on my door.

471
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,427
Pushing the delivery
system up to the aortic valve.

472
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,621
You're nearly there.
How much longer?

473
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,200
Ah-ah-ah... Don't rush
me, and I won't rush you.

474
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,167
If we get caught, it's my
name on the schedule.

475
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,295
Well, Dr. Merritt
will cover for you.

476
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,532
I didn't see anything.

477
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:02,869
Thank you, Maren.

478
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,187
Sheath's in place.

479
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,270
Got it.

480
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,004
Inflating the balloon.

481
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,339
Leaflets are moving.

482
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,819
Maren, you'll feel
some pressure.

483
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,986
Nice and easy.

484
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,151
Almost got it.

485
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,986
All right, new aortic valve's
in place. Deflating the balloon.

486
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,108
Wonderful. Let's get her
back to our hospital now.

487
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,657
Dr. Reynolds. I see it.

488
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:31,670
What? A bleed at
the cath insertion site.

489
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:35,138
It's a common side effect, but
Maren's gonna have to remain flat

490
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,167
with a sandbag on her
hip to keep the pressure on.

491
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,233
For how long?

492
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,138
It looks like you're gonna

493
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,732
have to do your
procedure here as well.

494
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,716
But I'm not Dr. Merritt, either.

495
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,857
Got them all on a cocktail of antivirals,
and we're doing active fluid replacement.

496
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,058
Thanks.

497
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,599
You don't think it's hanta?

498
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,525
No.

499
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,407
What do I know?

500
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,372
You know, Henry was shattered,

501
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,843
just standing there watching
the surgery go on without him.

502
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,785
It's like looking at a broken
man. You did the right thing.

503
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,717
Did I? Yeah.

504
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,248
Then why do I find myself
trying to recall Judas' good traits?

505
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:30,261
Iggy, I know he's a good
friend, but so are you, okay?

506
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,386
You didn't betray him,

507
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,932
because somebody could
have gotten hurt or worse.

508
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,960
Well, his body is
going. His mind is not.

509
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:38,996
Very few doctors have
that kind of expertise.

510
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,939
I mean, if we send
him on his way,

511
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,874
all that knowledge, all that
expertise goes out the door with him.

512
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,388
We might as well be saying, "Hey,
Doc, thank you. You're ancient.

513
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,089
"Don't need you anymore.
Don't let the door hit you

514
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,741
"on the wrinkly old
ass on the way out."

515
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,042
Hi.

516
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,143
Oh.

517
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,447
Hello. How are you?

518
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,458
<i>Hello.</i> Goodbye, Iggy.

519
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,989
Huh?

520
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,495
Leave. Yes, I'm sorry.

521
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,088
Bye.

522
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,898
I'll be back in 10. I just
need to fire a few people.

523
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,996
You know you
can't fire me, right?

524
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,403
I was referring to Iggy.

525
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:15,717
Yeah, you can't fire him either.

526
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,800
Yes, I know, Max.

527
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:17,986
But it makes me look in charge,

528
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,979
and right now I could
use a little bit of that.

529
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,770
How are things
with you and Bloom?

530
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,172
Fine.

531
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:26,508
Um, how are you feeling?

532
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,317
Good, yeah.

533
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,165
Aside from Iggy starting
an international rumor

534
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,624
that we traffic in
ageism, pretty good.

535
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:34,850
Your nausea?

536
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,293
Chemo tried to slow this
man down, but you know what?

537
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,455
It failed?

538
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,624
No, it succeeded, big-time.

539
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,329
But the drugs you
gave me are helping.

540
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,660
Good.

541
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:49,108
Well, it sounds like you're in the
right frame of mind to start radiation.

542
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,200
Aren't you glad you swung by?

543
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,305
So glad.

544
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,676
Okay.

545
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,381
Everyone just act normal,
like you belong here.

546
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,151
Like we're doctors
in a hospital?

547
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:06,783
MRI lab is down this way.

548
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,624
How are we gonna get in?

549
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,791
You might have to
schedule us again.

550
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,632
I'm starting to miss
the real Dr. Merritt.

551
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:16,300
How are you doing,
Maren? Nervous.

552
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,572
I haven't let myself be
hopeful in a very, very long time.

553
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,238
I know this whole process
has been rather unorthodox,

554
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:27,074
but I made you a promise,
and promise I will keep.

555
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,239
Dr. Kapoor, what
are you doing here?

556
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,308
Huh.

557
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,545
Funny story, actually.

558
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:37,386
Dr. Carlebach was one of
my best interns back in the day.

559
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,685
And now he's this big-time
neurologist here in University.

560
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,195
Yeah, Dr. Kapoor tried to
recruit me to New Amsterdam.

561
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,697
I wanted to go. I
really did, Vijay,

562
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,063
but my med school
loans were out of control.

563
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,191
I had to go private.

564
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,594
It's nice to meet you. Likewise.

565
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,502
I got to admit, I still miss
my days at The Dam.

566
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:57,042
Making the most out of
nothing, thinking outside the box.

567
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,578
Always such an adventure.

568
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,918
Funny you should
say that, Dr. Carlebach.

569
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,960
<i>Initiating sonication pulse.</i>

570
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,265
And going again.

571
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:25,436
<i>Mrs. Thompson, we're using
high-intensity focused ultrasound</i>

572
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,438
to pinpoint the tumor
at the base of your brain.

573
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,563
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

574
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,871
Maren, how are you feeling?

575
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,946
Uh, honestly, I don't know.

576
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:39,949
I thought I was doing this so that
I could see my daughter's face,

577
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,921
but I don't think I am.

578
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,887
I think I want her to see mine.

579
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:51,495
I want her to see me seeing her

580
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:58,898
being proud and growing up
and falling down, being scared.

581
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,796
I want her to know,

582
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,235
<i>all her life,</i>

583
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,944
that she's seen.

584
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,950
The tumor is responding.

585
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,167
Hey.

586
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,436
Is this seat taken?

587
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,214
You know, we're doing
everything we can for Miguel,

588
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,952
and the others. Thank you.

589
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,216
What's that?

590
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:57,890
A <i>santo.</i>

591
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:03,396
After Maria, our house
was just mud and water,

592
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,670
and the trunk of a huge tree
where my bedroom once stood.

593
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,339
I went to a <i>santero</i> in town
and asked him to carve this

594
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,488
from the wood of that tree.

595
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,906
As a reminder? No, no.

596
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,980
There are many
<i>santo</i> on the island.

597
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:19,818
This one is Anima
Sola, the Lonely Soul.

598
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,756
She is in purgatory,
bound to the flames forever.

599
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,321
And I pray to her for
strength and patience,

600
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,818
and redemption.

601
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,394
Why redemption?

602
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:32,887
I, um...

603
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,663
I liked to drink. Too much.

604
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,602
And I could not stop.

605
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,036
And I would be
dead if not for her.

606
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,067
She helps me to say no.

607
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,445
She reminds me to
always think of tomorrow.

608
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48,741
She keeps me alive.

609
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,080
And yet you work on a vineyard,

610
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,584
surrounded by
temptation every day.

611
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,018
Miguel helps me with that.

612
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:58,241
Never lets the others tempt
me with the angel's share.

613
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,690
"Angel's share"?

614
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:03,593
In the barrels, the top
layer of wine, it evaporates.

615
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,075
They call that
the angel's share.

616
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,455
I like that.

617
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,925
So do all my
friends. Believe me.

618
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,027
And all the other workers.

619
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:15,472
At the end of a shift, they
would dip into the crush and drink.

620
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,599
After the way they treated us,

621
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,911
they felt like they
deserved a little taste.

622
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,576
Well, I'm sure the
angels would agree.

623
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:33,815
Blood pressure 60 over palp.

624
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,723
Then he's fading
fast. Add dobutamine.

625
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,228
Ten micrograms per minute.

626
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,661
It's odd that his
heart rate is 78.

627
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:41,131
It should be 178. The
antivirals aren't working.

628
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,058
Mariana! Mariana, hang
a bag of streptomycin!

629
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,628
Wait, no, no, no! Don't. The
hantavirus is affecting his heart!

630
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,270
He needs a pacing wire.
He needs streptomycin, okay?

631
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:52,971
I don't have time to explain.
Do you trust me or not?

632
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,282
I am setting up a pacing wire.

633
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,960
Lauren, you open this door!

634
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:12,924
Lauren! What are you
doing? Don't do this!

635
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,527
Call Dr. Goodwin.

636
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,844
Ready?

637
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,512
Come here.

638
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,980
Here we go.

639
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,188
Mommy, will you
be able to see me?

640
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,460
- Well, I hope so, honey.
- Almost there.

641
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,416
What do you see, Mrs. Thompson?

642
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:07,909
Mommy?

643
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,259
It's okay, baby.

644
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,237
Because in my head
and my heart, I see you

645
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,265
so clearly, okay?

646
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,432
I see you perfectly.

647
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,107
I don't understand.

648
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:34,240
I thought you said
it was gonna work.

649
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,146
The tumors were destroyed.

650
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,914
Surgery should have worked.

651
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,153
There must be
something we missed.

652
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,106
Miguel Arroyo is stable.

653
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,767
Let's treat the others for
oropharyngeal tularemia.

654
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,339
They got it from drinking
partially fermented wine

655
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,676
right out of the barrels.

656
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,011
That's why Ivan never
showed signs of illness.

657
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,478
He's sober.

658
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,989
You know, you and I
working together like this...

659
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,592
It's not gonna work.

660
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:28,957
You're right.

661
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,473
Hey, how was your
radiation treatment?

662
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,175
Mmm, like a relaxing
vacation at Chernobyl.

663
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,302
Right.

664
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,380
Henry, hi.

665
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,184
Um, if this is about the exit
paperwork, I was about to get to it.

666
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,119
Yeah, good. Great, okay.

667
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,617
Don't get to it.

668
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,284
Excuse me?

669
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,556
Because you're not exiting.

670
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,643
Can I tell him because
of your whole throat thing?

671
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,636
Could I stop you
if I wanted to? No.

672
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,169
Okay, I am

673
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,000
very happy to tell you that
we, here at New Amsterdam,

674
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:12,237
would officially
like to offer you

675
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,745
the brand-new position
of Chair of Telemedicine.

676
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,041
"Telemedicine"? MAX:
Video conferencing.

677
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:22,081
We can reach our sister hospitals
in Latin America, disaster sites,

678
00:35:22,187 --> 00:35:23,397
war zones, all around the world.

679
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,583
Yeah, all in need of
experienced doctors like you

680
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,919
to help guide and consult them

681
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:28,653
through complicated surgeries.

682
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,719
Surgeries that you've
done hundreds of times.

683
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,092
Thank you.

684
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:43,007
It's your experience that's
irreplaceable, not your hands.

685
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,741
I just don't see anything.

686
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,110
May I touch your face to
perform an examination?

687
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,244
Yeah, that's fine.

688
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,453
Please close your eyes. Mmm.

689
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,360
I would like to try latanoprost.

690
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:06,856
That's...

691
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,397
What's wrong?

692
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,564
Your eyes are harder
than they should be.

693
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,936
This indicates glaucoma
might have developed.

694
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,973
But there is no way you
would have ever known about it.

695
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,603
There's always a catch, right?

696
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,148
Please lean your
head back for me.

697
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:31,746
Yeah.

698
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,984
Blink.

699
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,816
Oh, that's a beautiful
drawing, baby.

700
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,046
Yeah.

701
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,517
Oh!

702
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,722
Can you see us? Yes,
my love, I can see you.

703
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:49,198
Can you see me? I can see you.

704
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:50,628
You can?

705
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,331
I can see.

706
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:05,513
It turns out being Dr. Merritt
does have its advantages.

707
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,649
Come here. Ohh!

708
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,492
I see you.

709
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,857
Retractor.

710
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:31,866
Hey.

711
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,537
Oh. Looks like
someone's feeling better.

712
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,677
No, don't thank me.

713
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,683
Thank your brother
and his <i>santo.</i>

714
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:43,915
She told me the answer.

715
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:46,116
El Anima Sola? Yes.

716
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,857
You two are really
lucky to have each other.

717
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,890
I don't really get along
with my real sister.

718
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,864
But what you two have,

719
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,032
you're gonna rebuild.

720
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,462
I know it.

721
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,106
Here. Please, for you.

722
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:08,412
No, I can't... Yes,
yes, yes. I insist.

723
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:13,551
My brother, he will take care of me,
and Anima Sola, she will take care of you.

724
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:20,816
Thank you.

725
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,334
Max?

726
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:44,005
What's wrong?

727
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,145
I've...

728
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,418
I've been round and
round in my head,

729
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,859
but I can't see that
there's any other way.

730
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,619
Helen?

731
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,465
This is harder than I thought.

732
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,771
I think that I need to report
an impaired physician.

733
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,674
No, we already
took care of it. Max...

734
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,941
I'm talking about Bloom.

735
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,986
Babe, is that you? Yeah.

736
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,360
Hey. Hi.

737
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:39,563
How is the guy who's not about
to let cancer slow him down?

738
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,008
Profoundly humbled.

739
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:50,712
I made dinner.

740
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,051
Steak, baked
potato and broccoli.

741
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,646
Wow.

742
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,259
Chemo?

743
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,165
Radiation.

744
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,670
My throat, it's already... Babe.

745
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:22,241
Helen said that I wouldn't
even feel it for four to five days.

746
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:24,111
Well, you really are special.

747
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,410
So special.

748
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,012
It smells...

749
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,111
It smells amazing.

750
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,192
Sorry. Hey.

751
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,727
You've got nothing
to be sorry about.

752
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,761
Maybe you should put
me in the return pile.

753
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,291
Nope.

754
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:47,297
You are a keeper.

755
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,245
Stay there.
