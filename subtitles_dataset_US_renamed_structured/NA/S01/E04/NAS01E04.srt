1
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,125
<i>Hello, my old heart</i>

2
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,558
<i>How have you been?</i>

3
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:38,035
<i>Are you still there
inside my chest?</i>

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,971
<i>I've been so worried</i>

5
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,408
<i>You've been so still</i>

6
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,948
<i>Barely beating at all</i>

7
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,243
<i>Oh</i>

8
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,379
<i>Don't leave me here alone</i>

9
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,258
<i>Don't tell me that we've
grown for having loved</i>

10
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,226
<i>A little while</i>

11
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,559
<i>Oh</i>

12
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,064
<i>I don't wanna be alone</i>

13
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,431
<i>I wanna find a home</i>

14
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,329
<i>And I wanna share it with you</i>

15
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,667
Good morning...

16
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,742
A cruel person wrote these.

17
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,637
A cruel person is gonna
put you back in bed.

18
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,088
Do you remember how much I
loved this bed when we got it?

19
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,180
I do. Hmm.

20
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,456
Now I want to set it on
fire and laugh while it burns.

21
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,996
That sounds dangerous,
and bed rest is important.

22
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,759
It prevents the cervix
from... From having a life.

23
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,266
Max, my cervix is so bored.

24
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,704
Thank you for doing this.

25
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,633
All of it.

26
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,871
How's the couch?

27
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,009
Really good. Hmm?

28
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,399
Yeah, it's a little bit better
than the bed, to be honest.

29
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,823
I want to be ready, Max.

30
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,224
I want to want you back.

31
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,829
I'm just... I'm not...

32
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,066
I got all the time in the world.

33
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,246
<i>I'm all right today</i>

34
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,049
<i>You gonna find a way to cross</i>

35
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,021
<i>And you gonna get there</i>

36
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,088
<i>And I'm on fire today</i>

37
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,862
<i>Ain't no water here to
calm or even put me out</i>

38
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,500
<i>I'll find a better way</i>

39
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,004
<i>Am I crazy, or the wind
is gonna blow me down?</i>

40
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,510
Do you mind if I ask how
long your foot's been hurting?

41
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,938
It's nothing. I'm fine.

42
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,379
I'm a doctor at New Amsterdam
right across the street.

43
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,532
Maybe you could take a walk
with me. I could have a look at that.

44
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,922
Maybe you could leave me alone.

45
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,726
Your foot is badly infected.

46
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,238
If you don't do something
about it, it's gonna get a lot worse.

47
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,560
Can you get away from me?

48
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,070
I love soil. Do you
want to know why?

49
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,937
I am at the edge of
my metaphorical seat.

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,107
Because it contains
<i>Mycobacterium vaccae,</i>

51
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,336
which has been proven to
promote serotonin production,

52
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,387
which acts as a
natural antidepressant.

53
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,389
So does that hat.

54
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,422
Can't bring me down,
my friend. Not today.

55
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,653
The HCC has funded my proposal.

56
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,722
After two years, they funded it!

57
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,098
For the community
garden? Yes, exactly.

58
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,642
You know, horticultural therapy

59
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,794
dates back to ancient
Mesopotamia, and, uh...

60
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,113
Oh, my gosh, are those your
little homemade Indian donuts?

61
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,572
They are not donuts.
They are laddus.

62
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,267
Well, I don't mind if I "laddu."

63
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,403
They are not for you.
They are for someone else.

64
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,386
Not the girl from the
coffee shop, though?

65
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,314
Her name is Ella.

66
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,352
It's my gesture of gratitude for
someone who showed me kindness.

67
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,963
Mmm-hmm. Okay, let
me see if I got this straight.

68
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,265
You're gonna give pastries to
someone who works in a pastry shop.

69
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,487
Laddus are not pastries.
They are sweets. Oh.

70
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,986
Well, that doesn't
make it any less weird.

71
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:32,829
Gladys?

72
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,039
Gladys, what is this?

73
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,510
Volt Cola swag. A gift
from the new sponsor.

74
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,275
What new sponsor? For
your community garden.

75
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,160
Bloom? What's the urgent page?

76
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,955
Uh, got an EMS notification
asking to have thoracic standing by.

77
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,163
You okay? Headache.

78
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,970
45-year-old man, acute
onset tearing chest pain.

79
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,170
Heart rate 110, 140 over 56, right
arm, 100 over palp, left. Respiration's 18.

80
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,145
Gave him nitro...
Dissecting aortic aneurysm.

81
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,039
Mateo?

82
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,344
Hope you're on your
game today, Floyd.

83
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,720
Who's... Mateo Fernandez.

84
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,155
The cardiothoracic from Baptist?

85
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,388
Yeah. Isn't this week...

86
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,760
Yeah. Hey, get
Max down here now.

87
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,921
Oh.

88
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,659
Okay, as I fit you for
the radiation mask,

89
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,001
remember you have
to keep absolutely still.

90
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,532
I always found stillness to be a
highly overrated human ability.

91
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:43,668
Consider it practice

92
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,869
for when we aim high
energy external beam radiation

93
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,882
at the cancer in your throat.

94
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,509
If you move then, you die.

95
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:56,348
Has anyone ever told you you would
make a great James Bond villain?

96
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,525
Uh, Max, you cannot move.

97
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,783
Right.

98
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,791
So, uh, come here often?

99
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,033
That includes your
mouth. All of it? Because...

100
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,093
Do I have to remind you that
you need a throat to make jokes?

101
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:15,632
Relax.

102
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,775
You can close
your eyes if you like.

103
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,137
Stay still, Max.

104
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,446
Done.

105
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,319
I think it's fair to say

106
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,725
that was torture for both of us.

107
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,261
If my cancer gets anyone
else killed besides me,

108
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,131
then I'm really gonna be upset.

109
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,399
I got the 911.

110
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,839
This week's the annual conference of
cardiothoracic surgeons in San Diego.

111
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,741
Everyone goes. All of
my attendings are there.

112
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,936
One unlucky surgeon stays
behind at each hospital to cover.

113
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,811
It's me here, it's
Fernandez at Baptist,

114
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,111
but only one of us has a
dissecting aortic aneurysm.

115
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,013
And since he's here, I'm
guessing no one's covering Baptist.

116
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,131
They still have general
surgeons, transplant surgeons.

117
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,623
Yeah, they can't
cover for Fernandez.

118
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,159
You want a gynecologist
tagging in on your heart surgery?

119
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,457
How can Baptist run their hospital
without a cardiothoracic surgeon?

120
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,111
They can't. Which means they're
no longer a level-one trauma center.

121
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,128
Without cardiothoracic backup,
they can't treat myocardial infarctions,

122
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,764
car accidents, GSWs...
They can't accept ambulances.

123
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,185
Guys, we're gonna have to pick
up Baptist's full ambulance load.

124
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,507
I knew you were gonna say that.

125
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,688
They'd do it for us. Would they?

126
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,957
We're short-staffed too. What
about their network hospitals?

127
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,981
They'll pick up the elective admits,
but emergency patients will die waiting

128
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,097
in cross-town traffic.
We're the closest. It's on us.

129
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,314
You really think we can

130
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,016
shoulder their full ED plus all
the cardiothoracic surgeries?

131
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,668
Just the ones that
need to be done today.

132
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,716
Yeah, just those.

133
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:40,850
Guys, this is what we do.

134
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,156
We help everyone.

135
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,796
Floyd, I trust you and I believe
in you, so I am only gonna do this

136
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,299
if you tell me
you can handle it.

137
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,960
I can handle it. Okay, good,

138
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,147
because if something goes
wrong, we are both on the hook.

139
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,970
Nothing will go wrong,
all right? I'll make sure of it.

140
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,468
Okay.

141
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,080
Bloom, we're gonna live or
die today based on our ED load.

142
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,490
So, any doc or nurse standing
still in any part of this hospital

143
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:11,901
needs to go down and pitch in.

144
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,826
I'll take it. I
already hear sirens,

145
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,972
so unfortunately, you're gonna have
to miss the rest of my big pep talk.

146
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,020
Aw, so sad.

147
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,929
Iggy, psych wait
times are the longest,

148
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,672
so make sure you get your patients
up to your ward early and often.

149
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,821
All right. Good thing psych
patients are so compliant.

150
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,149
Kapoor, neurology wait times are second,
so I need you to move double time today.

151
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,267
This is my double time. Noted.

152
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,368
Sharpe. This is a bad idea.

153
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,389
So is sending every
cardiothoracic surgeon in America

154
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,523
to San Diego at the same time,

155
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,175
but they do it every year.

156
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,582
Last year was Barcelona.
I do love sangria.

157
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,381
This is a bad idea.
So, are you telling me

158
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,198
that you wouldn't have
taken the extra patients?

159
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,520
No, I wouldn't have.

160
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,786
I try to make
things simple, easy.

161
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,960
You know, like a
normal person. Ah.

162
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,289
Why do you keep choosing the
hardest road at every opportunity?

163
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,191
Better views?

164
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,965
Tall person, how long have
you been with Reynolds?

165
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,908
Three years. And
it's Nottingham.

166
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,276
I'm a PGY-6, so...
Okay, today is not the day

167
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,339
where I'm gonna be polite
and remember your names.

168
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,775
When patients come in,
I'm gonna point and yell.

169
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,647
Don't take it personally.
You move on my orders only.

170
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,261
What'd you bring
us? Adaline Simon.

171
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,799
53-year-old female, had a
pleurodesis on the books at Baptist.

172
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,299
Tall person, take Mrs. Simon to any
empty bed and get her prepped for surgery.

173
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,269
This is Mr. Gold, 47-year-old
male in need of a VATS procedure.

174
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,969
Casey and brown-haired
woman. Any open bay.

175
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,797
Name is Sherry Fletcher.
68-year-old female.

176
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,085
She requires a mediastinoscopy.

177
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,006
Stay with me. Okay,
let's get her inside.

178
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,847
Okay, put Mrs.
Fletcher in bay 23.

179
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,185
Has anybody seen my ibuprofen?

180
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,968
Tell a nurse to grab
you a bottle from the...

181
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,952
What I need is for people
to stop taking my stuff.

182
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:58,855
Incoming!

183
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,503
Rib spreader. Rib spreader.

184
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,266
Fair warning. This
is being recorded

185
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,537
so that Dr. Fernandez can see
my technique when he's awake.

186
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,678
Um...

187
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:16,716
Dr. Reynolds? Uh...
Dr. Bloom asked me to, um...

188
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,848
Start with the
subject, then the verb,

189
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,633
and see where the
sentence goes from there.

190
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,783
The cases from Baptist
are crowding the ED.

191
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,349
There's a pleurodesis.

192
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,270
With your permission, I
was thinking I could grab

193
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,490
a general attending to
supervise and handle it myself.

194
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,226
Appreciate the enthusiasm, but
prep the patient and wait for me.

195
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,977
It's just the ED's awfully full,

196
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,367
and I really think
I can help out.

197
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,749
You have a very
promising future.

198
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,691
I don't want you in over your head
when I'm too busy to bail you out.

199
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,003
A mistake like that can
derail your entire career,

200
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,171
so go ahead and prep the patient,
and I'll get there when I'm done.

201
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,806
Yes, sir.

202
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,875
Thank you.

203
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,552
Baptist's surgeons are on a
flight back from San Diego.

204
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,851
It lands in five hours.
You got this, right?

205
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,358
Do I have a choice?

206
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,360
I could warp the
space-time continuum.

207
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,363
Hey, what patient is that for?

208
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,823
Homeless woman outside.

209
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,575
You couldn't find a
patient inside to help?

210
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,034
If I don't help her, she's
gonna lose her foot.

211
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,393
Send an intern.

212
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,598
She's skeptical of doctors and so
am I, so we have an understanding.

213
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,072
I'll be back in five
minutes. What?

214
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,537
Sorry, Doc!

215
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,917
You and Ella have an
asymmetric power structure.

216
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,077
Giving her a gift
can be misinterpreted

217
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:30,214
as a deliberate extraction of
reciprocal favors, sexual or otherwise.

218
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,952
I see you talked to Dr. Frome.

219
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,692
Mrs. Monaghan, I am
Dr. Vijay Kapoor and this is Dr...

220
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,788
Kao. Dr. Kao.

221
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,035
I'm dizzy. I'm so
sorry to hear that.

222
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,228
Dizzy can be awful.

223
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,934
Can you explain to me
what do you mean by "dizzy"?

224
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,100
You don't know "dizzy"?

225
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:54,111
I do, I do, but I also know that it
means different things to different people.

226
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,816
Well, at Baptist, they
understand dizzy.

227
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,375
That may be true, but
here in New Amsterdam,

228
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,547
I want you to think about what
exactly "dizzy" means to you.

229
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,424
It means "dizzy."

230
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,597
The good news is that
your CT scans are negative

231
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,223
and preliminary
lab tests all look fine.

232
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,395
She's a good
doctor. Yes, she is.

233
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,904
So, while I examine
my other patients,

234
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:22,500
I want you to think
about your kind of dizzy.

235
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,633
Tell me you're
admitting "dizzy chick."

236
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,250
I cannot admit anyone
without a proper diagnosis,

237
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,179
and I don't have any yet.

238
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,399
Maybe we should make it
a multiple-choice question.

239
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,484
We cannot give her choices.
It will influence her answers.

240
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,188
We just need to know
what "dizzy" means to her,

241
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,197
and we will get our diagnosis.

242
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,294
So then I call HCC,

243
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,080
and they say I take the
money from Volt Cola

244
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,436
or I can kiss my garden goodbye.

245
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,866
More than half of the sugar kids
consume comes directly from soda.

246
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,102
I know.

247
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,202
Volt Cola spend millions
each year to defeat

248
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,713
public health legislation
that could actually help.

249
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,107
I know.

250
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,761
So, unless you want to hurry along
the epidemic of childhood obesity,

251
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,545
then there's no way
you can take their money.

252
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:08,981
I know. Great.

253
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,321
Now you can focus on the
epidemic of overcrowding in my ED.

254
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:17,623
Your psych patients are in bays
two, eight, rooms 12, 22 and 28.

255
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,466
Get them out of
here. Okey-doke, Doc.

256
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,865
Okay, I'm just gonna check

257
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,731
if the numbing medication
has worked, Tianna.

258
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:27,897
Can you feel this?

259
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,305
No. How about this?

260
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,536
Mmm-mmm.

261
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,737
She was in pain,
so we called 911.

262
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,177
We didn't want to
take any chances.

263
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,217
Should we have just
driven her to Baptist?

264
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,597
No, no. You did the right thing.

265
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,732
I've read Tianna's
file. I'm all caught up.

266
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,549
Mommy, you're not
watching. I am, sweetheart.

267
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,391
Oh, don't move, Tianna.

268
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,568
I'm just gathering the cells

269
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,527
I need for the biopsy right now.

270
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,063
Those are gonna tell
you if my cancer's back?

271
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,491
That's right.

272
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,431
What's it like when you die?

273
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,707
Baby, you don't
need to know that.

274
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,949
That's not gonna happen
for a long, long time.

275
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,750
All right, baby girl?

276
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,883
Right, Dr. Sharpe?

277
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,691
Do you want the elephant
or the tiger Band-Aid?

278
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,017
Nobody tells me anything.

279
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,535
Miss me? Nope, nope, nope, nope.

280
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,544
I can't afford your
help! My help is free.

281
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,542
Not taking it is gonna
cost you your foot,

282
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,050
so either way, you're
gonna have to deal with me.

283
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,254
You're relentless.

284
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,548
I'm Max.

285
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,493
I'm Faye. It's nice
to meet you, Faye.

286
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:02,898
Okay, take one of these a
day until the bottle is gone.

287
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,731
I have to go, but, uh, I'll
come back to check on you.

288
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,940
I have a brother
who's very sick.

289
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,818
He won't go to the hospital.

290
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,989
Can you help him too?

291
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,524
I have a hospital full of
patients who need me.

292
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,538
How can I help?

293
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:59,382
Faye, I really can't go
far. We're close. I promise.

294
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,992
You have to see him.

295
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,397
This way.

296
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,297
Hey, how much longer?
I'm backing up downstairs.

297
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,865
I'm holding this
man's aorta together

298
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,967
with string and Scotch tape.
I'm doing everything I can.

299
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,654
Well, your seven surgeries
waiting in my ED would disagree.

300
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,156
Take it up with Max.

301
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,920
I would if I could find him.

302
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,110
I'm going as fast as I can.

303
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,445
I'm the only
cardiothoracic here.

304
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,844
Well, what about
one of your residents?

305
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,700
I mean, the tall one
looked semi-competent.

306
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,829
Nottingham and, look,
for all these patients,

307
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,498
this is the scariest
day of their lives.

308
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,319
They woke up needing major surgery,
then they were thrown into an ambulance

309
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,488
and dragged across town so
that a doctor they don't know

310
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,775
can cut open their hearts.

311
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,438
They're trusting me, just
like Max is trusting me.

312
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,160
And I'm not putting
that kind of pressure on

313
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,995
a first-year resident
straight out of med school.

314
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,459
Oh, we got a bleeder.

315
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,586
Are the patients
downstairs stable?

316
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,419
Yeah. Then they can wait.

317
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,437
I am giving you one hour and then I
am sending them somewhere else.

318
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,621
All right, here we go.

319
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,457
Suction.

320
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,395
Mrs. Monaghan, can you
describe your symptoms now?

321
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,594
Dizzy!

322
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,273
Are you even a real doctor?

323
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,204
Yes, and I'm trying to help you.

324
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,309
Good, then give me something
for dizzy so I can go home.

325
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,447
I would love to do that, but I want
to give you the right something.

326
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,551
I'll give you more time. You...

327
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,890
She's gonna be here all day.

328
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:43,623
Maybe, but fast and wrong is not
a service to her or to anyone else.

329
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,969
Dr. Bloom? What
are you looking for?

330
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,067
Are you, uh, getting
her out of my ED?

331
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,001
Not as yet.

332
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,156
Can you get some other patients
out of here? Something's gotta give.

333
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,576
Oh, and you should
totally give Ella your pastry.

334
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,147
So, you do understand it
was a harmless gesture.

335
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,533
Oh, I think it's a huge mistake,

336
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,748
but I want to see you suffer.

337
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,786
Oh!

338
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,360
Laddus are not pastries!

339
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,289
It's like my
college sit-in days.

340
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,924
Every chair occupied, so
people just lie on the floor.

341
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,002
Almost on tilt and
four hours to go.

342
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,300
Go steal the chemo
chairs from onc.

343
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,768
Oh.

344
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:34,837
Grab and go. Also like
my college days. On it.

345
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,187
Jemma. Jemma, wait. Hey.
Whoa, whoa. Are you okay?

346
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,694
No, I'm not okay.
None of this is okay.

347
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,889
Jemma, hang on. We're
trying our best here.

348
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,564
Okay? It's an uphill battle.

349
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,890
What?

350
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,728
What's this? What's
happening here?

351
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,168
Transfers from the ED.

352
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,331
No, no. Uh-uh. No. No vacancies.

353
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,897
We're all full up. So is the ED.

354
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,235
I'm not their safety valve.

355
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,805
All right, let's go. I just...

356
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:06,877
Yeah, come in.

357
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,312
This is exactly why we
needed the community garden.

358
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,048
What happened to the
garden? I have to kill it.

359
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,210
You have been wanting
that garden for years.

360
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,585
Yeah, just not with
Volt Cola attached.

361
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,218
In India, Volt Cola builds
playgrounds, football fields,

362
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,919
cricket pitches
for kids to play on.

363
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,929
Which means land,
which takes money.

364
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,226
Would a garden make a
difference to these kids too?

365
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:27,991
Yeah.

366
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,594
Yeah, it would.

367
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,573
Tianna's cancer's back.

368
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,441
Ewing's sarcoma.

369
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,716
It's extremely aggressive.

370
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,522
I'm very sorry.

371
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,757
What about something
experimental?

372
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,637
Unfortunately, there are no
clinical trials for kids her age.

373
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,966
There has to be
more out there. Uh...

374
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,899
Other countries.

375
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,105
Um...

376
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,737
There has to be something else.

377
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,613
I think

378
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,492
that we should discuss
palliative care options.

379
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,662
How do we tell her? We don't.

380
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,263
We can't.

381
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,068
Tianna is smart.

382
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,106
She is asking questions.
She is looking for answers.

383
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,781
The best course
of... I can't tell her.

384
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:54,745
Can you?

385
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,777
Who are you? What'd
you bring this guy here for?

386
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,633
He's a doctor and
his name is Max.

387
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,202
You brought a
doctor to our house?

388
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,602
Hey, hey, hey. He can help.

389
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,912
We don't need his kind of help.

390
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,766
Give him a chance, Paul.

391
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,173
Just...

392
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:26,777
It's okay.

393
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,891
Where are you from?

394
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,529
Are you from the Midwest?

395
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,469
Hamilton, Ohio. Born and raised.

396
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,895
Why?

397
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,572
Vance, you may
have a fungal infection,

398
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,738
and if it's the kind
that I think it is,

399
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,359
we need to get you into
New Amsterdam right now.

400
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,376
No, man. No hospital.

401
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,330
All right, what you got to do
now is just get the hell out of here.

402
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,965
I don't know what you
have against hospitals,

403
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,754
but if we don't take your brother
to New Amsterdam right now,

404
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:07,883
he is going to die.

405
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,656
That's exactly what the other
doctors said when Mom was sick.

406
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,057
Except rather than help,
they just kept bringing bills.

407
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,901
We lost our apartment.

408
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,993
The debt collectors
took the rest.

409
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:23,732
I promise you will never see a
single bill from New Amsterdam.

410
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,509
What do you say, Vance?

411
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,716
I took a gamble on you coming
here, leaving my own hospital.

412
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,164
You want to take a gamble on me?

413
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,585
Go away, man.

414
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,087
You heard him.

415
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,521
Get out of here.

416
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,446
The graft's pulling
taut. It's too damn small.

417
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,088
What?

418
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,001
Everyone is prepped,
so I thought I'd scrub in.

419
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,087
No.

420
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,624
I've watched you do
this surgery four times.

421
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,812
I know to ligate the internal mammary
before transecting the intercostal.

422
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:24,895
I know...

423
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,599
I don't need you in here.
I need you out there.

424
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,830
Go!

425
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,102
Suture.

426
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,335
Suture.

427
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:43,415
Excuse me.

428
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,818
Excuse me! That is my chair!

429
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,654
I said I ain't moving.

430
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,792
You're not the only
dumbass that needs space!

431
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,298
Fight, fight, fight!

432
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,273
Thanks. Over there. Not now.

433
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,307
Goodwin! Where the
hell have you been?

434
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,383
It's like a damn
MASH unit in here.

435
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,551
Dean, I had to take...
What were you thinking?

436
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,620
Bloom, get all the department
heads down here. Now.

437
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,054
Here you go, Doctor.

438
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,332
Okay, I'll make
this quick and clear.

439
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:34,195
I screwed up. All
this chaos, it's on me.

440
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,426
I overcommitted us and
then went out looking for more.

441
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,636
I thought I could help everyone
and ended up helping no one.

442
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,725
I'm not asking for
understanding or forgiveness,

443
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,679
but I am asking you
to help me fix this.

444
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,383
So, here's the plan.

445
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,978
Reynolds, I am sorry that I
put so much pressure on you.

446
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,318
How can I take some of it off?

447
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,590
Are any of the surgeries
waiting in the ED stable enough

448
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:54,750
<i>to go to Mount Zion?</i> Two.

449
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,056
I'll send them. Bloom,
anywhere there's an open bed,

450
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,063
admit a patient to it.
Admit everyone you can.

451
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,599
And what if we don't get
reimbursed for the beds?

452
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,362
I'll send Baptist
the bill. Iggy.

453
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,663
Captain? Take your
patients to the cafeteria,

454
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,902
to the roof, for a walk. Anywhere to
keep them busy and out of the ward.

455
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,537
Aye-aye. Sharpe.

456
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,238
I know what I have to
do. Great. Any questions?

457
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:18,378
Any questions not about
Kapoor's laddu situation?

458
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:19,843
No. Go.

459
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,859
Max, I don't know how
you're gonna pull this off.

460
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,629
We are all gonna work together.

461
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,423
Including you.

462
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,565
I could really use
your help, Dr. Fulton.

463
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:47,204
The flat metal part goes
on the patient's chest.

464
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,757
How are you holding up?

465
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,600
I thought getting the news
would be the hard part,

466
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,802
but telling Tianna's a
million times harder.

467
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,838
You shouldn't have to.

468
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,276
You be her mum.

469
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,106
I'll be her doctor.

470
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,611
I'll tell her.

471
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,160
In for a little treat here.

472
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,788
Come on. Come on out.

473
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:40,956
Okay.

474
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,967
So, it's not a garden, but, uh, you
know, it's outside. It's fresh-air therapy.

475
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,998
We got a wonderful view
of the city, so, you know,

476
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,777
spread out, feel the space.
Find your own spot, all right?

477
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,146
Jemma, hi. What's
going on? Talk to me.

478
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,712
There's nothing to say.

479
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:05,349
Well, I heard that Blanca's
background check came through clean.

480
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,320
That's good news, right?

481
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:10,862
Yeah. Yeah.

482
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,194
But, like, the site visit
keeps getting pushed back.

483
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,536
It isn't for months. And
there's, like, 100 other things

484
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,834
that could go wrong
before I get out of here.

485
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:25,478
Hey. Are those facts
or those feelings?

486
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,703
It's feelings.

487
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,349
Right, they're feelings, so why
don't we try sticking to the facts?

488
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,648
Okay, I'll make
some phone calls.

489
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,251
We're gonna get you
the home you deserve.

490
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,514
I promise.

491
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,684
All right.

492
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,406
Dr. Frome?

493
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,625
Don't we have
wheelchairs for that?

494
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,752
They're all taken, but don't need one.
This is how we did it in Afghanistan.

495
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,922
My man right here's
on his way to X-ray.

496
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,262
Got a lateral malleolus
fracture playing indoor soccer,

497
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,846
but he's gonna be
fine. Right, Camden?

498
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,798
Did you take my
ibuprofen? Yeah. Thanks.

499
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,974
Ah, Dr. Kapoor. Oh, Dean.

500
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,285
Mrs. Monaghan has been
telling me a very interesting story.

501
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,882
How you don't seem to
understand the word "dizzy."

502
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,884
I do understand. Do you?

503
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,762
Do you see what I mean?

504
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,060
I should have walked
out of here an hour ago.

505
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,557
Why didn't you?

506
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,801
Because when I try to stand up,

507
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,803
I feel like I'm
going to fall over.

508
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,463
Like my feet aren't even there.

509
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:06,738
Mrs. Monaghan, you have
Guillain-Barre syndrome.

510
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,336
Excuse me?

511
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,775
The anti-bodies your
system made to fight your cold

512
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,679
are attacking the
nerves in your feet.

513
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,024
That's why you can't feel them.

514
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,854
I can now officially admit
you and get you taken care of.

515
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,329
Help! We... We need help!

516
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:33,468
Max... Max... Max
said he would help him.

517
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,767
Max? Max?

518
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,451
We've got an arterial bleed.

519
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,704
Ready an intubation tray

520
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,801
and page Max to Trauma One, now!

521
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,177
Max! Come on, stay
with us. Come on.

522
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:49,312
Class-one airway. Get
20 milligrams Etomidate

523
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,290
and 100 milligrams succinylcholine
and let's start a propofol drip.

524
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,628
Give me a 7.5 on
the hockey stick.

525
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,450
Seven point five
on the hockey stick.

526
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,830
I'm in.

527
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,317
Now we find the bleeder.

528
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,495
There it is.

529
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,381
The bleeding's coming
from that bronchiole.

530
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,566
Don't say it.

531
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,774
We need Reynolds.

532
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,042
Ah. Elbow deep
in a tricky closure.

533
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:49,411
A man's bleeding out in the ED.

534
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,592
Is this your idea of
relieving pressure?

535
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,561
I know, Floyd. I'm sorry. I
don't know what else to do.

536
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,696
I don't know who else to ask.

537
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,240
Well, I can't be in
two places at once.

538
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,085
Well, I hope you can figure out
how, or someone is going to die.

539
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,064
Thank you. - Clamp.

540
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:15,950
Blood pressure's dropping.

541
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,033
Push more fluid.

542
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,576
Got two liters open
wide. It's not enough.

543
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,940
Grab a bag of O-negative
out of the trauma fridge.

544
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:24,125
There's too much blood.
I can't see anything.

545
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:27,142
There's a pumper in there
somewhere. I just can't find it. Suction.

546
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:32,287
Will you get the Richardson
and lift up the middle lobe, please?

547
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,323
There it is. I got that bad boy.

548
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,428
Hey, Max, can you give
me a little light over here?

549
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,239
There we go. NURSE: It's ready.

550
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,433
Bleeding's stopped.

551
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,444
Heart rate's steady.
Oxygenation stabilizing.

552
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,279
Nice work, boys.

553
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,280
So, what, you just let Dr. Fernandez
just bleed out in the OR?

554
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,786
I left him in the hands
of a top-notch surgeon.

555
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,795
One more running suture.

556
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:14,852
Respiration is spontaneous.

557
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,100
- That should hold.
- All right!

558
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:44,155
Surgeons landed
at JFK an hour ago.

559
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,720
Baptist is up and running.

560
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,730
You did it, Max.

561
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,370
It was fun, being
back in the trenches.

562
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,297
And, Max...

563
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,007
Don't ever do that again.

564
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,177
Good news. Vance will
be in the ICU a few days,

565
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:12,656
then a course of pills, then
he should make a full recovery.

566
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,222
What was wrong with him?

567
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,491
Histoplasmosis. It's a fungal
infection we see in the soil around Ohio.

568
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,192
Must have been dormant
in Vance his whole life,

569
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,826
and I'm sure living on the streets
weakened his immune system.

570
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,603
The fungus reemerged, and
attacked his lungs and his liver.

571
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,998
I would like to test
you both as well.

572
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:32,370
We can't possibly
pay for all this.

573
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:36,173
You don't have to. This is
why public hospitals exist.

574
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:40,116
This is why I work here. This is
why all these doctors work here.

575
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:42,851
We don't say no to anyone.

576
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,613
We don't know how.

577
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,255
Thank you.

578
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,971
Casey, hydrate. Why?

579
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:04,805
Because water plays a vital
role in nearly every bodily function.

580
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,442
Mmm.

581
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,774
Ah, I needed that.

582
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,283
My ibuprofen wasn't ibuprofen.

583
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,640
It was Adderall.

584
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,112
That explains why I
thought I was covered in lice.

585
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,554
And my headache never went away.

586
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,321
I have ADHD. Listen,
you don't have to...

587
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,791
I've had it my whole life.

588
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,822
Adderall got me through med
school, through my residency.

589
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,570
I mean, I couldn't
do this job without it.

590
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,757
So, why do you keep it
in an ibuprofen bottle?

591
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,163
You're killing
yourself for this job.

592
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,399
Everyone here is.

593
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,602
Everyone looks sad.

594
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:46,007
Sweetheart, your cancer is back.

595
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,417
Tianna,

596
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,086
you asked what it's
like when you die.

597
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:02,491
I think that it's like this.

598
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,139
Come.

599
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,157
So, when it happens,

600
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:38,196
you won't be able to
see your mum and dad,

601
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,370
and they won't
be able to see you.

602
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,506
But they will always be there.

603
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,182
And I'll always be here?

604
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,843
Yes.

605
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,150
You'll never stop
thinking of each other.

606
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,326
You'll never stop
talking to each other.

607
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:09,528
You'll just be on a
different side of the room.

608
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,068
Mommy, can you hear me?

609
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:24,176
Yes, baby doll. We
can hear you, little one.

610
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,548
I can hear you too.

611
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,809
<i>Hello, my old heart</i>

612
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,447
<i>How have you been?</i>

613
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,278
<i>Are you still there
inside my chest?</i>

614
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,492
<i>I've been so worried</i>

615
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:14,624
<i>You've been so still,
barely beating at all</i>

616
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,593
You okay?

617
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,834
<i>Don't leave me here alone</i>

618
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:23,473
<i>Don't tell me how we grow</i>

619
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,767
I took the hard road.

620
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:29,572
And?

621
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,310
Better views.

622
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,511
<i>I wanna find a home</i>

623
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,145
<i>And I wanna share it with you</i>

624
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,867
<i>Hello, my old heart</i>

625
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,863
You know, my attending
wouldn't even let me look

626
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,364
in the OR the first three
months of my residency?

627
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,059
I can still hear him in my head.

628
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:26,834
"Reynolds, you're more likely
to cut yourself than the patient."

629
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,700
I don't know. Old
habits die hard, I guess.

630
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,169
Well, the difference is
you trained these residents.

631
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:38,544
Yeah, well, but, you know, if
something had gone wrong...

632
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,543
Okay, do you know what feels
even better than being in control?

633
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:45,550
Letting go of it.

634
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,407
Don't start what
you can't finish.

635
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,715
<i>Cold</i>

636
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:22,258
Well, on the bright side, I
can finally take up fencing.

637
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,761
<i>She glides away</i>

638
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,266
In a few weeks, we'll
start chemo in the mornings

639
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,029
and radiation at night.

640
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,968
By "a few weeks,"
you mean... Two.

641
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:34,596
'Cause sometimes
"a few" can mean...

642
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,730
Two. Right.

643
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:38,276
<i>Does she know that
we bleed the same?</i>

644
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,042
There's so much to do.

645
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,440
<i>Don't wanna cry,
but I break that way</i>

646
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,916
You're gonna have to prioritize.

647
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,284
You mean start saying no?

648
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,259
I mean start saying yes.

649
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:58,986
To you.

650
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,094
What do you need, Max?

651
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,518
<i>I</i>

652
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,617
<i>Have got a fear</i>

653
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,818
<i>Oh, in my blood</i>

654
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,359
<i>Cold</i>

655
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,494
<i>Sheets</i>

656
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,695
<i>Oh, where's my love</i>

657
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,138
<i>I am</i>

658
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,937
<i>Searching high</i>

659
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,804
<i>I'm searching low</i>

660
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:48,773
<i>In the night</i>

661
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:55,317
<i>Ooh, does she know
that we bleed the same?</i>

662
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:04,554
<i>Ooh, don't want to
cry, but I break that way</i>

663
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,331
<i>Did she run away,
did she run away?</i>

664
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,862
<i>I don't know</i>

665
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,635
<i>If she ran away, if she ran away</i>

666
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:24,376
<i>Come back home</i>

667
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,514
Max.

668
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:37,820
Hey.

669
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,191
It's 9:30. You're gonna be late.

670
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,533
No, I'm not.

671
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,597
Oh, my God. Did you get fired?

672
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,840
That was fast, even for you.

673
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,006
I'm taking the day off.

674
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:59,918
Thought I'd spend the day here,

675
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,013
with you.
