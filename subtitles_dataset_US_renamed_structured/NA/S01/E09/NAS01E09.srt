1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,768
I found a clinical trial.

2
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,109
Precision-targeted
immunotherapy.

3
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:13,141
It's led by Dr. Panthaki
at St. Simon's.

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,772
He's highly regarded.

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:18,041
And, unlike radiation and chemo,

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,610
it comes with no
debilitating side effects.

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,257
That sounds perfect.

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,451
It's exactly what he wanted.

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,825
All right. Dr. Sharpe
gets it done.

10
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,296
Which is the difference
between me and this trial.

11
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,229
Because precision
therapy might not work.

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,666
Your objection is noted. Again.

13
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,432
Yes, radiation
chemotherapy is challenging,

14
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,938
but it's... It's brutal.

15
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,498
It's hitting yourself with a
brick over and over again

16
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,908
and hoping the cancer
dies first. That's the point.

17
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,707
The cancer dies.

18
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,409
Radiation and chemotherapy work.

19
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,644
Precision therapy is like
gambling your life on a lottery ticket.

20
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,119
People said the same thing
about bone marrow transplants.

21
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,985
They also say it
about lottery tickets.

22
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,183
Enough.

23
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,826
Is this what you really want?

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,499
She's right.

25
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,041
Chemo and radiation, they work.

26
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,369
They do the job.

27
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,040
But they'll break me.

28
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:23,540
No matter how strong I
am. I'll lose my hearing.

29
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,518
My sight.

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,052
I'll lose my mind.

31
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,625
They don't always come back.

32
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,887
And I have so many things

33
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,454
that I need to do.

34
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,931
So let's get in the trial.

35
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,204
So let's get in the trial.

36
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,982
Uh, so? What?

37
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,390
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

38
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,538
You know what, an email would
have covered it, maybe even a text.

39
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,498
But now we're here in person
you should definitely be groveling.

40
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,727
Evie and I were up
all night. You stallion.

41
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,095
Fighting. Look, I'm not
trying to be a jerk here,

42
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,529
but telling Evie
that we used to...

43
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,062
I know. It wasn't cool.

44
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,835
I said I know.

45
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,342
What you should be
saying is, "I am sorry."

46
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,179
I am. I'm sorry.

47
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,005
You don't sound sorry.

48
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,574
Look, can we just not
have this be a thing, okay?

49
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,963
You know what, you're the one
who said that we can be friends.

50
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,456
This doesn't feel like friends.

51
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,959
Early morning
rush started early.

52
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,190
You got some nerve.

53
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,927
It's French vanilla.

54
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,797
Like hell it is.

55
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,631
Eh, maybe hazelnut?

56
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,535
You're mothering
me or babying me.

57
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,199
Whichever one it is, stop it.

58
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,275
Are you okay?
You're doing it again.

59
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,574
What do we got? This
is LaDavius Powell,

60
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,446
45-year-old man with new
onset right-side abdominal pain.

61
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,782
No meds, no past medical
history, allergic to Cephalkem.

62
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,320
Cephalkem? Fancy penicillin.

63
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,379
Bay 23, step lively. Cephalkem.

64
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,922
Sarah Madsen, 36-year-old
woman, found down on the sidewalk.

65
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:16,327
Unresponsive, hypotensive.
BP 90 over palp, heart rate 120.

66
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,830
Said New Amsterdam
was her hospital.

67
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,209
Okay, looks like previous heart
surgery. Find her medical records.

68
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,759
Drew this in the field.
Why is the blood so diluted?

69
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,304
No idea. No sign of bleeding.

70
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,599
The blood's gotta be going
somewhere. Page Dr. Sharpe.

71
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,518
We gotta get on this or
she's not gonna make it.

72
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,422
Maximus, today is one of those days
that makes it all worth it, you know?

73
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,023
It's one of those days you jump out of
bed excited because you just know...

74
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,484
It's gonna be one of those
days. Yes! Yes, in a big, big way.

75
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,452
Are you feeling it
too? I am feeling it.

76
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,065
I got a meeting with the nurses'
union about insurance and birth control.

77
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,752
So not so much. Nah, it'll
be good. What do you got?

78
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,554
Me, I have a transitioning
teen coming in with his parents.

79
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,528
And you know how society
is not kind to trans teens.

80
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,329
Bullying, cultural stigma, hate
crimes, which all leads to depression,

81
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,960
which way too often
leads to suicide...

82
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,527
Sorry, this is your happy day?

83
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,506
No, no, my happy day is what happens
when these kids get to feel heard.

84
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,770
Today I get to help somebody
find out who they are.

85
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,607
I get to help somebody
find their voice.

86
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,374
Happy day indeed. Indeed.

87
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,275
Yeah, so I'm good with
the whole voice thing,

88
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,817
like, got it, found it.

89
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,683
Fine with it. I've got
other issues here.

90
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,883
Oh.

91
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,623
Okay.

92
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,421
Uh, what are they?

93
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,124
Exhibit those. Parents.

94
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,456
All right.

95
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,863
Jillian, Grant?

96
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,601
Care to elaborate?

97
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:34,233
Well, Dr. Frome, Shay says
he's ready for top surgery.

98
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,239
But we... They
won't let me get it.

99
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,743
I mean, how's that
for withholding?

100
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,042
Shay, that's not fair.
We have concerns.

101
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,545
See, Doc?

102
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,616
Issues. I mean,

103
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,544
help me out here.

104
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,057
<i>Nuclear Medicine,
please call extension 29.</i>

105
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,825
We could do a
sit-in. At shift change.

106
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,727
Bigger. Picket HCC's offices.

107
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,198
Bigger. You want to keep
your birth control coverage?

108
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,026
Then kick 'em where it
hurts. Excuse me, Max,

109
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,245
can I have a word
please? All right.

110
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,430
Keep thinking.

111
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,563
Kick some ass for
the working class!

112
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,602
Did you hear from Dr. Panthaki?

113
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,234
No, this isn't about the trial.

114
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,542
Dr. Bloom asked me to
consult on a hematology patient.

115
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,744
Turns out that she was a heart
transplant recipient here, 27 years ago.

116
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,911
And?

117
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,917
Her file says that she received
her heart from a "Luna Goodwin."

118
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,923
Your sister.

119
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,727
She's fading fast.

120
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,430
We've already infused
two units of packed red cells

121
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,282
with a pressure bag but
she's still net negative.

122
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:42,765
I would give her a plasma expander,
but her hematocrit's already in the toilet.

123
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,654
I mean, that's just gonna
make it crash even more.

124
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,289
The usual
production-destruction algorithm

125
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,645
doesn't seem to apply to her.

126
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,659
Let's order up two more
units from the blood bank

127
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,323
and let's get a second
large bore IV line.

128
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,014
Give me a little
Trendelenburg. How can I help?

129
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,620
That's where all the blood
is going. Sarah's right thigh.

130
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,868
Why is she bleeding in the first
place? There's no localized source.

131
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,225
No cuts, lacerations,
blown arterial aneurysm?

132
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,657
No, every organ just
seems to be oozing blood.

133
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,995
Elevated PTT? It's barely
out of the normal range.

134
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,877
Yeah, but put that together
with why she's bleeding so much.

135
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,335
Acquired hemophilia?

136
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,380
Her clotting factor eight isn't
working. That's why she's bleeding.

137
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,771
Rare, but it would
explain it. That's good.

138
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,138
I'm really thirsty.

139
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,905
Uh, uh... She's thirsty. Can
we get her some water, nurse?

140
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,947
Ah, let's hold off on
that. Uh, Ms. Madsen, I...

141
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:23,006
I had a heart transplant. At
my last check-up my doctor said

142
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,813
that my cyclosporine
levels were low

143
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,829
and I've been worried that
my body's rejecting my heart.

144
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,065
Could that be causing this?
That wouldn't explain the bleeding.

145
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,684
But it might explain why the
bleeding's been making you so sick.

146
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,817
How sick am I?

147
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,862
I'm afraid acquired
hemophilia is quite serious.

148
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,419
But we're gonna fix it, okay?

149
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,374
Uh, nurses are gonna
take you up to ICU right now.

150
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,842
We're gonna start treatment
and you're gonna do great.

151
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,334
Thank you.

152
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,661
Are you okay?

153
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,799
Uh, once the bleeding is stabilized,
get me a transvenous heart biopsy.

154
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,706
Tell me everything
you can about that heart.

155
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,835
Max.

156
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,342
You type so fast!

157
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,748
Like Matthew
Broderick in <i>WarGames.</i>

158
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,754
No idea who or what that is.

159
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,058
Boom. Now you're on Twitter.

160
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,060
See? That's me right there.

161
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,497
@ShayMyName2018?

162
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,126
Yeah. Silly name, I know.

163
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,000
You have 27,000 followers?

164
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,973
Yeah. Crazy, right?

165
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,519
They've been following me since
the beginning of my transition.

166
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,069
It's a... It's a real
community. They support me.

167
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,808
Keep me real. I had no idea.

168
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,761
Yeah, they can't wait
for me to get top surgery.

169
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:33,947
Now we're just waiting for
Dr. Frome to, you know, do his thing.

170
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,521
You don't understand.
We love Shay.

171
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,390
We have been supportive of
his transition from the beginning.

172
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,089
The new haircut,
the new clothes.

173
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,927
Even the hormone blockers.

174
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,557
We never pushed back, not once.

175
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,068
But surgery? It's so permanent.

176
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,763
Well, you know, um...

177
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:55,569
Top surgery is the most common
gender-confirmation surgery for trans men.

178
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,373
Having a body that
doesn't reflect your gender...

179
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,107
That can be deeply unsettling.

180
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,876
Of course. We know.

181
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,577
It's just... Okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

182
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,950
He's not even old
enough to drive a car.

183
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,956
He's not old enough to
get into R-rated movies,

184
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:13,824
and he's not old enough to decide
on his own to get permanent surgery.

185
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,714
It's okay, it's okay. This is exactly
where we can talk about all of this.

186
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,958
So why don't you guys
tell me a little bit about Shay

187
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,661
before he came out?

188
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,628
It was hard.

189
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,134
He was anxious all the time.

190
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,306
Sometimes he had
trouble getting out of bed.

191
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,175
What about after he
started to socially transition?

192
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,711
He started smiling.

193
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,543
Making friends.

194
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,160
And when he started
the hormone blockers,

195
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,585
he said he felt like
himself for the first time.

196
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,951
Yeah.

197
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,120
My baby was 14, and he
had never felt like himself.

198
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,961
And we're grateful he does.

199
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,995
But when we said no to
surgery, you know what he did?

200
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,163
He threw a GoFundMe on Twitter

201
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,136
to ask his followers
to pay for it.

202
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,265
And they did.

203
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:05,073
We're proud that he is
a voice for a community.

204
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,379
But he's just a kid.

205
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,878
Our kid.

206
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,442
Please tell him
he can't do this.

207
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,352
All right, I understand
that you are overwhelmed.

208
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,855
But the positive changes
in Shay since transitioning

209
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,917
are undeniable.

210
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,826
And emotionally,

211
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,627
I gotta say, I think the
emotions that matter most here

212
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,929
are his. So...

213
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:31,768
I am going to approve a
medical evaluation for surgery.

214
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,875
My son has been
sober for a year.

215
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,816
Oh, that's terrific.

216
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,854
He has shown great strength.

217
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,080
More than I knew he had.

218
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,884
I should have had more faith.

219
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,950
It's never too late. Peanuts?

220
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:55,461
Barbecue or Tangy Fiesta?

221
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,962
Tangy Fiesta.

222
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,533
I would like to
give Rohan a gift.

223
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,802
Show my support. Yeah.

224
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:06,328
But recently my gifts have
been completely misunderstood.

225
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,171
I hear that, and families
see agendas in everything.

226
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,835
What you thinking?

227
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,503
An apartment.

228
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,639
Just a small one.
Nothing too fancy.

229
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,414
Yeah, you wouldn't want
to spoil him with a fancy one.

230
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,853
I have been a doctor
for the last 40 years.

231
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,253
I've had more money
than I know what to do with.

232
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,893
It's a beautiful idea.

233
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,861
Use your money to help
someone you care about.

234
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,090
What else is it for, right?

235
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,239
Hey. Hey. Thanks for coming.

236
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,177
Is that her? MAX: Mmm.

237
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,908
She had the transplant here.
She's been coming back ever since.

238
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,142
I didn't even know

239
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,413
Luna was an organ donor.

240
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:59,247
It probably wasn't the easiest
thing for your parents to talk about.

241
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,255
My parents didn't even
take me to the funeral.

242
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,090
They just kind of shut the door.

243
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,129
Hey.

244
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,071
Have you told her who you are?

245
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,134
No, she has enough on her mind.

246
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,679
It's not about me.

247
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,008
Isn't it?

248
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,677
Luna's heart

249
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,313
is beating.

250
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,980
Right over there.

251
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,853
And the amazing thing is,

252
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,617
she gets another chance.

253
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,953
Thirty years ago, the doctors
here let Luna's heart stop.

254
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,834
Not this time.

255
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,013
Hey. Uh, Evie.

256
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,308
Sorry to bother you.

257
00:11:56,082 --> 00:12:00,816
Slogging through the
madness of malpractice claims.

258
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,746
Oh, not my department, I hope.

259
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,723
I always hide the
bodies when I'm done.

260
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,522
I... That was not
even a little bit funny.

261
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,162
Okay, uh, listen.

262
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,833
The other day when I mentioned
that Reynolds and I, we...

263
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,104
We kind of had this, uh,

264
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,367
fling?

265
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,205
That was, uh...
That was bad form.

266
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,680
To bring that up. I mean,
I totally betrayed the

267
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,374
sisterhood of

268
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,677
sisters.

269
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,377
Or whatever.

270
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,179
I think you and Reynolds
are perfect for each other.

271
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,655
I mean, that's why I
introduced the two of you, so...

272
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,885
Let me bail you out here.
Oh, great, please hurry.

273
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,325
I know Floyd had
a life before me.

274
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,692
I'm glad he did.

275
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,697
I just need to know
if you two are over.

276
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,964
Oh! Oh, we're over.

277
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,968
We are the very
definition of over.

278
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,102
I like Floyd.

279
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,570
But I've made bad bets before.

280
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:58,435
So if you really are a card-carrying
member of the sisterhood of sisters,

281
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,381
you won't let me do it again.

282
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,717
Because I do not have time.

283
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,882
So are you and Floyd done?

284
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,480
Evie.

285
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,659
It is not something that you
have to worry about. Okay?

286
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:16,990
Then I won't.

287
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,424
Okay.

288
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,680
That looks fun.

289
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:43,189
This infusion replaces the clotting
factor that your body is destroying.

290
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,691
So you can just replace
it? It's that simple?

291
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,250
Unfortunately, it's
not simple at all.

292
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,762
Uh, but it's very doable.

293
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,993
It's been done
successfully many times.

294
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,699
We need to infuse the factor

295
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,512
at the exact same rate that
your body is destroying it,

296
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:58,801
which is an incredibly
difficult rate to find.

297
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,772
But again, doable.

298
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,538
Too much factor and
your blood will clot.

299
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,406
You could suffer a stroke.

300
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,912
Or a heart attack.

301
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,757
Too little and you could
start to bleed again.

302
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,548
Which we won't let happen. I'll be
doing a blood test called the PTT.

303
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,611
I'll be drawing it from the
central line every 20 minutes,

304
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,090
and then based on the results,
I will adjust the rate of infusion.

305
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,238
Will that take a long time?

306
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,159
Yes, it will. Hopefully not.

307
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,323
It's not something that
we can definitively know.

308
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,336
Yeah, but however
long it may take,

309
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,804
I will be here by your side

310
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,170
night and day

311
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,267
till we get it right.

312
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,674
Why me?

313
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,042
Excuse me?

314
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:43,273
Well, um, you're the Medical
Director of the entire hospital.

315
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,649
You're dropping
everything for me, Dr., uh...

316
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,218
Uh... Goodwin, Max.

317
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,315
Um...

318
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,154
Just an interesting case.

319
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,193
Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Sharpe.
Could I have a minute?

320
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,697
Excuse us.

321
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,932
I, uh, got the results
from Sarah's heart biopsy.

322
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,943
The heart muscle showed both
fibrosis and T-lymphocyte infiltration.

323
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,501
It's Grade 4.

324
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,103
Well, it doesn't get much worse.

325
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,705
Okay, so we up the
cyclosporine dose.

326
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,326
Why would we...
If we up the dose

327
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,728
and we add pulse steroids. And
we look for an anti T-cell agent...

328
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,015
That's out of the question.

329
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,955
Look, the stress from Sarah's
hemophilia has ravaged her heart.

330
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,822
So un-ravage it. I gave you a
whole cardio department, use it,

331
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,385
because we sure as hell
aren't going to just sit here

332
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,589
while... What? Max.

333
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,531
Luna's heart is dying.

334
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:37,896
It's gone.

335
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,869
That's my sister's heart.

336
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,236
We have to save it.

337
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,075
No.

338
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,947
We have to save Sarah.

339
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,095
And the only thing that's
gonna do that is a new heart.

340
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,714
Because the old
one is out of time.

341
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,330
The waiting list for heart
transplants isn't short,

342
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,835
but the good news
is you're at the top.

343
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,438
And priority goes to
the most severe cases

344
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,167
that can withstand a transplant.

345
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,571
Wow. That's, uh, great. Also...

346
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,543
Totally terrifying.

347
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,410
Right. So...

348
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,574
OTF gets us a heart,

349
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,674
we fix the hemophilia

350
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,945
and you walk out of here.

351
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,748
That's the plan.
I like the plan.

352
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,448
Me too, so...

353
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,683
Hang in there.

354
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,951
Question.

355
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,516
Sorry, this is kind of weird.

356
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,826
No. I'm your doctor,
you can ask me anything.

357
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,091
Did you have a sister?

358
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,773
You're Luna's brother.

359
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,441
How did you know?

360
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,807
Your sister gave me her heart.

361
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,408
My folks told me all about her.

362
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,746
Her family.

363
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,548
When you said your name, I...

364
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,681
It didn't seem, uh, fair to

365
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,117
say anything. You
need to focus on you.

366
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,388
And, uh, really,
we are strangers.

367
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,464
I mean, we've never
even met before.

368
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,165
Yeah, we did.

369
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,361
You don't remember?

370
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,835
Sorry, no. Where did we meet?

371
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,669
We met in Cold Spring.

372
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:29,639
Wow. I haven't thought
about Cold Spring in years.

373
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,727
We used to go there on the
weekends. There was this dock.

374
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,186
My sister and I would jump
off and we thought we were,

375
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,812
you know,

376
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,686
cliff divers. We loved it.

377
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,558
Yeah, I know.

378
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,623
That's, uh...

379
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,253
That's where I saw you.

380
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,156
At Luna's funeral.

381
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,428
No, I...

382
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,934
I didn't go to the funeral.

383
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,930
You did.

384
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,371
It was in Cold Spring a
week after the transplant.

385
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:03,745
After the funeral, I, uh...
I saw you on that dock.

386
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,612
Skipping stones.

387
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,677
Well, you were trying to
skip stones. You were...

388
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,119
You were really bad at it.

389
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,795
So I went up and I asked
you how the stones were going.

390
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:22,466
You said... I'll never forget.

391
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:28,096
Your sister promised to teach
you the next time you came.

392
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,744
It was the first time it hit me.

393
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:35,037
I was only here 'cause
another girl wasn't.

394
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,714
So I showed you.

395
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,921
You taught me
how to skip stones.

396
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,818
Yeah.

397
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,256
I got <i>Mad Libs.</i>

398
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,764
I just... I couldn't believe
they still publish these.

399
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,731
See anything you like?

400
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,539
My patient needs a study
that's going to deliver results.

401
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,602
I'm more intrigued
by what I don't see.

402
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,312
Definitive conclusions.

403
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,550
Well, my sample size isn't large
enough for that kind of certainty,

404
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,017
but I like where we're heading.

405
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,753
Strong words

406
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,982
from someone failing
more than he succeeds.

407
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,455
It's cancer. I'll take
any wins I can get.

408
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,222
And each success gets
me a little closer to a cure.

409
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,925
You know what they say. Close only
counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.

410
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,930
And a couple other things.

411
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,235
You must know your
reputation precedes you.

412
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,365
My reputation for
exceptional results?

413
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,969
Your reputation for
exceptional charisma

414
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,536
and aptitude for salesmanship.
And I am immune.

415
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,709
Because I have
the same reputation.

416
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,710
I'm only paying
attention to the numbers.

417
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,815
You got your file upside down.

418
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,182
Made you look.

419
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,228
What would you say
to somebody who says

420
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,292
you sell quixotic hope in
lieu of medical certainty?

421
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,997
I'd say that someone is right.

422
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,729
Clinical trials are
riskier than chemo.

423
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,073
They're also the only way to
find a treatment better than chemo.

424
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,668
Yeah, they're
quixotic, and, yeah,

425
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,214
most of the time it doesn't
work. But when it does,

426
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,278
it's gonna change the world.

427
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,840
But it may never work.

428
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,251
Even Don Quixote hit
a couple of windmills.

429
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,552
He lunged at one and then
promptly fell off his horse.

430
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,553
How soon will you know
if my patient's eligible?

431
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,031
Max Goodwin.

432
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,589
You're treating your boss.

433
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,103
No, I'm treating my patient,
who also happens to be my friend.

434
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,466
I have to warn you, I don't accept
patients based on prominence.

435
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,440
The integrity of the
study is too important.

436
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,601
Of course.

437
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,339
And at first glance,
this is not a great fit.

438
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,938
That's not a "no."

439
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,773
Give me a beat, let me
get into it. I'll get back to you.

440
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,846
Thank you for your honesty.

441
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,552
And you for yours.

442
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,247
Even though you
were a little bit mean.

443
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,026
Okay. This is you.

444
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,889
Do you mind if I Insta this?

445
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,535
What the heck. Yeah.

446
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,537
Just no video, okay?

447
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,234
All right, so. Do you see the
dark spots here on the ends?

448
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,840
Those are your
epiphyseal plates.

449
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,311
That's the stuff inside your
bones that does all the growing.

450
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,180
Now, looking at this, we can estimate
more or less how much more growing

451
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,242
you are going to do.

452
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,546
So how tall am I gonna be?

453
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,423
I'm pleased to report, tall.

454
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,928
Not NBA tall. But,
you know, top shelf tall.

455
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,328
#Topshelftall...

456
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,825
Yes, you are in very good health,
Shay. All the doctors here agree

457
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:45,235
that you will be a prime candidate
for top surgery in about a year.

458
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,565
A year?

459
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,508
Yeah. I mean, I know you were
hoping for something a little sooner,

460
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:54,343
but, uh, we have to take medical
into consideration. It's surgery.

461
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,616
Now you sound
just like my parents.

462
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,915
Listen, you've only been on
hormone blockers for about six months.

463
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,546
We need to see how it
affects your breast tissue

464
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,114
before we can decide which
surgery will be right for you.

465
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,924
So a cisgender doctor gets
to tell me what's right for me.

466
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,562
Okay. Got it.

467
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,965
Got it.

468
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:20,362
All right. I hear
that you're upset,

469
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:25,638
but I need you to hear me when I tell
you that I want you to have the surgery.

470
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,304
I said so to your parents.

471
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,142
Screw this, and screw you.

472
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:31,477
Okay.

473
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,050
Okay, thanks.

474
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,280
Bye.

475
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,525
What's wrong? Oh, I'm fine.

476
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,625
Please, what's the
matter? Nope, it's nothing.

477
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,165
Honestly.

478
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,842
My dog, Gertie, has cancer.

479
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,304
I'm so sorry.

480
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,814
Is there anything
to be done? No.

481
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,182
I mean, surgery, but...

482
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,119
It costs more than
I make in a month.

483
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:12,056
I'm gonna have to put my little girl to
sleep unless I can come up with $2,000.

484
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,760
I'm sorry.

485
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,520
You do not need to
be thinking about this.

486
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,356
I'm fine, thank you.

487
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,367
Hey, Becky, I'm gonna take five.

488
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,633
Okay, we're starting to back up down
here. Turan, help me clear some space.

489
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,754
What do you got? Got an
upper GI bleeder in curtains.

490
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,474
Waiting on GI.
Hemodynamically stable?

491
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,878
Yes. Then send him home.

492
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,158
He can get a scope
as an outpatient.

493
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,708
And a weak and dizzy in
Bay 13. I'll meet you there.

494
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,363
Surgery cleared him for
conservative treatment.

495
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,685
Okay.

496
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,883
We're gonna treat you
with medicine, Mr. Powell.

497
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:47,722
No surgery. So we'll get you out
of here real soon. Sound good?

498
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,459
Sound good? Mmm-hmm.

499
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,360
And we'll give you
something for the nausea.

500
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,128
Start Cephalkem, and when he
can eat and drink, he can go home.

501
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:09,509
Casey, did you
give Mr. Powell...

502
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,743
Levofloxacin plus metronidazole.

503
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,582
Just like you said.

504
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,185
Right. Just like I said.

505
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,554
Great.

506
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,087
Need me to make
any other adjustments?

507
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:22,986
No.

508
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,871
Thank you again, Dr. Kleinman.
I know that this is moving fast,

509
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,999
but Sarah Madsen's case is
the definition of time-sensitive.

510
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,601
Mmm-hmm. I've spoken to one
of your reps over at OTF already

511
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,738
and they have agreed to move
Sarah to the top of the transplant list.

512
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,841
Mmm. We have a viable
donor in our ICU right now,

513
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,351
a brain-dead MVA, actually.

514
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,896
And so go ahead and
say the word, and we...

515
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,130
I'm going to stop
you right there.

516
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,247
Okay?

517
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,757
I'm certainly impressed
with your due diligence.

518
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,954
Your patient's hemophilia
is too compromising.

519
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,293
She isn't healthy enough
to receive a new heart.

520
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,832
I'm very sorry.

521
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,296
No, so, uh... Wait a
minute, wait a minute.

522
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,859
On paper, yes.

523
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,030
I see what you see.
But, this woman...

524
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:09,872
This woman, she can do this.
Believe me. Will you tell her?

525
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,911
Her INR and creatinine
clearance are normal.

526
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,412
Hepatic function excellent.
Her kidneys are fine.

527
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,125
Right, and she has never shown
any signs of bone marrow suppression.

528
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,947
Dr. Goodwin,
this isn't personal.

529
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,920
OTF has strict requirements
to ensure healthy organs

530
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,479
are not placed into bodies
that cannot support them.

531
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,616
Plain and simple. Sarah
Madsen does not qualify.

532
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,160
No, wait, wait, wait.

533
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,718
Sorry.

534
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,064
There has gotta be
something that I can do

535
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,692
to convince you to
give Sarah this heart.

536
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:42,464
She needs to complete
three normal-range PTT tests

537
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,669
in a row. Consider it done.

538
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,442
She's not gonna make
it, Max. Yeah, well,

539
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,027
it's gonna be hard...
She could barely pass

540
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,020
one PTT three hours ago.

541
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:57,352
The chances of her passing three
in a row before her heart gives out?

542
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:14,106
So... You said that passing
one of these tests would be hard.

543
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,436
It will be.

544
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,771
Well, I freaking
hate failing tests.

545
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,939
Oh, yeah, like you'd know.

546
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,449
My wife seems like
this cool New York chick.

547
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,109
"Oh, I'm a social worker.

548
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:28,677
"Look at my cool haircut."
Okay. Okay, you know,

549
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,066
you dye your hair purple once,
you never hear the end of it.

550
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,854
But she is a nerd.

551
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,327
She has never failed a test.
Not once in her whole life.

552
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,200
The X means a failed PTT, so...

553
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,263
We'll try again.

554
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,444
Hey.

555
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,875
Hey. Forget it.

556
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,146
What? Wait.

557
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:03,822
We, uh... We need to talk about
what happened with Mr. Powell.

558
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,288
What I did with Mr. Powell.

559
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,155
That was, uh...

560
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,056
That was unacceptable.

561
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,525
Are you

562
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,570
angry? I'm not angry.

563
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,572
Why are you standing there with
a face like I just kicked your dog?

564
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,238
It's just my face.

565
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,970
Hey, I am trying
to apologize here.

566
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,413
Okay, I'm sorry. I...

567
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,311
I do apologize, okay?

568
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,984
You came through huge for me
today, and if you hadn't, then...

569
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,287
I would never have
forgiven myself. Okay?

570
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,417
It won't happen again.

571
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,490
You know I'm not that kind of
doctor... It's happened before.

572
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,566
What? I correct your EMRs.

573
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,466
Put patient notes
on the right charts.

574
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,280
Pull doubles when you
leave holes in scheduling.

575
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:55,433
Okay, well, that's just paperwork.
That's not exhaustion. That's normal.

576
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,204
Okay? So once or twice I
screw up some red tape...

577
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,075
It happens all the time.

578
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,545
And it's been getting worse.

579
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:02,911
No. That can't be right.

580
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,506
Dr. Bloom...

581
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,251
I think you may need help.

582
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:09,049
I'm just tired, okay?

583
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,498
Just an RX from
Dr. Sleep and I'll...

584
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,115
Mr. Powell could have died.

585
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,004
Gladys, yes, I knew
you'd come around.

586
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,005
This falafel is a revelation.

587
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,338
Something may have
happened on the Internet.

588
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:33,345
Okay, well, the Internet
is a big place, Gladys.

589
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,176
Might want to be a
little more specific.

590
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,180
"Dr. Frome blocked
my top surgery.

591
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,742
"Dr. Iggy Frome hates
the trans community."

592
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,253
What? What is that?

593
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,619
Tweets. Tweets?

594
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,590
"What a typical
white cis-male move.

595
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,956
"Dr. Frome's nothing
but a transphobic loser."

596
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,858
What? Give me
that. Let me see that.

597
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,857
And there are so many more.

598
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,559
Like, hundreds of them.

599
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,941
Before you say anything,
I would like to pretend

600
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,308
that earlier never happened.

601
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:09,507
Ella. Uh, cappuccino,
extra dry. Coming up.

602
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,418
Uh, you have any
nice evening plans?

603
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,924
What is this? Please.

604
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:30,961
Oh.

605
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,399
Oh, Dr. Kapoor,
I can't take that.

606
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,670
For Gertie. No. No.

607
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:39,302
I can't. That's too much.

608
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:43,038
I was told to use my money
to help people I care about.

609
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,449
What else is this for?

610
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:49,713
Please.

611
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,451
Thank you.

612
00:29:57,596 --> 00:30:00,065
<i>Dr. Stiles to the Trauma Center.</i>

613
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,964
<i>Dr. Stiles to the Trauma Center.</i>

614
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,269
I picked a bad time
to start failing tests.

615
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,447
I'm not giving up. Are you?

616
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,777
You need to know it's okay.

617
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,013
What's okay?

618
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,684
That I'm gonna die.

619
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,849
No.

620
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,292
No. See, I'm a maestro at this.

621
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,694
So you're not gonna...

622
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,497
Right after my transplant,

623
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:39,964
my dad asked me what I'd
want to do if I could do anything.

624
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,472
I said I wanted to be a pirate.

625
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:48,674
So my parents sold
a car, got a loan,

626
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,478
and we spent a month
on a boat in the Bahamas.

627
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,950
It was insane.

628
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,387
We couldn't afford it.

629
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,058
But at the end of that trip

630
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,322
I wasn't a sick kid anymore.

631
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,196
You know why I
wanted to be a pirate?

632
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,796
Me neither.

633
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,529
I never did before the
surgery. I always thought

634
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:17,309
maybe it was Luna.

635
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,371
I have to tell you,

636
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:25,873
Luna's heart didn't always
have the best taste in guys.

637
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,483
But it skipped a beat
when she met Andy.

638
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,990
It's like she picked
him out just for me.

639
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:41,658
Me and Luna learned
what it felt like to be in love.

640
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,098
I have a job where
I help people.

641
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,873
I've been all over the world.

642
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:56,948
I ran a half-marathon even
though people told me not to.

643
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,578
Last year I won a
watermelon-eating contest.

644
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,590
Which is a real
thing and I love them.

645
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,886
That's why it's okay.

646
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,093
If it's time for me to go.

647
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,392
Your sister...

648
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,096
She gave me a beautiful life.

649
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,468
It's the other way around.

650
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,420
<i>There's a rhythm
in rush these days</i>

651
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,962
<i>Where the lights don't move
and the colors don't fade</i>

652
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,400
<i>Sometimes there's
things a man cannot know</i>

653
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,309

00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:05,350

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,779

<i>Look into the sun

660
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,122
You just lost a follower.

661
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,802
Okay.

662
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:05,738
I saw what you
said about me online.

663
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,411
I was, um, surprised.

664
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,044
My husband read those tweets.

665
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,819
My co-workers. My friends.

666
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,988
And if you google me right now,

667
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,315
that is the number
one thing that pops up.

668
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,759
Shay, I'm not here to shame you.

669
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,856
I'm not here to yell at you. But
I would like you to look at me.

670
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:30,734
Please.

671
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,937
Do you really think
that I'm anti-trans?

672
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,341
I knew it would make
people upset when I posted it.

673
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,614
But I did it anyways.

674
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:54,015
I don't even really
know why I posted it.

675
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,189
Yeah, social media's weird.

676
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,557
You know, it's like,

677
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:03,197
we're not even us
when we're on it.

678
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,696
It's like we're the thing
that we wish we were.

679
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,204
Or even worse,

680
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,203
we're the thing that we
think others want us to be.

681
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,874
Yeah, I scrolled
through your tweets.

682
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,976
It's powerful stuff.

683
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:18,910
I guess.

684
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:21,818
No, no, it's easy to see why
you have so many followers.

685
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,986
It's pretty intense.

686
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,183
I think it was your GoFundMe
campaign for your surgery

687
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,816
that really put you on the map.

688
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,225
You got a lot of followers
that are very excited about that.

689
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:34,330
So...

690
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,660
The rush for surgery,

691
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,297
the anger when I
advised you to wait...

692
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,370
Do you think maybe that's really
more about you being scared

693
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,740
to let your followers down?

694
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,448
They're all counting on me to
get it, and I told them I would.

695
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,784
I mean, now if I
make them wait, it's...

696
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,545
Let 'em wait. I mean...

697
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:00,456
Shay, I'm not... I'm not telling you
anything you don't already know.

698
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,521
How and when you
transition is about you.

699
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:10,463
You're not gonna let some
troll bully you out of a choice.

700
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,203
So you can't let
the fans do it either.

701
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,837
Even the ones that mean well.

702
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,042
And, dude, I'm telling you,
you are going to have exactly

703
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:21,273
zero problems helping
people understand.

704
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:26,007
You are extremely
gifted at Twitter.

705
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,981
As my Google hits would prove.

706
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,848
And, hey, in a year,

707
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,886
if you want the surgery,

708
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,985
I'll be right there with you.

709
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,852
Doctor.

710
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,481
You all right?

711
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,837
It's not something you
have to worry about.

712
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:30,677
Come on, Sarah. Just one more.

713
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,949
You can do it, Sarah.

714
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,089
Sarah.

715
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,425
You're a very good brother.

716
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:48,263
Nobody has ever said that to me.

717
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,602
Sarah.

718
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,901
You did it.

719
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,135
You did it!

720
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,844
Um, um... Can I get
the transplant team?

721
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,348
Now! Max.

722
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,646
Okay, we gotta
get... What? What?

723
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,549
Here, listen to her.

724
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:10,713
Listen.

725
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,950
Luna.

726
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,827
She did it.

727
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,254
Come here.

728
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,103
Hello? <i>Sharpe?</i>

729
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,106
<i>Panthaki. Got good
news and good news.</i>

730
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,506
Dr. Goodwin is a
candidate for therapy.

731
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:08,003
He'll be thrilled to hear it.

732
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,447
What's the other good news?

733
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,143
I'm on my way to your office.

734
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,718
You are?

735
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,620
<i>I have to pick up his cell samples
and give you some paperwork.</i>

736
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:21,026
Oh, well, I'm sure we can
have someone pick that up.

737
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,421
It's too risky.

738
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:26,123
See, this paperwork includes two
tickets to see Lauryn Hill at BAM.

739
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:35,869
Hey, if I was off-base
here, I apologize. I just, um...

740
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,671
I was just thinking about
what to do with the extra ticket.

741
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,071
Well, I might have a suggestion.

742
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,074
<i>Dr. Mendez, ER 1.</i>

743
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,642
<i>Dr. Mendez to ER 1.</i>

744
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,521
How's she doing?

745
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:55,693
Really well.

746
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,059
Thanks to you. Good.

747
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,322
The next few weeks are
critical, so stay close to her.

748
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,400
And keep us informed.

749
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,399
My wife is an optimist.

750
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:11,639
And the minute she found out

751
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,678
that it was your sister,

752
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:17,512
she had me arrange this.

753
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,917
It's her way of
thanking you both.

754
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:40,704
<i>Oh, I've just come
from the land of the sun</i>

755
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:44,565
<i>From a war that must be won</i>

756
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,612
<i>In the name of truth</i>

757
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,915
<i>With our soldiers so brave</i>

758
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,487
<i>Your freedom we will save</i>

759
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,384
<i>With our rifles and grenades</i>

760
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,724
<i>And some help from God</i>

761
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:09,495
<i>I want to see my family</i>

762
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:13,635
<i>My wife and child waiting for me</i>

763
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:19,240
<i>I've got to go home I've
been so alone, you see</i>

764
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:28,185
<i>You just can't believe
the joy I did receive</i>

765
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:34,650
<i>When I finally got my
leave and I was going home</i>

766
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:43,692
<i>Oh, I flew through the sky
my convictions could not lie</i>

767
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:51,136
<i>And I want to see my family</i>

768
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,441
Max?

769
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,604
Oh, my God.

770
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,139
Max.

771
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,342
Max! Hey!

772
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,109
Oh, my God!

773
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,518
Oh, my God.

774
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,154
Help!

775
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,850
Help!

776
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:11,991
Somebody!

777
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,030
Anyone!

778
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:15,956
Oh, my God.

779
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,964
Anyone...

780
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,004
Help!
