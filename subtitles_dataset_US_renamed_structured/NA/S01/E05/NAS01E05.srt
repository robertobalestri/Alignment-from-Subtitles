1
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,876
Wow.

2
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,175
You guys all look how I feel.

3
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:24,087
Happens when your worst
day is immortalized in print.

4
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,386
Bad karma.

5
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,958
Bad karma for what?

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,900
We were all just staring
to groove, weren't we?

7
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,888
I should have never
doubted myself.

8
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,295
I should have
gotten there sooner.

9
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,295
My personal life affected
my decision-making.

10
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,566
Guys, I should have
made a diagnosis sooner.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,684
But we can't just sit here
beating ourselves up over it.

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,732
Okay? I feel like we can.

13
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,609
Or at least I can.

14
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,285
"Yesterday
morning, at 7:38 a.m.,

15
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:07,332
"a bullet ripped through
New Amsterdam."

16
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,503
I got dinged

17
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,055
for not changing my
patient's TV channel

18
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,103
fast enough.

19
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,276
Apparently my name
brings back bad memories.

20
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,115
I get it. The customer
satisfaction survey isn't good.

21
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,745
So rewrite the survey. What?

22
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,433
If you don't like the answers,
change the questions.

23
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,734
What should the
patients focus on?

24
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,659
Nurses know better than anyone.

25
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,196
Harold. You're a long
way from the morgue.

26
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,262
Oh, the ICU has the only
decent coffee in the hospital.

27
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:44,196
You know, I may work with the dead,
but that doesn't mean I have their taste.

28
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,035
Well, I say equal coffee
now, equal coffee forever.

29
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,020
It's a joke, Harold. We'll
get you the same coffee.

30
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,979
Sharpe, why does
nobody get my jokes?

31
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,016
You just missed me solve the
hospital's most vexing problem.

32
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,982
That the ICU has the
only decent coffee?

33
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,952
So that is actually a thing?

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,189
Are you heading out? I was.

35
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,866
When did that
happen to your voice?

36
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,859
On my day off. That'll teach me.

37
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,555
You don't think the, uh,
"Nutella" is spreading, do you?

38
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,564
I hope you don't
expect me to call it that.

39
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,156
Why? Everyone loves Nutella.

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,469
Let me do a laryngoscopy
and see what's going on

41
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,367
with the, uh, "Nutella."

42
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,199
See? It's catchy. Dora.

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,240
Getting exceptionally
good at finding me.

44
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,173
I've updated your
tracking device.

45
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,803
Whatever it is that you
wanna tell me or want me to do,

46
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,370
I can't do it because
I have a thing.

47
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,847
My thing trumps your thing.

48
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,507
Find me later. Okay.

49
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:34,146
Max, this is Louis
Navarro from the <i>Standard.</i>

50
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,315
Apparently HCC approved
him to shadow you.

51
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,849
Right, yes. For the, um,
profile. Overlord told me.

52
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,320
Overlord? HCC.

53
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,154
Your supervisors.

54
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,732
Who doesn't like a fun nickname?

55
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,095
Probably HCC.

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,000
Do you have a contentious relationship
with the Health Care Commission?

57
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,695
Off to a great start.

58
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,901
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna go start posting my résumé.

59
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,167
Do you?

60
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,910
Why don't we start over?

61
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,181
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Navarro. No, Lou.

62
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,661
So intrigued to meet the
Dam's newest medical director

63
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,244
turning this place upside-down.

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,250
I'm an open book.

65
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,054
Hey, is your voice
okay? Karaoke.

66
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,769
You know, one of these
days, I have to accept that

67
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,887
<i>Total Eclipse of the
Heart</i> just isn't in my range.

68
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,523
Pan-roasted whole
branzino... Mmm-hmm.

69
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:25,399
Served with ramps and fiddleheads,
steeped in an unctuous maitake jus.

70
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,905
What are fiddleheads?
I have no idea.

71
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,454
But I'm gonna order
them tonight. Mmm.

72
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,704
Maybe even twice.

73
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,941
Taking Martin to Verdugo
for dinner. No kids.

74
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,958
You know, I think once a year,
it's important to go somewhere

75
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,746
that doesn't have a
maze on the menu.

76
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,309
You know what I
mean? KAO: Dr. Kapoor?

77
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,386
Am I needed? There's
somebody here to see you.

78
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,113
He said he's your son.

79
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,115
Who?

80
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,451
Your son? Wait. You have a son?

81
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,957
Hey, hey.

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,063
You have a son?

83
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,327
Vijay.

84
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,163
Vijay.

85
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,436
Mmm.

86
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,935
Not good.

87
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,948
You only have five eggs.
Oh, maybe six in play,

88
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,646
in your ovulation cycle.

89
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,614
Ten is considered normal.

90
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,924
There's a few weeks
left in my cycle.

91
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,619
Others could still catch up.

92
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:25,294
Yes, in theory, they could,
but... I'm a late bloomer.

93
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,699
School, my chest, men.

94
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,336
These eggs will come round.

95
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,001
Helen, you said you wanted
to know where your fertility was.

96
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,805
Well, here it is.

97
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,871
Your FSH is high.

98
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,884
Your AMH is low because
your ovaries are aging fast.

99
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,153
You have diminished
ovarian reserves, which...

100
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,620
Hey.

101
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,489
Hey, it's just the
genes you were dealt.

102
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,663
Yeah, right.

103
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,579
If you're interested in having
your own biological child,

104
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,882
you're gonna have
to work on that now.

105
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,212
One option, we freeze embryos.

106
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,978
Or we could work to
start getting you pregnant

107
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,147
as soon as your next cycle.

108
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,149
So, um...

109
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,599
You're going to have to
make some decisions on this.

110
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,025
That piece that you wrote

111
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,535
on the, uh, corporatization of
healthcare for the <i>Times,</i> that was great.

112
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,696
Oh, you remember that?
That was a decade ago.

113
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,415
Yeah, but my favorite
is the one that you wrote

114
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,103
on the, uh, inadequacies
of maternal postpartum care.

115
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,940
Hmm. Also 10 years ago.

116
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,446
Yeah, why aren't you writing
pieces like that anymore?

117
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,346
Well, you know, the market now
demands shorter, buzzier topics.

118
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,716
But the healthcare system
demands more, don't you think?

119
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:56,279
Okay, yeah, let's talk about
you. Your story. How you got here.

120
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,018
Lou, I'm flattered, but
I'm not the story here.

121
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,621
New Amsterdam is.

122
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:04,289
Mmm, the only thing new
about New Amsterdam is you.

123
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,059
Now, HCC

124
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,532
gave me full access to follow
you around the entire hospital.

125
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,131
Full access?

126
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,299
Anywhere in the
hospital is fair game.

127
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,600
Max.

128
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,701
Uh, did you know that
HCC gave Lou full access?

129
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,906
The Chief of Police just called.

130
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,971
It's... It's bad.

131
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,989
Malik Stokes, 14-year-old
GSW to left and right chest.

132
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,934
It Seems like a
through-and-through.

133
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,486
Scoop and go. He's tachy at 120,
100 over 68, respiration's at 16.

134
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,223
Jesus, he's just a kid.

135
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,731
Hey, Malik, I'm Dr. Bloom, okay?

136
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,597
We're here to help you.

137
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,101
Malik?

138
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,063
I'm here, baby.

139
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,264
Malik? Oh! Malik?

140
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,103
I'm right here,
baby. I'm here, baby.

141
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,941
Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

142
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,490
He can't die like this.
You have to save him.

143
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,608
He can't die... Escort
her out of here, please.

144
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,112
Okay, transfer on my
count. One, two, three.

145
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,656
Second ambulance coming in.

146
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,849
Type and cross two
units and get a second IV.

147
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,996
Jalen Pagan.

148
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,464
17-year-old GSW with a bullet
hole on the left side of his neck.

149
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,000
98, 145 over 85, 14.

150
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,114
He was on the same
corner as the first victim.

151
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,334
According to NYPD,
only one shot. One bullet.

152
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:21,801
Must have been some bullet.

153
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,503
Okay, let's get him into bay 24.

154
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,841
Jalen, can you wiggle
your toes for me?

155
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,109
Okay, that's great.

156
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,650
Malik's BP is dropping.
Heart rate is rising.

157
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,622
Okay, hang two bags of normal
saline. Let's get a type and cross match.

158
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,885
On it.

159
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,886
Heart rate's
climbing now to 154.

160
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,054
And BP's dropping.
Eighty over 40.

161
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,794
Muffled heart sounds. Malik's
got a pericardial effusion.

162
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,280
Fluid must be accumulating
around his heart.

163
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,330
Heart rate's gone
from 100 to 160.

164
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,246
Okay, if we don't do a
pericardiocentesis soon,

165
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,376
his BP will bottom out.
Where's cardiothoracic surgery?

166
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,838
Reynolds is 10 minutes out.
What about one of his new hires?

167
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,960
All three have been scrubbed
for their own surgeries.

168
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,010
BP's dropping again.

169
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,181
Okay, I'll do it.

170
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:12,419
Uh, get me an 18-gauge spinal
needle and a 20-cc syringe. Go.

171
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,055
It's against protocol. What
do you want me to do?

172
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,284
Wait until he's pulseless
so I can call time of death?

173
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,570
Get me an 18-gauge spinal
needle and a 20-cc syringe. Now.

174
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,607
He's down at 50 over palp.

175
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,294
Heart rate's up to 180.

176
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,169
Get a second IV bag.

177
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,894
O2 sats are dropping.

178
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,124
Steady. Steady.

179
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,096
BP's dropping. I got it.

180
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,064
- You're in the heart.
- Heart rate's rising.

181
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,136
Damn it.

182
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,986
Max, you're not walking
towards your office.

183
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,119
No, I'm walking to the
ED where the GSWs are.

184
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,936
What about Chief Williams?
Last time I checked, he wasn't shot.

185
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,989
He's just gonna call again.

186
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,539
Well, I'll ignore that call, too, and
then eventually, he'll stop dialing.

187
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,643
He doesn't dial his own phone.

188
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,895
You normally in the habit of
blowing off the Chief of Police?

189
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,164
The police department
has its own agenda.

190
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,139
But my agenda and the agenda
of my hospital is to save lives.

191
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,264
Plain and simple. Hmm.

192
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,781
You realize this is probably a
police-related shooting, right?

193
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,655
That information, while
tragic and upsetting,

194
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,148
doesn't matter in here.
Wait. Doesn't matter?

195
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,779
More than 700 people have been shot
and killed by the police just this year.

196
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,707
The second they come through these doors,
they become patients, not statistics.

197
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,017
Hold on. Wait.

198
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,936
If you wanna do a ride-along
with the police, then you go ahead.

199
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,986
But in here, the
hospital is the story.

200
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,367
When exactly did you
become a cardiac surgeon?

201
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,626
When we were waiting
on you. On anyone.

202
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,467
'Cause you're still so
insanely understaffed.

203
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,283
I mean, what was
I supposed to do?

204
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,936
You're supposed to follow
protocol. He would have crashed.

205
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,921
You pushed that needle
way too deep into his heart

206
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,385
'cause you are not
a cardiac surgeon.

207
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,646
You better hope I can fix this.

208
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,027
Ms. Tewkes, can you talk to me?

209
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,663
Ms. Tewkes? Ms. Tewkes.

210
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,835
At what point did you see the
officers... Hang on. Hang on there.

211
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,504
Just one sec. I'm sorry
to cut in on you, Officer...

212
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,170
Detective Adams.

213
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,681
NYPD. And you're? Frome. NAMC.

214
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,517
New Amsterdam Medical Center.
It's... It's a mouthful, I know. Um...

215
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,830
I'm gonna need you to give
Ms. Tewkes a little room here.

216
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,398
I just need a few statements
from the aunt there.

217
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,868
No, I understand, but we're just...
We're gonna do our thing first, okay?

218
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,132
Thank you. I'll bring her back.

219
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,726
Are you one of Malik's surgeons?

220
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,731
Um, no. No.

221
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,666
Here. Come in here.

222
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:12,070
No, I'm, uh, a psychiatrist. I'm
on Malik's trauma support team.

223
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,601
I'm Iggy Frome.

224
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,269
What does he need
with a psychiatrist?

225
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,536
Is he out of surgery?
No. No, not yet.

226
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,006
Um, but if his
surgery is a success,

227
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,217
he's gonna need more
than physical rehabilitation.

228
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,844
There will be many, many
mental hurdles to overcome.

229
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,445
So you don't know how he is now?

230
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,349
No.

231
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,259
But, um, I can assure
you that he's in...

232
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,057
He's in the best hands.

233
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,461
<i>Yo, that's so bugged.</i>

234
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:45,932
Word to, son.

235
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,204
It's all good, though.
Your boy bulletproof.

236
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,474
<i>How are you bulletproof
with a bullet hole, B?</i>

237
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,478
<i>You sound dumb-smacked.</i>
You're just jealous.

238
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,281
Why is Jalen Pagan still here?

239
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,783
Why do you sound
like a frog? Allergies.

240
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,564
Why hasn't he been sent for an
MRI? He's got a bullet lodged near T1.

241
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,489
Yes, but he's stable,
and he's a minor.

242
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,550
So we're trying to contact
his mother for consent.

243
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,753
It's an MRI.

244
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,124
I'm just following protocol.

245
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,821
I mean, I wouldn't
wanna piss anyone off

246
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,529
overstepping any
precious rules, would I?

247
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,224
Gonna say no.

248
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,761
How long have the cops
been circling? A while now.

249
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,716
They want a statement
from Jalen like yesterday.

250
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,500
Not till we reach his parents.

251
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,473
Yo, what's up, guys?
Jalen's gotta go.

252
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,178
We gotta call his mom,
okay? Thanks, bye.

253
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,400
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

254
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,807
It's for your own good.
Now, help me call your mom.

255
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,421
You need money?

256
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,331
I have a job.

257
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,530
It's at a restaurant.

258
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,462
Solstice, in Soho.

259
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,875
It's new, but it's making noise.

260
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,637
A restaurant.

261
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,610
Yeah, I manage the place.

262
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,651
I mean, it's no
big deal. Just...

263
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,454
Why were you hiding all this?

264
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,151
I don't know.

265
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,989
It's weird enough me
showing up like this, but...

266
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,570
After I got your
voice mail, I...

267
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,872
Rohan, I'm...

268
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,568
I'm glad you came.

269
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,744
I forgive you.

270
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,144
You forgive me?

271
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,013
Yes, for...

272
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,522
For the funeral,
for all the lies.

273
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,385
For everything.

274
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,756
You forgive me?

275
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,861
Isn't that what people
like you need to hear?

276
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,030
You know, my
sponsor said not to...

277
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,935
Not to expect...

278
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,339
Never mind.

279
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,421
But I don't understand...
Yeah, of course you don't.

280
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,175
You know, Maji was right.
You are just so pigheaded.

281
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,563
Nothing is ever your fault.

282
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,080
You know, I was hoping you might
change just a little after she passed,

283
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,215
but you're still you.

284
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,925
Goodbye, <i>Abba.</i>

285
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,433
Ms. Tewkes, can you
tell me about Malik?

286
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,973
Rhonda. What? Why
are you still talking?

287
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,689
I'm just trying to learn more
about Malik's home support system.

288
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,409
He's not some charity case.

289
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,449
No, no, I didn't mean to imply...
Malik has been well-loved.

290
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,721
And extremely well cared for.
Is that what you need to hear?

291
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,054
It's good. Church choir.

292
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,658
After-school care.
Year-round sports.

293
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,788
I've done everything in
my power to keep him safe.

294
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,157
To keep him from
dying like his parents.

295
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,736
This foolishness
still found him.

296
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,233
I'm genuinely just
here trying to help.

297
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,269
If you really wanna help,

298
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,410
then stop the police
from shooting black boys

299
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,506
trying to get to school on time.

300
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:21,118
And get every
bullet out of this city,

301
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:25,258
so my nephew has a chance
of seeing his 21st birthday.

302
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,092
Can you do that,
Mr. Trauma Support Man?

303
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,593
So we should start.

304
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,826
Excuse me one minute.

305
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,761
I got your page.
Have you been crying?

306
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,964
Do you want this
laryngoscopy or not?

307
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,472
What's a laryngoscopy?

308
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,122
Just call me when you're free.

309
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,939
So, Lou, what's the story?

310
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,519
Well, it seems your purge of
the cardiac surgery department

311
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,814
has resulted in, uh,
staffing shortages.

312
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,652
That the new department
head is thoughtfully refilling.

313
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:01,660
Yeah, apparently not fast
enough to stop a breach of protocol

314
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,696
by one of your
department chiefs.

315
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,233
The doctor stuck a needle way
too deep into Malik Stokes' heart.

316
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,611
Now, it's very possible
he could die from this.

317
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,001
Now, do you have a comment?

318
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,811
Uh, you gonna fire Dr. Bloom?
Who said anything about firing?

319
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,814
Well, if Malik dies because
she broke protocol...

320
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,824
I only care if what she did helped
him. We're in the business of healing.

321
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,884
And if protocol gets in the way of
that, then we will change the protocol.

322
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,672
Oh, can... Can I
quote you on that?

323
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,240
I just assumed all
this was on the record.

324
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,699
Max. Really? The
police chief? Still?

325
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,395
No, the Mayor. Congratulations.
You've moved up in the world.

326
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,014
He wants an update on the injuries
and the kind of bullet that was used.

327
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,318
I don't wanna
talk to him either.

328
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,876
Any idea why he
would wanna know that?

329
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:58,412
Yeah, but his agenda is not
your story. Hospital is. Remember?

330
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,458
Hello, Jalen. I'm
Dr. Vijay Kapoor.

331
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,657
Would you mind wiggling
your toes for me, please?

332
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,399
I already did a work-up,
Vijay. The bullet stays.

333
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,231
Sending him up to the
ward for observation.

334
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,802
Jalen, go ahead. I am.

335
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,273
Okay, tell me if you
feel something, okay?

336
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,309
Here? Yeah.

337
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,807
Pull his x-rays. Sure thing.

338
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,814
Dr. Hartman, he has
ascending paralysis.

339
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,791
That just started. It's
probably from edema.

340
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,700
I already had them start
on methylprednisolone.

341
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:46,324
It's not edema. His vertebrae is
unstable. You're a surgeon. Fix it.

342
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,757
What's got you riled up today?

343
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,679
A neurologist advocating
for a construction project?

344
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,605
Because it's indicated. These
scans don't say that definitively.

345
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,609
If you actually look, they
do. You're being stubborn.

346
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,477
Okay, let's wait for the bloody
vertebrae to collapse for proof!

347
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,673
What?

348
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,117
Prep him for surgery.

349
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,992
You coming, John Wayne?

350
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,744
See, there? No trace wave.

351
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,062
So all that blood must have
come from where the bullet

352
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,486
nicked his heart, not my needle.

353
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,965
And you needed a
video to tell you that?

354
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,685
Oh, I needed something, okay?

355
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,757
I'm second-guessing every
move I make in there now.

356
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,973
Do you think that Reynolds
sits around whingeing

357
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,257
about the calls that he makes?

358
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,698
No. What is it?

359
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:57,060
They need a hematology
consult in the OR.

360
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,105
Malik? No. The other GSW, Jalen.

361
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,777
Infusion rate is point
five mils per minute.

362
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,908
It won't clot. Blood keeps
oozing into my surgical field.

363
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,978
And you've got an
expanding hematoma.

364
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,530
Because Kapoor
pressed for stabilizing rods.

365
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,749
That you know he needed.

366
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,767
But now I can't close,
so we should have waited.

367
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,935
And let him become paraplegic?

368
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,894
For goodness' sake, will
you both give it a rest?

369
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,953
Push calcium chloride
before giving him FFP.

370
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,789
That should stabilize the oozing

371
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,958
while I run a detailed
clotting factor analysis.

372
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:40,936
Hi.

373
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,040
Hi.

374
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:49,584
I will, um, freely admit that
I'm stress-eating right now.

375
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,219
Ruining my appetite
for what will surely be

376
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,011
a very expensive meal
with my husband later.

377
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,956
I didn't see
anything. Thank you.

378
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,808
What's wrong with your voice?

379
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,802
It's the, uh, big game.

380
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,230
The... What big game?
Why are you stress-eating?

381
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,141
They're out there right
now for Malik and Jalen.

382
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,069
But tomorrow, it's
gonna be another family

383
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,245
crying, scared, praying.

384
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,016
And this happens every day.

385
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:26,042
And Malik and Jalen could end up
here again through no fault of their own.

386
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,149
Yeah.

387
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,419
Maybe, but you do
what you can in here,

388
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:34,129
maybe make a
difference out there.

389
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,634
I don't see how.

390
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,093
Malik lives in a war zone.

391
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:41,797
Both of his parents are dead.

392
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,532
His aunt is...

393
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,042
Fraying at the seams,
and she's angry.

394
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,846
Distracted. You seem
very focused on Malik.

395
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,643
Of course I am.

396
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,453
Sounds like Malik
isn't your only patient.

397
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,053
Blood pressure dropped again.

398
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,205
Come on, Malik. Where
is that damn bleeder?

399
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,206
Wipe.

400
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,646
Nottingham, is his
abdomen distended?

401
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,751
I don't feel anything.

402
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,684
Cut the drapes.

403
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,829
He's got Grey Turner
sign on his abdomen.

404
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,539
Because it's full of blood.

405
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,206
That's where that
bleeder is, damn it.

406
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:56,091
Prepare to expand the
surgical field to the abdomen.

407
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,559
Shouldn't we call
the general surgeon?

408
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,347
If we're hitting the spleen...

409
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,379
He's bleeding out fast,

410
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,333
and I'll be damned if
this kid dies on my watch.

411
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,080
Ten-blade.

412
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,462
Scrub in. Stat.

413
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,809
Where's the barnacle?

414
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,210
Probably writing an exposé
about our coffee situation.

415
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,960
Well, I can scope you now. I'm
just waiting on Jalen's test results.

416
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,775
What's going on
with you? Nothing.

417
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,717
Red eyes earlier. Now
you're mean-mugging.

418
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:38,451
Helen, you know my
biggest, hairiest secret.

419
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,059
So if you need to talk to me...

420
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,923
You're the one
with the "Nutella."

421
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,489
Not me.

422
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,427
So let's just do the scope
before you get another page.

423
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,662
Max!

424
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,261
I said I ain't giving
you my phone!

425
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is the problem?

426
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,308
The name's Javier Pagan.
We found him filming in the ED.

427
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,055
Yeah, because that's
where y'all took my brother!

428
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,389
Okay, okay. And
now he isn't there!

429
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,779
Hey, who is your brother?

430
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,113
How many people
I gotta tell? Jalen.

431
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,983
Jalen Pagan. He
was shot in the back.

432
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,647
But now nobody wants to
tell me where y'all took him!

433
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,123
My mom keeps calling me
trying to get here from her job.

434
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,093
Keeps asking me for
news that I can't give her!

435
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,253
I understand...

436
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,048
And now I got these
two dumb-ass rent-a-cops

437
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,441
getting spicy over a damn phone!

438
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,934
I understand. Calm down.
Calm down. Listen, listen, listen!

439
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,835
You're gonna come with me. We're
gonna talk about your brother, okay?

440
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:27,737
We need to make sure he didn't
film any hospital personnel or patients.

441
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,360
It's policy. You are
making this worse.

442
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,535
What? You think I'm scared?

443
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,669
Huh? Back up. Okay? It's okay.

444
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,214
No, no. You think I'm scared?

445
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,316
You gonna shoot
me, too? It's okay.

446
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,145
Easy, man.

447
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,488
Calm down, son. Are
you gonna shoot me too?

448
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,322
Back off. You need to calm down.

449
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,338
Hey, hey, just back...
Give him some space!

450
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,384
Max!

451
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,290
Give me that.

452
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,123
No! Hey!

453
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,739
If I'd have known that punching
you in the face was all it took

454
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,603
to make you available,
I'd have done it myself.

455
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,758
How long for the test results?

456
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,359
I'll have them in the morning.

457
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:33,495
In the meantime, I was thinking

458
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,269
a course of steroids
might help clear the, uh...

459
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,068
Steroids.

460
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,107
What?

461
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,184
I have to go. What about me?

462
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,048
Here. Heal thyself.

463
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,195
Changing out the CO2 absorber.

464
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,918
Hanging a bag
of cryoprecipitate.

465
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,123
Hanging. Tests come back?

466
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,595
No, but Jalen is not clotting
because he's on anabolic steroids.

467
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,396
Seems a bit out of left field.

468
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:04,346
Not if you've seen his brother
or factor in Jalen's damaged liver.

469
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,880
But his liver function
tests were normal.

470
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,202
Appear normal.

471
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,950
But his protein levels
tell the whole story.

472
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,308
I confirmed his A/G ratio is
less than one. He's on steroids.

473
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,184
We should wait for
the tests to come back.

474
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,615
Four mils per minute.
- Wait, wait.

475
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:22,914
It's drying up.

476
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,114
It's working.

477
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:28,955
Well done, Sharpe.

478
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,136
Hi. Just me.

479
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:38,397
What happened?

480
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,772
Uh, nothing. Malik
is still in surgery.

481
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,733
But, um, I thought you might
appreciate a fresh set of clothes.

482
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,644
Thank you. It's my pleasure.

483
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,477
And I've said all I had to
say about Malik in all of this.

484
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,745
Well, I'm actually not
here to talk about Malik.

485
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,352
I'm here to talk about you.

486
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,293
Hey, how'd you earn the shiner?

487
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:05,263
Can't be Medical Director at
the Dam without at least one.

488
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,664
Hey, listen, my contact
at the mayor's office

489
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,244
says they want to hold
a press conference.

490
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,760
It's about what the bullet
did to both Malik and Jalen.

491
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,169
Of course they are.

492
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,138
You going to?

493
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,152
You're getting caught up
in the shiny thing again, Lou.

494
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,974
Yeah, but you get to
talk about your agenda.

495
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:20,878
Tell your story.

496
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,710
I would love nothing
more than to tell people

497
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,307
what hollow points do to flesh.

498
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:30,015
How the bullet blooms inside of
you, expanding to three times its size.

499
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,455
How it breaks apart,
tearing through flesh,

500
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,358
pulverizing bones,
liquefying muscles.

501
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,395
Just not for the Mayor.

502
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,466
Aren't you on the same side?

503
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:46,201
The Mayor's been campaigning
the police to use different bullets.

504
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,206
He wants me to
influence public opinion.

505
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:52,039
I pick a side between
the Mayor and the police,

506
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,806
all of a sudden there's less
patrolling in our neighborhood

507
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,817
or a grant we were assured
gets diverted to another hospital.

508
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,311
There are no safe sides.

509
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,414
So what are you gonna do?

510
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,995
Lou, what are we
gonna do with you?

511
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,761
Let me guess.

512
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,158
It's not the story.

513
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,835
May be hope for you yet.

514
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,344
PTSD.

515
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,517
I'm not a soldier. I
haven't been to war.

516
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,514
PTSD can occur from
any traumatic event.

517
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,059
Seeing your nephew get shot,
that would be more than enough,

518
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,089
but it most likely triggered other
traumatizing memories for you.

519
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,296
It can make sleeping hard.

520
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,097
Sudden noises can be jarring.

521
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,271
Same thing happened to my kids.

522
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:58,868
Yeah.

523
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,980
We, uh, adopted them from
Bangladesh two years ago.

524
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,883
When we first got them here,

525
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,385
they were terrified.

526
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:13,415
Of everything.

527
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,955
Car horns, school bells.

528
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:24,393
Crowded spaces, everything.
They were just petrified.

529
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,399
All five of us slept in
the same bed for months.

530
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,240
And they would just
wake themselves crying.

531
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,080
Night after night after night.

532
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,779
When was the last time
you had a good night's sleep?

533
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,082
Never.

534
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,860
I just thought that was life.

535
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,259
It doesn't have to be.

536
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,262
I can help you.

537
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,110
And then you can help Malik.

538
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:12,944
Yeah.

539
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,190
Well, we'll see how
it goes, but thank you.

540
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,323
Hey. Hey.

541
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,224
Malik's surgery all good?

542
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:28,531
Yeah, it was a bit dicey,
but he's gonna pull through.

543
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,730
I was just, uh, going
to tell his family.

544
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,863
Yeah, they just
closed Jalen as well.

545
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,166
Score one for the
good guys. I suppose.

546
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,645
Never felt good about
fixing bullet holes in anyone.

547
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,811
Let alone kids, you know?

548
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,544
That's something I will never
understand about this country.

549
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,215
The dangers of walking
around in brown skin?

550
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,400
I never really gave it much
thought till I moved here.

551
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,017
Now I can't not think about it.

552
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:58,319
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
it's a lesson we learn early.

553
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,496
But this is no way to live.

554
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,057
No.

555
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,202
It's not. Yet we do.

556
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:07,929
You know?

557
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:13,869
So if it takes a million
camera phones and protests

558
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:18,344
and knees to make
that point, so be it.

559
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,066
I didn't mean to do all that.

560
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,199
Seriously. I'm so sorry.

561
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,967
It's just, Jalen is
my little brother.

562
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:47,576
Don't worry about it.
Really. And I only got one.

563
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:52,083
I have a sister. I get it.

564
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,318
So am I being arrested?

565
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,391
I have a better idea.

566
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,624
How about we go see
your brother instead?

567
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,592
His surgery went well.

568
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:13,772
He's in recovery now.

569
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,241
Just easy on that elbow.

570
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,674
Yeah.

571
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,351
My mom's gonna be so
hyped when she gets here.

572
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,013
Jalen's the baby. Yeah?

573
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:33,091
Little badass too.

574
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,669
Once he poured ketchup
all over his T-shirt.

575
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,184
Acted like he got shot.

576
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,505
Scared the crap out of my moms.

577
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,773
He got the <i>chancla</i> for that one.

578
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:40,129
No doubt.

579
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,643
He's always pulling
stupid stuff like that.

580
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:45,531
What's going on? Stay here.

581
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,673
Where's Jalen? Javi, look at me.

582
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,799
I need you to stay out here.

583
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,593
He's in pulseless
electrical activity.

584
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,921
Chest compressions? MAN: Gomez.

585
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,336
Max, one milligram of epi.

586
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,499
No, it's already open.

587
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:05,855
V-fib. MAX: Go.

588
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,884
Clear.

589
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,329
- Still V-fib.
- Another round of epi.

590
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:15,459
Clear.

591
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,335
No pulse.

592
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,338
Still no pulse.

593
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,754
Max. Wait.

594
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,830
Max. Just wait!

595
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,533
Stop it, Max.

596
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:02,672
Stop it.

597
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:07,677
It's over.

598
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,683
Time of death, 3:18.

599
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,970
<i>Damn, you saw Mami face?</i>

600
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,818
<i>Unstoppable, you heard
me? Oh, man, stop fronting.</i>

601
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,620
<i>You know I'm the
brains of the operation.</i>

602
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,717
<i>What brains, man?</i>

603
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,087
<i>What brains? Oh, yeah?</i>

604
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,329
I heard Malik is stable.

605
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,666
And, uh...

606
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:11,182
Jalen died of cardiac arrest
secondary to a gunshot wound.

607
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,787
So you gonna call
the Chief of Police?

608
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:19,781
Mayor?

609
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,759
It's not the story, Lou.

610
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,297
Well, then what is?

611
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:30,963
What is the story if it's not
you, the police or the Mayor?

612
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,303
If you don't know after
spending all day at this hospital,

613
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,341
then I picked the
wrong man for the job.

614
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,379
What, you picked me?

615
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,616
So HCC didn't give me
full access? You did?

616
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,789
Did they even
want me here at all?

617
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:01,992
Why did you?

618
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,373
Gotta see the truth

619
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,034
to write the truth.

620
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,713
<i>Unstoppable, you heard me?</i>

621
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,843
<i>Oh, man. Stop fronting.</i>

622
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:23,354
<i>You know I'm the
brains of the operation.</i>

623
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:37,244
<i>Get off, man. That's not funny.</i>

624
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,430
<i>It's not funny. No
brains. No brains.</i>

625
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,702
<i>Too blind</i>

626
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:53,708
<i>Hurrying through the
forks without regrets</i>

627
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:02,886
<i>Different now, every
step feels like a mile</i>

628
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:11,732
<i>All the lights seem to
flash and pass you by</i>

629
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:20,204
<i>So how's it gonna be</i>

630
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,238
<i>When it all</i>

631
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,611
Hey, Martin, it's me.

632
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:29,944
Do you think I could take a rain
check on date night tonight? I just, um...

633
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,681
I really wanna be
with you and the kids.

634
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:37,418
<i>But don't know which way to turn</i>

635
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,579
You know, there might not
have even been a patient to save

636
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,626
if I hadn't done the
pericardiocentesis.

637
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:48,471
Yeah, and I wanted to tell
you that you did it perfectly.

638
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,173
I know I did.

639
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:53,669
I didn't need, nor did
I ask, for your opinion.

640
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,580
Look, Floyd, you're an
incredibly gifted doctor

641
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,981
who heads up a
world-class department.

642
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,108
But so am I.

643
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,485
Yeah. You're right.

644
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,082
So we're good?

645
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,089
I don't know.

646
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:11,923
Are we?

647
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,796
I mean, I don't know.

648
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:16,096
I really don't want no
static at work after this.

649
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,999
Agreed.

650
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,911
Well, you sound like you're
still in your feelings, so...

651
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,431
Oh, my God.

652
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,455
You just can't help
yourself, can you?

653
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:28,703
You know, for the record,
the spleen is way outside

654
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,213
of cardiac's protocol.

655
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,719
<i>"Yesterday
morning, at 7:38 a.m.,</i>

That is the truth.

Not one of you is at fault.

671
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,915
Not one of you is to blame.

<i>When it all comes
down to cycling trivialities</i>

673
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,021

working someplace else.

00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,958
Making...

675
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,964
Making more money.

But you're here.

679
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:09,114
And I'm so grateful.

680
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,586
Today is a new day.

681
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:24,619
Go.

682
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,360
The "Nutella" didn't spread.

683
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,107
I should stop
calling it "Nutella."

684
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:20,145
It's not Nutella. It's cancer.

685
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,852
I should start being honest.

686
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,187
At least with myself.

687
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,663
I want to have a baby.

688
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,795
Okay.

689
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:45,334
But I'm single and on
the wrong side of 35.

690
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:48,837
I'd have to do injections and
deal with epic mood swings

691
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,353
if I even wanna
give myself a chance.

692
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,810
I don't know why I'd
wanna bring a child,

693
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:59,085
a brown child, into this world.

694
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,652
There are 1,000 reasons not to.

695
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,922
But the only way to beat death

696
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:10,858
is life.

697
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:15,833
There's a word for it.

698
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,173
Surrogacy.

699
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,374
Hope.
