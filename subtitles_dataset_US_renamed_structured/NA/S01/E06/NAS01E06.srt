1
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,098
Is that normal?

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,901
Okay, what does that
mean? What does what mean?

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,972
You're sure, Doctor?

4
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:17,910
Okay.

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,721
Thank you, Suzanne.
What did she say?

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,881
A lot of things.

7
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,255
Okay, like?

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,396
The placenta previa resolved.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,361
It resolved? It
corrected itself.

10
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,593
It corrected itself?

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,499
I can have a natural childbirth.

12
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,980
You don't have
to repeat that part.

13
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,836
This is amazing.

14
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,272
Oh, my goodness, the baby.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,985
Sorry, I just... We're
gonna have a birth right now.

16
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,671
There's more. There's more?

17
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,612
I am no longer chained
to that hateful bed.

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,581
Hate that bed. I think
we should celebrate.

19
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,515
I think we should rent
a boat on the Hudson.

20
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,382
I think we should
go skiing in the Alps.

21
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,683
I think we should
just hike a mountain.

22
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,747
Or we could just go for dinner.

23
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,189
Yeah.

24
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,518
Well, would you maybe...

25
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,961
join me for dinner tonight?

26
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,656
Are you asking me on
a date, Max Goodwin?

27
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,868
Yes, I am, Georgia Goodwin.

28
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,363
No, um...

29
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,197
Crap, I can't.

30
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,300
I have the fund-raiser
for the hospital.

31
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,469
Ouch.

32
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,176
Your favorite.

33
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,175
This weekend?

34
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:23,777
Maybe?

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,182
This weekend.

36
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,220
Definitely.

37
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,791
You're in a good mood.
It's a good news kind of day.

38
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:39,924
Let me guess.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,344
Getting ready for
tonight's schmooze fest.

40
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,303
Georgia's off bed rest.
The baby is healthy.

41
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,498
We are gonna start dating again.

42
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,551
I know the order of
that's a little weird,

43
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,237
but, uh, I'm excited.

44
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,907
You... You still
haven't told her.

45
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,176
You know, it just...

46
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,683
It wasn't the right moment.

47
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,783
There's never a right moment

48
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,253
to tell someone you have cancer.

49
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,482
Just tell them.

50
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:06,084
Can't she just have one day
without worrying about someone?

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,919
About me, about the baby?

52
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,554
Just one day.

53
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,331
You swore that
you would tell her

54
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,095
once she was out of the woods.

55
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,258
She's out.

56
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,502
I can't tell her today.

57
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,165
You know why?

58
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,175
'Cause it's "a good
news kind of day."

59
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,211
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

60
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,679
Yeah, my parents...
They're not even coming

61
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,272
to see me or the kids.

62
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,226
They just happen to be in
town for their annual binge

63
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,776
of Broadway musicals that
I will never be able to afford.

64
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,919
<i>Waitress,</i> right orchestra.

65
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,618
But you invited them
for the fund-raiser.

66
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,091
I did, yeah.

67
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:42,185
Yeah, I mean, my... my
oldest, Sameera, has no idea

68
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,356
there's any tension,
as it should be,

69
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,866
and she just, like, loves
my parents, you know?

70
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,026
And I guess...

71
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,461
I want them to love her,
too, and her brothers.

72
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,882
You know, when we
first brought them back

73
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,171
from Bangladesh,
they just happened

74
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,268
to be in town
again for <i>Hamilton,</i>

75
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:58,670
center orchestra.

76
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,804
Thank you very much, Pop.

77
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,145
But I've gotten
over that. Clearly.

78
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,375
You know, then we rode the
paddleboats in Central Park.

79
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,011
The ones shaped like swans?

80
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,520
Yeah, exactly those ones.

81
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,920
And now Sameera is
obsessed with swans.

82
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,519
She even learned how to make

83
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,253
those little swan
napkins for them.

84
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,318
Hey, she can make you
one tonight, if you ask her.

85
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,486
Oh.

86
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,330
Uh, not this year, my friend.

87
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,519
Really? Why? Last year you
said you wished you'd gone.

88
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,395
I'm not ready.

89
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,570
Okay, I understand.

90
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,552
In that case, you should
really consider giving

91
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,554
those tickets to somebody,
'cause some of your residents

92
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,308
would just kill to
be at that thing.

93
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,680
That's not a bad idea.
I know, thank you.

94
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,275
Okay, that's it.

95
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,920
I'll send you my bill.

96
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,291
Whoa, whoa, Nelly!

97
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,718
I mean, uh, I prefer coffee.

98
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,092
It's hMG.

99
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,789
Wow.

100
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,992
So you're, uh... Trying, yes.

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,101
Have you already
picked out a donor?

102
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,727
Follow-up question,
is he ripped?

103
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,362
Hardly.

104
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,968
I'm just trying to
trick my stupid body

105
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,304
into producing eggs.

106
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,505
Well...

107
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,707
I'm really proud of you,

108
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,173
you know,

109
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,110
for trying.

110
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,815
Can you believe I'm
considered geriatric?

111
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,485
You want a hand with that?

112
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,992
I mean, 'cause
you're so old and all.

113
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,861
Thank you.

114
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,002
<i>Bonjour</i> from Pan de Vie.

115
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,501
<i>Au revoir.</i>

116
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,711
<i>Bonjour</i> from Pain de Vie.

117
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,609
<i>"Bonjour"?</i>

118
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,743
It's a new thing
they're making us say.

119
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,219
It's so dorky.

120
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,254
Uh, you want your usual?

121
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,415
Yeah. Okay.

122
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,150
Ella. <i>Oui?</i>

123
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,957
The hospital fund-raiser
is this evening,

124
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,258
and I have two tickets.

125
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,994
Oh, wow...

126
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,830
I thought if you wished to go...

127
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,504
Yeah, that would be really nice.

128
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,767
Thank you. No, no.

129
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,670
I'll meet you in the
lobby when I get off.

130
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,180
<i>Bonjour</i> from Pain de Vie.

131
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,825
Two tall cappuccinos.

132
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,111
Thanks. You can swipe.

133
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,198
I can't believe
you're actually going

134
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,281
to this thing tonight.

135
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,790
All it's gonna be
is stuffy donors

136
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,053
acting stuffy and boring.

137
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,221
- Did I mention the full bar?
- Oh, I'm so jealous.

138
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,873
I don't think you fully
grasp what just happened.

139
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,241
What'd you bring us?
- Car crash.

140
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,665
Dan Marken, 66-year-old male.

141
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,634
Stable vitals with
an arm laceration.

142
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,704
Christopher Marken, VSS.

143
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,002
42 years old with
single-leg crush injury.

144
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,338
Okay, put them to
bay 29 and bay 30.

145
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,900
I was trying to save our lives.

146
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,721
That car made a crazy
left. You made a crazy right.

147
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,577
There's no such
thing as a crazy right.

148
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,081
You're not
crossing traffic lines.

149
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,914
It's not my fault no one
uses their blinkers anymore.

150
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,563
No, it's your fault... Looks
like you're gonna have

151
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:55,783
as much fun as I am
tonight. I hate you.

152
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,155
Damn it.

153
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,195
Slow down. I'm on the Code Team.

154
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,962
Rules are rules.
Empty your pockets.

155
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,468
Phones, pagers...
Someone is dying in there.

156
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,165
He's over here.

157
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,442
Guy just dropped
like a sack of potatoes.

158
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,888
- Status, Hedera?
- Manny Harris.

159
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,505
Shallow to no
breathing. No pulse.

160
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,344
Chest compression
for three minutes.

161
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,815
Paddles.

162
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,743
Charge to 200. Charged.

163
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,113
Clear.

164
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,649
Going again.

165
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:35,987
Clear.

166
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,364
He's back.

167
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,100
It's faint, but he's back.

168
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,374
Did he complain about
anything before he collapsed?

169
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,469
No.

170
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,515
Hey, Jeffers, did he
say anything to you?

171
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,115
No, nothing.

172
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,058
Across, under, and through.

173
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,031
Always been more of a
scrubs and sneakers kind of guy.

174
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,828
Well, listen, Max, I need
to talk to you about tonight.

175
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,631
I think I have all
the salient details.

176
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:20,231
Schmooze donors, get money,
uh, hospital keeps running.

177
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,737
So this whole
evening is about you.

178
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,242
You're the face of
this hospital now,

179
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,247
and the donors are
gonna look to you

180
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:30,250
to see that you have plans
for fiscal responsibility.

181
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,912
So you need to assure them

182
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,983
that this hospital is
a good investment.

183
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,990
The fiscal thing is
really not my strong suit.

184
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,923
I prefer to talk
about the patients.

185
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,583
And does that work?

186
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,188
Not really, no.

187
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,997
How in God's name did you
ever raise money in Chinatown?

188
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,025
I had a secret weapon.

189
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,264
Really?

190
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,199
Well, dust it off, kid, because
you're gonna need it tonight.

191
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,175
I'll do my best.

192
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,670
Let me put this to you

193
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,508
a different way, Max.

194
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,548
Our last medical director raised

195
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:08,187
$3.4 million on
his first fund-raiser.

196
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,381
Big shoes.

197
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,184
And we fired him.

198
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:17,188
Hey. Did you, uh, get
that blood work I sent over

199
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,708
for Manny Harris in
the Corrections Ward?

200
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,394
Oh, I saw it, all right.

201
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,627
Well, I was hoping to get
your professional opinion.

202
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,466
My professional opinion? Yeah.

203
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,133
Well, my professional opinion

204
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,141
is that anybody in this hospital

205
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,734
could have read those labs,
and you only sent it to me

206
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,075
in a pathetic and
poorly veiled attempt

207
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,241
to make amends for insulting
my abilities as a doctor.

208
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,313
You're right.

209
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,979
I know I'm right.

210
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,920
Just didn't think that
you knew I was right.

211
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,753
All right, look,
I'm sorry, all right?

212
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,053
I am.

213
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,190
You're an exceptional
doctor, all right?

214
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,854
One of the best I've
ever worked with.

215
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,160
In fact, I'll never question
your judgment again.

216
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,030
Look, I owe you
a bottle of scotch

217
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,765
just for putting
up with me, okay?

218
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,668
All right, now this is
where you forgive me.

219
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,574
Fine, whatever.

220
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,411
As for your prisoner's
labs, the only thing of note

221
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,678
was that he tested
positive for Special K.

222
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,451
Ketamine. Wow.

223
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,318
He OD'd, huh? Yep.

224
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,519
But when I admitted
him a week ago,

225
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,559
he was clean as a whistle, so...

226
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,219
He got the K in here.

227
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,092
Looks like someone's
smuggling drugs

228
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,597
into our Corrections Ward.

229
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,526
Hey, you and the kids got this?

230
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,696
I need to get all
dolled up. Yeah, yeah.

231
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,706
Get out of here.
Drive safe, boys.

232
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,851
Hey, genius, what do you
got planned for us next year?

233
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,867
What, are we gonna get
our appendix removed?

234
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,655
I don't think we should go
on these trips anymore, Dad.

235
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,147
Clearly you're getting too old.

236
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,807
Says the man in the wheelchair.

237
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,476
What... What's wrong?

238
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,044
Bloom, get back here!

239
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,215
What happened? He
just started seizing.

240
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,521
Move that wheelchair!
I need Ativan, now!

241
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,108
I got his head. - I got him!

242
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,327
Bloom. What?

243
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,959
Grab his legs.

244
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,114
So...

245
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,481
Hey. Hey.

246
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,917
You ready to raise some money?

247
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,148
Absolutely. You know, I was

248
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,418
just about to chat up this man.

249
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,187
Looks like he has
about 14 yachts.

250
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,327
That's the caterer.

251
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,355
I meant, uh, the
guy next to him.

252
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,467
Andrew Nomura. Yeah.

253
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,627
Hedge fund. Mmm-hmm.

254
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,762
$1.2 billion. Ooh. Is that all?

255
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,363
Max, when you
go up... I got this.

256
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,068
I do.

257
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,012
You must be the
new medical director.

258
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,381
It's nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.

259
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:55,119
Um, I need to tell
you about a patient.

260
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,212
Um...

261
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,162
But, um, sorry.

262
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,928
I need to... Excuse me.

263
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,807
I thought I'd surprise you.

264
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,270
You look amazing.

265
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,878
I'm celebrating. Hmm.

266
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,382
With you.

267
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,088
Just like old times. Mmm-hmm.

268
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,323
Except tonight, we won't be
having sex in the coat room.

269
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,724
Says you.

270
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,687
What are the odds
of both men seizing

271
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,425
within minutes of
each other? Quite low.

272
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:40,262
I bet a seizure is why
the dad lost control

273
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,733
of the car. CTs?

274
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,599
Well, they look
normal, but the CSF

275
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,748
and the lumbar puncture showed
white and red cells for both.

276
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,772
I thought a hematologist
should take a closer look.

277
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,072
It could be infection.
Or exposure.

278
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,543
Which is why I paged you both.

279
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,455
And I believe in my heart
of hearts that you guys

280
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,505
are gonna figure
it out. "You guys"?

281
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,414
I am late for a
fund-raiser, Doctor.

282
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:58,911
Oh, that.

283
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,919
Guess who apologized.

284
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,116
No. Mmm.

285
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,191
It was a sincere
one, too, really gushy.

286
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,524
How'd you feel about that?

287
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,626
I don't know.

288
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,075
It was definitely
easier getting over him

289
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,590
when he was being a dick.

290
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,964
Hey, you gonna come
tonight? Um, I don't know.

291
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,801
We'll see. Come.

292
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,874
Well, you deserve
to have some fun.

293
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,107
Because of your
unusual symptoms,

294
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,545
it would be helpful to know
exactly where have you been

295
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,742
and whom you have
come in contact with.

296
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,660
Well, like I said, we've
been outside the country.

297
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,118
Begged to go to Hawaii,

298
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,451
but my son insisted
on northern Canada.

299
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,699
We take a father-son adventure

300
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:37,866
every year since my mom died.

301
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,222
Every year he complains.

302
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,590
Have you ever tried moose jerky?

303
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,204
- I - wanted to
see the glaciers.

304
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,254
Yeah, what's left of them.
The snow was so wet,

305
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,299
it was like trudging
through a Slurpee.

306
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,768
They don't appear to
understand the severity

307
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,064
of their current situation.

308
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,661
Good, let's keep it that way.

309
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,502
I believe this is Naegleriasis.

310
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:56,099
But there was no warm
water for swimming up there.

311
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,803
An arbovirus is more likely

312
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,311
if there were mosquitoes around.

313
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,507
Perhaps we should
test them for rabies.

314
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,514
If they slept in a
room with a bat...

315
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,275
If they'd slept in
a room with a bat,

316
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,320
I'm confident we'd
have heard about it.

317
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,721
So we do a full panel? Yeah.

318
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,825
Hey, wake up.

319
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,826
You could have
died today, Manny.

320
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,358
Yeah? Yeah.

321
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,094
I know it's rough in here,

322
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,103
but you using like
this, it could kill you.

323
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,229
What are you talking about?

324
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,936
Come on. The
Special K you're using.

325
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,875
"Special K"?

326
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,340
No, man. I don't do that stuff.

327
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,048
Well, your blood work
says otherwise, my friend.

328
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,017
I said I don't do that.

329
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:42,586
I'm just trying to do my bid
and get my ass up out of here.

330
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,588
Explain this.

331
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,852
Come on, man, that's
a new injection site,

332
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,225
from shooting up.

333
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,956
I ain't do nothing wrong.

334
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,198
I ain't even start it.

335
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,295
What do you mean? Start what?

336
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,463
The fight.

337
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,634
Guy came at me.

338
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,910
Things popped off...

339
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,411
Then she stepped in.

340
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,979
She did this to you?

341
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,081
Yeah, so?

342
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,888
She can't do that.

343
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,834
Why didn't you say anything?

344
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,803
To who?

345
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,497
Who cares about
what happens to us?

346
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,672
Mom, I'm not gonna sit here
and pretend that this is okay.

347
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,782
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

348
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,644
Mmm-hmm.

349
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,685
Yeah, bye.

350
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,458
Boo!

351
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,523
Oh, my gosh! Hi.

352
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,030
Hi, my little meerkat.

353
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,191
How you doing? Hi. Come here.

354
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,266
MclNTYRE: She remembered
every hallway, every turn.

355
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,395
- I couldn't keep up.
- Wow, amazing.

356
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,462
You look nice. You
look nice yourself.

357
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,632
Thank you.

358
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,599
So is everybody sad they have
to stay at home with Jessie?

359
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,871
They're watching a movie.

360
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,970
They're missing out.
Come on, let's go.

361
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,824
What if Grandpa and
Grandma are already there?

362
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,326
She couldn't stop talking
about them the whole way here.

363
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,717
Yeah, about that... About what?

364
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,445
Hey, relax.

365
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,486
Tonight's gonna
be great. You'll see.

366
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,723
Yeah, okay.

367
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,320
I have made myself
perfectly clear.

368
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,657
The tickets were for her.

369
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,288
I honestly don't see
how you could have

370
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,492
accidentally asked this
poor girl out on a date.

371
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,432
But she accepted.
Of course she did.

372
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,493
She was trapped behind
a croissant counter.

373
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,833
So what do I do?

374
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:39,964
"Do"?

375
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,871
You can't do
anything. It's a disaster.

376
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,375
Avoid her until you die.
Dr. Kapoor, Dr. Sharpe.

377
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,614
The Markens have
been moved into isolation,

378
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,857
and here are their test results.

379
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,407
Could you get us hard
copies? Printers are down.

380
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,953
Get IT on those printers and
find us another tablet, please.

381
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,044
Okay.

382
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,885
It's not Naegleriasis
or botulism.

383
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,185
It's not anything.

384
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,420
All their tests are clean.

385
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,059
But something's wrong with them.

386
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,834
There's one possibility
we have not yet considered.

387
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:16,768
Good evening.

388
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,573
Uh, I'm Dr. Max Goodwin,

389
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,678
Medical Director
of New Amsterdam,

390
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,980
and I need to fill this

391
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,110
weird thermometer
thing behind me

392
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,619
with, uh, your money.

393
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,684
Um...

394
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,525
I need to tell you
about a patient...

395
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:36,060
And... And why she matters to us

396
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,295
and why she should
matter to, um...

397
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,757
Um...

398
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,702
To you.

399
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,331
You can look forward to that

400
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,773
and, and much, much more.

401
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,639
Just a few minutes,

402
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,408
just, um, please enjoy
the free champagne.

403
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,520
I'm not busy or anything.

404
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,082
We have two
patients in isolation

405
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,718
who are exhibiting
identical symptoms.

406
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,093
They recently returned from
hiking the Canadian Rockies.

407
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,859
On melting permafrost.

408
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,696
We have tested them
for every known disease,

409
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,258
but nothing has
come back positive.

410
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,335
What's more, their condition
is only getting worse.

411
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,598
Their BPs are falling,
and their fevers are spiking.

412
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,164
As more and more ice thaws,

413
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,801
long-dormant
pathogens are waking up.

414
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,405
Are you telling me there
may be some ancient disease

415
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,744
floating around our hospital?

416
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,943
Yes, we are. Yeah,
that's about right.

417
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,721
Look, I'm not saying it
isn't some ancient pathogen

418
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,692
that we've never
heard of, can't test for,

419
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,887
and couldn't possibly treat.

420
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,726
I am simply suggesting
that we should focus

421
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,858
on other diseases that we
could actually, you know, cure.

422
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,896
We've been through
it, Max. Vasculitis?

423
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,530
Their kidney function's
fine. Carbon monoxide.

424
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,438
Wouldn't account
for the seizures.

425
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,635
Marantic endocarditis.

426
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,179
We'd have seen thrombotic
vegetations in the CTs.

427
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,778
Mercury poisoning?

428
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,919
I read the Arctic permafrost
has something like

429
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,289
20 swimming pools
of pure mercury.

430
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,129
The more the ice
melts, the more mercury

431
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,754
is released into the ecosystem.

432
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,799
Our patients hike
through, absorb it...

433
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,558
It would indeed
fit the symptoms.

434
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,830
We'll work up a treatment
of dimercaprol right away.

435
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,805
Great, and while you two
are here heroically saving lives,

436
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,899
I will be charming rich
people out of their money.

437
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,172
<i>I was left there in the dark</i>

438
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,873
<i>Blinded by your glowing light</i>

439
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,581
That is quite the dress.

440
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,087
Oh, thank you.

441
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,181
Uh, it is my response to wearing
formal scrubs for eight weeks straight.

442
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,689
How are you, Evie? Hi.

443
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,623
Oh, crap. I owe
you a call, don't I?

444
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,756
Oh, we were supposed to
grab lunch six months ago.

445
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:53,959
I'm so sorry.

446
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,161
Well, how are things
upstairs? It's good.

447
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,931
Just trying to keep
you troublemakers

448
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,870
out of trouble with
my bright legal mind.

449
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,339
Yeah, and how's Robert?

450
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,342
That man couldn't
handle anything real.

451
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,135
He couldn't handle a strong,

452
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,874
intelligent woman,
so he's black history.

453
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,282
I'm so happy I ran into you.
The legal department is...

454
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,929
Okay, I'm gonna stop
you there. Count me in.

455
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,031
But I need to cram at least
two drinks into my system,

456
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,933
so I can't get called back to
work, and you're gonna join me.

457
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,220
Absolutely.

458
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,902
And he wanted you
to know that he's sorry.

459
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,394
He's just...

460
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,387
curing an ancient disease.

461
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,399
And, yes, I do know
how that sounds.

462
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,196
Hello there.

463
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,534
Hi. Nice to see you.

464
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,684
<i>Bring the beat in</i>

465
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,974
Excuse me. Were you with
The Elizabeth Mills Company?

466
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,209
That's right, I was. I am.

467
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,647
I saw you perform at BAM.

468
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,009
That was extraordinary,
and you were wonderful.

469
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,246
Thank you.

470
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,584
I, uh, can't wait to get back.

471
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,155
Forgive me, I was just
gonna borrow this young lady

472
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,658
for a quick boogie.

473
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,630
<i>I'm knowing no pain</i>

474
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,629
Max.

475
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,234
Do you know who that
was? Andrew Nomura?

476
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,896
Worth only $1.2 billion?

477
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,994
Mmm-hmm.

478
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,507
If you want this
night to be a success,

479
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,171
you should really be dancing
with him right now. Mmm.

480
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,446
You know what? I'll ask
him to do the Funky Chicken

481
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,415
right after I'm
through with you.

482
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,079
Can I cut in?

483
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,280
<i>Fight through my tears</i>

484
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,652
This had better be good.

485
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,588
So you're saying my guards
are tranquilizing prisoners?

486
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,889
Not all of them, Gloria.

487
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,481
Just the newest
recruit. Codie Jeffers.

488
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,464
I believe she used
ketamine to sedate a guy

489
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,726
she felt was acting up.

490
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,428
Now, in an untrained
hand, that's potentially lethal.

491
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,060
That's a serious
accusation, Max.

492
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,915
We wouldn't be bringing it
to you otherwise, Warden.

493
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,016
Our floor isn't a cake-walk

494
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,720
but all of my guards
are thoroughly vetted.

495
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,902
I'm sure, but that doesn't
mean that a bad apple

496
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,879
won't slip through
from time to time.

497
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,050
You can't expect me to go
on the hearsay of one prisoner.

498
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:52,708
Is there proof?

499
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,719
Look, no, but this patient
was telling the truth.

500
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,649
I'm sorry, but Rikers is filled

501
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,089
with incredibly good liars.

502
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,626
Look, he's not
lying. Okay, okay.

503
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,753
The only way that we're
gonna solve this problem

504
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,263
is if we work together,
because the hospital and Rikers

505
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:06,765
are in a symbiotic relationship.

506
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,802
So we just want to support
you in correcting this.

507
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,167
"Support me"?

508
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,698
I'll run my prison.
You run your hospital.

509
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,339
Thank you, Warden.

510
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:24,074
I don't understand. Do you
think we have mercury poisoning?

511
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,312
Confirmatory tests
would take weeks.

512
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,345
Weeks you don't have.

513
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,356
We're acting now to give you
the best chance for survival.

514
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,719
We want to treat you
with an agent called BAL.

515
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,929
It binds to the mercury
and strips it out of your body.

516
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,393
What if we don't have
mercury poisoning?

517
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,330
Then it bonds to the
proteins in your blood

518
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,837
and strips them instead.

519
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,908
Which is why we'd like to start
by treating only one of you...

520
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,276
To see how you respond.

521
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:58,775
I'll go.

522
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,116
I'll go.

523
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,054
You do me. Dad, wait...

524
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,383
No.

525
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,925
I'm older. I'm your father.

526
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,559
And if something
were to go wrong...

527
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,991
Unfortunately, we're gonna need

528
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,363
to start with Christopher.

529
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,035
He's younger.

530
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,261
His system can better
handle the harsh side effects.

531
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,744
It's okay, Dad.

532
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:29,976
I got this.

533
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,222
<i>No one can tell you</i>

534
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,721
Are they stuck
in traffic or what?

535
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,421
Yeah, that's probably it, hon.

536
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,459
That one looks really
good, by the way.

537
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,658
Nuh-uh. It has to be perfect.

538
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,733
Can I get some more
napkins? Sure, honey.

539
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,671
Careful.

540
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,875
<i>Take off your armor</i>

541
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,606
Iggy, what's going on?

542
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,642
They bailed. No.

543
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,845
Yeah.

544
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,945
Yeah, last-minute
plans with old friends.

545
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,348
Decided it would be best
not to give us the wrong idea.

546
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,151
Direct quote. Unbelievable.

547
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,355
Why didn't you just tell her?

548
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,664
When?

549
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,301
How?

550
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,998
I don't even know what to say.

551
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,334
The truth would be a good start.

552
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:32,675
"The truth"?

553
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,272
That two gay dads
and their Muslim kids

554
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,043
aren't worthy of love?

555
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,713
She's already had one
family taken away from her.

556
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,502
Chris? Christopher!

557
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,403
What's happened to my boy?

558
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,737
- BP's bottoming out.
- Heart rate's climbing.

559
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,221
There's blood in the urine.
His kidneys are failing.

560
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,455
What's happening to my boy?

561
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,004
BAL is tearing through his body.

562
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,879
Pass me the Ambu bag.

563
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,077
It should have been me.

564
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:17,515
It's not mercury.

565
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,716
It should have
been me! I told you!

566
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,156
You should have tested it on me!

567
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,101
Is he gonna be all right?

568
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,038
We are in uncharted
waters here, Mr. Marken.

569
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,769
But... But you have to be
able to do something, right?

570
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,606
Your son's reaction to
the BAL has provided us

571
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,446
with invaluable information.

572
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:48,687
Information we will
use to seek out...

573
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,416
Another diagnosis.

574
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,618
So you really have no idea
what we have or how to cure it.

575
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,863
No.

576
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:07,764
Every year, um, we...

577
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:12,540
Take these adventures
together, and, uh...

578
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,742
And I complain, and...

579
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,912
Chris complains that I complain.

580
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,222
But the truth is, is that...

581
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,239
I look forward to these trips

582
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,425
more than anything in the world.

583
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,994
But...

584
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,997
Now that he's grown, I...

585
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,267
That's all...

586
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,440
That's the only time
that I have with him.

587
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,617
We don't get enough time.

588
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,456
We just don't get
enough time with our kids.

589
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,246
How do you want to handle this?

590
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,114
Well, if she gets away with
it once, she'll do it again.

591
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,816
We can't just wait around
until somebody dies.

592
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,518
But the Corrections
Ward is Salazar's domain.

593
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,601
Yeah, and we're the ones

594
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,953
that have to take
care of the patients.

595
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,588
Right, so if you piss off the
guards, what's gonna happen?

596
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,636
We lose our protection.

597
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,124
I don't know about you,
but I doubt our staff's

598
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,492
gonna want to go
in there without them,

599
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,996
which means the
patients would suffer,

600
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,796
so, if we're gonna fix
this we're gonna do it right.

601
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,879
What?

602
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,286
Another code. Corrections Ward.

603
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,223
I got to do something, Max.

604
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,702
<i>Let me take you there...</i>

605
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,286
This new director's so
radical, he's not even here.

606
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,425
If he wants us to pony up,

607
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,091
he should at least
make an appearance.

608
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,691
You're not giving this year?

609
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,770
Where are the
touching patient stories?

610
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,602
Where are the flashy speeches

611
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,301
about cutting-edge achievements?

612
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,774
'Cause I didn't
come for the food.

613
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,505
Don't knock it till you try it.

614
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,541
I'm sorry, I, um...

615
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,879
I've been on bed
rest, so, to me, this is...

616
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,015
It's like New Year's in Paris.

617
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,365
There are a few
things you should know

618
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,119
about the new medical director.

619
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,717
Uh, one, he is radical.

620
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:12,961
So radical that he turned
a failing clinic in Chinatown

621
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,694
into one of the most efficient
medical units in the city.

622
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,264
Two, he won awards

623
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,272
for his radical treatment
of women with Zika

624
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:21,568
in Guatemala.

625
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,072
Three...

626
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,539
There's north of $100
million in this room

627
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,342
ripe for the picking.

628
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,674
And you know where
Dr. Goodwin is?

629
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,879
With his patients.

630
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,387
A medical director
who's more interested

631
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,584
in helping the sick
than raising money?

632
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,757
I'd pony up for that.

633
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:48,563
I mean, of course I'm
glad he was so sincere,

634
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:51,570
but I shouldn't be so easily
swayed by an apology.

635
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,572
There's just this
spark between us,

636
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,505
and it tricks my stupid heart

637
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,385
into thinking that it could
work out, but it can't.

638
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,401
I mean, he said it can't, so...

639
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,214
I can't put myself
through that again. I can't.

640
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:06,944
Can I?

641
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,812
Are you sure I'm
the right guy to ask?

642
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,551
Because I'm five drinks in
and you're my boss' boss?

643
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,893
No, because I've been
married four times,

644
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:19,758
and after each divorce, I
swore I'd never do it again.

645
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,229
Yes, but you did.

646
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:23,826
Yeah, I did.

647
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,569
Why?

648
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,406
Because ignoring my feelings
didn't make them go away.

649
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,171
So I decided to ignore my fears.

650
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,140
Katy and I have been
together for nine years.

651
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:40,810
So I say run towards
love. You'll never regret it.

652
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,557
<i>I'll take you there</i>

653
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,751
<i>Ooh, I know a place</i>

654
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,495
Hey! Arrest me.

655
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,891
No pulse. Chest
compressions for five minutes.

656
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,628
Push one milligram of epi.

657
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:56,958
Hand me the paddles.

658
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,333
Clear.

659
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,410
Still no pulse.

660
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,451
Charge to 300. NURSE: Charged.

661
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,283
Clear.

662
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,722
He's back.

663
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,328
We got him.

664
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:37,634
Floyd?

665
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,573
Patient coming through.
Hemodynamically stable.

666
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,177
Let's get him to bay 10.
Sinus rhythm's steady.

667
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,588
As the drug wears off, I
want him monitored 24/7

668
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,320
in case he displays
any signs of tachycardia.

669
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,387
You coming? I'll be right there.

670
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,192
Floyd?

671
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,192
I've got this.

672
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,275
So, what, you were
punishing him for talking to me?

673
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,783
I didn't do anything.

674
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,617
Do you know you
could have killed him?

675
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,491
Sorry, Doc, I don't know
what you're talking about.

676
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,857
I know you're dosing
them with ketamine.

677
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,627
Why do you even care
what goes on up here?

678
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,225
These are my patients.

679
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,900
You think they're like
your compliant invalids

680
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,634
from downstairs.

681
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,570
These scum scream,

682
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,806
bite, spit.

683
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,878
Hey, you need more
help you ask the warden,

684
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,508
but you leave the
medicine to us, is that clear?

685
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,951
You do your job,
and I'll do mine.

686
00:30:56,121 --> 00:31:00,320
And I'm gonna do what it takes
to keep these bastards in line.

687
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,557
Finally, it's working.

688
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:15,497
For God's sake.

689
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:18,970
Useless technology.

690
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:26,864
You were right.
What do you mean?

691
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,853
You were right
from the very start.

692
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:32,386
The technology got it wrong.
Our test results got it wrong.

693
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,756
Think about it. This whole
time we've been testing

694
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,351
for today's pathogens,

695
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,795
but today's pathogens
are all mutated,

696
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:41,129
evolved variants of
much older strains.

697
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,659
What those men were
exposed to up there

698
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,038
was a much older strain...

699
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,436
of a very common infection.

700
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,773
So, even if it were a 99% match,

701
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,404
our equipment will still
read it as a negative result.

702
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,539
Exactly.

703
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,774
Their initial symptoms
were telling you

704
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,819
they were suffering
from Naegleriasis.

705
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,452
Our collective wisdom and
experience were telling us

706
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,423
they were suffering
from Naegleriasis.

707
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,652
And our equipment
could not see it.

708
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,725
This may be an ancient strain,

709
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,955
but it's essentially
the same old amoeba.

710
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,329
Which means today's
treatment should still be effective.

711
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,340
<i>I'll do mine, and I'm
gonna do what it takes</i>

712
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,398
<i>to keep these bastards in line.</i>

713
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,869
You asked for proof.

714
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,172
So?

715
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:32,217
Codie Jeffers is going to
be fired effective immediately.

716
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,250
Thank you, Dr. Reynolds.

717
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:35,987
This practice ends with her.

718
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,728
<i>He had his father's eyes</i>

719
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:46,857
<i>And his mother's point of view</i>

720
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,961
Grandpa and
Grandma are really late.

721
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,765
They're gonna
miss the whole party.

722
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,863
<i>He can see through</i>

723
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,466
They're not coming.

724
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,602
<i>Sometimes the little things...</i>

725
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,144
Not tonight, not tomorrow.

726
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,616
But they have to come.

727
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,652
It's been forever
since we've seen them.

728
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,588
I'm the only one who
even remembers them.

729
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,917
You know, sweetheart,
Grandma and Grandpa...

730
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:20,097
They don't really
understand our family.

731
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:25,060
Is something wrong
with our family?

732
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,238
No, no. God, no.

733
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,534
There's not a thing
wrong with our family.

734
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,471
Then why don't
they want to see us?

735
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:37,909
You know, most families,

736
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:42,151
they just wind up
together... Right?

737
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,798
They don't... They don't
have to think about it

738
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,188
or ever even stop and ask why.

739
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,657
They just are.

740
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,758
But you know what is
so super-duper special

741
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:50,955
about our family?

742
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,453
What?

743
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,100
We chose each other.

744
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,593
I chose you.

745
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,504
I chose your brothers
and your sister.

746
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,907
And I just wouldn't
want it any other way.

747
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,444
Me either.

748
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:18,881
So I'm... I'm gonna stop
feeling sorry for myself

749
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,791
I'm gonna stop feeling
sad for me and you,

750
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,795
and I'm gonna feel sad
for Grandma and Grandpa,

751
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:28,095
because they are choosing
to miss out on all of us.

752
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,829
All right?

753
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,334
Come here, come here.

754
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,130
Oh.

755
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,276
I love you, kiddo.

756
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,540
I love you. I love you, too.

757
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,157
<i>You don't need money</i>

758
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,685
<i>You don't need to try</i>

759
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,125
<i>We just need to make</i>

760
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,031
<i>A soul connection</i>

761
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,494
<i>We need to find</i>

762
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,539
<i>A soul connection</i>

763
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,701
<i>To find out</i>

764
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,507
<i>Find out</i>

765
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:15,377
<i>That what we have is real</i>

766
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,685
Hey.

767
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,814
<i>You don't need love</i>

768
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,185
Hey.

769
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,985
<i>You don't need to be</i>

770
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,588
Come with me.

771
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,796
<i>We just need to make</i>

772
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,889
<i>A soul connection</i>

773
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,057
<i>We need to find</i>

774
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,768
<i>A soul connection</i>

775
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,472
Lauren, I thought you left.

776
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,598
Hey, uh, I want to
introduce you to someone.

777
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,207
This is Dr. Floyd Reynolds,
Chief of Cardiac Surgery.

778
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,345
He can definitely handle a
strong, intelligent woman,

779
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,576
and he is ready
for something real.

780
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,715
Uh, this is Evie Garrison,

781
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,914
Associate Director
of our legal team.

782
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,525
I think you two are
really gonna hit it off.

783
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,825
Well, that was...

784
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,132
very Lauren, wasn't it?

785
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,767
It's nice to meet you, Floyd.

786
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,309
It's very nice to meet you, too.

787
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,470
<i>Baby, it's burning</i>

788
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,706
<i>Looks like we made...</i>

789
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,318
The treatment's working.

790
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,162
Looks like this won't
be your last adventure.

791
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:46,567
Next year, Dad...

792
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,303
Hawaii.

793
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,408
I promise.

794
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:05,223
Assuming by the outfit
that we're not all going

795
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,758
to die of an ancient virus?

796
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,418
At least not today.

797
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,655
It will happen in our lifetime,

798
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,263
and we are not ready.

799
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:18,699
If you'll please excuse me.

800
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,297
I am so sorry for
keeping you waiting.

801
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,365
Oh, no, you were
curing a disease,

802
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,638
and I was eating,
like, 500 shrimp,

803
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,111
so we're even.

804
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,140
Ella...

805
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:37,050
I never meant to ask you out.

806
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,453
In fact, I was, uh...

807
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,987
I was attempting to
offer you both my tickets,

808
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,496
but I did not know
how to clear it up

809
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:50,968
without feeling as foolish
as I am feeling right now.

810
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,800
So we're having the same
nervous breakdown all night,

811
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,803
because I was worried
that you thought...

812
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,343
No, no, no. I was worried
that you thought that...

813
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,145
Wait, so you didn't want
to come here at all tonight?

814
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,149
Why not?

815
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:11,655
Every year, I used to attend
this event with my late wife.

816
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,351
And being here, uh,

817
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,387
made me miss her all the more.

818
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,964
I am so sorry I have
been unavailable all night,

819
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:30,065
but I am here now, and
I am ready to charm you.

820
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,502
Don't bother.

821
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,107
Certainly saves me some time.

822
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,450
Every year, the medical
director corners me,

823
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,351
charms me, says
whatever they can to get me

824
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,412
to open up my wallet.

825
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,684
But you...

826
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,223
You actually put
your patients first...

827
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,457
above all this.

828
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,867
I haven't seen that before.

829
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,101
Big shoes filled...

830
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,907
and then some.

831
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,473
<i>All we ever do</i>

832
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,751
<i>Is all we ever knew</i>

833
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,349
<i>All we ever do</i>

834
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:25,486
<i>It's time to wake up from this</i>

835
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,666
<i>La la la la la la</i>

836
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,809
<i>La la la la la la</i>

837
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,450
Excuse me, um...

838
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,191
Would you like to dance?

839
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:08,597
Now, you didn't happen
to say something to, uh...

840
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:09,971
Andrew Nomura?

841
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,670
Worth less than
$1.2 billion now...

842
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,813
Huh. Thanks to you.

843
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:20,682
You're my secret weapon.

844
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:33,692
Hey. Mmm.

845
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,126
I've been thinking
about something all night.

846
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,691
Coat room. No.

847
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:40,635
Our living situation. Yep.

848
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,266
Well, with baby out of danger,

849
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,402
I, um... I don't really need

850
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,105
a doctor living with me anymore.

851
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,909
Right, well, you know,

852
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,449
I thought maybe
after a few dates...

853
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,644
I don't need a few dates, Max.

854
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,382
I just need you.

855
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,586
Move back in with me.

856
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,070
What's wrong?

857
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:18,569
I can't... I can't.

858
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,548
Why not?

859
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,916
I need to tell you...

860
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,759
about a patient.

861
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,758
The fund-raiser's over.

862
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,867
Hold on to me.

863
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,297
What is it?

864
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,602
And hold on tight.

865
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:08,892
Oh, God...

866
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,295
Oh, God.
