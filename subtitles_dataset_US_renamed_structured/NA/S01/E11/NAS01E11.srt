00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,823
<i>Dr. Ryan to Pediatrics.</i>

2
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,164
<i>Dr. Ryan to Pediatrics.</i>

3
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,631
There he is. Hey.

4
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,573
Right on time.
Reporting for duty.

5
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:45,579
I half expected I'd have to
physically drag you out of your office.

6
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,411
Have you met the group?

7
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,979
Uh... No actually, uh...
Come. Don't be shy.

8
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,981
Morning everyone. Morning.

9
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,520
Hey. This is Max.

10
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,419
It's his first day.

11
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,788
Why are you in scrubs?

12
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,293
Oh, I'm a doctor. Mmm. Where?

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,794
Here. WILLOW: Nice.

14
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,660
I wish I could do
chemo at Whole Foods,

15
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,926
but we're not even
allowed to use our phones.

16
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,525
Mmm-hmm. Uh, Max,
this is Mr. Kiggens.

17
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,001
"Big Mike." Yeah, clearly.

18
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,629
That's Willow. Smart,
bringing your own food.

19
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,368
No one delivers here. Really?

20
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,444
And Millie. Don't
be scared, Max.

21
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,104
We don't bite.

22
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,774
Uh, no, thank
you, but I'm not...

23
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,881
I'm not scared. Okay.

24
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:27,711
Hey, you know, why don't you
join us? We need a fourth for euchre.

25
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:31,019
You know what, I would love to,
but I actually got the, uh, to-go chemo.

26
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,670
It's fewer calories, so...
Max, it's three hours.

27
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,162
You can't stay put
for three hours?

28
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,773
Yeah, no, I would, but
you know me and sitting.

29
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,397
It's just not a good...
Have a good game.

30
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,727
Good luck out there.

31
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,807
You know, a doctor with an IV
pole is gonna frighten patients.

32
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:47,966
That's a good point.

33
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,875
Why don't we just, uh, do this.

34
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,304
There we go.

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,576
Meet Earl, my new sidekick.

36
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,551
Oh, yeah, that's much better.

37
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,483
Right? A smiling bag of poison.

38
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:00,680
Yep, going full chemo.

39
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,154
Please don't say that. Got it.

40
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:06,250
I know that at some
point I'm gonna be useless.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,856
Thanks for not disagreeing.

42
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,659
Well, we both
know what's coming.

43
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:14,190
And, uh, after what happened in Cold Spring,
I can't just let the hospital fall apart.

44
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,931
I mean, I need to find someone
who can, you know, take over

45
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,099
when I'm, uh... When I can't...

46
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,245
Will you be my deputy
medical director?

47
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,712
Sorry, I don't know why that
sounded like I was asking you to prom.

48
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,245
I'm flattered, of course.

49
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,055
My friend Earl, here, doesn't
think you look flattered.

50
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,959
I've already cut back on
my public appearances.

51
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,530
If I cut back any more, we're
gonna start to lose funding.

52
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:46,465
Okay, yeah.
Well, think about it.

53
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:50,401
Otherwise I'm gonna have to
give my friend Earl, here, a sad face.

54
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:01,581
Uh, was that our medical director
attached to an IV of cis-platinum?

55
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,310
Don't ask.

56
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,116
Why are you here?

57
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,583
Uh, tough one.

58
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,282
Uh, because this is a
hospital and I'm a doctor.

59
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,825
You said that you were
gonna take some time off.

60
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,325
Well, that was before.

61
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:17,455
I mean, Max needs
my help, clearly.

62
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,400
Sweetheart, this is important.

63
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,935
You need to take
care of yourself.

64
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,301
And I am going to, okay.

65
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,005
I'm just gonna do it
without leaving the hospital.

66
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,739
I flushed all my
pills this morning.

67
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,642
You know I'm going cold turkey?

68
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,907
Yes, it is gonna
suck for a while,

69
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,472
but it's what I need to
do. And not just for me.

70
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,607
For Max.

71
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,245
Oh.

72
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,350
Ooh, triage. Gotta run.

73
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,492
Damn it, Andy.

74
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,534
Triage said an acute
coronary syndrome in here.

75
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,502
I did not use those words
'cause I don't know them,

76
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,266
but it had to sound serious

77
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,117
or they would have given
me to one of your residents.

78
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:04,270
Yeah, well, you nearly
gave me an acute coronary.

79
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,479
Did you do something
new with your hair?

80
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,186
All right, Andy,
what's the story?

81
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,113
My knee's been swelling up.

82
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,213
I can't move it without...

83
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,653
Patel, let's, uh, let's
drain Andy's knee.

84
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,350
Hey, take your time, LB.

85
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,958
Clean sheets.

86
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,403
Tony, I know it's difficult
to talk about the attack but

87
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,166
you should.

88
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:42,176
I was painting up in Mohonk.

89
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,912
Lots of light.

90
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,053
My dad came with
me, so I was annoyed.

91
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,982
I'd wanted to go solo.

92
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,317
But it's good he was there,

93
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,421
'cause when I moved my
easel near the tree line, I...

94
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,490
I saw this shape.

95
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,530
Okay. Tell me more about that.

96
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,933
It was daytime.

97
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,907
They're nocturnal, right?

98
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,233
Yeah.

99
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,445
It shouldn't have been there.

100
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,442
But I saw it, and it just...

101
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,281
it just stared at me.

102
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,949
Mmm.

103
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:23,348
And then it started running

104
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,415
right at me

105
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,290
and then I turned
and ran, and I'm fast.

106
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,862
I used to run track, but
I didn't make it two feet.

107
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,031
Before it... Before...

108
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,771
So...

109
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,076
before this most recent
attack, you hadn't seen the wolf

110
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,975
in over a month, correct?

111
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,277
Uh...

112
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,549
Yeah.

113
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,882
Hey, Tony, is the, um...

114
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,956
is the wolf here right now?

115
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,433
Okay, all right. Here's
what we're gonna do.

116
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,605
I am gonna go get your dad,
and we are going to talk next steps.

117
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,581
Okay?

118
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,776
Right. Okay.

119
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,926
Oh, my God, this is Rohan.

120
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:40,934
I mean, I thought it might be because
he has the same... but I didn't wanna...

121
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,333
okay, I'm done.

122
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,995
Hi. Hi. Oh, it's so
nice to meet you.

123
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,870
Your dad talks about
you all the time. He does?

124
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,805
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Ella.

125
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,437
Now he's blushing,
so this is a disaster.

126
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,608
I'm gonna go, but I
hope I see you again.

127
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,212
You talk about me?

128
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,986
Uh, yes. I wanted to get you a
gift, and Ella was helping me.

129
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,322
What kind of gift?

130
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,623
We've not decided,

131
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,007
but I didn't want to get you
something which meant something

132
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,364
other than what I
wanted it to mean.

133
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,458
Oh, that's...

134
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,197
that's thoughtful.

135
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,905
There is something...
Yes, tell me.

136
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,309
I told you about the songs
I'm writing? Mmm-hmm.

137
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,810
Well, I'd love to make a demo,

138
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,814
and to do that, I
need to rent a studio.

139
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,384
I was wondering if
you could, you know...

140
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,850
Give you money?

141
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,652
I don't think it's a good idea.

142
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,527
Okay. Okay. Baby steps, right?

143
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,330
LB. How's that knee doing?

144
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,030
It's better. Oh.

145
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,268
So why are you still here?

146
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,344
I meant better than bad,

147
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,935
which is still, you
know, not good.

148
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,015
All right, Andy. Why don't you
tell me what's really going on?

149
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,219
My shelter voucher
doesn't start till Saturday,

150
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,722
so I got four
days on the street.

151
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,223
So I thought...

152
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,782
We're a hospital, okay?

153
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,361
You don't warrant
an overnight stay. Yet.

154
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,794
Just do some more digging.

155
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:21,095
There's gotta be something else wrong
with me. I'm a very unhealthy person.

156
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,567
You paged?

157
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,694
Uh, yeah.

158
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,137
Yeah, is, uh, now a bad time?

159
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,434
For both of you?

160
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,906
Oh, yeah. What do you got?

161
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,615
You said you wanted to know the
next time a frequent flyer came in.

162
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,556
Yeah, frequent flyers
mean we're not doing our job.

163
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,878
Oh, well, then you're in luck.

164
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,713
Meet the Amelia
Earhart of frequent flyers,

165
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,047
Andy Keener.

166
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,088
How can I help?

167
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,553
Looking good, Dr. Reynolds.

168
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,889
Just hold it there.

169
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,756
Fantastic.

170
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,627
That's perfect. Thanks, Chris.

171
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,231
That was great.

172
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,165
This is going to come
together seamlessly.

173
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,103
I thought Fred Niemens usually
does the, uh, medical articles?

174
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:03,906
My editor thought the personal angle
would be better for The Face of Diversity.

175
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,275
Is that the angle?

176
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,109
I figured we'd start
with a profile on you

177
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,540
and then talk about how you've
put together your department.

178
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,752
Okay. For your
profile, I was thinking

179
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,018
it's a "rags to riches" story.

180
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,348
I already know the layout.

181
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,932
Just below the headline, there'll
be these two pictures of you

182
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,254
where you are now

183
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,516
right next to this.

184
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,442
I wanna know the details of what
led to the mug shot, so we can...

185
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,798
This interview is over.

186
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,096
Wait.

187
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,476
Um, sorry, I didn't mean...

188
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,279
Your chemo bag is
making people nervous.

189
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,617
Yeah, sorry, just one more hour.

190
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,623
And by "people," I mean me.

191
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:54,317
Did you know that Andy Keener has
been in this hospital over 100 times?

192
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,056
He's a frequent flyer.

193
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,840
If my math is correct,
and I'm pretty sure that it is,

194
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:02,996
Andy Keener has cost New
Amsterdam $1.4 million this year.

195
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,140
And we haven't done
a thing to help him.

196
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:17,043
Andy Keener has rung up over $1
million in charges here at New Amsterdam.

197
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,177
That is enough for
50,000 prenatal visits,

198
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:24,850
two liver transplants, or,
you know, one NBA contract.

199
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,019
How do we lower this
number right there?

200
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,324
Don't look at me.

201
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,743
Well, he's had over 30 visits
and three surgeries for a foot ulcer.

202
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,396
He walks around all day. He
can't keep his foot elevated.

203
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,905
Look, bandages fall off,
antibiotic creams get lost.

204
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,067
Okay, Bloom. ED's number one on
the hospital encounters hit parade.

205
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,179
My ED is open 24/7,
so if he wants to get out

206
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:49,080
of the rain, or snow, or
sun, or get a hot meal, then...

207
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:54,553
Got it. Neurology. 10 EEGs and
18 head CT scans this year alone.

208
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,180
All indicated and necessary.

209
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,090
Andy falls, and gets beaten
up, and has a withdrawal seizure.

210
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,185
EMTs bring him in and we
give him the same evaluation

211
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,855
we would give to anyone else.

212
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,729
Yeah, Helen, you can't tell me that
all these biopsies were necessary.

213
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,677
Well, if we don't have
a patient's family history

214
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,567
then all concerns have
to be taken seriously.

215
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,698
Psychiatry, help me out. There's
gotta be a way to save a dollar.

216
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,435
Just one dollar.

217
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:18,740
Uh, no. No can do, Doc. Andy
suffers from PTSD and depression.

218
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,906
An abusive childhood will do that to
you. Not to mention, he is an alcoholic.

219
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,711
Multiple detox stays.

220
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,977
Okay, so what
everyone is telling me

221
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:30,489
is that not only was there no
way to avoid spending $1.4 million

222
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,150
on Andy Keener this year,
but apparently there's no way

223
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,891
to avoid spending another $1.4
million on Andy Keener next year?

224
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,095
Yes? Yes, I was
hoping to meet Earl.

225
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,604
Is Earl here? Is
he coming later?

226
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:48,733
Not here, okay.

227
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,175
Hey, Max, hold up. You
got a fix for Andy Keener?

228
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:55,112
No, apparently I missed the Solve-America's-Homeless-
Epidemic class in med school.

229
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,615
Fair enough. All right, so, uh,

230
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:59,676
look, a reporter from <i>The New
England Cardiothoracic Journal</i>

231
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:00,981
dug up some dirt on me.

232
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,148
Some dirt that... That
could embarrass the hospital.

233
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,158
Define "dirt."

234
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,252
Ten years ago I was
arrested and, um,

235
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,495
she wants to print my mug shot.

236
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,861
Every time I think
this is dead and buried

237
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,663
it just keeps popping
back up in my life,

238
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,772
and I never wanted to be a
burden to you or this hospital.

239
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,170
You're not.

240
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,270
You wanna tell me what happened?

241
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,810
Do I have to?

242
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,142
Well, if I knew the story,
would I trust you less?

243
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,339
No.

244
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,328
Would it make me think
less of you as a surgeon?

245
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:31,677
No.

246
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,549
Then I don't need to know,
and neither does anybody else.

247
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,658
I just don't want anyone
to think less of me.

248
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,660
Patients, colleagues...
They won't.

249
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,958
Let's go full chemo
on this. "Full chemo"?

250
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,021
Let's get legal to bring
down the hammer.

251
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,161
I wanna keep him overnight
for observation. The, um...

252
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,564
The delusions are back, full-on.

253
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:53,965
I'm, uh...

254
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,565
I'm so sorry, Hector.

255
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,179
This last attack, he was

256
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,177
screaming.

257
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,744
Clawing at his throat.

258
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,721
He thought he was dying.

259
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,821
My little boy.

260
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,759
How's he supposed
to live like this?

261
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,328
I mean, what's he
gonna do when I'm gone?

262
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:31,373
I've been reading about,
uh, "deep brain stimulation"?

263
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:35,206
Deep brain stimulation is not
designed for psychological issues.

264
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,240
It's for, um... It's
for Parkinson's.

265
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,917
It's people with
physical ailments.

266
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,715
But there's trials
happening right now.

267
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,086
Yes, Hector.

268
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:47,259
A handful of patients with
delusional disorders have tried it, but,

269
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,790
you know, the side
effects are not...

270
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,725
we're not talking scars, here.

271
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,295
The kind, funny, artistic son
that you know and love right now?

272
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,601
It can change
Tony's personality.

273
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,810
Ativan,

274
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,381
Paxil, Klonopin,

275
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,217
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

276
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,713
Hypnosis, ECT.

277
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,756
Electricity shooting
through my <i>cariño's</i> brain.

278
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,949
That hasn't changed him?

279
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,557
'Cause it has.

280
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,659
We can try a
compassionate-use trial.

281
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:35,407
But, Hector, you gotta know that if
you send your son in for this surgery,

282
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,340
you may not recognize
the person that you get back.

283
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,911
Do you understand?

284
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,649
If helping him means
losing some of him,

285
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,123
parts of him I love,

286
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,926
I'll pay the price.

287
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,497
Hey, there. You okay?

288
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,334
No.

289
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,475
Got a migraine,
among other things.

290
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,369
Did we... Did we page you?

291
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,344
No. No, I just got
you some ginger tea.

292
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,473
Okay.

293
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,848
Why?

294
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:23,011
Because ginger is a miracle
cure-all for the whole system.

295
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,050
Wait, are you monitoring me?

296
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,184
No.

297
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,388
I'm just checking up on you.

298
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,795
Oh, I'm sorry, I
thought I was an adult.

299
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,959
I didn't realize I
needed a babysitter.

300
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,132
Lauren... You know
what, don't, okay?

301
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,398
I am leaving now,

302
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,700
'cause, you know,
I've got an ED to run.

303
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,641
<i>Born a son</i>

304
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:51,015
<i>Feel the pull from inside of you</i>

305
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,550
<i>The world's behind</i>

306
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,721
Oh, hey.

307
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:56,983
Hey.

308
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,257
Ella, right? Yeah.

309
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,220
Are you... Are you
waiting for your dad?

310
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,727
Oh, no.

311
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,389
Just taking advantage
of the free Wi-Fi.

312
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,988
Have a seat. Thanks.

313
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,167
What are you writing?

314
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,595
Nothing.

315
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:15,367
Oh, no, come on. We've known
each other a whole two minutes now.

316
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,668
I'm a songwriter.

317
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,409
Go ahead, take your best shot.

318
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,714
Oh, I should have known your dad
would raise the sensitive, artistic type.

319
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,052
Back then he didn't
do much raising.

320
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,681
Right, sorry.

321
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,625
Uh, he's just been
so generous with me.

322
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,059
I didn't mean to... "Generous"?

323
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,424
How?

324
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,965
Oh, my God, he totally
saved my dog's life.

325
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,459
My dad's still a human
neurologist, right?

326
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,628
Yep.

327
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,300
But, uh, he paid for
my dog's surgery.

328
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,238
He did? Yeah.

329
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,911
Gave me $2,000.

330
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,306
I didn't even have to ask.

331
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,451
Wow.

332
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:04,647
Bloom?

333
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,955
We've been trying to help Andy
Keener entirely the wrong way.

334
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,726
Are you screaming
right now, or is it just me?

335
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,594
I figured out what to give him.

336
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,927
Andy? ANDY: G.

337
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,162
Um...

338
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,170
We have done you
a great disservice.

339
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,900
You guys have the
best service in New York.

340
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,533
Every time you've
come to this hospital,

341
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,170
we have focused on treating
a whole host of symptoms.

342
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:28,146
I'd give you five stars on
Yelp if I had a computer.

343
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,113
That ends today. Scrips?

344
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,983
The, uh, fatigue, stress, heart
arrhythmia, malnutrition, you name it,

345
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,988
each of these
symptoms is the result of

346
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,253
you not having a stable
living environment.

347
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,693
This cure will fix all of that.

348
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,093
Mr. Keener...

349
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,331
I am prescribing you a home.

350
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,956
Morning.

351
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,618
Max in yet? Haven't seen him.

352
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,557
Day two can hit you
like a ton of bricks.

353
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,996
He might still be in bed. Okay.

354
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,830
Well, if you do see him...

355
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,233
I made it, I'm here. Sorry.

356
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,861
I made it. Call off the dogs.

357
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,338
How do you feel?
Oh, like a million bucks

358
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,240
that was shoved dollar by dollar
through an industrial shredder

359
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,823
and then set on
fire with a blowtorch.

360
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,473
Your feet, huh?
Points for Big Mike.

361
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,210
Swollen and sore. Thank you.

362
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,561
You should borrow some
Crocs from the nurses' stash.

363
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,885
They're super ugly but
they do make a difference.

364
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,424
And then you should...
You should sit down.

365
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,049
You should join us for euchre.

366
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,718
We could still use a fourth.

367
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:52,595
Appreciate the generous offer, Millie,
but this hospital never sleeps, so...

368
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,698
Back at it. I'm
going mobile again.

369
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:56,930
Max.

370
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,729
They know what they're
talking about. You should listen.

371
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,571
Well, Willow was
right. They are ugly,

372
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,772
but, man, I feel like
I'm walking on clouds.

373
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,850
Mmm. And Earl is
shaping up... I know, right?

374
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,715
To be far creepier than any
plastic bag has a right to be.

375
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,584
Now, that's just
mean, all right?

376
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,213
Maybe he could use a hat.

377
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:18,924
I, um...

378
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,257
I want you to know that I've
truly considered your offer...

379
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,556
Great.

380
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,925
And I...

381
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,695
I can't be your deputy, Max. Oh.

382
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:35,064
I'm barely maintaining the
commitments I already have,

383
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,576
and as you know I'm knee-deep
in oocyte cryopreservation.

384
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,135
When the time comes to
move forward with implantation...

385
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,908
I understand, I do.

386
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,773
What about Bloom?

387
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,583
Bloom? Yeah, she's reliable.

388
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,950
She's great under pressure.

389
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,553
Let me get back to you. Okay.

390
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:58,389
<i>The wheels on the
bus go round and round</i>

391
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:01,161
<i>Round and round, round and round</i>

392
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,929
So he really has to
be awake for this?

393
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,632
Yeah, yeah. It reduces the
risk of damaging critical areas

394
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,799
that control speech
and other skills.

395
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:12,242
And we can't have him draw,
so singing is the next best thing.

396
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,245
<i>Go round and round</i>

397
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:18,010
<i>Round and round, round and round</i>

398
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,416
Very good, Tony. Keep going.

399
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,087
Advancing the wire.

400
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,190
<i>The wheels on
the bus go round...</i>

401
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,659
<i>And...</i>

402
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:29,785
Pull back.

403
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:30,955
<i>Round</i>

404
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:36,030
<i>Round and round All through</i>

405
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,603
Let's keep going.

406
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,801
You know, you've raised
an amazing young man.

407
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:47,545
For his 13th birthday, he
begged me to take him to the Uffizi.

408
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,849
What kind of kid begs
to go to the Uffizi?

409
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,110
But I took him,

410
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,054
and he marched straight
up to <i>The Birth of Venus.</i>

411
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,184
Studied every detail.

412
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,954
And he knew what he
wanted to be when he grew up.

413
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,123
But then the wolf appeared

414
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,731
and never left.

415
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,637
And all that potential...

416
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,199
I just I hope the wolf goes away
so he can be that man again.

417
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,478
Max.

418
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,991
You must really enjoy
putting me through this,

419
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,583
because that is the only
explanation I can come up with.

420
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,924
Probably, but, uh, what
are we talking about?

421
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,396
Just explain to me
why I got a phone call

422
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,989
from a landlord on First Avenue

423
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,093
asking me if Andy
Keener has any pets.

424
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,001
Oh, that. I can explain that.

425
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,437
Yeah, I sure hope you can.

426
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,907
Yeah, uh, since I've only
been here at New Amsterdam

427
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:53,741
for a few weeks, the landlord
wouldn't let me co-sign his lease.

428
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:56,543
So, I, um, put your name down.

429
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:57,742
Did you? Yeah.

430
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,250
And who is Andy Keener, and

431
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:02,017
why are we renting
an apartment for him?

432
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:05,216
Uh, Andy is a,
um, frequent flyer.

433
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:09,752
His homelessness has cost this
hospital over $1 million this year alone,

434
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:14,094
and many of those costs will go away if
Andy simply has a full-time place to stay.

435
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,796
I mean, renting this man an apartment is
actually gonna save this hospital money.

436
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,099
So you suddenly decided
to care about money.

437
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,937
Well, I care about money
when it's only going to one patient

438
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,352
when it should be
going to thousands.

439
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,641
Right, so let's say I let
you do this, hypothetically.

440
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,738
Okay. And we rent this
apartment for a year.

441
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,216
Right. And then Andy
gets back on his feet

442
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,946
and he pays for
it himself, right?

443
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:37,080
No, we would be
paying for it for a while.

444
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:38,618
How long is "a while"?

445
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,284
Just, you know, forever.

446
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,827
Oh, Max. No, look,

447
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,659
I'm already solving one enormous
fiscal problem for this hospital.

448
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,665
I can't also solve...
This is socialism.

449
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,801
This is exactly what's wrong
with our whole health care system.

450
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,169
You're right. Somebody
really should fix it.

451
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,400
So this guy abuses the system
and he gets a free apartment.

452
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,822
What about all the other guys
who are working their asses off?

453
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,966
You think this is fair to
them? It's not fair to them,

454
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,811
but it's smart business for us.

455
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:08,081
We're talking about saving
over $1 million a year.

456
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,917
That's $1 million
that could be spent

457
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,356
on those very people who
are working their asses off.

458
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,484
Who do deserve more.

459
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,835
Andy better not have any pets.

460
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,441
Hey. Oh, no tea today?

461
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,669
No tea.

462
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,008
Just, uh... I'm sorry.

463
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,173
You were right. I was hovering.

464
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:37,978
But that's not because
I don't trust you.

465
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,780
I want to help you.

466
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,844
I obviously have no
idea how to do that.

467
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,465
Oh, that's all right.

468
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:46,323
I know your people like to
think that tea fixes everything.

469
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:47,669
Wow. That was
pretty good, right?

470
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,855
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a horrible accent.

471
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,462
So, look, I'm sorry too.

472
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,660
I shouldn't have
been so defensive.

473
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,863
Just, it was a lot rougher
than I thought it was gonna be.

474
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:03,035
You seem better today. Yeah.

475
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,405
Yeah, I, uh...

476
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,336
I got a lot of sleep.

477
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,373
Uh, okay, I gotta go to work.

478
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,912
Do you maybe want to grab
some dinner after work today?

479
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,646
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

480
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,189
Just, uh, meet me back
here when you're done.

481
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,884
Yeah. Okay.

482
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,861
I heard.

483
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,331
I'm sorry.

484
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,992
Yeah, thanks.

485
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,898
Max wants me to go "full chemo"

486
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,941
on this reporter.

487
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,236
I don't know what that means,

488
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,005
exactly, but here
are a few options.

489
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,205
Okay.

490
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,942
Step one, we pull the interview.

491
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,177
If she wants to write about a
10-year-old arrest, she can go right ahead,

492
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,119
but she can expect a
defamation suit to follow.

493
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,713
No doubt she indemnified the
publisher when she was hired,

494
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,056
so when we threaten to sue her
for libel and demand damages,

495
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,028
the onus will be on her.

496
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,895
Not on <i>The New England
Cardiothoracic Journal.</i>

497
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,758
And that's just step one?

498
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,229
Do you want to go
"full chemo" or not?

499
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,069
I can make it so this Penny
Atwater can't find a job

500
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,576
at <i>The New England
Journal of Trout Fishing.</i>

501
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,245
Damn, you're good.

502
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,642
It's just so typical.

503
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,449
It's like if you're
African-American

504
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,143
and you're exemplary,

505
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,084
they're always
looking for a catch.

506
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:25,885
I just want my nephew

507
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:31,089
to know that you can be exemplary
without a catch, you know?

508
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,962
As your legal representation,

509
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,763
I can make this all go away.

510
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,668
But as your girlfriend,

511
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,641
I think you should
own your story.

512
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,744
Not in spite of your nephew.

513
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,748
Because of your nephew.

514
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,351
He should know the truth.

515
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,119
All of it.

516
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,299
Well,

517
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,691
here we are.

518
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:21,480
It's safe to come
all the way in.

519
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,892
Well, will you look at that?

520
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,058
Stove works. Good to know.

521
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,736
I haven't made
myself a cup of coffee

522
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:48,667
in decades.

523
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:54,207
Look, Andy, uh, I know
this place isn't much but...

524
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,576
No.

525
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,916
It's an awful lot, Dr. Goodwin.

526
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,649
When do I need
to be out of here?

527
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:07,024
No, uh, this isn't temporary.

528
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,221
Andy, this place is yours
as long as you want it.

529
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,355
Just no pets.

530
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,261
Other than that,
you make the rules.

531
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,230
All of this is mine?

532
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,071
Welcome home, Andy.

533
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,063
Floyd?

534
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,034
You wanna begin?

535
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,909
Yeah.

536
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,807
It was, uh...

537
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,584
It was 2008.

538
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,752
Election night.

539
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,952
And we're having this big party

540
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,784
out in Connecticut where I
was interning at a hospital.

541
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:17,720
And, uh,

542
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,797
it was electric.

543
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:25,295
I remember I never felt so,
uh, empowered, you know?

544
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,428
So present.

545
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,841
So American.

546
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,273
I felt invincible and

547
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:35,137
I was on my way home
back to my apartment,

548
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:39,309
and I remember I rolled the windows
down so that I could feel that cool breeze.

549
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,185
And the empty road.

550
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,686
And then

551
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,612
flashing red lights.

552
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,622
Siren.

553
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,285
I was getting pulled over.

554
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,656
And I checked the speedometer,
only three miles over the speed limit.

555
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,766
Officer asked me to step out.

556
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,497
Still had on my scrubs.

557
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,805
Showed him my hospital
badge but he didn't like my tone.

558
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,834
And I begged him.

559
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,974
I begged him to
just give me a ticket.

560
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,439
Nope.

561
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:11,173
There I was, face-down
on my own hood

562
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,809
with my arms cuffed
behind my back

563
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:17,281
on a night that started
out at my dream internship

564
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:21,020
celebrating this newfound
hope for America.

565
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,326
Ended with me in a holding
cell, stripped of my dignity.

566
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,961
Waiting for my sister to catch the
next train up, so she could bail me out.

567
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,175
Not even a Morehouse
College license plate

568
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,541
or a Yale Med School
bumper sticker could save me.

569
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,671
No, a mug shot,

570
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,011
that you found,

571
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,052
as a lifelong souvenir.

572
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,531
You know, I was ashamed
of that night for a long time.

573
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,218
That's why I...
That's why I buried it.

574
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,861
You know, that's why I
tried to forget all about it.

575
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,830
I mean, the fact that you
were so eager to shoehorn it

576
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,766
into an article that purports
to celebrate a black doctor,

577
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,064
I mean...

578
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,206
That says very little about me.

579
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:14,408
I'm a good surgeon.

580
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,509
Period.

581
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,510
That's your story.

582
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,556
What are you doing here?

583
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,926
Can't I just stop by to say hi?

584
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,622
Any time. All the time.

585
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,266
Would you like to go for dinner?

586
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,528
There's a nice Indian
restaurant down the street.

587
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,802
The food tastes exactly
like your mother's cooking.

588
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:43,632
Actually, I have
plans with Ella.

589
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,101
Ella?

590
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,203
Turns out we have
the same taste in music.

591
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,314
Weird, right?

592
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,382
Where are you going?

593
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,784
We're gonna go
see this band play.

594
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,565
The bassist is a friend of mine.
We used to jam together a lot.

595
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,455
He was gonna help
me with the demo.

596
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,319
Okay.

597
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,759
Anyway,

598
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,227
thanks for introducing us.

599
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,975
You paged? BLOOM: I did.

600
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,140
What happened?

601
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,145
Uh, he says he fell off a
ladder and hit his head.

602
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,586
Make that 1.5 million.

603
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,154
Hey.

604
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,662
Hey, uh, so can we please go
somewhere not healthy, for once?

605
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,289
I mean, I actually
think I hate salad.

606
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,663
Uh, Dr. Bloom?

607
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,862
Can I ask you to take a quick
look at a patient in Bay 4?

608
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,268
So close.

609
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:47,772
Okay, um, I'm
gonna be right back.

610
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,365
Your job is to Google dive bars.

611
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,837
I want a giant,
disgusting burger.

612
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,139
Ew.

613
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:35,183
Lauren.

614
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,318
Lauren!

615
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,256
You're not real.

616
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,123
You're not real.

617
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,030
Buddy, you need a hand?

618
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,166
You know what?

619
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,441
That'd be awesome, thanks.

620
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:47,781
All right, thanks, man.

621
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,378
You should really go see a
doctor, man. That's a good idea.

622
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,194
Max.

623
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,734
Where are you? <i>33rd and Park.</i>

624
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:07,870
I don't think I can make it.

625
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,474
Stay there, I'm coming to you.

626
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,344
I don't understand.

627
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,908
Well, it's, um... It's
an agricultural co-op.

628
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,979
It's not a hospital.

629
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,350
No, it's not.

630
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,892
What kind of medicine
do they practice there?

631
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,258
None.

632
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,359
They don't practice
medicine there.

633
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,094
That's the point.

634
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:42,231
You're suggesting I... I
send my son away without me

635
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,600
to a farm?

636
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,078
To a place where they
claim the way to fix him

637
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,341
is to pretend
that he's not sick?

638
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:56,080
You know, Hector, one of the keys to
avoiding relapse in delusional disorders

639
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,587
is environment.

640
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,953
Plain and simple. And
Tony's current environment,

641
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,731
it's not helping. You know?

642
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,561
You mean me?

643
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,057
And me.

644
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,197
And this hospital.

645
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:15,900
That...

646
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,533
That boy is the
pride of my life.

647
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:18,633
I know.

648
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,212
He needs his father.

649
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,475
Someone who will... loves him.

650
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,648
Who will run
through walls for him.

651
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,480
No, no, no.
Listen, listen, listen.

652
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,611
You're trying to fix him.

653
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,615
We're all trying to fix him.

654
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:39,789
And on a very deep,
profound level, Tony feels that.

655
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,459
He knows it, and it's
making him worse.

656
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,336
This place will
accept him as he is.

657
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,096
You're telling me

658
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,240
to stop trying to
make him better?

659
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,307
To not be his father?

660
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,611
You told me

661
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,610
that to help Tony,

662
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,016
you'd be willing to
risk losing some of him.

663
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,094
This is how you do that.

664
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,302
Andy?

665
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:34,113
You gonna take
away my apartment?

666
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,346
No.

667
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,546
I don't know what to do.

668
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,724
I guess I just like it here.

669
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,298
Think we're the only ones.

670
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,698
You are always welcome here

671
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,703
when you're sick.

672
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,732
And when you're not sick,

673
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,402
we have a lot of people
that we have to take care of,

674
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:02,140
and that's just the
way it has to be.

675
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,205
I'll... I'll leave.

676
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:05,806
No problem.

677
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,147
Excuse me?

678
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,352
Sorry, does anyone know
how to get to the ICU?

679
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,857
Oh, dude, you can't get to
the 12th floor from this building.

680
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,519
You gotta take the
elevator to the 3rd floor,

681
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,028
then take the
breezeway to Harriman.

682
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:21,066
Then you take the second
set of elevators to 12.

683
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,725
Then you walk to
the end of the hall.

684
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,860
Thanks, man. You're a lifesaver.

685
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,368
Andy...

686
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,668
Do you know how to get
to the Oncology Ward?

687
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:35,342
Of course, I've had many the
nonexistent tumor examined there.

688
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,575
How would you like to start
paying off that apartment?

689
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,745
How?

690
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,881
By spending a little more
time at New Amsterdam.

691
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,089
Hey, champ.

692
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:48,888
You got time to
rap for a minute?

693
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,760
I got something to tell you.

694
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,802
And I'm hoping you
can still be proud of me.

695
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:09,741
<i>All inside our
Amsterdam she hides</i>

696
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:15,578
<i>Watery-eyed</i>

697
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:17,980
I... I can draw there?

698
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,417
You can draw and paint

699
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,419
and just be you.

700
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,157
If you want, Tony.

701
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:33,162
If it'll make you
happy, I'll let you go.

702
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:36,240
<i>Oh, silhouette</i>

703
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,339
<i>She's growing tall and fine</i>

704
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:46,478
<i>She's got my back</i>

705
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,749
<i>She'll follow me
down every street</i>

706
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,952
<i>No matter what my crime</i>

707
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,324
Lauren.

708
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,446
Done enough good for one day?

709
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,681
Think I'm gonna puke.

710
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,053
We paid enough for those chairs.

711
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:29,389
I think that our medical director
deserves to try them out sometime.

712
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,856
I don't want
everyone to see me so

713
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,159
weak.

714
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:39,898
You know?

715
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,465
It's why I can't
let Georgia come.

716
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,207
Why I can't sit in that chair.

717
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,382
Everybody's gonna see me.

718
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,683
The answer's yes, Max.

719
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:04,996
I'll be your deputy.

720
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,393
But you... Go.

721
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,762
Be weak.

722
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:11,600
Sit.

723
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,701
I won't watch.

724
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,060
Millie.

725
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,523
Glaciers are moving.
Children are being born.

726
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,294
Can you shuffle any faster?

727
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,799
I... I think I just went from a
stage three to a stage four.

728
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,135
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

729
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:51,232
Room for a fourth?

730
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,309
Yeah, always. Unfortunately.

731
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,811
Loving your slipper game, dude.

732
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,142
Oh, yeah, thanks.

733
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,479
I'm, uh, feeling
pretty good about it.

734
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,978
Those are pretty sharp yourself.

735
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:09,152
Okay, so, uh, these are mine,
I take it. Whose are those?

736
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,058
Those are Stevie's.

737
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,961
Our old fourth.

738
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,099
We always deal him in.

739
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,163
Hmm.

740
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,328
You know how to
play euchre, Max?

741
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,436
Uh...

742
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:22,838
I'll catch on.
