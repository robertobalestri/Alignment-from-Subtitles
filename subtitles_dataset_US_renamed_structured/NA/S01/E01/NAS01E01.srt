1
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,467
<i>I feel good</i>

2
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,408
<i>I knew that I would, now</i>

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,941
<i>I feel good</i>

4
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,714
<i>I knew that I would, now</i>

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,077
<i>So good so good</i>

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,656
<i>I got you oh!</i>

7
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,493
<i>I feel nice</i>

8
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:29,924
<i>Like sugar and spice</i>

9
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,601
<i>I feel nice</i>

10
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,602
<i>Like sugar and spice</i>

11
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,339
<i>So nice so nice</i>

12
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,640
<i>I got you</i>

13
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:57,959
<i>When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong</i>

14
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:04,359
<i>And when I hold you in my arms
my love won't do you no harm</i>

15
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:09,198
<i>And I feel nice
like sugar and spice</i>

16
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:15,642
<i>I feel nice like sugar and spice</i>

17
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,201
New Amsterdam Hospital.

18
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,973
<i>So nice so nice</i>

19
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,510
<i>I got you</i>

20
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:27,878
Massive carbon monoxide
poisoning from a faulty furnace.

21
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,299
There was a climate
change conference,

22
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,200
so we've got dozens more
ambassadors coming out.

23
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,853
Give him 100% high flow
and get him to The Dam.

24
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,464
<i>So good so good</i>

25
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,059
Yeah, he's something.

26
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,695
On the move.

27
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,704
<i>So good</i>

28
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,534
<i>I got you</i>

29
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,510
<i>Hey</i>

30
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,078
There you are. I
knew you'd get lost.

31
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,552
All the new medical
directors get lost.

32
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:49,893
And...

33
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,636
I'll take those odds.

34
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,383
Grab a sheet, will you?
EMS just dropped off.

35
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,418
Wait. What?

36
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,559
Do you hear that?

37
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,255
Hear what?

38
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,727
Dr. Bloom, she's dead.

39
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,064
No pulse, no BP,
cyanotic, rigor mortis.

40
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,935
I need a defib ventilator, ALS,
and resuscitation team, now!

41
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,303
That's impossible. She's dead.

42
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,636
Well, at least you
didn't kill her twice.

43
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,807
New Amsterdam
has a public school,

44
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,346
prison ward, and
facilities for the UN.

45
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,975
We performed the world's first C-section
in the world's first maternity ward.

46
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,683
New Amsterdam is
America's first public hospital.

47
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,311
Patients don't need
insurance, money...

48
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,650
Dora, I know the history.

49
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,248
The Dean makes me tell it
to every new medical director.

50
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,003
And how many of those
have you worked with?

51
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,929
Five in five years.

52
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,695
Dr. Helen Sharpe.

53
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,199
Max Goodwin, how can
I help? You're too kind.

54
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,793
Welcome to The Dam.
Why are you in scrubs?

55
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,032
Because I'm a doctor.
Going somewhere?

56
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:01,768
I have to tape segments with <i>The
Morning Show</i> and Megyn Kelly,

57
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,505
then give the keynote address
at the oncology conference in Vail.

58
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,045
I'll take that for
you. Thank you.

59
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,308
Wow. You're gonna do
all that on your lunch break.

60
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,213
You're funny. I'll
be back next week.

61
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,479
We'll lunch at the
Tavern. My treat.

62
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,453
Unlike the previous
medical director,

63
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,615
I actually expect you
to practice medicine

64
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,651
at this hospital because,
I don't know, it's your job.

65
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,559
You're funny.

66
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,132
You said that.

67
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,200
I'll tell you what. I'll continue
giving speeches all over the world,

68
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,899
because you can't afford the
kind of publicity I give this hospital.

69
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,637
And I'll continue my on-air
appearances with Ellen, Oprah,

70
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,078
and anyone else powerful
enough to go by one name

71
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,808
because someone
has to remind New York

72
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,647
that even though New Amsterdam
is an under-funded public hospital,

73
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,744
we can still go toe-to-toe
with the privates

74
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,584
from basic care to
state-of-the-art procedures.

75
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,816
I will be back next week.

76
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,326
We'll lunch at the
Tavern. My treat.

77
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,500
I like her.

78
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,558
If she comes
back, let's keep her.

79
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,009
Sorry.

80
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,946
Max.

81
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,452
Is everything okay?

82
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:21,948
Just calling to say hi.

83
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,353
<i>Really?</i>

84
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,584
Isn't that what people do?

85
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,018
People, yeah.

86
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,525
You? Not so much.

87
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,129
I'm trying.

88
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,092
How's the... Can I...

89
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,902
Sorry. What? No, you...

90
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,098
<i>I was...</i>

91
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,409
I was just going to ask
about the apartment.

92
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,467
<i>It's great. Yeah.</i>

93
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,255
<i>You should come by
sometime, sit on the floor,</i>

94
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,804
<i>eat some soy sauce packets.</i>

95
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,373
Have you had
any time to think...

96
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,713
Max.

97
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,117
It's time.

98
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,252
Georgia, I have to...

99
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,555
Save the world? I know. Go.

100
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,494
But listen, listen. I know
what I did was wrong.

101
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,259
<i>I should have put you and the
baby first, but I am going to change.</i>

102
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,662
And I'm gonna win you back.

103
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,836
Well, you have 12 weeks.

104
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,505
Hey, Reynolds. One second.

105
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,516
Hey. I've been
thinking about you.

106
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,643
You wanna grab a
drink later? I can't.

107
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,848
You know when I say "grab a
drink," I don't really mean grab a drink.

108
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,317
I do.

109
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,023
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

110
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,363
Sorry.

111
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,435
So sorry.

112
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,005
You guys okay?

113
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,782
There he is.

114
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,788
Uh...

115
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:10,793
My sister Luna and I were
born here in New Amsterdam.

116
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,690
And then, eight years later, uh,

117
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,361
Luna died here.

118
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,168
It was a
hospital-acquired infection.

119
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,903
Entirely preventable.

120
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,869
So,

121
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:30,714
working here, being able to
save someone else's sister

122
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,744
or someone's daughter,

123
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,479
it's a dream come true

124
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,687
for me.

125
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,693
Anyway, so...

126
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,161
How can I help?

127
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,733
Uh... Sorry. That's
not a trick question.

128
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,032
I'm really just asking.

129
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,269
I work for you, so you
can work for your patients.

130
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,710
How can I help?

131
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,769
Shout it out.

132
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,245
Really? No one? Wow.

133
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,950
Okay, why don't we
try this? I'll go first.

134
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,046
Will everyone in the
cardiac surgical department

135
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,887
please raise your hands?

136
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,398
Don't be shy. Just
get them up there.

137
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,122
Great.

138
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,929
Great, thank you.

139
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,471
You're all fired.

140
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,069
Any department who
places billing above care,

141
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,606
no matter how much
money you make this hospital,

142
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,765
you will be terminated.

143
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,433
Oh, I am serious.

144
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,443
Bye-bye.

145
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,441
We're gonna be
starting over, all right?

146
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,779
Without you.

147
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,477
Sorry.

148
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,221
Next, will all the department
chairs raise your hands, please?

149
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,953
I have no idea how you managed

150
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,294
to keep this hospital
afloat with so little help,

151
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,301
so I'm gonna hire
you 50 new attendings

152
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,804
because untrained residents will
no longer be running this hospital,

153
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,602
regardless of how much
money their university makes

154
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,142
off their indentured servitude

155
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,407
or how much time it affords
some of you to play golf.

156
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,779
So let me ask again,

157
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,287
how can I help?

158
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,194
Yeah. Person not
calling their lawyer.

159
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,197
Lauren Bloom,
emergency department.

160
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,358
I want to get rid of
our waiting room.

161
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,412
Okay, what do you...
Where do you want to put it?

162
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,961
I want to get rid of it.

163
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,597
I want to move patients
direct to bed. No waiting room.

164
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,603
Done.

165
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,168
Really?

166
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,336
Sure, let's try.

167
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,636
Yeah.

168
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,342
Hi. Dr. Iggy Frome,
head of psych.

169
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,010
Can we do something
about healthy food?

170
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,815
What do you want to do about it?

171
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,014
Have some.

172
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,383
To eat in the hospital.

173
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,527
Okay. Done.

174
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,493
Aces. Thank you.

175
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,895
Thank you.

176
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:02,025
You know, we all feel like the system
is too big to change, but guess what?

177
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,831
We are the system.

178
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,496
And we need to change.

179
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,383
So just tell me what you
need, what your patients need.

180
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,866
And I don't care if it's not covered.
I don't care if the board said no.

181
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,097
Let's get into some trouble.

182
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,547
Let's be doctors again.

183
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,184
Okay, I appreciate it. Go,
and I'll see you out in the wards.

184
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,983
Thanks.

185
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,723
Uh, Bloom.

186
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,853
Sorry, uh, could I
borrow you for a minute?

187
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,421
Um, I need you to
do a throat biopsy.

188
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,194
It'll just take a second. Sure.

189
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,701
For what patient?

190
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,503
Uh... Me.

191
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,916
Hello? My name is Alain.
I wrote my name down.

192
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,504
Then we'll call you when we
have a doctor available. Okay, hon?

193
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,794
<i>At New Amsterdam's department of
pediatric oncology, we strive to ensure</i>

194
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,099
<i>that the children feel that they are
in a relaxed, positive environment...</i>

195
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,603
You know what?
She is good. She is.

196
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,402
How long have you
noticed irritation?

197
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,070
Do you think she's
coming back early? No.

198
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,612
Max? Yeah, four weeks.

199
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,078
Six. Maybe eight? I don't know.

200
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,581
You look tired. Do
you need a nap?

201
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,144
I need you to stay still.

202
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,710
Good luck with that.

203
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,954
Who's calling? Dean
of medicine. Third time.

204
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,490
Ignore. BLOOM: Max.

205
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,492
Please stop talking. Yeah.

206
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,994
Wait. What's on my hot list
after this? What's a hot list?

207
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,393
It's a to-do list,

208
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,125
but, you know,
with a cooler name.

209
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,325
Call the Dean back.

210
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,560
After that.

211
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,125
You know, I can come back later.

212
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,001
Well, you've got the entire
United Nations in the ICU

213
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,097
and a cardiac patient
being prepped for surgery.

214
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,939
Right... Wait. Why is a
cardiac surgery on my hot list?

215
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,979
Because you fired all
the cardiac surgeons.

216
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,391
Right, but I had all the new
patients rerouted to University.

217
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,940
Not the ones from Rikers.

218
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,417
Maybe you shouldn't have
fired the entire department.

219
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,086
They were all corrupt and lazy.

220
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,020
See? Except for Dr. Reynolds.

221
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,647
How do you know that?

222
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,320
Just read his file.

223
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,655
Ow.

224
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,595
Dr. Frome?

225
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,764
Please sign in and take a seat.

226
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,540
Dr. Frome.

227
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,511
Young lady, it is way too early in
my day to call security, but I will.

228
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:30,345
Dr. Frome! Dr. Frome! Dr. Frome!

229
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,885
It's okay! It's okay! I
got it. Jemma, hi, hey.

230
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,284
I got this. Thank you.

231
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,598
All right, come
on. Come with me.

232
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,181
Thank you.

233
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,197
It's okay, whatever it is.

234
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:55,002
It happened again.

235
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,410
Floyd Reynolds?

236
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:05,679
Max Goodwin. Yeah, I
remember you from an hour ago.

237
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,584
When you fired me.

238
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,315
Yale. Fancy.

239
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,517
What secret society were
you? Skull and Bones?

240
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,425
Scroll and Key? The one
that took a poor black kid.

241
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,189
Which one was that?

242
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,231
School of Medicine.

243
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,568
So, Floyd, why did you become
a cardiovascular surgeon?

244
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,516
You know, all due respect, I don't
need a pat on the back on the way out.

245
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,385
That's good because I don't
intend to pat you on the back,

246
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,587
given the appalling history of
patient care in your department.

247
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,255
If I were you and I had
analyzed our performance,

248
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,542
I would have done the same.

249
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,584
By performance, do you mean the
highest mortality and infection rates

250
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,277
in New York City?

251
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,286
'Cause that's like the
Beyoncé of performances

252
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,413
if Beyoncé, you
know, killed people.

253
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:47,255
Yeah, and don't forget our rampant
culture of inflating billable hours.

254
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,851
Except you didn't.

255
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,242
I read your files. You have the
lowest billing rates in the department.

256
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,894
What's wrong? You
don't like surgery?

257
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,460
I love surgery.

258
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,300
Then why did you perform half as
many procedures as your colleagues?

259
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,465
Because my patients
didn't need them.

260
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,635
Because there's other ways to help
people than by cutting them open.

261
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,083
It's a cute kid.

262
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,087
It's my nephew.

263
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,622
I'm unfiring you.

264
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,481
To do what?

265
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,590
To run the cardiac
surgical department.

266
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,493
There is no cardiac
surgical department.

267
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,497
Then build one.

268
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,294
A good one.

269
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,403
I mean, it's only people's
hearts we're talking about.

270
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,399
You do know the whole
system's rigged, don't you?

271
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,802
I mean, they're not gonna let you
come in here and just help people.

272
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,576
So let's help as many as we
can before they figure us out.

273
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,117
You can't say no.

274
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,085
You already unpacked.

275
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,329
Jemma first came
to me eight years ago

276
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,489
after she was sexually
abused by her foster father.

277
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,358
Just tell me how long
before I can place her.

278
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,265
Two years after
that, she came back

279
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,169
after she was found chained to
a radiator, being fed like a dog.

280
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,797
How long, Iggy? This
girl has been abused

281
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,433
three times in the
foster care system,

282
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,819
and you want to
put her right back in?

283
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,210
What other options do we have?

284
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,042
I'm keeping her.

285
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,483
What do you mean, "keeping her"?

286
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,783
I mean I'm not discharging
her. I'm keeping her.

287
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,152
Until when?

288
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,485
Until she's 18.

289
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,616
But that's...

290
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,023
Two years.

291
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,818
So you are committing a patient

292
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,727
just to keep them
out of foster care?

293
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,462
Yeah.

294
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,164
Dr., uh...

295
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,142
Goodwin, but call me Max.

296
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,304
I was just taking an interest.

297
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,508
Surely, you don't have the time to
take an interest in every single case.

298
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,983
Well, that's why I
wear my running shoes.

299
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,513
I've been practicing
here for 25 years.

300
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,557
The key to survival is to
have more than one speed.

301
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,216
I can go faster.

302
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,691
That's not what I meant.

303
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,695
Just keep me in the
loop on this, will you?

304
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:03,923
Hi.

305
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,325
Good afternoon, Mr. Martín.

306
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,268
I'm Dr. Vijay Kapoor,
your wife's neurologist.

307
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,998
What happened to her?

308
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:17,032
Let me first find my glasses
so that I can read her chart.

309
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,570
There they are.

310
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,841
Thank you.

311
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,740
Presented cyanotic
and rigor mortis.

312
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:28,219
Administered
Diazepam and Valium.

313
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,119
So, Mr. Martín,

314
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,283
it appears Patricia's
brain convinced her heart

315
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,792
that she was dead, even
though she was very much alive.

316
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:38,422
We are going to perform
a few tests to find out why.

317
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,794
In the meantime,

318
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,926
you and I are
going to talk. Talk?

319
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:47,370
Talk about your life together,
how you met, how you live.

320
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,069
What does that have to do
with what happened to her?

321
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,775
Everything.

322
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,795
Get a resuscitation team.

323
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,941
Give me a bio. ER
NURSE: Respiration shallow.

324
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:17,335
Okay, give me a CBC, BMP,
chem 7, and a saline lock.

325
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,305
Anybody know who this is? I
found a boarding pass in his pocket.

326
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,500
Stop.

327
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,441
Everyone back
away from the patient.

328
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,241
Masks on, now.

329
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,149
This is Max.

330
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,689
We have a patient in the ED

331
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,692
from Liberia presenting
with all the signs of malaria,

332
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,262
<i>Lassa fever, TB, or...</i>

333
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,854
Ebola.

334
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,435
First thing we do is call the
Mayor's office and the CDC

335
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,445
if we even suspect Ebola virus.

336
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,947
Now, the patient is in
an isolation chamber

337
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,710
with negative pressure airflow.

338
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,928
That chamber is equipped
with every available medicine

339
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,285
should the patient
need to self-medicate.

340
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,687
What about us?
Ebola isn't airborne,

341
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,055
but if you develop
symptoms, you will join him.

342
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,025
Until then, you will help him.

343
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,062
Everyone interacting
with the patient is required

344
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,997
to wear personal protective
equipment at all times.

345
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,194
No shortcuts ever.

346
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,697
Good.

347
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,570
Once blood is drawn, the
test results will come back

348
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,578
in 24 to 48 hours.

349
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:39,349
Commencing a code green blood draw
at 1:10 p.m., New Amsterdam Hospital.

350
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,854
Your husband said you
are taking Haloperidol.

351
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,854
For two years.

352
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,552
For depression.

353
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,356
And last year, you were
diagnosed with Parkinson's.

354
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,421
Does any of it explain
what is happening to me?

355
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,555
Not yet.

356
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,626
I'm going to run some
more tests, and hopefully...

357
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,330
More tests? But she's in pain,

358
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,566
and she's not
getting any better.

359
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:04,838
Mr. Martín, I need some more
information before I can make a diagnosis.

360
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,708
How can you not do
something for her?

361
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,838
Shh.

362
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,882
We are going to do something.

363
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,043
We are going to keep talking.

364
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,878
Where are my glasses?

365
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,613
Thank you.

366
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,228
Whoa, whoa.

367
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

368
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,595
What's the problem?

369
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,262
I demand doctor. He
wants to be discharged.

370
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,862
Dr. Chen needs
him for observation.

371
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,407
Mr. Ambassador, I'm Dr. Goodwin.

372
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,603
I am the new medical director here,
and I am officially discharging you.

373
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,373
Ah. Thank you.

374
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:43,575
Before you go, can you just translate
one thing for your security detail?

375
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,042
What?

376
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,596
Since you're being released early
and against the wishes of your doctor,

377
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,715
they should look for any signs of
lethargy, brain damage, cardiac arrest,

378
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,554
sudden loss of
consciousness, and, of course,

379
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,457
rectal bleeding.

380
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,121
Mr. Ambassador?

381
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,894
Maybe I stay.

382
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,941
Can I have our menus back?

383
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,648
Hey. Welcome back.

384
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,121
I heard you got promoted.

385
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,658
Right after I got fired.

386
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,659
Lord works in mysterious ways.

387
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,126
She does, doesn't she?

388
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,630
A patient from Rikers
was admitted with 17 lacs.

389
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,461
Ruptured spleen, aortic tear.

390
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,967
We got him stable in the
ED, but the tear is all you.

391
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,436
Okay. You wanna
grab a drink tomorrow?

392
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:39,802
I can't.

393
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,983
You know when I say "grab
a drink," I don't actually...

394
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,441
Yes, I do.

395
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,807
Okay.

396
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:48,439
Wait. You're not trying to...

397
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,449
Look, Lauren.

398
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:51,814
I think you're great.

399
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,778
Oh, wow. You are
trying to. Okay, I...

400
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,949
I guess I'd rather us
just be friends again.

401
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,855
You know, colleagues.

402
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,655
But I thought we...

403
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,652
We did.

404
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,528
And I thought you... I do.

405
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,794
So then why not
see where this goes?

406
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:12,168
I wish I could. I
really do, but I can't.

407
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,797
Because?

408
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,705
Because...

409
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,709
Hey, I'm a big
girl. I can take it.

410
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,210
What?

411
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,478
Because you're not black.

412
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,514
Gate!

413
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,523
Hands. Thank you.

414
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,150
Hands, hands. Thank you.

415
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,888
Hands, hands...

416
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,096
Jemma.

417
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,709
You know pens and pencils aren't
allowed outside the classroom.

418
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,895
The pen's attached
to my journal. Okay.

419
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,602
You'll have to give
me the journal, then.

420
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,694
No.

421
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,831
You'll get it back
in the morning.

422
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,900
It's mine. Jemma,
give me the journal.

423
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,444
Jemma, don't do this.

424
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:53,672
Jemma.

425
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,578
Please... But it's mine!

426
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,246
Let me go! It's mine! It's mine!

427
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,855
Dr. Frome told me that
he gave you that journal

428
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,122
when you were 10.

429
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,758
It's mine.

430
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,592
Can I ask why you pushed...

431
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,136
It's the only thing that's mine.

432
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,704
Jemma,

433
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,907
what do you want to happen?

434
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,749
Jemma.

435
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,416
What do you want to happen?

436
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:45,997
Nobody's ever
asked me that before.

437
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:51,802
Do you want to stay here, Jemma?

438
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,339
Do you want to stay
at New Amsterdam?

439
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:05,847
Well, would you like me to get you
placed in a new home by Social Services?

440
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:10,188
Just decide for me. I mean,
you're gonna do it anyway.

441
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,190
That's not true. That... No.

442
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,850
Hey, Jemma.

443
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,860
Keep it.

444
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,192
Like, what's the point?

445
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,041
Return them to baseline and
put them through the system.

446
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,772
That's my job.

447
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,609
Look.

448
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,616
If you can't help
Jemma as a doctor,

449
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,050
then just help her
as a human being.

450
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,053
Am I allowed to do that?

451
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,214
You are now.

452
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,460
Dr. Goodwin?

453
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,026
How can I help?
Dr. Kapoor's patient in 1208.

454
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,381
You wanted to be
kept in the loop?

455
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,169
Yes, thank you. How's she doing?

456
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,210
I think Dr. Kapoor
is going to kill her.

457
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,869
Max.

458
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,004
This is Detective
Rose from the NYPD

459
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,673
and Agent Bratton from the FBI.

460
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,013
The CDC alerted us to
your patient with Ebola.

461
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,296
We're still waiting on the test
results. I'll be with you in five minutes.

462
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,882
The NSA just intercepted
a video made by ISIS.

463
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,754
They claim they sent
one of their followers

464
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,850
from Liberia to New York City,

465
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,896
infected with the Ebola virus.

466
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,863
Your patient is now
a terror suspect.

467
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,236
A man came to my village.

468
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,863
What was his name?

469
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,066
Ayaan.

470
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,733
Last name?

471
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,572
I don't know.

472
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:42,045
He was showing off
money he made in America

473
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:46,245
from selling kufi hats and
dashikis in Times Square.

474
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,253
He offered to give
me clothes to sell

475
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:51,449
and a plane ticket if I give
him half of what I make.

476
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:52,889
And you believed him.

477
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,056
Yes.

478
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:58,359
He took me to doctor
for traveler's vaccination.

479
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,060
Alain, where did Ayaan want
you to go when you got to America?

480
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:05,404
Youth hostel in Times Square.

481
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,301
Then why did you come here?

482
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,269
This is the only hospital
in America I heard of.

483
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,107
He's not a terrorist.

484
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,743
We'll gather the evidence.

485
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,031
If he was a terrorist, he would
have gone to Times Square,

486
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,699
where he could have
infected the entire city,

487
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,919
but he didn't. He
came here to get better.

488
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,927
He was clearly tricked
into getting something

489
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,939
injected into his bloodstream.
You see that, right?

490
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,228
Dr. Goodwin... Just
please promise me

491
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,789
you will look into his story.

492
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,331
I'll look into it.

493
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,941
What does that even
mean? Because I'm not black.

494
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,485
Patient is stable in case
you were wondering.

495
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:44,807
Oh, good.

496
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,970
So are you gonna
answer my question?

497
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,815
I'm 35 years old. I
want to get married,

498
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,942
I wanna have kids, and
I want them to be black.

499
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,988
You know you can't just
order that off a menu, right?

500
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:58,168
Well, yeah, but I also know
I'm not gonna meet anyone

501
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,453
if you and I are...
Getting our swirl on?

502
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,427
Look, I don't expect
you to understand.

503
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,328
I'm sorry, okay?
I want to. I do.

504
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:08,458
I have this plan for how I
want my life to look, all right?

505
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:10,765
I have for a long time, and
that plan's important to me.

506
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,281
So what part of the plan was
taking me back to your place and...

507
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:17,333
Whoa, whoa, hey. Look,
okay. It wasn't, all right?

508
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:21,881
But when I was with
you, I forgot I had a plan.

509
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,877
No, sorry. I still
don't understand.

510
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,682
Well, I guess that's
the point, right?

511
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,314
You can't. You can't understand
how confusing it was growing up,

512
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,859
watching every black athlete
have a white girl on his arm,

513
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,689
or how betrayed
black women felt,

514
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,559
my mom, my sisters, watching
it happen time and again.

515
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,830
I get it. You're just
taking one for the team.

516
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,500
I love black women.

517
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,036
So do I.

518
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,002
But I don't see one
asking you out for a drink.

519
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:56,712
I asked you to keep
me in the loop on 1208.

520
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,226
I needed to conduct
thorough patient...

521
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,014
I'm taking the patient
out of your service.

522
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,144
Because?

523
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,864
Because you should have
made a presumptive diagnosis.

524
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,357
Because you should have
aggressively treated the Parkinson's.

525
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,416
Except she doesn't
have Parkinson's.

526
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,020
PET scan.

527
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,826
Small black flecks
over her heart.

528
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,366
Artifacts.

529
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,334
Look closer.

530
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,404
Two years ago, Patricia was
misdiagnosed with depression.

531
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,871
She was prescribed Haloperidol,

532
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,407
which caused stiffness... Right.

533
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:26,240
As the result, she was misdiagnosed
with Parkinson and prescribed Levodopa,

534
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,541
which made it
impossible for her to sleep.

535
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:30,549
So she was
prescribed hydroxyzine.

536
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:34,417
That toxic combination caused
both cardiac arrest and rigidity.

537
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,218
But this whole time, her true symptom
was her immune system fighting a tumor

538
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,350
which nobody could see.

539
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,121
Small black flecks.

540
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,860
Malignant thymoma. Yeah.

541
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,095
If I continued treating
her for Parkinson's,

542
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,261
she would have another
cardiac arrest and died.

543
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,937
By taking my time,
by slowing down,

544
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,236
I bought her another year.

545
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,073
Maybe two.

546
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,407
How can I help?

547
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,080
When she wakes up,

548
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:11,146
you can help me tell
her she's going to die.

549
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,108
Well, move Sugarman
to Wednesday,

550
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:22,431
and I'll do Hinkle via
Skype from the hotel.

551
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,265
Just make sure I
have his updated...

552
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,429
Ron.

553
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,939
Ron, I said JFK. Why are
we back at New Amsterdam?

554
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,475
Hi. Remember me?

555
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,818
You told my driver to
bring me back here?

556
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,945
No, I told our driver
to bring you back here

557
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,321
because Ron works for New
Amsterdam, and so do you, remember?

558
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,451
If I miss my flight...
You can keep your job.

559
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,671
Why do you care
about me so much?

560
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:51,323
Because you're a good doctor.

561
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,241
Because you bring in patients
who would otherwise never go

562
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,824
to a public hospital,
which helps pay

563
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,511
for the patients who
can't go anywhere else.

564
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,629
So it's about money.
It's about care,

565
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,264
which is why I can't figure out
why'd you'd rather give lectures

566
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,107
to semi-retired physicians than
actually provide care to patients.

567
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,139
I'll see you next week.

568
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,048
Come back in 48 hours,
or don't come back at all.

569
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,792
Blanca?

570
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,064
Hi. Dr. Frome from
New Amsterdam.

571
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,481
Hi. Thank you so
much for meeting me.

572
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,565
I brought you donuts.

573
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,809
I ate one already. I'm sorry.

574
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,637
I actually ate two. I don't
know why I said one. That's...

575
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:46,208
I have to be at work soon, so
I don't... Yeah. No, of course.

576
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,148
I wanted you to see this.

577
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,648
It's a journal from the patient I
was telling you about. Jemma?

578
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,592
Normally, there'd
be privacy issues,

579
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,873
but, uh, you know, this is
the one thing that Jemma kept

580
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,661
from foster home to foster home.

581
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:04,260
And, uh, one of those homes
was actually your mother's.

582
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:13,544
Camilla, right? That
was her name? Camilla?

583
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:19,517
Well, Camilla was the first foster
parent to really make Jemma feel safe.

584
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:23,182
You know, safe to grow
and safe to be a kid, really.

585
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,550
And after Camilla died,

586
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:30,559
Jemma wrote pages and pages
about her in here. You can read.

587
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:35,296
My mother and I were
estranged when she died.

588
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:40,737
I didn't even know
she took in foster kids.

589
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,202
Oh.

590
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,969
I was a tough kid to
raise. Stubborn, wild.

591
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:46,905
Left when I was 16.

592
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:50,142
You know, that sounds a lot like
Jemma. Tough, but she's got a big heart...

593
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:55,050
I can't be her foster parent
if that's what this is about.

594
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:01,826
I'm sorry. This was a
long shot. I know that.

595
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:05,626
Thank you for meeting
me. I really do appreciate it.

596
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:11,597
Can I just leave this with you?

597
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,230
You don't have to
get it back to me.

598
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,740
I'll come back
and pick it up later,

599
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,333
but can I just
leave it with you?

600
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:19,736
Why?

601
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,939
I think that you'll see that
your mother gave Jemma

602
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,743
all the love that she
couldn't give to you.

603
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,451
That love didn't go to waste.

604
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,593
I don't understand.

605
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,927
I never had Parkinson's?

606
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,698
And the depression?

607
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,469
Hormones from your tumor.

608
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:53,101
They triggered your immune system
and set off a cascade of symptoms.

609
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,538
Patricia,

610
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,811
your mind is
strong and resilient.

611
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:01,649
I'm sorry you were led
to believe otherwise.

612
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,053
Mrs. Martín,

613
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,182
you could stay here,

614
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:09,786
but, in this case, the treatment
is worse than the disease.

615
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,791
And with so little time,

616
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,959
maybe there's someplace
else you'd rather be.

617
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:22,070
No, we stay here. We
fight. She get better.

618
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,836
No.

619
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,537
I want to go home.

620
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,670
To see my parents,

621
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:29,874
my girls.

622
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,746
I haven't seen them in 11 years.

623
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,013
That's a wonderful idea.

624
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,317
We can't go home.

625
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,419
Home is Chiapas.

626
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,925
We crossed the
border without papers.

627
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,859
We cross back,

628
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,397
we will be arrested.

629
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:46,988
I have to go home.

630
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,268
Mr. Ambassador?

631
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,403
Yes. Can I ask a favor?

632
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,448
Of course. You need
some Yankees tickets?

633
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,878
I need you to repatriate
two of your citizens.

634
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,522
Hemoptysis! He's crashing!

635
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,089
Can someone help me in my suit?

636
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:23,601
Alain! Alain, you need
to grab the oxygen mask!

637
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,203
Alain!

638
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,097
Alain, it is right above you.

639
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,707
Helmet, now!

640
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:41,747
Forget it.

641
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:44,818
I'm going in.

642
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:46,892
Dr. Bloom, wait.

643
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,801
Okay.

644
00:34:02,107 --> 00:34:03,439
Bloom!

645
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,999
Get out of there, now!

646
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,238
Too late! I'm already in!

647
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,640
There's too much blood,
I can't see anything.

648
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,825
Heart rate is dropping.
He needs adrenaline.

649
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,257
I can't stop bagging.

650
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:23,591
Adrenaline first,
oxygen after, okay?

651
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:24,994
Go.

652
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,668
Okay, now push
10 mls. Open wide.

653
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,971
But that's too much.
Not for this kind of virus.

654
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:40,774
It'll send his
heart rate too high.

655
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,343
Push 10 hard
and fast, right now.

656
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,491
Lauren.

657
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,945
I know what you're
gonna say. That was...

658
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,495
That was stupid. I
violated the protocol.

659
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,537
Lauren.

660
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,905
Your glove.

661
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:20,710
Doctor.

662
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,290
Sorry, I can't talk right now.

663
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:30,425
There's something wrong
with the baby. Oh, my God.

664
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:38,661
She's bleeding.

665
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,764
I need a trans-abdominal
ultrasound, mag sulfate, four grams, IV.

666
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,897
BP 160 over 110.

667
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,186
How we doing with that second...
Draw a chem 24 and coag panel.

668
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,450
Let's get the fetal monitor on.

669
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,718
How can I help? By
getting out of the way.

670
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,079
This is my wife.
And she needs you.

671
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,051
Off the O2. Off the O2.

672
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:55,713
One, two, three.

673
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,349
Baby's in distress. No...

674
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,023
No... MAX: I'm here.
I'm here. I got you.

675
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,252
Push 4 mag sulfate.

676
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,089
Max. No, no, just focus on me.

677
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,560
I'm right here.

678
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,792
Ultrasound's up.

679
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,793
She's complete
previa. What's that?

680
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,781
It means your placenta
is obstructing your cervix.

681
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,535
There's nowhere
for the baby to go.

682
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:19,544
Corticosteroids and a unit of
O-negative, and type and cross.

683
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,547
This is because of me.
You did nothing wrong.

684
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:23,980
It's my fault.

685
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:25,880
Georgia, if we can't
control the bleeding,

686
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,715
we're going to need to do an
emergency caesarean, understand?

687
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,779
The baby is not
ready. She's not ready.

688
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,414
We're not gonna have a choice.

689
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,550
Is she still bleeding?
Bleeding's slowed down.

690
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:38,119
I still want a transfusion, and
someone tell me baby's heart rate.

691
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,994
I can't find it. What?

692
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,432
I can't find the
baby's heartbeat.

693
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,501
Suzanne?

694
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,269
Come on. It's okay.

695
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,004
Suzanne...

696
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,608
Where are you?

697
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,517
There you are,
baby girl. Oh, God.

698
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,822
Looking good.

699
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,192
It's okay.

700
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,459
Does baby have a name yet?

701
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:23,835
Luna.

702
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,676
<i>When you try your best
but you don't succeed</i>

703
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:34,976
<i>When you get what you
want but not what you need</i>

704
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:42,223
<i>When you feel so
tired but you can't sleep</i>

705
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,794
<i>Stuck in reverse</i>

706
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,896
Dr. Frome?

707
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:55,704
<i>And the tears come
streaming down your face</i>

708
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:02,413
<i>When you lose
something you can't replace</i>

709
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:11,687
<i>Lights will guide you home</i>

710
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:19,224
<i>And ignite your bones</i>

711
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:24,661
<i>And I will try to fix you</i>

712
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:37,244
<i>And the tears come
streaming down your face</i>

713
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:41,176
<i>When you lose something...</i>

714
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,412
<i>Mija...</i>

715
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:53,264
<i>Lights will guide you home</i>

716
00:38:54,566 --> 00:39:00,198
<i>And ignite your bones</i>

717
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:06,372
<i>And I will try to fix you</i>

718
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,448
Alain, that shot they
gave you in Liberia,

719
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:24,586
they might have thought
it was Ebola, but it wasn't.

720
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:27,894
It was the Lassa virus,
which is just as deadly,

721
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,936
except, as Dr. Bloom
can tell you,

722
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:34,769
the Lassa virus can be
treated with antiviral medication,

723
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,933
which we gave you.

724
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:46,407
<i>Tears stream down your face</i>

725
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:51,084
Nice job, Dr. Bloom.

726
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,588
You wanna grab a drink?

727
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:56,792
Seriously? Now?

728
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,296
I'm talking about a
nice glass of scotch.

729
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,992
What are you talking about?

730
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,933
Yeah. Yeah, I could use a drink.

731
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:13,435
<i>Lights will guide you home</i>

732
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,438
<i>And I will try...</i>

733
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,778
Dr. Sharpe.

734
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,443
I hope I'm not interrupting.

735
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,885
No, no, I was just, um...

736
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,658
My sister was here,

737
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,888
in this room, a long time
ago, and I was just, uh,

738
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,394
introducing her to someone.

739
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
I, um...

740
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,996
I saw the Farmer's Market.

741
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,504
Oh, yeah? Did you buy anything?

742
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,699
Couldn't. They were sold out.

743
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,633
Hmm.

744
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,702
Made a few changes
while you were gone.

745
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,813
I didn't think you
were coming back.

746
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:55,219
Neither did I.

747
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,815
So much death here.

748
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,021
Got to you, didn't it?

749
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:07,324
No, actually. I became immune
to it, which is even worse.

750
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,560
So why did you come back?

751
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:14,762
Because of you.

752
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,042
People are excited, Max.

753
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,911
For the first time in a long time,
they are excited to be doctors again.

754
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,174
I wanna be excited too.

755
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,720
But you need to slow down.

756
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,628
Yeah.

757
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,200
I get that a lot.

758
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,195
You have cancer.

759
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,038
Squamous cell carcinoma.

760
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,716
But you knew that, didn't you?

761
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,623
How can I help?
