1
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,596
<i>Previously on</i> New Amsterdam...

2
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,917
You're being accused of
forming a nontherapeutic alliance

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,876
with your patient, Avi Mantell.

4
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,105
The rules exist for a
reason, and I broke them.

5
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,707
Now the only thing for me to
do is to be a different therapist.

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,150
I was actually here to talk to
Max about extending my leave.

7
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,722
Whoa, for how long? Forever.

8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,279
Max.

9
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:34,729
<i>Early in the morning
I'll come calling</i>

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:38,135
<i>I'll come calling after you</i>

11
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,738
<i>Darling, if you answer
Oh, we'll wander</i>

12
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:47,076
<i>Down the garden where it's cool</i>

13
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:52,616
<i>Later we'd
discover All in colors</i>

14
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:56,418
<i>Children silent as the stars</i>

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,928
<i>Early in the morning
I'll come calling</i>

16
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,294
<i>I'll come calling after you</i>

17
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,797
<i>Though you seldom
answer Still I wonder</i>

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,102
<i>What will pass here when you do</i>

19
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,477
<i>Crisp and pressed and blue</i>

20
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:29,047
Wow. Dora, you really are
as terrifying as Max says.

21
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,180
And I'm going easy

22
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,135
'cause you're new to the
role of medical director.

23
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,457
Deputy medical director.

24
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:36,292
I'm only taking on Max's
duties while he's recuperating.

25
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,798
Yeah, well, you're 10 minutes
late to your first meeting,

26
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,391
which is a baller move
so soon into your tenure.

27
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,129
I'm on my way.

28
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:46,503
Could you message this
to Dr. Valentina Castro?

29
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,666
Max's DNA?

30
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,471
Please don't <i>Jurassic Park</i> him.

31
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,011
One Max is more
than I can handle.

32
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,343
It's for a new treatment,
one that will get him back

33
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,507
into the hospital ASAP,
so I no longer have to be...

34
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,211
Sharpe, just the medical
director I was looking for.

35
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,220
Deputy medical
director. How can I help?

36
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,654
Oh, I need ecstasy.

37
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,053
Like, the feeling of bliss?

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,652
Like MDMA, like drugs.

39
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,500
Is this a joke?
Am I being hazed?

40
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:16,867
No, we don't do
that anymore, right?

41
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,907
No, I have a patient who is
exhibiting the most aggressive PTSD

42
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,031
I think I've ever seen.

43
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,508
Kapoor and I've
tried everything.

44
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:26,741
Nothing makes a dent, so I would like
you to sign my new treatment strategy.

45
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,509
Max thoroughly approved.

46
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,560
Was he high at the time?

47
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,748
No, but he actually made that same
joke when he approved it, so it's cool.

48
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,755
It's a good joke, I think.
Great minds, right?

49
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,223
Listen, I assure you MDMA,
under the proper supervision,

50
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,569
allows a patient to
confront their memories

51
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,528
in a trigger-free
environment, it's amazing.

52
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,755
Yeah, see you later. Mmm-hmm?

53
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:43,876
It teaches them to remember

54
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,365
a traumatic event
instead of reliving it.

55
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,544
All right, either you sign,
so I can get the pure stuff

56
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,580
from upstairs, or I'm gonna
have to go score from a guy

57
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,597
named Rocket who lives in
his grandmother's basement.

58
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,208
Yeah, just... Okay, fine.

59
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,040
Aces.

60
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,807
Wow.

61
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:04,408
Signing off on illicit drugs
on your first day. Hmm.

62
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,615
Yeah. Yes, I do.

63
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,053
Oh, my gosh,
that's true, though.

64
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,924
How long have you
all had this tradition?

65
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,089
Oh. How many
Sundays is in forever?

66
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,395
Mom! Hey, Jayden...

67
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,267
No matter how old we
got, Mama has always

68
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,827
made sure we're here every
Sunday eating her food, right?

69
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,778
It's been family tradition
since before I was born.

70
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,778
Sunday means church, family,
and a meal with two meats.

71
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:31,903
No exceptions.

72
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,344
That's right. Right?

73
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,416
Yep, yep.

74
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:39,180
My family never did the church
thing, but we're very spiritual.

75
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,255
Hmm. Uh... Which spirit?

76
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,501
Uh, Brandi... - Hmm?

77
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,120
Don't make me bust out
the drill team photos. Oh.

78
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:50,687
Okay, Foofy.

79
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,260
Ooh!

80
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,911
All right, forget the drill team
photos. I'm busting out prom.

81
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:55,975
Everybody look right here.

82
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:59,006
Two words, "sportin' waves."

83
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:02,941
I'm gonna put you both in the
corner if you can't find your manners.

84
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,174
So, Evie, you're a
lawyer at Floyd's hospital?

85
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,511
Well, I got there
first, actually. Oh.

86
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,710
By one week.

87
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,982
Okay. I did my
undergrad at Yale,

88
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,116
and I went to, I went
to law school at NYU.

89
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,368
So, I did have a
leg up on the city.

90
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,885
Oh, I had the HBCU experience.

91
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,465
Do they have Greeks
at Yale? I pledged AKA.

92
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,398
Oh. Hey, Soror.

93
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,992
No way! Yes.

94
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,196
Oh, my goodness.

95
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,871
Oh, I knew I liked her.

96
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:37,543
Okay, I hear you. I hear you.

97
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,979
There you go.

98
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,921
Sorry.

99
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,692
Keep in mind, Dr. Kapoor and I
will be here with you the entire time.

100
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,362
Jacob, you don't have
to do this, obviously,

101
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,871
but before you say
no, can I just ask,

102
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,034
when was the last time a
loud noise didn't scare you?

103
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,776
Or when was the last time
you felt safe in a crowded room?

104
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,409
Or slept without nightmares?

105
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,677
You cannot keep going through
life feeling like everyone is a threat.

106
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,016
But they are.

107
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,126
Just turn on the news,
hate crimes, wars,

108
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,889
they put kids in cages,
and no one cares.

109
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:33,525
It's not PTSD. People are
a threat. People are evil.

110
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,068
Do you know what the
cruelest symptom of PTSD is?

111
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,936
It's a thief.

112
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,806
It robs us of the
ability to see the light.

113
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,937
But that doesn't
mean it's not there.

114
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,650
Do you remember how it
felt when the world had light?

115
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,919
This process is how you
get that light back, Jacob.

116
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:29,681
Max?

117
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,319
Max.

118
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,232
No, it's not me. It's Georgia.

119
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,324
What happened?

120
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,836
The placenta previa ruptured.
I was about to call 911.

121
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,015
Do it now.

122
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,333
The blood, it happened so fast.

123
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,520
Okay, we need to
get you off the floor.

124
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,012
Max?

125
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,139
No, I was too weak.
I couldn't lift her.

126
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,359
Okay, well, now you
got me. Come on.

127
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,423
Ready? One, two, three.

128
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,955
Max, 911. OPERATOR:
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

129
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,991
Any fever? Chills? No.

130
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,457
Any contractions? No.

131
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,036
I need an ambulance
to 42 East 17th Street.

132
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,205
I need paramedics, not EMTs,
and I need you to get here now.

133
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,373
Heart rate up to
180 and thready.

134
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,831
No, no, just get here.

135
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,027
Is that bad? No,
just try to relax, okay?

136
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,230
Max, Max, can I... They're
out there, 12 minutes out.

137
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,465
That's too far away.

138
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,179
Georgia will bleed
out before they arrive.

139
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,472
No, there's time.

140
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,377
Max, she's out of time.
We need to ligate the artery.

141
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,984
Here? And now.

142
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,386
Hey, look at me. I'm right here.

143
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,117
I'm with you, okay?

144
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,782
I'm right here with you.

145
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,895
The fentanyl should
already be working.

146
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:21,134
Okay, you're gonna
feel a slight heaviness,

147
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,868
and then you're gonna
drift off to sleep. Hmm.

148
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,237
And then we'll
be able to operate

149
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,866
without you feeling a thing.

150
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,214
All these drugs,
they might hurt her.

151
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,251
Will they hurt her?

152
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,048
It's not gonna hurt the baby.

153
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,558
It's not gonna hurt
her? No, I promise, no.

154
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,292
The opiate will slow
Luna's heart rate a little,

155
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,488
but we'll be monitoring
her every step of the way.

156
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,394
Okay.

157
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,229
Hey, it's gonna work.

158
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,166
It's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

159
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:11,414
I don't want Luna to have to
take ballet because of me, Max.

160
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,745
No, no, she won't.

161
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,792
I want her to experience
everything. Everything.

162
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:28,162
Rock climbing and
clarinet and painting.

163
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,294
She will.

164
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,033
No, you have to
encourage her, Max.

165
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,876
You have to help her.

166
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,639
You have to help
her find her own voice.

167
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,843
Her own path.

168
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:47,114
We can encourage her
together, you and me.

169
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,817
But if I don't...

170
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,689
If I don't, Max...
Stop, stop. No.

171
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,288
No.

172
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,195
I need you to
promise me something.

173
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:08,407
Promise me that you'll
save her... Save her first.

174
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,742
Promise, I need
you to promise me.

175
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,247
Promise you'll
save our baby girl.

176
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,383
Promise me, no matter what.

177
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,022
Promise me.

178
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,264
Max, it's time.

179
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,083
Let me go! Will you
guys just listen to me?

180
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,418
I have done nothing wrong!

181
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,516
Yeah, that's what all
innocent people scream.

182
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,187
This lunatic... My
name is Wilson Hatch.

183
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,342
This lunatic, Wilson Hatch,

184
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,441
swallowed the biggest balloon
of cocaine I've ever seen.

185
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,524
No, no. We need an X-ray

186
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,761
of his abdomen so we
can get him on intent to sell.

187
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,546
This is... Okay, this
might fly with people

188
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,904
who don't know any better, but I am a
partner at Wyman, Frost, and Handle.

189
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,518
I know my rights. You
guys have nothing on me.

190
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,601
I'm out of here. I'm done.

191
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,853
I'm leaving. CASEY:
Yeah, you're leaving...

192
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,455
You're leaving this floor
and heading up to radiology.

193
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,607
Let's go, buddy. I
don't consent to that.

194
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,747
Ow! Mom. How you
gonna do me like that?

195
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,913
I love you, but you take
food with your bare hands,

196
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,616
I'll put you over my knee.

197
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,301
I can't help it. It's so good,
and I can't live without it,

198
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,536
just like I can't
live without you.

199
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,823
Aw.

200
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,591
Yeah, yeah.

201
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,223
So, she's amazing, right?

202
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,734
She's an exceptional young lady.

203
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,464
Good, I was hoping
you'd say that because

204
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,507
it's time, for me to
use the family ring.

205
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,166
Oh, honey.

206
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,334
What?

207
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,674
Evie seems like
the perfect woman,

208
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,405
just not the perfect
woman for you.

209
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,318
Don't want to pull too hard.

210
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,414
A half hedge will fully
occlude the artery.

211
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,423
That should do it. Bleeding
should be under control.

212
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,927
Huh?

213
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,596
Georgia's having a contraction.

214
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,865
It... It's squeezing the cord.

215
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,102
Heart rate down to 40.

216
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,611
If it goes any lower, it...

217
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,648
We... We need to stop
the contraction. I can't.

218
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,013
It can only pass.

219
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,451
By itself.

220
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,019
Max...

221
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,384
The baby won't
survive another one.

222
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,336
So we have to get her out.

223
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,025
There'll be too much blood loss,

224
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,828
Georgia's lost enough as it is.

225
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,620
No, you did one surgery,
you can do another.

226
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,365
Except this time,
Georgia will die.

227
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,378
Yes, Max, the hospital is still
here, so you can go back to bed.

228
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,142
I need you to listen to me.

229
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,013
911 dispatched an
ambulance to my apartment,

230
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,177
<i>but they don't have
everything that we need.</i>

231
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,652
An ambulance, why?

232
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,498
<i>I need you to call dispatch
and have them go back</i>

233
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,821
<i>to the station, and
they need to pick up</i>

234
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,826
<i>trauma dressing and
surgical gloves and oxygen,</i>

235
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,170
<i>and then I need a
second ambulance</i>

236
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,672
<i>from New Amsterdam
that's fully stocked</i>

237
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:19,530
<i>with B-positive blood
and mifepristone.</i>

238
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,228
I'm doing it now. Max,
what's happening?

239
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,930
I'm trying to save my family.

240
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,269
We just finished finals.

241
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,244
Third year, never have
to take a test again, so,

242
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,111
we went out to
celebrate. Who's "we"?

243
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,548
I can't remember exactly.

244
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,881
Try.

245
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,861
It's me,

246
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,560
Bobby and Emma.

247
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,734
We're outside the door.

248
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,905
What happened next?

249
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:16,812
You got a problem?

250
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:18,983
Perhaps we should wait.

251
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,151
No, no, no.

252
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,921
He's not talking to me.

253
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,489
Hey!

254
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,794
He said...

255
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,300
You got a problem?

256
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,894
Jacob, leave it alone.

257
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,003
<i>This guy just bumps into me.</i>

258
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,302
He's big.

259
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,257
It's all right, Jacob.

260
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,409
We're right here
with you. It's okay.

261
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,646
It's okay. It's
okay, Jacob. Hey.

262
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,688
We're right here
with you, Jacob.

263
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,827
I didn't know it was a pipe
bomb when it happened.

264
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,470
I see Emma. She's...

265
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,009
Emma?

266
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,803
Help!

267
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,372
This piece of stone
is crushing her.

268
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,280
<i>She can't breathe.</i>

269
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,547
I have to get her out,

270
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,952
but it's too heavy.

271
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,218
Please, somebody help me!

272
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,293
If just one person
helps me, I can get it off.

273
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,352
Just one person,
but no one helps.

274
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,727
Not Bobby, not anyone.

275
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,226
Ahh!

276
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,501
Now they're trampling
me, and I can't move.

277
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,839
<i>And she's dying.
No one will help.</i>

278
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,038
They're all running
right over us.

279
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,237
Watch it!

280
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,248
Why would he do that?

281
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,553
It's okay... It's okay, Jacob.

282
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,555
No, why would he do that?

283
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,367
It's okay. It's
okay. Just breathe.

284
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,689
Help me.

285
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,819
Help me, Dr. Frome. Help me.

286
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,232
Please, Dr. Frome, help me.

287
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:11,049
I'm sorry, Jacob. I need... I
need to... I need something.

288
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,872
Dr. Frome, what's happening?

289
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,431
Dr. Frome, what's happening?

290
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,410
You're in New
Amsterdam Hospital.

291
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:21,690
You're in Manhattan.
Where is she?

292
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,858
- What's happening?
- You're safe.

293
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,282
Dr. Frome, where is he?

294
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,544
Take the FDR, anything
else will take too long.

295
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,164
And remember, when
you get there, cut up early.

296
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,247
It's a one-way.

297
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,120
Wait! Wait, I'm coming.

298
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,922
Dr. Sharpe, you cannot leave.
You are the medical director.

299
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,393
And I learned from the best.

300
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:58,979
Max, we need to talk
about what happens if...

301
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,383
They'll get here.

302
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:06,654
If Georgia has another contraction,
there's not gonna be time to talk.

303
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,661
I'm gonna have to deliver the
baby, or we're risking both their lives.

304
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,960
But if you open her up

305
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,591
before the blood gets here,

306
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,330
she might not make it.

307
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:23,633
Which is why we
need to decide who...

308
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,440
No, they'll get
here. They have to.

309
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,117
I've been so selfish.

310
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:38,948
Thinking that I was the
one who wouldn't survive.

311
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,857
I never even stopped
to think, what if...

312
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,995
Georgia...

313
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,361
And Luna.

314
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,600
You know what? It's
okay. We don't have to...

315
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,872
If you hadn't shown
up when you did,

316
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,674
I don't know what
I would've done.

317
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,055
Thank God you're here.

318
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,325
By the way,

319
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,687
why are you here?

320
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,526
We can talk about that later.

321
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,811
You can't keep ignoring
me. I'm not ignoring you.

322
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,477
We've got guests, and these dishes
are not gonna walk themselves in.

323
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,316
You're always reminding
me how you're saving

324
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:43,565
the family ring for me, and
now I finally want to use it.

325
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,048
All your adult life you keep
telling me about your plan,

326
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,596
that you want your new
family to look like this one.

327
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,720
Yeah, I still do.

328
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,493
And how's that gonna
happen with Evie?

329
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,432
She doesn't even go to church.

330
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,662
Ma, that doesn't
mean that I can't.

331
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,206
I even noticed that
Evie doesn't cook.

332
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,535
Doesn't cook 'cause she can't.

333
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,269
She works 12 hours a day.

334
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,835
So, is she giving that up
when you have your kids?

335
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,717
Are you? I don't know.

336
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,252
Exactly.

337
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,844
Come back for the
ring when you do know.

338
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,854
Don't say it.

339
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,693
She just wants you to be happy.

340
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:29,258
No, she wants me to
marry somebody like her.

341
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,963
'Cause that's how you
get a family like this.

342
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:35,473
No judgment.
That's just the reality.

343
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,372
A life with Evie isn't
gonna look like this.

344
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,413
It's not going to look
like what you planned.

345
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,881
And Mom is smart enough
to see that. Why can't you?

346
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,161
He's calmer now.

347
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,160
Good.

348
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:05,930
Thank you.

349
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,918
When Jacob started to break
down in there, my instinct was...

350
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,412
Was to hold him.

351
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,022
That seemed like the
appropriate response.

352
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,321
But I can't.

353
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,489
Not after what happened
with Avi. I can't do that.

354
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,263
So I just froze.

355
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,800
This is different than Avi.

356
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,534
No, it's not.

357
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,504
I feel like

358
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,616
the physical contact

359
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,715
is all I have.

360
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,356
It's my crutch, you know?

361
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,667
The only thing I have
in my bag of tricks.

362
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,132
Iggy, sometimes people
need the physical contact

363
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:11,896
to feel cared for.

364
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,905
But it's not the
only trick you have.

365
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,507
It just heightens
your other gifts.

366
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,179
You can't doubt that.

367
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,379
But I do.

368
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,984
All the time now.

369
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,656
How can I get inside someone
else's head if I can't get out of my own?

370
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,861
You're always the
one who counsels me.

371
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:46,737
And you have
taught me very well.

372
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,577
So what I'll say to you is this.

373
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,907
That boy needs help,

374
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,278
and you are the only
one who can help him.

375
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,135
Heart rate's fluctuating.

376
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,296
The contractions have
started. I have to cut.

377
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,184
No, wait, wait, wait.
They're close, okay? Max...

378
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,609
No, they're gonna
be close. Just wait.

379
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,860
Hey, hey, tell me you guys will
make it here in the next three minutes.

380
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,762
We're close, Dr. Goodwin.
The other bus is right...

381
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:34,879
Give it to me. Sure.

382
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,220
Max, it's Helen. Talk to me.

383
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,786
Luna's heart rate is fading
with each contraction.

384
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,224
We could lose her
on the next one.

385
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,547
<i>But if Bloom operates now...</i>

386
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,654
Bloom's there?

387
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,128
Yeah, she saved Georgia's life.

388
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,463
But if she operates and
you are not close enough,

389
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,126
<i>then she could bleed out.</i>

390
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:51,998
Oh, God.

391
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,465
What? What?

392
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:54,800
Max, we are not close enough.

393
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,600
Yeah, no, but you...

394
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,339
<i>We're not gonna make it.</i>

395
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,441
Max?

396
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,147
<i>Are you still there?</i>

397
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,121
Yeah.

398
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,592
After everything you have done,

399
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,795
I would jump out of here, and
I would run the blood to you

400
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,201
<i>if I thought that it would help,</i>

401
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,533
<i>but we are not close enough.</i>

402
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,439
<i>I'm...</i>

403
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,470
I'm so sorry.

404
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,514
I have to...

405
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,544
I have to choose
between my wife and my...

406
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,117
No, no. Okay, look.

407
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,991
Hey, listen to me.

408
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,992
This is a decision
that you cannot make,

409
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,495
'cause whatever you decide,

410
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,033
you're gonna be haunted
by it for the rest of your life.

411
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,199
I've seen it, Max.

412
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,900
The guilt, the shame.

413
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,070
The loss.

414
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,205
It'll destroy you, Max.

415
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,045
But I have to.

416
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,349
I'll do it.

417
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,886
I'll decide.

418
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:25,194
I'll take on the responsibility.

419
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,897
Please, Max, please.

420
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,937
Let me do this for you.

421
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,408
Okay.

422
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,119
Try to cast your mind
back to that night.

423
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:54,886
What was the last exam you
and your friends had taken?

424
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,055
I don't...

425
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:58,856
I don't remember.

426
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,967
Jacob.

427
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,643
Jacob, when you
were talking about

428
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,647
being trampled
by people earlier,

429
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,483
you said, "Why
would he do that?"

430
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:20,879
Okay.

431
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:25,652
Why would you refer to a
whole crowd of people as "he"?

432
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:31,057
Person after person
running by you, over you,

433
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,796
and you said, "Why
would he do that?"

434
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,095
That's not what I meant.

435
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,661
I think it was.

436
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,967
Jacob, what really
happened that night?

437
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,105
Don't you think
it's time to find out?

438
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,475
Georgia's pulse?

439
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,153
Steady.

440
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,350
I can't get it.

441
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:04,855
The cord is crimped.

442
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,192
Can you free it?

443
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,493
I'm trying.

444
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,769
Come on, baby,
come on. Easy, easy.

445
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,600
Easy, easy.

446
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,265
You got it. All right,
you got it. Okay.

447
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,032
Okay, I got it.

448
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,304
Okay.

449
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,437
Easy.

450
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:26,183
Okay. There you go,
baby. There you go, baby.

451
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,721
There she is.

452
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:33,850
Hi, Luna.

453
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,821
Oh, my Lord.

454
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,056
It's okay.

455
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,221
Hi, hi.

456
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,698
Hi, hi.

457
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,010
Hi, Luna.

458
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,580
There you are.

459
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,649
You're a mess.

460
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:58,978
I'm your dad.

461
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,210
I got ya.

462
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,147
Ready?

463
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,246
Georgia,

464
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:07,551
she's here.

465
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:11,920
Georgia.

466
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:13,824
Yeah, I know.

467
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,333
Georgia, she's here.

468
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,668
Hi, we've been
waiting so long for you.

469
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,839
You came into this
world in a really,

470
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,347
really crazy way,
but now you're here.

471
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,009
Now you're here.

472
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,085
Georgia, she's here.

473
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:38,782
Georgia.

474
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:42,187
Max, she needs blood.

475
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,287
Right now.

476
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,701
You have to hang in there.

477
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:52,932
You need to hang in there.

478
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,774
Because I am not
doing this without you.

479
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,246
This little girl...

480
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,543
This little girl, she
needs her mom.

481
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,085
And so do I.

482
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,773
<i>I wish that I had known</i>

483
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,004
<i>In that first minute we met</i>

484
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,578
<i>The unpayable debt</i>

485
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,009
<i>That I owed you</i>

486
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,948
<i>Because you've been abused</i>

487
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,323
<i>By the bone that refused you</i>

488
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:50,288
<i>And you hired me
to make up for that</i>

489
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,464
<i>Walking in that room</i>

490
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:58,971
<i>When you had tubes in your arms</i>

491
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:04,943
<i>Singing morphine
alarms out of tune</i>

492
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,838
<i>Had you sleeping and eating</i>

493
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,884
<i>And I didn't believe them</i>

494
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:18,549
<i>When they called you a
hurricane thundercloud</i>

495
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,821
Okay, we got a pulse.

496
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,470
Is she all right?

497
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,405
She's fine.

498
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,151
It's not happening.
It's just a memory.

499
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,182
Say that.

500
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,657
It's just a memory.

501
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,853
So then look at it.

502
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,222
It's okay to look, Jacob.

503
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,324
Watch it!

504
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,362
I don't want to.

505
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,597
Every single detail is in there.

506
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,573
Just close your eyes and look.

507
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,385
Em...

508
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,863
It's okay. It's okay.

509
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,029
It's okay to look somewhere
else, just this once.

510
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,936
Where's your other
friend from the line?

511
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,600
Bobby? Yeah.

512
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,468
I have no idea.

513
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:48,805
Sure you do.

514
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,771
He's on the dance
floor somewhere.

515
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:55,713
Facing us?

516
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,556
He's facing away.

517
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,601
Okay. Well, now you
know why he didn't help.

518
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,565
He didn't see us.

519
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,797
No.

520
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,749
What about the big guy, the
guy who bumped into you?

521
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:15,934
Where's he?

522
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,976
He's on the dance
floor somewhere.

523
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,742
You sure?

524
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,508
You said he
crashed into you later.

525
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,981
So he couldn't be on the dance
floor when the bomb went off.

526
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,278
He must have been...

527
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,511
Why is he over there?

528
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,783
You tell me.

529
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,351
Wait. I hear something.

530
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,823
What is that?

531
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,156
Take a look.

532
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:46,835
It's a gas pipe.

533
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,572
Is that what the
guy's looking at?

534
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:01,946
That can't be right.

535
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,655
If that happened, I'd be dead.

536
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,319
So why aren't you?

537
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,317
Watch out!

538
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,366
He saved me.

539
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,736
I wasn't being trampled.

540
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,240
I couldn't move because

541
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,548
he saved me.

542
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,213
He risked his life for me.

543
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:41,591
Why would he do that?

544
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,763
Because sometimes
the world has light.

545
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,588
Hey.

546
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,522
Hey.

547
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:19,860
I have to say, you're the last
person I expected to find here.

548
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,091
Yeah, well, me too.

549
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,061
I actually came to tell Max

550
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,132
that I'm not coming back.

551
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,940
Hell of a last day.

552
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:34,241
Yeah.

553
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:38,249
Max would've lost his
family if it wasn't for you.

554
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,457
I am so sorry, Lauren.

555
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:48,826
I'm so very sorry.

556
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,930
I betrayed your trust.
I ruined our friendship.

557
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,488
You saved my life.

558
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,567
You saved my life.

559
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:03,569
Look, if I did anything good
today, it's because of you.

560
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:05,802
Let's go.

561
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,003
Trauma team's waiting.

562
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,839
Go.

563
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,513
You coming?

564
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,624
So, in my professional opinion,

565
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,665
that right there
is a giant balloon

566
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,700
full of cocaine in
Wilson Hatch's stomach.

567
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,291
It's at least four ounces.

568
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,600
Okay, so maybe there happens
to be a balloon in my stomach,

569
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:37,336
but you can't prove what's in it. It
could be something perfectly legal.

570
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,499
So let's see it.

571
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,371
What do you mean,
here? Just now, in the...

572
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,316
Please, man, please.

573
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,714
I'll be disbarred.

574
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,547
My girlfriend will leave me.

575
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,177
My wife will leave me.

576
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,482
Good luck.

577
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,155
No, no, no, no.

578
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,870
Tre, you want to play video games...
- Tre, put your hat on.

579
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,614
When we get home?
Thank y'all for coming.

580
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,799
Evie, you should come
over for dinner every Sunday.

581
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,426
Ah. If I came over every Sunday,
I would never get any work done.

582
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:07,067
Thank you.

583
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,631
Here.

584
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,566
It's yours, right?

585
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,254
You gonna take it or what?

586
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:33,755
No.

587
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,090
She's great.

588
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,422
Is that her?

589
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:11,594
Hey.

590
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,232
You did it.

591
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:22,603
There's somebody
who is dying to meet you.

592
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,081
Luna, say hi to your mom.

593
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,314
Oh, my God.

594
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,213
Hi.

595
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:33,250
Honey, you did it.

596
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,130
She's perfect.

597
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,457
Yeah.

598
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,628
There she is.

599
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,818
Your mom is drop-dead gorgeous.

600
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:07,154
I hope I look half
as good at her age.

601
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:14,331
Now is when you say, "You'll
look gorgeous at any age, babe."

602
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,130
I'm sorry. I just...

603
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,838
What's up? You haven't said
more than two words since we left.

604
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:24,708
Couldn't have been that bad.

605
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,342
I couldn't have been that bad.

606
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:35,679
You know, my whole life I imagined
what my future would look like,

607
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,379
what my family would look like.

608
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,784
I had a plan.

609
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:43,958
And to be honest,
you don't fit into it.

610
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:48,830
So I...

611
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,501
I don't know what to do.

612
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,737
For the first time,

613
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:05,372
I don't know what's
next, and I don't care.

614
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,748
As long as you're there.

615
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,753
As long as you're
right there with me,

616
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,215
I don't need a plan.

617
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,398
Look, I don't have your family's
blessing, and I don't have mine.

618
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,697
I don't have a ring, I
don't have anything.

619
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:32,403
Will you please,

620
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:37,910
please say you'll
spend your life with me,

621
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:41,080
make a family with me,

622
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,549
you'll marry me?

623
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,588
Yes.

624
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,455
Yes.

625
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,445
Here you go.

626
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,576
Thanks.

627
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,285
So are you back
down on earth yet?

628
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:20,984
Yeah.

629
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,826
First time on ecstasy
I haven't called an ex.

630
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,821
Jacob.

631
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,899
A joke, all right, man.

632
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,635
So why would my brain do that?

633
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,668
That guy saved my life.

634
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,401
Wouldn't I want
to remember that?

635
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:42,237
It does seem counterintuitive,

636
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,643
until you realize
how the brain works.

637
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,147
The brain is just...

638
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,918
It's just trying to
make sense of things.

639
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:55,427
Like, sometimes the world
is so beautiful, you know?

640
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,995
<i>The laughter of a friend.</i>

641
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,666
<i>A newborn baby
gripping your finger.</i>

642
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,267
<i>Life is all so fragile.</i>

643
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,942
<i>You blink, it's
gone, just like that.</i>

644
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,862
<i>In the face of horror,
our minds turn our trauma</i>

645
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:38,562
<i>into a story to
make sense of it,</i>

646
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,696
<i>even if it doesn't make sense.</i>

647
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:59,981
<i>So why would your mind tell
you that the world was evil?</i>

648
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,693
<i>Because evil means
that your fear is right.</i>

649
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,006
<i>Evil means that
you can just give up.</i>

650
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:41,797
<i>But to believe that we all
have the capacity to be heroes,</i>

651
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,969
<i>no matter how evil
the world may seem,</i>

652
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:48,465
<i>that's harder.</i>

653
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,536
<i>Because that means
when the worst happens,</i>

654
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:58,915
<i>we can choose to stand
up, we can choose to help.</i>

655
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:04,883
<i>And that's what, all day,
all around us, people do.</i>

656
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:09,728
<i>So, is the world dark?</i>

657
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:13,455
<i>Sure, but there's light.</i>

658
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,999
<i>There's so much light.</i>

659
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,264
<i>You just have to open
your eyes and look.</i>
