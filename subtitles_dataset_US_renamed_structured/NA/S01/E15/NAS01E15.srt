1
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:07,902
<i>You'll be back Soon you'll see</i>

2
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,707
<i>You'll remember You belong to me</i>

3
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:15,908
<i>And when push comes to shove</i>

4
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,919
<i>I will send a fully
armed battalion...</i>

5
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,611
Oh!

6
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:23,048
I see how it is. Yeah,
it's called strategy.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,803
Yeah, where I'm from,
it's called cheating.

8
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,261
You all right, Willow?

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,598
I swear, if they wrote a
Broadway musical about me,

10
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,396
it'd be called <i>The
Sound of Mucus.</i>

11
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,665
Mine would be called
<i>Mamma Mastectomy.</i>

12
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,499
More like <i>Thoroughly
Mortal Millie.</i>

13
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,173
That's a good one. <i>The
Phantom of the Operation.</i>

14
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,681
Willow, uh, how long
have you had that cough?

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,641
Mine'd be <i>Liver Let Die.</i>

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,644
<i>Liver-less.</i>

17
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,122
Of course, that's a Bond
film, not a Broadway musical,

18
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,120
but unlike you, I'm cool
with cheating. She's right.

19
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,628
Well, actually, I was thinking
of the Guns N' Roses song.

20
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,599
So, Max, what's
your cancer musical?

21
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,664
<i>Forever and ever...</i>

22
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,933
What's the matter,
Max? No jokes today?

23
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,201
Where's your sense of tumor?

24
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,627
Thank you, Andre.
That was so brave.

25
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,890
Nice connecting.

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,735
Lauren, how about you?

27
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,171
I know that you're
still getting acclimated

28
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,639
but we would love
to hear from you.

29
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,069
Your friend just visited?

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,813
Maybe you want to talk
about how that made you feel.

31
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,241
No.

32
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,853
But, um, thank you.

33
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,214
Maybe at evening group.

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,551
Have a beautiful
morning, everyone.

35
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,374
Thanks for sharing, Andre.
- Good session.

36
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,422
Way to go.

37
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,027
Yeah, hi. Come in. It's Martin.

38
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,146
No, babe. I hear what
you're saying loud and clear,

39
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,848
but she needs to try
new things, all right?

40
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:19,896
And plus, literally,

41
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,687
there's nothing cooler
that a kid could do.

42
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:27,075
Yes, or an adult. You got
me, okay? But she is going.

43
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,874
Yes, I'll call you
later. Love you.

44
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,544
Husbands, am I right?
Anyway, sorry about the mess.

45
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,419
Me and Sameera are
going for a sleepover

46
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,048
at the Museum of
Natural History later

47
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,184
and I am so excited.

48
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,194
I visited Lauren in rehab.

49
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,621
Okay.

50
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,524
Well, that happened.

51
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,966
I shouldn't have done that.

52
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,092
Yeah.

53
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,762
How was she?

54
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,069
I don't know. She wouldn't
even look at me, man. Just...

55
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,645
Then she just told me to leave.

56
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,214
Well, you invaded her privacy.

57
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:02,781
Yeah, but come
on. I'm her friend.

58
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,394
Yeah, but you may remind her

59
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,561
of an environment that's toxic.

60
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,383
Understand? Toxic?

61
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:10,049
The hospital. This place. All
the stress that it caused her.

62
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,414
Oh, yeah.

63
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,427
Besides, the first few days
in rehab are a huge transition.

64
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,618
You shouldn't have...

65
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,140
I thought you were
supposed to be a good listener.

66
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,393
Do... Ugh.

67
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,267
You know what? If you
want me to stand here

68
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,979
and make you feel better
about doing something

69
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,098
that I strongly advised
you not to, I'm not going to.

70
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,965
Because the person that I'm concerned
about right now is Lauren. Not you.

71
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,809
What? Really?

72
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,481
The old saved-by-the-page,
huh? That old chestnut?

73
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,910
Ten-year-old boy, status
post heart transplant,

74
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,980
now with respiratory arrest during
the Pope's procession down Fifth.

75
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,493
Trauma one. 126, 150/92 and 22.

76
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,587
O2 sat 92 on 100%
non-rebreather.

77
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,837
Jimmy, your parents are
right behind you, okay?

78
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,164
And I'm here. Ah, good. Jump in.

79
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,826
Jimmy, we're right here.

80
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,256
He's 10 years old.
Recent heart transplant.

81
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,618
O2 sats still in low 90s.

82
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:00,917
Push another 10
milligrams of Lasix.

83
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,341
Jimmy, everything's gonna be
okay. Just keep breathing, okay?

84
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,621
His lungs are filled with fluid.

85
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,704
Heart failure?

86
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,377
Most likely secondary
acute rejection,

87
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,680
which we need a left
ventricular biopsy to confirm.

88
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,246
Why is he rejecting
the transplant?

89
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,053
God only knows.

90
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,866
Good morning,
Mr. Brandt. Oh, okay.

91
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,863
Ahem!

92
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,232
Sorry.

93
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,170
You know how young women are
sex positive and everything nowadays.

94
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,745
Yes.

95
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,520
I understand you're
under a protocol at Baptist.

96
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,413
Yeah, for colon
cancer. Stage three.

97
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,220
Worst 18 months of my life.

98
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,553
Of course, until I met
this gorgeous woman.

99
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,358
So what would you
like me to do for you?

100
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,065
Well, it's pretty simple.

101
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,497
I want this thing removed.

102
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,577
Well, that thing is
how they administer

103
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,509
your chemotherapy
drugs for your colon cancer.

104
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,745
I'm not interested
in that either.

105
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,873
He wants to stop the chemo.

106
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,830
Have you discussed that with your
oncologist over at Baptist because...

107
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,449
Look, look. Can you take
the catheter out or not?

108
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,453
But the treatment is
prolonging your life.

109
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,057
It... It might be,

110
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,755
but I'm certain
as hell not living.

111
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:36,192
Tethered to a hospital,
dragged down by drugs.

112
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:41,870
I'd rather spend some time
traveling with this young woman.

113
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,977
Well, all my patients would rather be
doing something besides chemotherapy,

114
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,605
but it's vital in order
to treat the disease.

115
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,415
Haven't you ever been in love?

116
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:58,449
What wouldn't you give
for just a little bit more of it?

117
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,632
Meeting with Brennan
from HCC at 9:00.

118
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,497
Maintenance review
panel at 10:00.

119
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,400
Morbidity and Mortality
conference at 11:00.

120
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,268
I have a sense of humor, right?

121
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,902
I don't find you funny

122
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,118
but that's mainly because most
of your decisions ruin my life.

123
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,166
Ah.

124
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,076
You owe a call to the head of
the board about year-end budgets,

125
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,258
and you're meeting Georgia
for birthing class at 1:30.

126
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,342
Can you push it? Yeah, okay.

127
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,283
That was funny. What?
No, it wasn't a joke.

128
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,187
I just... I'm not really in
the push-push mood today.

129
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,951
Yeah, because birthing
class is all about your mood.

130
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,903
It's the... You know, I
don't know. It's like...

131
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:38,797
Something about joking about
death that's just not to me very funny.

132
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,010
You know, as much as I'd
love to keep talking to you

133
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,798
about your sense of humor,

134
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,600
do you remember speaking to the
Secret Service a few weeks ago?

135
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,937
Maybe, but if I told
you, I'd have to kill you.

136
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,248
Don't give up your day job.
Come on, that was funny.

137
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,642
They're in your office.

138
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,807
Hmm.

139
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,480
Uh... Max Goodwin, Medical
Director. Welcome to New Amsterdam.

140
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,614
Thank you. I am
Cardinal Mancini.

141
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,057
Hi. This is Agent Hayes
and Agent Larson...

142
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,659
How you doing? From
the Secret Service.

143
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,959
Cool. You know why we're here?

144
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,660
Uh... Yeah, no.

145
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,198
The Pope is addressing
the UN this afternoon.

146
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:21,230
Right, the Pope is addressing
the... Right. Yeah, I remember.

147
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,333
Ah, yes. And as
papal security liaison,

148
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:28,246
it falls to me to secure
your presidential bay

149
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,476
in case of an
emergency, God forbid.

150
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:34,745
Sure. Great. Well, I'm happy to
help. You need the presidential bay?

151
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,232
Yes, sir. And
surrounding floors.

152
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,225
Ah, yes. And the
surrounding floors.

153
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,193
Well, I don't love the
sound of surrounding floors.

154
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,254
This is a working hospital.

155
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,504
It's a precaution.
And merely a formality.

156
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,101
You'll hardly tell we're here.

157
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,003
Please make room. - Excuse us.

158
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,591
All the way to the
end of the hall, please.

159
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,674
Behind you.

160
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,711
Let's go, let's go.
Keep moving, please.

161
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,118
Hate to say this, but I
can kinda tell you're here.

162
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,087
Quincey.

163
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,222
Good hound, good
hound, good hound.

164
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:20,563
I'm not seeing any significant
scarring. It would be a very mild surgery.

165
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,193
Let her rip.

166
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:26,566
Before we let her rip I need to make
sure that you're absolutely certain

167
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,079
that you wanna end
your chemotherapy.

168
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,937
Never more sure of anything.

169
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,411
Okay. Well, while we wait for your
records to be sent over from Baptist,

170
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,560
we can schedule the procedure,
and then we'll take it from...

171
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:38,961
Dr. Sharpe. Lila,
I'm with a patient.

172
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,096
I'm sorry. I tried to tell them.

173
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,918
Tell who? Yeah, she's the one.

174
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,908
Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to ask you a few questions.

175
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,235
I haven't done anything.
Don't you touch her!

176
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,591
Sheila! Come on, let's go.

177
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,871
Sorry. Excuse me.
What's going on, please?

178
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,332
Hi. I'm Carl Jimenez. I'm
Mr. Brandt's legal guardian.

179
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,229
That woman kidnapped him.

180
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,431
Gentlemen.

181
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,440
We have received a
credible death threat

182
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,672
against the Pope
from within this hospital.

183
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,156
Security will need
to be heightened.

184
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,673
Uh... Sorry. Wait. Who here
would threaten the Pope?

185
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,475
As it turns out,
one of your doctors.

186
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:14,982
Dr. Vijay Kapoor.

187
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,822
It's not as simple as whether I
did or did not try to kill the Pope.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,798
How could it possibly
not be that simple?

189
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,769
Dr. Kapoor coated the bed in the
presidential bay with a known poison.

190
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,538
Sorry. Poison? It
was oleander petals!

191
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,439
Which are poisonous.
But it was a gift.

192
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,978
It represents heart chakra.
Pope has a big heart.

193
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,047
Yeah, Vijay, couldn't you just
have given the Pope a normal gift?

194
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:46,279
I would have, but what do you give
someone who lives in the Vatican?

195
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,819
Pope is a man of peace.

196
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,713
He supports women's
rights and gay people.

197
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,889
In fact, I heard a rumor that
he sneaks out of the Vatican,

198
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,656
disguised, to help to
feed the poor people.

199
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,698
As you can see, Dr. Kapoor
made an innocent mistake.

200
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,824
He loves the Pope.

201
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,197
I love the Pope. Loves him.

202
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,069
Your background
check came back clear.

203
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,476
So he can go, right?

204
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,151
I'll check. Great. Thank you.

205
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,685
I mean, if I actually
wanted to kill the Pope,

206
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,984
I would have used
white snakeroot petals.

207
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,257
Excuse me? Yeah, it's
faster and untraceable.

208
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,557
That's exactly what killed
Abraham Lincoln's mother, you know.

209
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,887
Take a seat, please, Dr. Kapoor.

210
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,663
What? You're on your own, pal.

211
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,165
Please take a seat.

212
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,105
So, Jimmy's heart biopsy results

213
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,283
show signs of acute rejection
and that's why your son collapsed.

214
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,190
Well, is he gonna be all right?

215
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,187
Well, I've increased
his immunosuppressants

216
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,046
and that should
treat this episode,

217
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,682
but we need to find out why
it happened in the first place.

218
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:03,093
Now, were there any changes in his
diet? Any rashes, colds or upset stomach?

219
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,892
Hmm.

220
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,634
Well, can you think of anything different?
Like, anything out of the ordinary?

221
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,467
Mrs. Corrigan?

222
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,606
Our insurance paid
for the transplant,

223
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,785
but they didn't pay for any
of the post-op medications.

224
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,252
Doesn't make any sense.

225
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,226
The pills, they cost
over $9,000 a month.

226
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,724
Our church held a fundraiser,
but it wasn't enough.

227
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,164
Okay. And?

228
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,304
We started
spreading out the pills.

229
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:51,237
Like, just giving him
one every other day.

230
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,470
We were trying
to make them last.

231
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,008
Um...

232
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,917
That's what made Jimmy sick.

233
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,113
We did this.

234
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,851
Well, I mean... It's real
easy to blame yourselves.

235
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,293
That's not gonna make
Jimmy better, okay?

236
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,480
We just need to make sure
that it never happens again.

237
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,756
All right? But it will.

238
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,131
We can't afford the pills.

239
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,295
What are we supposed to do?

240
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,038
I'm just doing my job.

241
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,806
Walter's living will
specifically states

242
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,178
any and all known medical
treatments should be explored.

243
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,780
Okay. But Sheila?

244
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,647
You can't honestly think that
that sweet lady's a kidnapper.

245
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,190
She removed him from his
residence and ran away with him.

246
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,449
They're in love.

247
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:42,389
Look, I'm just trying to protect
Walter from the story I see all the time.

248
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,457
An older man, alone, vulnerable,
meets a younger woman...

249
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,992
She's 75.

250
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,468
Twenty-five or 75, she wants
him to stop his cancer treatment.

251
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,382
Now, I've been granted his
healthcare decisions because frankly,

252
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,204
his healthcare proxy
was asleep at the wheel.

253
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,669
So here I am,
doing the best I can.

254
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,810
I can appreciate that.

255
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,750
So, tell me.

256
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,014
Is stopping treatment in
Walter's best interests?

257
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,486
Medically, no.

258
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,019
But I have to respect
the patient's wishes.

259
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,017
Well, legally, you have
to respect my wishes.

260
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:19,894
And even though Walt's a pain in
the ass, I'm just trying to keep him alive.

261
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,008
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>

262
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:29,103
If it were left up to Carl, I would
be alone, rotting in my apartment,

263
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,677
having the life
drained out of me.

264
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,672
He's doing what
he thinks is best.

265
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,715
He thinks Sheila pushed me.

266
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,384
The whole thing was my idea.

267
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,681
Unfortunately, the law
may not see it that way.

268
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:46,055
I don't have a lot of
time left on this Earth.

269
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,954
And the law won't let
me live the way I want to.

270
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,691
That ain't right.

271
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,868
Maybe there is
something that we can do.

272
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,467
Get the law on our side.

273
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,142
Max. How can I help?

274
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,279
Change the fundamental
idiocracy of American healthcare?

275
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,408
I'm working on it.

276
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,954
I've got this kid, just
had a heart transplant,

277
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,545
family can't afford
the post-op meds.

278
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,056
What's their financial profile?

279
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,490
Married, stable.

280
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,118
Dad's a security guard who
pulls in about 45K a year.

281
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,719
Too much to
qualify for Medicaid.

282
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,059
Or the Community Care Fund.

283
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:28,898
Well, we can help them in the short
term but they need a long-term solution.

284
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,627
Working class, just
caught in the middle.

285
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,232
Maybe not.

286
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,674
Um...

287
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,446
You could get a divorce.

288
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,287
Is this a joke?

289
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,815
Look, if Patricia is a
single mom with no income,

290
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,088
she and Jimmy could
qualify for Medicaid.

291
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,659
And Medicaid would cover
the cost of Jimmy's medication.

292
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,788
But we love each other.

293
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,033
Well, no one's questioning that.

294
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,036
And as Catholics, we don't
even believe in divorce.

295
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,533
You can't ask us to break

296
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,107
something that's
unbreakable. I can't even...

297
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:12,270
I'm sorry. It's just
this system is flawed.

298
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,510
And so is this solution, but
I can't think of a better one.

299
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,651
Get divorced, save your son.

300
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,725
What happened?

301
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,163
I don't know. I
just got the page.

302
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,661
Heart rate 140. BP 90 over
palp. Respiratory rate 22.

303
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,734
She collapsed at work.
EMS just dropped off.

304
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,206
Any history of
infection? No, none.

305
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,639
She's tachy, hypotensive,
warm to the touch.

306
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,732
Sepsis?

307
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,903
She has a hot, red, macular
rash around her J-tube.

308
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,571
Cellulitis. Looks like it.

309
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:48,806
That's preventable.

310
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,193
Helen, your people let her walk
out with an infection? Who's next?

311
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,379
Max, I paged you here as
her friend, not as her doctor.

312
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,984
Let's get her to Trauma One!

313
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,755
I've got this under control.

314
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:57,880
Do you?

315
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,685
I'm gonna give you a minute to
think about what you just said.

316
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,932
Max. Birthing class?
Hmm. I'll be there.

317
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,501
Okay.

318
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,112
How is she?

319
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,877
She's stable, but
not out of the woods.

320
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,928
Yeah. She was coughing this
morning but there was no indication...

321
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,547
Setbacks happen. You're
calling sepsis a setback?

322
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,199
Is this your way of apologizing?

323
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,748
She was laughing
at her symptoms.

324
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,220
This morning in chemo.

325
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:37,224
Everyone was laughing, and
I could have done something.

326
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,788
I could have gotten someone.

327
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,362
She was laughing
at her symptoms.

328
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,434
She was laughing because
of her symptoms, Max.

329
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,068
There's a difference.

330
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,945
One, two, three, four, five.

331
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,075
No.

332
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:02,741
Five, four, three, two, one?

333
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,115
No.

334
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,061
Can you think of any
other five-digit password?

335
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,256
As soon as I scan your
email, you're free to go.

336
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,236
I want to help you
but I rarely use email.

337
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,662
Honestly, I thought it
was a passing trend.

338
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,800
What do you use?

339
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,300
A cup of tea and a conversation.

340
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,305
Is it your back
that's bothering you?

341
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,105
Maybe I can help.

342
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,285
You wanna help?
Remember your password.

343
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,183
Hello, John Wilkes Booth.

344
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,317
I warned you not
to do it, didn't I? Ah.

345
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,983
You did?

346
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,932
Yeah. Hell yeah, I did,
because it was idiotic.

347
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,507
You mean you knew about this little
stunt and you decided not to report it?

348
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,863
Yeah. No.

349
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,691
No, wait. What?

350
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,292
Take a seat, please.

351
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,332
No, no, no, I gotta...

352
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,278
That's a joke, right?
You're kidding?

353
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,339
I'm not known for
my sense of humor.

354
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,383
Do you know my password?

355
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,885
The ICU is a secured area, sir.

356
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,822
Sure it is, and you're
doing a hell of a job,

357
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,384
but I'm late for a birthing
class and this way's faster,

358
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,555
so I'm just gonna go
ahead and... Okay.

359
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,528
That's my ICU, right?
And I'm really late

360
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,799
so I'm just gonna go ahead
and walk through it right now.

361
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,739
So you can just step aside.

362
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,170
Go ahead and just step...

363
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,809
Yeah. Did I mention
I have cancer?

364
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,697
<i>When you find out
that you have cancer,</i>

365
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,928
it's the worst moment.

366
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,502
Everything is chaos and...

367
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,667
And fear.

368
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,340
When adult protection services

369
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,706
petitioned to have Mr. Brandt
become a ward of the state,

370
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,446
he had just got his
cancer diagnosis.

371
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,575
He was unraveling.

372
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,010
But then Walter met Sheila.

373
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:21,792
And since he's been with Sheila,
he's happy and taken care of.

374
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,756
Will love cure Walter? No.

375
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,029
But it will heal
him in other ways.

376
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,802
Mr. Jimenez, do
you have a response?

377
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,708
I do, Your Honor.

378
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,078
The decision to deem
Mr. Brandt an incapacitated person

379
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,240
was not made lightly.

380
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,943
Now... Oh, come on.

381
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,916
Mr. Brandt, this
is for your benefit.

382
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,084
You're petitioning to
get your rights back.

383
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,645
Please let Mr. Jimenez finish.

384
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,716
I'm sorry.

385
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,201
Look, I didn't want to go there,

386
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,059
but of the five speeding
tickets Walter got last year,

387
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,495
one of them was near a school.

388
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,827
His hoarding caused a
small fire in his apartment.

389
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,493
And then Walter got aggressive
with his healthcare attendant

390
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,127
when she tried to
help him clean up.

391
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,573
That's why the state stepped in.

392
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,971
You believe he's a danger
to himself and to others?

393
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,346
I do, Your Honor.

394
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,522
Hey, there.

395
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,798
Can we talk for a minute?

396
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:44,205
I just wanted to check in. I
know we hit you with a crazy idea.

397
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,844
We were just trying to help
you duck some red tape.

398
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,173
Our marriage isn't red tape.

399
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,044
I realize that.

400
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,779
When Neil and I got
married, we made a promise

401
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:58,681
to our friends,
our family, to God.

402
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,961
It was a divine pact to each
other. That's a... It's a real promise.

403
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,724
Marriage is forever.

404
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,026
I can't even imagine.

405
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,661
Neil is our rock.

406
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,793
Look, Mrs. Corrigan...

407
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,667
I won't abandon my family.

408
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,640
It'd just be on paper. "Render
unto Caesar," that sort of thing.

409
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,903
There has to be another way.

410
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,671
We'd lose our community.

411
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,771
We wouldn't be able
to receive the Eucharist.

412
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,212
I understand,

413
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,643
but is that worth more
than your son's life?

414
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,524
Hey, maybe we
could get remarried.

415
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,252
You know, when Jimmy's
off his medications.

416
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:42,030
Unfortunately, Jimmy will be
on meds for the rest of his life.

417
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,437
This is forever?

418
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,066
I don't see any
other way around it.

419
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,247
Then we'll do it.

420
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,099
Inhale.

421
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,431
And exhale.

422
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:28,036
Okay, moms. Put all your
weight on your partner.

423
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,145
Inhale.

424
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,384
And sway.

425
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:40,058
Good. Doesn't that feel good?

426
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,058
Are you okay? Hmm?

427
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,555
If this is too
much, we can stop.

428
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,456
No, yeah, I'm good. I'm swaying.

429
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,829
Sorry. All right.

430
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,769
Okay, now guide
mom down to her pillow.

431
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,804
And, moms, this
is the best part.

432
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,440
Foot massage.

433
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,782
This is great if you
have a headache.

434
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:06,517
And who remembers the
one place not to massage?

435
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:07,809
Ankles.

436
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,821
Everyone, this is Max,
the Medical Director.

437
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,336
Yeah, I got a follow-up question.
Why are we giving foot massages

438
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,591
when we should be discussing
postpartum hemorrhaging,

439
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,702
which is the number one
cause of maternal mortality?

440
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,127
Not a joke.

441
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,860
Max... What?

442
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,533
Rest assured that
hemorrhaging is very rare, okay?

443
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,373
Yeah, rare, but 5% of births
and double that for Cesareans

444
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,208
and I mean, if mom
does have a headache,

445
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:35,857
that could be preeclampsia
or any number of...

446
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,009
Max, stop it. Sorry, sorry.

447
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:42,613
Just there's a lot that could

448
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:44,550
go wrong.

449
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,183
Sorry.

450
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,366
So you have your
settlement agreement.

451
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,400
We'll take it to the
judge for questioning.

452
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:58,335
It'll take a while before
your divorce becomes official,

453
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,203
so when you go home, we'll
make sure that we send you

454
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:04,402
with enough meds to cover
Jimmy until the Medicaid kicks in.

455
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,638
As long as Jimmy's okay.
That's what's important.

456
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,570
Where is he?

457
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,355
Jimmy couldn't have gone far.

458
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,489
Sepsis in oncology,
missing patients...

459
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,604
This isn't supposed to happen
here at New Amsterdam.

460
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,329
Well, it's still a hospital, Max.
People get sick, scared or...

461
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,995
Don't say it. Die.

462
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:33,596
Dude, I just said,
"Don't say it."

463
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:37,199
Why... I literally... Oh,
my God. Seriously?

464
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,136
Agents, have you
seen a 10-year-old boy,

465
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,931
straight brown hair,
in the last 30 minutes?

466
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,379
I have not. Hmm. Right.
Of course you haven't.

467
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,940
Can I just ask,
what have you seen?

468
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,884
Four orderlies, 12 patients,
nine doctors, 17 nurses,

469
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,720
a janitor and two pregnant couples
looking for building D. Three couples.

470
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,188
Wow.

471
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,263
Yeah, since the Pope
probably isn't coming today...

472
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,256
How about you and a few of your
guys help us out in another way?

473
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,094
Scent.

474
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,433
Good dog.

475
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,713
Good dog.

476
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,248
Can we go now, please?

477
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,463
My supervisor wants you to stay
put until the Pope leaves the city.

478
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,583
Till...

479
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,591
Come on, come on! Till
the Pope leaves the city?

480
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,223
Do we look like Pope
assassins to you?

481
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,245
He doesn't even know where his
glasses are and they're on top of his head.

482
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,431
Right? I'm a pacifist.
I can't even swat a fly.

483
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,765
We should all have
a nice cup of tea.

484
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:46,071
Tea? Martin and Sameera
are on their way here right now.

485
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,089
We're gonna miss the sleepover
at the Natural History Museum

486
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,473
and you're talking
to me about tea?

487
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,909
It's cinnamon spice.

488
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,613
I do love cinnamon spice.

489
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,658
The Museum of Natural History
must be so creepy at night.

490
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,404
Yeah, well, you must
be so creepy at night.

491
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,330
You know, with those all
dead animals with their eyes.

492
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,151
My Rohan never liked
to go there as a child.

493
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,034
It's creepy. No, it's not.

494
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,127
It's magical, it's wonderful
and it's educational.

495
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,669
The trifecta.
You're not listening.

496
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,653
No, you guys are having
a different conversation

497
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,939
- than I am, clearly.
- Jesus!

498
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,304
What's the matter? Scalding hot.

499
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,234
No, actually, it's kinda
the perfect temperature.

500
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,442
My leg's on fire.

501
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,278
Have you been experiencing
strange sensation in your leg?

502
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,014
Tingling.

503
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,787
On and off.

504
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,519
Is it better after work hours?

505
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,387
How do you know?

506
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:42,832
You have meralgia paresthetica.
It's caused by your gun.

507
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:44,796
My gun?

508
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,330
Yeah, it's pressing on your
lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.

509
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,735
If you switch to a shoulder holster,
your symptoms should go away.

510
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:54,836
Thank you.

511
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,609
So let me ask you
something. In your line of work,

512
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:03,755
do a lot of assassins stop to diagnose
strangers with nerve disorders?

513
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,596
Dr. Sharpe, like you,
I do believe in love.

514
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,696
But love doesn't change the law.

515
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:17,065
The law grants Mr. Jimenez
the right to determine

516
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,401
the medical decisions
for Mr. Brandt.

517
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,469
Unless you have
anything else to present.

518
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:24,970
I don't, Your Honor.

519
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,964
Then I'm afraid
to say we're done.

520
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,939
Legal guardianship
remains with Mr. Jimenez.

521
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,577
Thank you, Your Honor.

522
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:39,983
Walt.

523
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,052
Let's get you home.

524
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,026
What are you doing?

525
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,364
Hiding.

526
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:30,007
If I thought I could get
back up, I would join you.

527
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,208
You got a family?

528
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,542
I'm mad at them.

529
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,147
Yeah.

530
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,715
Authority figures.

531
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,051
I'm mad at them, too.

532
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,060
I wish I was old.

533
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,560
I wish I was young.

534
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:07,704
Found him.

535
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:16,018
Honey, we were so
worried about you.

536
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,221
Are you gonna live
in different houses?

537
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,249
No.

538
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,420
Will you still love each other?

539
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,026
Of course.

540
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,033
But you're gonna go to hell.

541
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,505
Jimmy.

542
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:37,035
It's not that simple.

543
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:42,681
Divorce is a sin. Sister Frances
said so. She said sinning isn't cool.

544
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,711
Is she wrong?

545
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,913
No, she's right.
Sinning isn't cool.

546
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:54,526
So you'll go to hell and I'll go to
heaven and not be with you forever.

547
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,464
Hi. Hi.

548
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,268
It's an ambush. I see that.

549
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,312
So are we kicked out
of foot massage class?

550
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,582
No, but there
were a lot of people

551
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,243
googling preeclampsia
and hyperventilating.

552
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,038
Well, hyperventilating
is kinda like Lamaze,

553
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,714
so good practice, right?

554
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,447
Sorry.

555
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,752
Not funny.

556
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,925
Kind of off my game today.

557
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,428
What is going on, babe?

558
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,433
It's nothing.

559
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,793
I should get back to work. Max.

560
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:42,739
Okay, it's just that... I
mean, foot massages?

561
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,076
And standing squats,

562
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:49,740
and changing doll diapers. The
focus of that class is just way off.

563
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,074
Babe, the focus of that
class is managing labor.

564
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,914
The focus of that class

565
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,963
is situations that you could
handle with an epidural

566
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,183
when what you need to
focus on is getting ready.

567
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,088
I mean, you need to get...

568
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:02,522
You need to get ready.

569
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:05,759
Just in case.

570
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:08,859
In case of what?

571
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,299
In case I'm not there.

572
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,664
I might not be able
to carry your weight,

573
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:19,973
or help you change positions
or bring you ice chips.

574
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,877
I might not be in there at all.

575
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,143
You understand?

576
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,527
That is what you
need to think about.

577
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,144
That is what you
need to get ready for.

578
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,549
I know. And I do.

579
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:32,882
Every day.

580
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,139
Yeah, but you
don't... I don't what?

581
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,722
I don't have public outbursts?

582
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,376
I don't rail about
maternal death rates?

583
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,527
No, I don't.

584
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,067
Then how do you...

585
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,074
I look around.

586
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,844
At everything that I have.

587
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,344
And I focus on that.

588
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,479
Hmm.

589
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,221
And if it goes?

590
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,325
Then it goes.

591
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,665
But it's not gone yet.

592
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:18,897
You hear me?

593
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,765
You're not gone yet.

594
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,032
Mmm-hmm.

595
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:52,063
There's no improvement
yet but she is a tough cookie.

596
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:54,096
Not that cancer cares.

597
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,139
Why was she laughing?

598
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:03,814
You should hear
some of their jokes.

599
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,484
I mean, they used
to name their tumors.

600
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,883
I believe Willow's
was Arnold, as in,

601
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:14,017
"It's not a tumor."

602
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,659
That's pretty good.

603
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,325
But it is a tumor.

604
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,925
Grace comes in many forms.

605
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,667
You would have been
proud of me today.

606
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,405
Yeah? Yeah, I pulled a Max.

607
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,010
How? Had multiple panic
attacks in the hospital,

608
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,243
frightened pregnant
women, encouraged sin?

609
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:40,846
No. Mmm.

610
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,852
No, I...

611
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:46,122
I got way more involved with
a patient than I should have.

612
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,825
Feels good, doesn't it?

613
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:52,089
Not when it doesn't work out.

614
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,789
Yeah.

615
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,330
Sorry to interrupt.

616
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,773
Dr. Sharpe, can we talk
about Walter's next steps?

617
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:06,202
Yeah.

618
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,190
First thing we have to do is
get Walter back to Mt. Zion.

619
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,184
Baptist. What?
No, no. He's at...

620
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:21,952
Oh.

621
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:25,225
Baptist. Yeah,
you're right. Sorry.

622
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:27,963
How many are you taking care of?

623
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,634
Wards of the state? Ten?

624
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:32,865
Seems rather a lot.

625
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,167
Well, it is, but I wish
I could take on more.

626
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,902
There are so many
seniors out there alone.

627
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,140
No husband or wife, no children.

628
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,708
And the ones like Walter, they
require even more time and attention.

629
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,210
And even more care.

630
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,182
You mean like that?

631
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,721
Yeah, like that.

632
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,167
I have an idea.

633
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,364
Well, this is one for the books.

634
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,672
You want me to
terminate his guardianship?

635
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:12,938
Yes, Your Honor.

636
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,610
The ruling that I just
confirmed in your favor?

637
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,676
Yes, Your Honor. Can I ask why?

638
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,876
Actually, it was
Dr. Sharpe's idea.

639
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:23,879
But there is one condition.

640
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,384
One condition?

641
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:29,053
If Mr. Jimenez is not going to be
Mr. Brandt's guardian, who will?

642
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,591
His wife.

643
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,397
I didn't realize you
were married, Mr. Brandt.

644
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,959
That's the one condition.

645
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,595
All I want is for someone
to look out for Walter.

646
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,238
Someone with his
best interests at heart.

647
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,032
And I accept.

648
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,305
Me, too.

649
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,810
Dr. Goodwin, <i>grazie.</i>

650
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,249
I apologize for
any inconvenience.

651
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,951
It's no inconvenience at all.

652
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,887
Actually, that's not true. It
was a lot of inconvenience.

653
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,088
Ah.

654
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,155
If there is any way I
can express my gratitude,

655
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,733
just let me know.

656
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,824
Mmm.

657
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,663
Actually...

658
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,397
There is.

659
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,775
Dr. Reynolds? Oh. Just in time.

660
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,909
Hey, guys. Jimmy, I'd
like you to meet someone.

661
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,474
This is Cardinal Mancini,
the Pope's right-hand man.

662
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,419
The Pope?

663
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,849
Mmm-hmm.

664
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:31,454
It's a great honor,
Cardinal, sir.

665
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,288
We're big fans.

666
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,824
I talked to His Holiness
about your predicament.

667
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,092
The Pope says it's cool.

668
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,853
You guys will not believe
what I just went through.

669
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,936
Iggy. All right,

670
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,424
so if we're gonna make the flashlight
tour of the museum, we gotta get going.

671
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,780
Put that away. Hang on a second.

672
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,112
What? What is it?

673
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,711
She doesn't want to go.
What are you talking about?

674
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,531
Of course, she wants to go.
That's what we talked about.

675
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:04,865
We're going, right?
Put that stuff away.

676
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,155
Iggy, Iggy. Stop
talking and listen.

677
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,188
Okay.

678
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,576
Wanna tell him what you told me?

679
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,892
Okay, come on. Come on, bug.

680
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,116
You gotta tell me what's
going on. What's wrong?

681
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,465
The museum is scary.

682
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,140
The museum is not
scary. It's a museum.

683
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,970
And you told me that
you wanted to go, right?

684
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,870
'Cause you wanted to go.

685
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,911
I just, um...

686
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,246
You know, I just...

687
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,848
I wanna share all the things
that I loved the most with you

688
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,005
because that's my favorite
part about being your dad.

689
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:48,695
But maybe sometimes
I'm not the best listener.

690
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,436
Even though that
is technically my job.

691
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,068
Maybe sometimes at home
you don't get the best of me.

692
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,873
I'm sorry. I always want
you to have the best of me.

693
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,109
Okay?

694
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,076
What do you think? Hug?

695
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:11,681
You're in? Come
here. Meet me halfway.

696
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,103
Get up here. Oh, my
gosh. You're getting so big.

697
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,121
Can I get in on that? Of course.

698
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,365
Does anyone else wanna speak?

699
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,546
All right, then. I'll see you
guys tomorrow morning.

700
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:37,772
I messed up.

701
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,549
Uh...

702
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,782
I was in trouble,

703
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,619
and instead of asking for help,

704
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,122
I just pushed everyone away.

705
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,296
I didn't think I had
any friends left.

706
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,631
I thought, well,

707
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,468
I ruin all my relationships.

708
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,807
And I was wondering...

709
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:13,074
Why even bother
recovering, you know?

710
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,356
Why not let myself sink
deeper down the hole?

711
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,953
Didn't think I
had anything left.

712
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,524
I have nothing to go back to.

713
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,628
But then,

714
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,500
the other night,

715
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,867
a friend of mine came to visit,

716
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,310
and I'm just really
grateful that he did.

717
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,109
Thank you.

718
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,815
<i>I wish I was the moon tonight</i>

719
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,302
"Out of the night that covers me

720
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:57,557
"Black as the pit
from pole to pole

721
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,990
"I thank whatever gods may be

722
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,158
"For my unconquerable soul"

723
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:07,334
<i>God bless me I'm a free man</i>

724
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:11,866
<i>With no place free to go</i>

725
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,572
<i>Paralyzed and collared-tight</i>

726
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,412
<i>No pills for what I fear</i>

727
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,009
<i>This is crazy</i>

728
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,890
<i>I wish I was the moon tonight</i>

729
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:33,392
<i>Chimney falls as lovers blaze</i>

730
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:36,900
<i>Thought that I was young</i>

731
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,867
<i>Now I've freezing hands
And bloodless veins</i>

732
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,602
No! What have you
done with my daughter?

733
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:47,543
<i>Numb as I've
become, I'm so tired</i>

734
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:51,413
<i>And I wish I was the moon</i>

735
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,542
<i>I'm so tired</i>

736
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,917
<i>I'm so tired</i>

737
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,549
<i>And I wish I was the moon</i>

738
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:04,858
<i>Tonight</i>

739
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:17,805
Jeez. Feels like I walked into
the final scene of <i>Miss Saigon.</i>

740
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,638
We were worried about you,
hon. Yeah, you scared us.

741
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:29,152
Yeah, we... For a minute there,
we thought you were <i>"Croaklahoma."</i>

742
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,621
Oh, my...

743
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,257
- That's twisted, man.
- I love it.

744
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,094
You know, you also could
have gone with <i>Oaklymphoma.</i>

745
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,610
See, that's good. That's better.

746
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,971
Or <i>A Little Night Mucus.</i>

747
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,076
<i>Fiddler on the Puke?</i>
Does that work?

748
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,846
Ew. It's good. Why is it
"Ew"? Why is that "Ew"?

749
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:59,014
<i>- Catch Me If You Cancer.</i>
- Mmm. Strong.

750
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,316
<i>The King and Eye Cancer.</i>

751
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:02,510
Very specific.

752
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,322
Good one, Mike.
An actual musical.

753
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:10,118
<i>Anything Ghosts</i> is a pretty good one.
<i>- "Anything Ghosts"!</i>

754
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,995
<i>Gurney Boys.</i>

755
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,460
It's a good one.
That's a good one.

756
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,495
How about this?
