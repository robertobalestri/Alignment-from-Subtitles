355
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,613
Are you Superintendent Davis?

356
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,443
You a parent?

357
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,271
- I am. Yeah.

358
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:10,186
But, fortunately,
my daughter's only three,

359
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,275
so she doesn't attend any
of your schools.

360
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,235
I'm also a doctor treating
two boys from PS 441

361
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:17,019
who ended up in the hospital

362
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,979
because your non-nurse
mixed up their meds.

363
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,158
- I, uh...

364
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,638
I didn't know about this.

365
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:31,251
- I'm not surprised,
but I am curious why--

366
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:34,080
why you would authorize
a secretary

367
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:38,040
with no medical training
to hand out drugs to children.

368
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,043
- How are the boys?

369
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,263
- In the hospital...

370
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:44,525
but stable.

371
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,748
Look, it's not just PS 441,

372
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,881
Dr. Goodwin.

373
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,491
Even if I could come up
with the money,

374
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,972
there are over 400
other schools in our district.

375
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,105
- That don't have nurses?
- They used to--

376
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,802
back in the day
when you and I went to school.

377
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:03,283
We've had over
a billion dollars

378
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,415
cut out of our budget
over the past decade.

379
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,157
- So w-what happens
when a kid gets sick?

380
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,246
- We treat them
as best as we can,

381
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,467
and then we send them home,
often to an empty apartment.

382
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,338
It's a disaster.

383
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,038
I mean,
is your budget on the rise?

384
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,301
You have any nurses
you can spare?

385
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:23,868
Didn't think so.

386
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:25,522
Look, I took an oath

387
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,438
to make public schools better
for our children.

388
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,529
I kept as many teachers
as I could,

389
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,357
but something had to go.

390
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:37,534
So now I come down here
every lunch break,

391
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:41,799
and I imagine that each ball
is a bureaucrat

392
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:45,107
who's taken something
important away from our kids.

393
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:51,983
- You want to hit one?

394
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,075
- Okay, Mr. Fontenot, thank you
very much for coming in.

395
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,641
I appreciate it.

396
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:01,732
I, um--I had an interesting
session with your wife,

397
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,778
um, but I realized
after speaking with Pauline

398
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:06,085
that I really needed
to meet the entire family.

399
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:08,174
- Oh?
- Yeah.

400
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:11,220
You know, y-your wife
had a miraculous recovery.

401
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:13,092
How has that made
everyone feel?

402
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,051
- Oh, blessed.
- Relieved.

403
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,835
- I just couldn't stop
hugging her.

404
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,533
- I was beyond grateful.

405
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:23,014
- Huh, okay.

406
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:26,583
So, um, since Pauline found
out that she was cancer-free,

407
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:30,761
has anyone noticed
that she was a tad depressed?

408
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:33,590
- No. No.
- Not really.

409
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:34,983
- Huh?

410
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,942
- Okay.

411
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:39,944
I used to love
watching the Spurs.

412
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,032
They're my team, right?

413
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,992
After Pauline
got her diagnosis,

414
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:46,125
she'd always insist
we watch something else.

415
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,431
I mean, how could I argue?
She had cancer.

416
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,694
- But when I offer
to make her dinner,

417
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:52,174
she always asks for fish.

418
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,307
And most of us hate fish!

419
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,960
- Could you believe it?

420
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,180
She actually asked us
to go skydiving.

421
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,139
And I'm terrified of heights.

422
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,531
But I couldn't say no
to her

423
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,142
because it's all
on her "bucket list."

424
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,796
- After a while,
we all wanted cancer.

425
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,320
- Um...

426
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,062

427
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:14,022

Here at New Amsterdam,

532
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:50,532
you can become CNA's--
certified nursing assistants.

533
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:52,360
- But many of us have jobs,
more than one.

534
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:53,448
How could we--

535
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,841
- Chipping in
just an hour a day,

536
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:56,538
one day a week,
we can make this work.

537
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:59,715
And we know it's not an ideal
situation, but it's a Band-Aid.

538
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,543
And Band-Aids serve a purpose.

539
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:04,807
They help keep things
together, so...

540
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:07,767
So who's in?

that during your illness,

543
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:22,085
your family was always there
to support you, right?

544
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:25,132
Always by your side?
- They were, yes.

545
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:28,439
- Well, that's pretty easy
to get used to, isn't it?

546
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:30,920
People doing what you want
whenever you want it--

547
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:32,922
that's powerful stuff.

548
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:36,230
But now that you're healthy,
it is important

549
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:39,363
to give those same people the
space to attend to their needs.

550
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:44,107
- Pauline, why are you crying?

551
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:48,547

with them.

552
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,247
T-this is why they
don't want me around anymore.

553
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,379

554
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,033

Let me ask you this.

556
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:02,604
Before the cancer,

557
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,954
what would happen
if you didn't want to watch

558
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,477

with your husband?

559
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:07,914
- We'd watch anyway.

560
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:09,219
- And if you wanted fish

561
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:10,873
and everybody else
wanted steak?

562
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:12,092
- I'd eat steak.

563
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:14,442
- Did you ever push back
on this?

564
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:15,878
- I'd go along.

565
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,794
- Your generation
was taught that it was rude

566
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:21,101
to ask for what they wanted.

567
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:24,931
When you got cancer
and you finally did ask for it,

568
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,454

pretty darn good, right?

570

- More than good.

- Huh.
- Considering you were dying.

Pauline, you know, you spent

575
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,520

the ones that you love,

577
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:54,830

got sick with cancer,

578
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:57,224

worked overtime

579

trying to do the same for you
to support you.

580
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,967
- I can't go
back to the way it was.

581
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,317
- No, nor should you.

582
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,754
But you need to figure out how
to take turns

583
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:07,669

584
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,105
Balance.

is to let them know you.

00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:40,920

No, you most certainly did not.
