00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:00,757
because you don't
like what they said.

180
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,324
- It's not what they said.

181
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,936
It's what they did.
Isaac--Isaac dumped me.

182
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,068
It's his fault.
- Oh.

183
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,460
- He started it!
- Okay, okay.

184
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:09,549
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,246
Heartbreak, that's rough,

186
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,813
but you can talk to me
about it, okay?

187
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:14,684
No matter how awful it gets.

188
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:17,034
- The only one who's gonna
feel awful is him.

189
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,949
I'm coming for you, you freak!

190
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:22,039
- Okay, time out, time out,
time out, come on.

191
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,651
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

192
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,920
Well, looky here.
What, is it Visitor's Day?

193
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,835
- Actually, I work here.
For Urgent Medicine.

194
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,924
Yeah, lovely little outfit
on the sixth floor.

195
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,839
Nice people, great benefits.

196
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:41,581
- And UMI is a subcontractor,
so I can't fire you.

197
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,887
Cute.
- Yeah, isn't it?

198
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:45,628
You know, the cutest thing
might actually be

199
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,108
UMI's seat
on New Amsterdam's board,

200
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:50,154
which I believe
meets this afternoon, right?

201
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:51,852
Which is great for me
because...

202
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:54,376
I got a lot to say.

203
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:58,162
Hey, I'll see you there.

204
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,686
- Can't wait.

205
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,867
- Hey, in my office.

206
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:11,262
- "Office"
is an ambitious word choice.

207
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:14,265
- Well, underestimate me
at your own risk.

208
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,964
I have a way to take out
our target once and for all.

209
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,880
In 2004, there was
a huge malpractice suit.

210
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:21,621
A patient died,
they settled out of court,

211
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:23,623
and that NDA just expired.

212
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,537
I can take that NDA
to the board

213
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,627
and blow the lid
off this thing.

214
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,759
- We can't.
- I mean, I don't want to

215
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:31,587
use it either,
but what choice do we have?

216
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,458
- I mean, we can't because
the board's already heard it.

217
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,678
Veronica told the story
at her job interview.

218
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:37,288
Took full responsibility.

219
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,682
That's what
great politicians do,

220
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,379
turn weakness into strength.

221
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,251
What they don't do
is show up at the OK Corral

222
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:47,124
at High Noon
with an empty gun.

223
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,866
We still have
the element of surprise.

224
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,825
At least she doesn't
know we're coming for her.

225
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:57,744
- Yeah, well, about that,

226
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:00,921
she kind of knows.

227
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:08,145
- Is this your office?
- Rude.

228
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,017
- Patient Oren Azad
got handed

229
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,584
an unjustified bill
from New Amsterdam.

230
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:15,544
Not only is it unjustified,
it is intentionally predatory.

231
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:16,893
- Well, did he talk to billing?

232
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,373
Sometimes they can
help negotiate that down.

233
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,070
- He did,
and that's where he found out

234
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:21,724
it was already
referred to collections.

235
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,683
- Yeah, where he can
fight it in court

236
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,075
with a bunch of money
he doesn't have.

237
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,469
- Exactly. But since
you are always the Mozart

238
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,167
of helping people not pay,
I thought maybe a little

239
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,603
"Goodwin special sauce" might--

240
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:33,736
- Floyd.
- Oh, I like that face.

241
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,738
That's a classic
"Max brings justice

242
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:37,261
to the people" face
right there.

243
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,872
- This is it.

244
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:41,352
This is what's gonna
finally bring Veronica down.

245
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,055
- You know, when somebody
breaks up with you,

246
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:51,232
it is perfectly natural to feel
a whole well of emotion--

247
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,842
sadness, loss...

248
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,496
- Revenge.

249
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:57,847
The desire to make his pathetic
life an ever-living hell.

250
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:02,809
- Sure, yeah, that's an emotion
one could feel, yeah.

251
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:06,116
Why do you think
you're feeling that?

252
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,031
- Because I-I liked him.

253
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:10,033
I spent my first kiss on him.

254
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,035
- Oh.

255
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,341
How was it?

256
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,038
- Good?

257
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:17,301
But then I got confused,

258
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,782
'cause I know
I don't feel things the way

259
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:21,523
other people feel things.
- Sure.

260
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:24,134
- So I decided
I should test it.

261
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,136
- You decided to test it?
How?

262
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,008
- I kissed every other boy
on the inpatient floor

263
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:29,879
to see how those kisses
made me feel.

264
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,359
- Ah.

265
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:33,535
- And none of them even came
close to kissing Isaac.

266
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,755
His kiss was...different.

267
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,322
I don't know.
He made me feel something.

268
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:41,108
- Hmm.
- But then he found out.

269
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:42,805
He should have been happy.

270
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,155
The test proved
his kiss was the best one,

271
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,245
but instead he dumped me

272
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,639
in front of everyone.

273
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:52,902
And now he's gonna pay.

274
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:55,905
- Did you ever consider

275
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:59,213
that Isaac might feel another
emotion other than happiness,

276
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:00,910
after he learned
about the kissing?

277

278

- Well, all you can do is try.

- Mmm, yeah.

283
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:36,467
And worth coming to
the sixth floor for, huh?

284
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:37,817
- I love this place.

285
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,644
Best calzones in Brooklyn.
- Oh, yeah.

286
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:42,604
- No, no, no,
Brooklyn is Classic Kyle's.

287
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:44,824
Midtown is Original Kyle's.

288
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,043
Famous Kyle's--
the only real Kyle's--

289
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,045
is Lower East Side.
- All right, thanks, Kyle.

290
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,568
- How hard is this?

291
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:53,484
- Hey, I just heard that
Kyle Vincenzi came back in.

292
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:55,138
How's he doing?
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,487
He's doing much better

294
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,839
since I pushed
broad-spectrum antibiotics...

295
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:03,494
to reverse your unindicated
and dangerous FMT.

296
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:05,670
- Oh, I think you'll see that
it was indicated,

297
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,150
just not by his MS.

298
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:09,326
His neuroimmune issues,
his weight issues,

299
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,632
his compulsive behaviors--

300
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:13,069
they all suggest
a maladaptive gut biome.

301
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:15,680
- Right, well,
Kyle is my patient now,

302
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:18,335
so I am gonna treat him
with traditional medicine.

303
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:19,641
- No, that's what
I've been doing.

304
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:22,513
- No, what you do
is alternative medicine.

305
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,689
What I do
is traditional medicine.

306
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:26,430
- No, what you do
is modern medicine.

307
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:29,520
- Okay, um, I wanna say
awful things to you right now--

308
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,218
I mean, like, way worse
than I've already said--

309
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:33,002
but I know
that it's not okay

310
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,961
to rip someone's head off
and jump down their throat

311
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:37,050
just because you disagree
on a diagnosis.

312
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,400
Unfortunately,
I haven't found a better way

313
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,923
to deal
with my negative emotion,

314
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,318
so I suggest you leave very,
very quickly.

315
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:46,537
- I like hot yoga

316
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,888

and leafy greens.

317
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,977
- Thank you.
- Feel better.

- Mr. Azad.
- I got nothing to say to you.

319
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:12,041
- Well, I just came
for a detail.

320
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:14,565
- You came to me for a detail?
- Yeah.

321
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:17,394
The, uh, gold package
with the hand wax

322
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:19,179

or you chrome it out?

324
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:26,186
- You know,
I'm not much of a car nut.

325
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,883
- With a car like this?

326
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,493
- Oh, yeah,
this belonged to my dad.

327
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:30,712

328
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,757
I don't have too
many memories of him,

00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:35,499
but him showing me
how to clean a car right--

330
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,588
that was one.

331
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,982
- Look, doc, I appreciate
the business,

332
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:43,551
but I'm still not coming in
for the surgery.

333
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:46,684
- Look, Mr. Azad,
the surgery's on the house.

334
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:51,385
No, in fact,

335
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:53,691

00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:52,924
or in a week, or in a year.

352
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:57,799
I hope it's soon, but, Helen,

353
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:00,758
you have a mountain to climb.

354
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,544
You're not climbing badly.

355
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,894
You're just climbing.

356
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:13,249
I've also seen a lot
of benefits

357
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:16,209
from bringing a partner
to the sessions.

358
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:19,299
This afternoon,
why don't you bring Max?

359
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,958
- So Reynolds came to me
with this egregious case

360
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,656
of overcharging,
and I looked into it.

361
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,527
It's everywhere.

362
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:32,007
Veronica
is overcharging patients

363
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,661
and then threatening them
with court

364
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:35,184
before their stitches
are even out.

365
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,926
Oren Azad wasn't an accident.
He's the plan.

366
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:39,841
- She'll claim she's doing
what every hospital does.

367
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,277
- Yeah, but how much?

368
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,975
Right now, Veronica's
an industry leader in greed.

369
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,369
- The board likes money.
They won't care if it's dirty.

370
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:48,371
- No, but the world will.

371
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,895
- You want to go public,
force the board's hand?

372
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:53,072
You tell the world
what you just told me,

373
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,335
and the hospital's reputation
will be in tatters.

374
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:57,337
We'll be synonymous with greed,
poor care,

375
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,729
and we may never recover.

376
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,123
So I need to be sure
you understand

377
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,082

New Amsterdam.

378
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,866

an apology would work.

417

- No, I didn't.
I said that it was worth a try,

it was a guarantee.

No, yeah--he's open

Hi. You don't know me,

530
00:25:14,469 --> 00:25:16,384
sister's husband,
and they told me that--

531
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,821
Wait, I'm desperate here.

standing where I am right now

538
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:32,705
and I'm asking you
doctor to doctor,

539
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,925
human to human,
to just drop everything

540
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,537

541
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,103
Please.

542
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:45,631
Yeah, yeah, sure,
if something opens up.

543
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:47,241
Okay.

544
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:09,480
- Okay, Kyle, I just want you
to take some deep breaths

545
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:13,354
and try to relax as the toxins
are leaving your body.

546
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:17,837
- You can't steal from me.

547
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,360
- I took a calzone.

548
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,797
- My patient.
It is unacceptable.

549
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:23,886
I'm upstairs trying
to figure out a diagnosis,

550
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,323
and you're down here laying
a tea party out on his back.

551
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:27,760
- It's called cupping.
- Yeah.

552
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,240
Well, what it is not
called is medicine.

553
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:31,633
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't

554
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:32,765
report you to the board.

555
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,114
- 'Cause I didn't
steal your patient.

556
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:35,768
He requested
to be transferred to me.

557
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,508
- Why would he do that?

558
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:39,206
- Because his doctors
keep trying to figure out

559
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:40,903
if he has this kind of MS
or that kind of infection,

560
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:42,644
and all he wants
is to feel better.

561
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:46,169
But I have some good news.
The tea party is working.

562
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:48,215
It's triggering
some muscle relaxation,

563
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:50,609
and he's actually feeling
really good right now.

564
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:55,135
- That is good news.

565
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:56,615
Sorry.
- It's okay.

566
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,921
It's not like you
ripped my head off

567
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:01,837
and spat down my throat
just because we disagreed.

568
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:03,317
- Wait.

569
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,667
Um...

570
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,802
I've had a really hard stretch.

571
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:11,455
And, uh...

572
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:14,633
the things that I used to
rely on to get me through...

573
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:18,201
Well, they're, um...

574

they're not so sustainable.

575
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:22,815
So I'm lashing out.

576
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,905
I guess I need a new crutch.

577

Not doing so hot
with the old ones.

578
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:31,737

579
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,782

I've embarrassed myself enough.

581

So I'm gonna let you tell me.

582
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:39,658
- It's leaning on something

583
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,703
instead of fixing
what's really wrong.

584

00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,927
- I think that
it's because deep down,

703
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,364
you still care a lot
for Isaac.

704
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:24,627
- Well, duh.
Of course I do.

705
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:28,370
- Why do you think
you hurt him then?

706
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:32,026
- I was really, really happy
when we got back together.

707
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,376
And I thought
everything was gonna be

708
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,727
the same as it was before.

709
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:40,034
But he was different with me.

710
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,644
He was distant,

711
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:47,346
and I knew it was only a matter
of time before I got dumped.

712
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:52,002
So I wanted to win

713
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:53,787
before I lost again.

714
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,137
- Hmm.

715
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:58,879
Wow, that must
have felt strange...

716
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:01,055
first time winning felt bad.

717
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,666
- It's my own fault.

718
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,799
- How so?

719
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:08,454
- I'm callous-unemotional.

720
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:12,458
I'm not supposed to be happy
with someone else.

721
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:15,374
I'm clinically predisposed
to be alone,

722
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:18,159
and these feelings prove it.

723
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:22,120
- Holy moly, did you ever
get this one wrong.

724
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,036
- You making fun of me?
- No.

725
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,301
Feeling like
you're doomed to be alone?

726
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,129
That you screwed things up
so badly

727
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,478
with the one person for you

728
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,480
that you're never
gonna be happy again?

729
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:36,395
These are big emotions
that everyone feels

730
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:38,353
when they get broken up with.

731
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:40,877
Juliet, these are
the most recognizable emotions

732
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:42,357
you've ever shared with me.

733
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:43,663
- Really?

734
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:45,708
- Yes, really.

735
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:51,105
But you know what I think
these tears mean?

736
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,238
I think they mean
you're getting better.

737
00:35:57,372 --> 00:36:01,202
- I move to immediately
dismiss Veronica Fuentes

738
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:02,899
as Medical Director
of New Amsterdam.

739
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:04,771
Can I get a second?

740
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,645
- Hi--
You started without me?

741
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,691
Hi, everybody.
- Veronica, welcome.

742
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:15,085
You are just in time to take
a vote on your termination.

743
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:17,697
- Mm, shame.

744
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,397
Well, I guess I could just
make it easier on everybody

745
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:25,400
and hand in my resignation.

746
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,402
- Wow, that would be great.

747
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:29,361
- But before I do that,

748
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:32,233
I would like to make
one final proposal.

749
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:35,845
I would like to acquire
Urgent Medicine Inc.

750
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:39,545
You see, there's this little
buyout option in the contract,

751
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:42,548
and call me crazy,
but Max's very weird

752
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:45,290
and rather ugly
grandstanding today

753
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:49,424
actually created
a beautiful opportunity for us.

754
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:54,124
But I want to be very clear--
this is not just a PR win.

755
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:57,389
This is a huge
financial gain for us

756
00:36:57,432 --> 00:37:00,218
because once we bring back
our former patients,

757
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,089
plus UMI's,

758
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:05,310
we will be netting
approximately--ooh, let's see,

759
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:10,228
hmm, maybe about
$3 million a month,
