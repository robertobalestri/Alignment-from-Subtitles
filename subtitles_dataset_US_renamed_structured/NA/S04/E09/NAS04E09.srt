00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,631
Get away from me!

177
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,372
Are you okay over here?

178
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,200
Don't touch me.

179
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,334
Should I get an orderly?
No, hold on.

180
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,293
I got this.

181
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:36,385
Okay. Let's start over, huh?

182
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:39,910
I'm Kai, he or they pronouns.
What's your name?

183
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:47,875
Does taking your binder off
make you feel unsafe, exposed?

184
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,443
I get that, I do.

185
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:54,838
But the thing is, between
the smoke and your binder,

186
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,579
your lungs are struggling,

187
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:59,800
which is why I have to
take the binder off.

188
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,323
Can we do that?

189
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,285
Okay.

190
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:19,602
My name is Temi.
My pronouns are he and him.

191
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,648
Its' nice to meet you, Temi.

192
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:34,051
♪

193
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,227
I got him.
Father, I'm Dr. Goodwin.

194
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,968
You want to come with me?

195
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,319
Are they all here
from the church?

196
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,017
Yeah, quite a few
of them, actually.

197
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,019
And they say religion's dying.

198
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:46,890
I need to know
that they're all okay.

199
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,152
They're in very good hands,
I promise you.

200
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:49,806
You got a pretty nasty
burn there.

201
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,200
You want to have a seat,
let me take a look?

202
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:56,160
Aah!

203
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:57,901
Grabbed the doorknob
like an idiot,

204
00:09:57,945 --> 00:09:59,686
try and get everyone out.
Mm.

205
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,693
Are there...
are the police here?

206
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,303
Are some of these folks
undocumented?

207
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:10,522
I'm not saying anything.
That's okay.

208
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:13,090
Just know that if they were,
all patients are safe

209
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:17,007
at New Amsterdam regardless
of immigration status.

210
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,271
They're all undocumented.

211
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,317
I prefer to think of them

212
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,364
as pilgrims on the road
to a better life.

213
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:29,672
Max, you gotta see this.
Uh, excuse me.

214
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,121
What the hell
is ICE doing here?

215
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:47,777
Waiting for us
to discharge our patients.

216
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:54,958
.

217
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,395
ICE has been circling
our church for weeks.

218
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,441
They've been coming by
at random times

219
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:01,617
waiting for someone
to be out of our protection.

220
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,054
They're coming home from work,
leaving to go to school.

221
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,665
Okay. Well, you're safe here.

222
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,971
They can't come into
the hospital, can they?

223
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:11,975
They could, but they won't.
We're a sensitive location too.

224
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,760
Yeah, but they're going
to be waiting out there.

225
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:15,805
Which is why we're not
discharging any patients

226
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:19,200
who came in from the church.
Spread the word--code 935.

227
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:21,202
On it.

228
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,773
You're gonna
let those things eat me?

229
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,383
You ready?

230
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:30,646
Hey, will I feel them?

231
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,387
You're on a lot
of pain medication

232
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,259
but they might tickle a little.

233
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:37,131
And we'll be right here
the whole time.

234
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:39,568
Yeah. Maggots have been
used in medicine

235
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:42,223
for thousands of years,
and they're the best way

236
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:44,965
to get all the dead tissue
off your legs.

237
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:48,316
And the best part is
they're picky eaters.

238
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,405
They only like the dead skin

239
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:53,713
so they leave all the nice
clean living tissue.

240
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,540
And after they're all done,

241
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:58,718
we'll be able to apply
new skin grafts to your legs.

242
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:01,546
Attention,
we are in code 935.

243
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,333
I repeat, the hospital
is now in code 935.

244
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,814
What's code 935?
ICE.

245
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,685
Immigration's here?
You're safe, Yakub.

246
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,384
Just relax,
focus on getting better.

247
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:22,132
I used to see the, uh,

248
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:24,047
ICE van
at the church every day

249
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:26,354
just sitting there waiting,

250
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:28,486
so scared they'll take me
and my sister

251
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,925
and put us in one
of those places...

252
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:34,405
those jails.

253
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:39,671
So I burned our papers.

254
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:46,417
Yakub...

255
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:47,941
did you start the fire?

256
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:53,424
I tried to stomp it out,

257
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:56,688
but it destroyed everything.

258
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:59,561
I destroyed everything.

259
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,566
I always mess things up...

260
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,918
For me,

261
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:10,877
my sister...

262
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:15,751
Everyone.

263
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:24,978
Okay, Rahel, hi.

264
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,894
So tell me about
these talks with God.

265
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:29,634
How long have
they been happening?

266
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:32,115
For as long as I can
remember.

267
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,553
Okay. So they started
before you came to America?

268
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:38,643
They happen more now.
Almost every day.

269
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,297
Almost every day.

270
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,952
What about your little brother?
Does he, um, talk with God?

271
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:46,651
Not unless God is on
WhatsApp, plays Minecraft.

272
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:51,178
Okay, so typical
little kid, check.

273
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,571
I know you think I'm crazy.

274
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:57,271
I'm not even sure if
Father O'Connell believes me,

275
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:58,707
even though everything
he preaches

276
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,841
is about talking with God...

277
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:05,192
even though the Bible is full
of people who talk with God.

278
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,584
Yeah. First of all,

279
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,804
I do not think you're crazy,
for the record.

280
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,546
And secondly,
we all talk to God, right?

281
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,288
Or some version of our
perception of God, anyway.

282
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:16,856
So no, I don't think
you're crazy.

283
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,687
What do the talks feel like?
Can you explain it?

284
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,908
Love.

285
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,910
It feels like love.

286
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,999
Love is good.

287
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:33,220
Okay. And it just happens
out of the blue?

288
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,178
I guess so.

289
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:38,878
I just light incense
and focus, and it happens.

290
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,881
Okay, simple enough.

291
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,666
You really don't think
I'm crazy?

292
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:47,930
I really do not think
you're crazy, okay?

293
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:51,891
You're no crazier than this guy
right here, or me, you know?

294
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,545
And that's saying something.
I don't think you're crazy.

295
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:55,895
I think you're a caring,

296
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,549
intuitive and spiritual
human being.

297
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,900
And lucky.

298
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:04,338
But I am going to need to
ask you for a few more tests.

299
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,209
You can trust me.

300
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,733
I don't trust anyone.

301
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:11,519
That's how me and my brother
made it this far.

302
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:14,435
Okay. I understand that.

303
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:18,569
But, Rahel,
if I'm gonna help you,

304
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,224
I'm gonna need you
to trust me.

305
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,922
Just a little.

306
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,665
I'll admit,
it's not the most welcoming,

307
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,059
but it will tell us
what to make of the discharge.

308
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,974
I can tell you
from personal experience

309
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:34,194
that getting a mammogram sucks.

310
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:38,459
It's like stepping back
into a body that isn't mine.

311
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:41,070
Does that sound familiar?

312
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:43,159
So for people like us,
trans men,

313
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:45,422
it's tempting
to ignore cancer screenings

314
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:49,252
and walk away from God-awful
machines like this one.

315
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:52,342
Yes, I know.

316
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,301
But you don't understand.

317
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,781
But we're willing to try.

318
00:15:56,825 --> 00:16:00,220
You said you're from Nigeria,
yes?

319
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,963
Did they hurt you there?

320
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:12,275
I don't need to tell you the
terrible things that happened.

321
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:14,886
I'm alive.

322
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,019
I'm here.

323
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,979
This body, which they tried
to destroy...

324
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:24,722
All I can do...

325
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:28,030
the best thing I can do
is to fill it with love.

326
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,816
This body my home.

327
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,036
And you want to
protect your home.

328
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:38,998
I can't put myself
in that machine.

329
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,610
Okay. It's all right.

330
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:45,134
It's okay.

331
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,180
Sorry. Okay.

332
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,966
Do you wanna get arrested
and go to jail?

333
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,315
Because if you don't
step aside--

334
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,751
Okay, he's not the one
you have to worry about--

335
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:54,883
All right. All right.
What is the issue?

336
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,276
They're trying to
make an arrest.

337
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,842
Okay. I'm Max Goodwin,
the medical director here.

338
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,366
I'm going to have to ask you
to turn around

339
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,802
and walk out of here

340
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:02,673
or I'm going to report you
for violating HIPAA laws.

341
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,110
Dr. Goodwin,
I'm sorry we have to meet

342
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:06,068
under these circumstances,
but I have a warrant here

343
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,678
for the arrest
of Salvador Perez,

344
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,115
and I have a judge
issuing warrants

345
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:11,030
for every undocumented
that you're harboring.

346
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,989
This is a warrant for missing
an immigration hearing.

347
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,425
I don't make the laws,
Dr. Goodwin,

348
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,861
I just enforce them.

349
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:17,993
He probably missed
the hearing

350
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,994
because you were staking
out his church

351
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,691
and he was terrified to leave.

352
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,345
Do you really want
to walk into this hospital

353
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,043
and start arresting people?

354
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,219
We respected the church
as a sanctuary,

355
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,438
but this doesn't look
like a church to me.

356
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,005
So you can either
help us do our job

357
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
or you can get out of the way.

358
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,144
All right, everybody,
quickly inside.

359
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:40,537
Let's move some of these tables
and make some room.

360
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,887
Hi there, so sorry about this.
Do you mind if I, uh...

361
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,499
There you go.
Enjoying the pasta?

362
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,892
Max, we appreciate
what you're doing,

363
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,025
but I don't see
how hiding in a cafeteria

364
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,635
is going to protect anyone.

365
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,202
You're absolutely right.
Do you have your rosary on you?

366
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:55,074
Of course.

367
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,817
If ICE can come into
our hospital but not a church,

368
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:02,472
well, we'll have to make do.

369
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,474
With your blessing, Father,

370
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:07,608
welcome to your new sanctuary.

371
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,538
.

372
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,279
Come to make a confession?

373
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,063
I bet you've got
quite a few sins

374
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,413
you'd like to
get off your chest.

375
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:33,634
I can't believe
that I have to say this,

376
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:36,854
but you cannot hide a bunch
of undocumented immigrants

377
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:38,378
in our cafeteria.

378
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:40,249
Well, they're not just
undocumented immigrants,

379
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:42,208
Mrs. Trahn right there,

380
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:45,167
she was a nanny
for Manhattan families

381
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:46,821
for about three decades.

382
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:49,302
And that's Daniel there--
he crossed the border

383
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:50,825
pretty much by himself
to find his mother.

384
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:53,349
And the little boy
he's playing with is Nelson,

385
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,873
one of the brightest boys
you'll ever meet.

386
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:59,007
And he's just waiting
for the day to go to school.

387
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,357
Please don't try to appeal
to my sense of humanity, Max.

388
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:03,664
No? Okay. How about this.
They're our patients,

389
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,492
and it's going to be
pretty hard to treat them

390
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:08,495
when they're being
dragged away in vans.

391
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:14,196
And, uh,
where will they sleep?

392
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,592
Hmm? Where will they go
to the bathroom, Max?

393
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:22,030
ICE is here legally executing
warrants set by a judge,

394
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,988
and I highly doubt
they're going to just drop them

395
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:26,817
because you decided
to hide them in a hospital.

396
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:29,342
And again, for the record,

397
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:32,780
we are a hospital
and not a refugee center, Max.

398
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:35,217
You really think ICE
is going to give them

399
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,263
the medical care they need?
You know what?

400
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,743
I'm willing to let
the government do their job

401
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:42,093
and to let
this hospital do ours.

402
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:45,662
So Church Amsterdam is over.

403
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:50,711
I cannot believe
that you put up with this

404
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:53,496
for three years.

405
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:01,765
I can't do it.

406
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,811
I can't send that boy
to a detention center.

407
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,206
Neither can I.

408
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,035
Maybe neither of us
has what it takes

409
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,602
to make the hard decisions.

410
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:15,692
Maybe we can still
make the right ones.

411
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,956
There's a board meeting
tonight.

412
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,262
I'll call for a vote

413
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:23,483
to terminate
Dr. Fuentes' contract.

414
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:25,136
Really?

415
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,270
Do you have the votes
to pull that off?

416
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:30,185
Not yet.

417
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:34,102
But I'll find them.

418
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:36,278
Carol Brantley.

419
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,498
Didn't know
you had it in ya.

420
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:46,375
So, Temi,
this is a transducer table.

421
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:49,204
You'll lie face-down
with your chest in the water,

422
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,294
and the ultrasound signals
will show us what's going on.

423
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:55,297
No compression, no pain.

424
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:59,170
It's not perfect, but it is
the best that we can offer.

425
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:01,651
I do hope you'll trust us.

426
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,753
Thank you.

427
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:31,420
♪

428
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,163
Is the water warm enough?

429
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,034
Yes.

430
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:38,775
Are you okay?

431
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:43,824
I'm seeing a spiculated,
hypoechoic density

432
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,260
with angular borders

433
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,045
in the lateral field
just there.

434
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,918
Yep, I see it.

435
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,528
I'd say it's removable, yes?

436
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:55,444
Yes. From the looks of it.

437
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:05,541
Temi, we have found a tumor
on your right side,

438
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,543
hence the bleeding.

439
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,284
We will need to operate,

440
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,939
but a lumpectomy
will leave minimal scarring.

441
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,161
Take them off, both of them.

442
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,294
Can you do that?

443
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:23,559
A-a double mastectomy?

444
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:31,611
So a full mastectomy
leaves a flat chest

445
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:35,136
that kind of dips in, concave.

446
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,660
That's different
than top surgery

447
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,923
which creates muscle contour.

448
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:45,320
This might be my only
chance.

449
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,061
Please.

450
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:52,327
Okay, Rahel.

451
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:56,113
So we, um, looked at your
scans, and it turns out

452
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:59,726
that your visions are actually
temporal lobe seizures.

453
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:01,597
People call them
Dostoevsky seizures

454
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,469
because we think that
that's what he had,

455
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:05,645
the, um, the writer.

456
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:07,864
I'm having seizures?

457
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:09,431
So you know the incense
that you light

458
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:10,954
as part of your ritual?

459
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:15,002
That incense, oddly enough,
is was is bringing them on.

460
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:17,352
The smoke is reducing
the amount of oxygen

461
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,136
to your brain and--

462
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,442
Wait, no.

463
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,923
No, you might see
a seizure on the scan,

464
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:25,795
but I know how I feel--
I know I'm talking to God.

465
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,058
That's the thing about
these Dostoevsky seizures.

466
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:30,974
They can feel...inspiring.

467
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:34,804
They can feel blissful,
like you're in another world.

468
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:37,981
But left untreated,
they can cause brain damage.

469
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:41,245
The good news is that
they are very treatable

470
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,551
and I just so happen

471
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:44,292
to have a medication
you can start today.

472
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:47,991
I don't want that.
I help people.

473
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:51,908
Back home, I stopped my aunt's
migraines and people at church,

474
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:53,519
they come to me.

475
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:56,870
I can carry their suffering.
Why would you take that away?

476
00:23:56,913 --> 00:24:00,482
Okay. Yes, you would
stop having

477
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:03,790
this very profound
spiritual experience.

478
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:07,707
But again, if we don't treat
your epilepsy,

479
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,970
your seizures
will go from temporal lobe

480
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:11,928
to full tonic-clonic.

481
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:14,322
And I know you feel like you
can control them right now.

482
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:17,194
But eventually, believe me,
they will control you.

483
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:19,458
But what about Yakub?

484
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,503
He still needs me.

485
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:22,852
Yes, he does.

486
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,419
Yakub will need you
when he gets better.

487
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,855
That is absolutely correct.

488
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,075
But if you don't manage
your epilepsy,

489
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:31,034
you won't be the sister
that he knows.

490
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:34,603
I know what it's like
to lose a sibling,

491
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:37,432
and I'm not going to
let that happen to Yakub.

492
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:42,306
All right. Let's go ahead
and remove the epinephrine pads

493
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,830
and see what we got.

494
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:45,396
Bleeding's controlled.
Right on.

495
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,312
Let's go ahead
and apply some skin.

496
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:53,013
All right. Set me up with
a 2-0 chromic on an SH.

497
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:56,233
You prefer that over
the PS3 needles?

498
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:57,408
It's a little bit more work,

499
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:59,236
but it's less traumatic
on the skin,

500
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,239
and this boy
doesn't need any more trauma.

501
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:04,764
When I came here,
I couldn't shake the fear

502
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:07,462
that I would lose
everything any minute.

503
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:12,032
When you feel like that, you do
whatever you can to survive.

504
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:14,948
You even put out fires
with your bare hands and feet.

505
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:18,429
You okay?

506
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:21,258
I am now.

507
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:23,260
I'm one of the lucky ones.

508
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:28,701
Heart rate's 120,
BP's 160/80 and rising,

509
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:30,920
and his throat's swelling
around the ET tube.

510
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:32,966
He's got cervical
compartment syndrome.

511
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,055
If we don't relieve
the pressure around his neck,

512
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:37,057
he'll suffocate.
All right, ChloraPrep.

513
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,102
Give me a scalpel
and retractors.

514
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:42,584
Let's prep
for cervical faciotomy.

515
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:48,982
You paged?

516
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:50,549
We've got a problem
with Church Amsterdam.

517
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,812
More ICE again?
Definitely not ICE.

518
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:59,601
Where did they all come from?
They're from New Amsterdam.

519
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:01,168
When we called code 935,

520
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,605
every undocumented patient
in the hospital

521
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:05,172
was diverted here by staff.

522
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:06,869
And now...
They're afraid to leave.

523
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:09,306
Well, wouldn't you be
with ICE circling the building?

524
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,613
But this is--
Completely unsustainable.

525
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,397
I mean, they can't stay here,

526
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:15,182
and we can't just
kick them out.

527
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,879
What are we gonna do?

528
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,278
.

529
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,981
Where are you taking me, Max?
What do you think?

530
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:35,811
It's perfect.

531
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:37,857
For what, exactly?

532
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,642
Your new sanctuary.
With all the new parishioners,

533
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:43,514
you're gonna need a lot more
space, and we can spruce it up.

534
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:45,560
Max, I don't think--
I know it's not ideal,

535
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,649
but I bet that's exactly
what your church thought

536
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:48,998
when it first opened its doors,

537
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,871
what every church
or temple or mosque thinks

538
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:53,655
when they open their doors.

539
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:56,658
This isn't why we built
these places of worship

540
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,051
and yet it's exactly why,

541
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,922
to shelter people
from the storm,

542
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:01,968
to harbor those who have
nowhere else to go,

543
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,230
who have left
their homes behind.

544
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:05,145
And if churches
can be sanctuaries,

545
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:07,060
then why not hospitals?

546
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:09,236
We've got medical care,
food, shelter,

547
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,065
we've got a school right here.

548
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:15,242
Why not us?

549
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:18,637
What about the people
who have jobs

550
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,031
and families
waiting for them across town?

551
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:25,905
Look, they don't need
another place to hide.

552
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:27,602
They need a home.

553
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:32,607
One that they're not afraid
to leave or come back to.

554
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,785
A-a real sanctuary,
it provides safety,

555
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:38,918
protection.

556
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:42,835
A real sanctuary...

557
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:44,663
it's a sacred space.

558
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:49,842
You're not built
to provide that.

559
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,845
And don't blame yourself
for not providing it either.

560
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,324
All right?

561
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:03,290
Firing Dr. Fuentes?

562
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,292
How many of us
are on board with this plan?

563
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:06,728
You're the first
one I've talked to.

564
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:08,164
Well, to protect myself,

565
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,949
I'd prefer to be
the last one you talk to.

566
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:12,081
I understand.
Do you?

567
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,649
What will this look like?
We just hired her.

568
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,130
I'm more concerned what it
will look like if we keep her.

569
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:18,958
I was wondering when
you would come around.

570
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,437
I'm in.

571
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,744
You're one of many now,
I can assure you.

572
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:23,919
But do we have enough?

573
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:25,312
I'm working on it.

574
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:26,574
Have you talked to
Evan Nashton?

575
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:28,054
Not yet.

576
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,316
Get his vote,
and you'll have mine.

577
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,492
I didn't know Evan
carried so much sway.

578
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:34,103
Quite the opposite.
He's the weakest link.

579
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:37,193
If you can convince him,
the rest will follow.

580
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:39,021
Including me.

581
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:44,113
Almost half the board is in,
but I need your vote,

582
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:45,854
the strongest vote,
so the rest will follow.

583
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:48,814
So you've chosen to court me
in the stairwell.

584
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:51,773
So are you in or out?

585
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:54,733
Veronica's done some good
things for this place--

586
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:55,908
fattened our bottom line,

587
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,518
and I heard about
the pasta bar.

588
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:59,825
Now a combination pasta bar
immigration camp.

589
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:01,609
Exactly!

590
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:04,438
You can't blame Veronica
for trying to restore order.

591
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:07,354
We hired her to clean up
this mess that Max has made--

592
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:10,357
keeps making.
But at what cost?

593
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,359
These people came here
for our help, to heal.

594
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:13,795
And if Veronica has her way,

595
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,015
we'll end up putting them
in detention camps.

596
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:18,408
There's no easy answer,
Karen.

597
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:20,759
No, but there's a human one.

598
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,718
Evan, we both joined the board
because we knew in our hearts

599
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,548
New Amsterdam was special,
this place has a soul.

600
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:29,376
It makes me a better person
every day.

601
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:32,031
Hell, it even made you
a better one.

602
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:33,815
If we don't take action now,

603
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,687
that soul will be gone,
maybe forever.

604
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:39,560
I'm asking for your vote.

605
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:46,088
All right. You're the boss.
You have my support.

606
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:49,439
Thank you.

607
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,097
That should be
the last of the tumor.

608
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:58,100
Scalpel.

609
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:03,627
Going to extend
the surgical field laterally.

610
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:09,677
Lynn, the margins
aren't clear.

611
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:12,723
We couldn't see it
on the ultrasound,

612
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,595
but the tumor has invaded
the chest wall.

613
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:17,250
The mastectomy
won't be enough.

614
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:25,954
Dr. Frome!

615
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,782
Rahel, what happened?

616
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,653
I can't take the medicine
you gave me.

617
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:30,785
Why not?

618
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,439
My brother,
he's still in surgery!

619
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:34,310
Yeah, I heard.
And he's in good hands.

620
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:36,443
He's supposed to be out
by now.

621
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:39,881
But I need to help him.
I need God to help him.

622
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:45,408
Okay... I understand
that you want to help him.

623
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:47,062
But I'm not going
to let you give yourself

624
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,281
a seizure to do it.

625
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:49,891
That would be unethical
and dangerous.

626
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,110
My brother needs me.

627
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:52,285
And he's getting
the best medical care.

628
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:54,896
And it's not working.

629
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,899
I've protected my brother
his whole life,

630
00:30:57,943 --> 00:31:01,816
but only with God's help.
My prayers are not nothing.

631
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,863
My prayers are--
they're all I have.

632
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,475
If you could have saved
your own brother,

633
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,999
wouldn't you have tried
everything...

634
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:13,697
everything you could?

635
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,531
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

636
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:24,491
Um, objectively speaking?
No, this is a terrible idea.

637
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:26,362
I can't make her take
the medication,

638
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,277
so all I can do is be here
for her if I need to be.

639
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:31,280
"By the rivers of Babylon,

Okay, we're in the clear.
If we're lucky,

671
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:49,184
we won't see any.
Thank you.

00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:51,708
Mind holding this?

673
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:54,015
BP's holding.
Trace it up.

Chechi?

675
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:04,808
You're here!

676
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:08,856
Is this where you go?

677
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:11,032
Is God here?

678
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:13,513
You're going to be okay.

679
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:18,344
Why aren't you mad at me?

680
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:21,869
I ruined everything we had
with that fire.

681
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:26,787
Thought I was protecting us,
but I destroyed our home.

682
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:31,313
You should just let me go now,
Chechi.

683
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:35,274
You'll be free now.

684
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:38,146
Yakub, you didn't destroy
our home.

685
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,366

Wow, that's amazing.

689
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,203
So all the swelling
is from the burns

690
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:53,031
and not from some infection?

691
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:54,989

00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:19,753
Ventilator's down
to 5 of Peep.

698
00:34:19,796 --> 00:34:21,668
Airway constriction is easing.

699
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:25,150
Compartment syndrome
is letting up.

700
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:27,674
That was fast.

701
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:30,546
Someone was looking out
for this kid today.

702
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,421
She's seizing.
It's tonic-clonic.

703
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:37,597
Help me get her on her side.
We should get her to the ED.

704
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,556
No, we can't.
ICE are waiting there.

705
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,992
Right, okay, okay.

706
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:47,041
.

707
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,869
Dr. Hyet, pediatrics.

708
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:50,784
Dr. Hyet, pediatrics.

709
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:55,963
It's strange to see myself
like this, but good.

710
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:59,097
Ha. I feel good.

711
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:06,756
Temi, you need to know
that your cancer has spread,

712
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,368
and we couldn't remove
all of it.

713
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:15,287
So...do you mean--

714
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,332
You do have
treatment options.

715
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,900
After you've healed, you'll
need to come in every day

716
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:22,468
for chemo
and radiation for six weeks.

717
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:26,341
Six weeks. So I can stay here
in the hospital?

718
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:28,865
I'm afraid they're dissolving
the sanctuary

719
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:31,868
and everyone
from the church has to...

720
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:34,175
has to leave.

721
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:38,875
I just found out, I'm so sorry.

722
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,964
And go where?

723
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:44,272
I don't know.

724
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:46,405
But our medical director
is trying.

725
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:50,409
Trying.

726
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:59,374
Even if you can protect me
from ICE today,

727
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:02,072
I'll be risking ICE every time
I come in for treatment.

728
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:03,465
It's a risk, yes.

729
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,598
But not treating your cancer
will kill you.

730
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:10,951
Being deported will kill me.

731
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:14,563
Going to detention
will kill me.

732
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:18,524
Every option
is a death sentence.

733
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:31,493
Meds are working but recovery
is going to take some time.

734
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:33,321
She's going to need
to be admitted,

735
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:36,106
which, and I can't believe
I'm actually saying this,

736
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,370
is a good thing.

737
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:41,416
Because then
ICE can't touch her.

738
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,636
I never should have
let things go this far.

739
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,246
You and me both.

740
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,206
This girl's faith
is something else though.

741
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,251
It's like a fortress.

742
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,427
Even when she was fading
in and out,

743
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:55,256
at one point she came to
and she looked right at me,

744
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,737
and she said,
"Let me go and you'll be free."

745
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,175
I don't think she was
talking about herself.

746
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,135
She was connected
to something larger.

747
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:09,227
Maybe she was onto something.

748
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,580
You okay?
I might be.

749
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:17,278
We all might be.

750
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:23,589
Send all available ambulances
to the west exit.

751
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:26,374
