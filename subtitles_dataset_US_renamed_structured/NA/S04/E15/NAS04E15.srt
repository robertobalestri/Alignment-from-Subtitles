- Oh, busy?
There's nobody here.

184
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,525
- Not enough docs.

185

- Well, that's perfect,
actually,

186
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:08,575
'cause I'm here
for a job interview.

187

Love you.

One of my favorites.

Has your pain level
decreased at all?

Still a pressure always there.

for consistency, right?

202

Ooh.

203
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:58,146

late-stage osteosarcoma

into upping your dosage

I plan on going in
with a chevron incision

254
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:05,882

The tumor is not confined
to the pancreas.

If you start cutting,

259
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,630
you're gonna be compelled
to keep cutting.

260
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,588
You'll take out the stomach

my dad's laptop,

287

and I see that on his browser,

288
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:33,578
he has this video about
how 9/11 was an inside job.

I mean, I thought
it was "The Onion,"

He knew it was real.

320
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:51,831
He's still in there.

Help me get my dad back,

What?

You got me, okay?
You're very astute.

334
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:29,607

Sixth floor

00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:21,572
- Mr. Twickham, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

356
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:23,661
- Oh, role-playing? Kinky.
I like it.

357
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,315
So where were we?

358
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,709
Oh, right,
the gazebo was a-rocking,

359
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,929
so don't come a-knocking.

360
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,497
- Wrong number!

361
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,934
- Hello? Hello?

362
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:40,983
Broken.

363
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,988
- Welcome.

364
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,990
- Hey, you got a minute
for a consult?

365
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,644
- Yeah, always.

366
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:52,864
- So I have a patient
who is losing his battle

367
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:55,911
with late-stage bone cancer.

368
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,174
His only wish is to live
long enough

369
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:00,002
to attend
his daughter's wedding.

370
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:02,439
It's only three months away,
but I don't think

371
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,572
he's going to make it
that long.

372
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,182
- That's heartbreaking.

373
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:10,447
- Well, I was hoping that you
might have a way to--

374
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:13,102
you know, with--

375
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:19,195
to extend his life
with the means and methods

376
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:25,245
that maybe are outside of
the realms of scientific study.

377
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:29,379
- You've come
to the right place.

378
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:33,731
I was just putting together
this elixir.

379
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:36,082
It's from the springs
of the Loxahatchee River

380
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,258
where, in 1513,

381
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:41,565
Ponce de León searched
for the Fountain of Youth.

382
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:42,653
- Oh.

383
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:45,439
- Wait, seriously?

384
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:46,788
- Of course not.

385
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:50,052
This is Dijon vinaigrette
for my arugula salad.

386
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:51,967
I am a medical practitioner.

387
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,360
I don't make magic potions.

388
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:55,231
I'm a healer. I'm like you.

389
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:56,928
I can't just wave a magic wand

390
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:58,974
and heal your patient,

391
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,628
even though I wish I could.

392
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:04,110
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

393
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,504
- Enjoy your salad.

394
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:15,860
- I have heard what Drew
has to say about that day.

395
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:17,645
But what about you, Robert?

396
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,606
- You think
it's gonna help him?

397
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,478
- I do.

398
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:26,349
- Drew and I don't see
eye to eye on Nick's Grocery,

399
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:29,265
and I don't wanna
keep upsetting him.

400
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:32,442
- That day was hard
for everyone, okay?

401
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,097
But I think what Drew
needs to hear

402
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:39,145
is what it was like
for you in your words.

403
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:42,104
- I was at work.

404
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:45,716
My wife called
and said she saw

405
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,980
Drew's store on the news.

406
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,592
Brought Drew home.

407
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:55,335
- Okay, well, what was that
like, getting that call?

408
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:58,512
- Bad news, your heart drops,
you know?

409
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:00,035
I could hear panic
in her voice,

410
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,993
but she was talking so fast.

411
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:05,562
It took me a sec to get what
she was seeing on the news,

412
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,042
but when I did...

413
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,656
When I did...

414
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,791
I did, like, 90
out of that parking lot.

415
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:21,448
I had this image of you...

416
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:24,712
shot,

417
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:29,151
dying, wanting me with you
when you went...

418
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:32,459
and not being with you.

419
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:37,594
But then I come
around the corner...

420
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:40,075
and there you are.

421
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,425
My boy.

422
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,297
Alive.

423
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:52,000
- You both experienced
a trauma that day.

424
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,654
It's not the fear

425
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:57,179
or the pain that casts
a shadow over your life.

426
00:18:57,223 --> 00:19:01,314
It's the,
"Why did this happen? Why?"

427
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:06,319
You ask God,
you ask the universe, and...

428
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:10,714
you don't get
an answer, ever.

429
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:12,151
And that is so hard.

430
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:15,893
And in that void, we turn
to whatever we can find.

431
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:20,071
We turn to anything that looks
like it might tell us why,

432
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,465
no matter
how far-fetched it may be.

433
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:27,644
But some things
can't be explained.

434
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:30,212
Sometimes "why"

435
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,258
doesn't have an answer.

436
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,089
- Hmm.
You're right.

437
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,265
You're right.

438
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,399
All I wanna know is,
how did they get to my son

439
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:44,574
and get him
to say those things?

440
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,663
- Jesus!
- If you would just let me,

441
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,230
I could show you
how it was all rigged--

442
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:50,276
- I was there, Dad! You saw me!

443
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,581
Why the hell
would I make that up?

444
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,366
- I'm not saying you're lying.

445
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,019
- Maybe we can just--
we can take a step back here.

446
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:57,326
- I can't believe I thought
this would actually work.

447
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:00,503
- Drew, hang on.

448
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:08,598
- Where's Teyarnie Jordan?

449
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,470
- Dr. Fuentes had her
transferred up to the OR,

450
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:13,081
like, 20 minutes ago.

451
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,960
- What in God's name
do you think you're doing?

452
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:25,441
- This middle school teacher
needs our help

453
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,443
to get back to work.

454
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:29,489
- This surgery
was not approved.

455
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:33,493
- Yet we're starting
with a chevron incision.

456
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:34,798
Scalpel.

457
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,539
- As chief of medicine,
I will make certain

458
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,585
that anyone doing procedures
behind my back

459
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:41,631
will never find work in
another health-care facility.

460
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,067
- Noted.

461
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,721
Now, get out of my OR.

462
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:49,683
Scalpel.

463
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:58,648
Need a little more light
on the field, please.

464
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,129
- Why wasn't I notified
of my own patient's surgery?

465
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,654
- Need I remind you of our
last exchange, Dr. Reynolds?

466
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,526
Retractor.

467
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,180
You refused to run labs
and order scans

468
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:10,486
that I deemed relevant.

469
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,835
You tried to push through
a surgical procedure

470
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,924
before it was even clear
that surgery

471
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,274
was the best course of action.

472
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,710
Lap pad.

473
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:19,800
So I ran those labs myself,
and I really didn't feel

474
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:22,324
compelled to include you
in that decision.

475
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:23,630
But if you're gonna
stick around,

476
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,719
I suggest you
make yourself useful.

477
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,939
Scrub in.

478
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:32,639
♪

479
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,209
- It's called
Urgent Medicine Incorporated.

480
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:41,212
And I know, it sounds like
a front for the Serbian mob,

481
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:42,649
and honestly, it might be,

482
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,215
but we're gonna turn
this place around, okay?

483
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,870
And this job is gonna
be way more hours

484
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:47,915
with a lot less money.

485
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:51,092
- How do you think your pitch
is going so far?

486
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,094
- What you're trying to do
sounds amazing, Max.

487
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,878
- Right? And that's why
I'd love to have you on board.

488
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:57,228
- I would love to,
but my hands are full.

489
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,753
My patient load is crazy
now that I'm no longer a chair.

490
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,626
- So you expect
the former chair of surgery

491
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,193
at the largest public hospital
in the country to join you

492
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:08,022
working part-time at some
rinky-dink walk-in clinic?

493
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,546
- Well, no, Claude,
I never said, "Rinky-dink."

494
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,679
Gladys, please.
- It's just a case

495
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,115
of supply and demand.
- Uh-huh.

496
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:15,899
- You know, there's
a nationwide nursing shortage.

497
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:18,598
And my level of skills
is in very high demand.

498
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:21,296
- Well, I can see that.
- I can even make my own hours.

499
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,385
- That's great! Then you can
totally fit Urgent Medicine

500
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:24,778
right into your schedule.

501
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:27,694
- Oh, Max,
you couldn't afford me.

502
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,480
- Sandra Fall, me and you

503
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:33,482
back together again
like Thelma and Louise!

504
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:34,788
- They drove off a cliff.
- Oh, yeah.

505
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:36,006
What about--excuse me--
Butch and Sundance?

506
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,704
- Died in a hail of bullets
in Bolivia.

507
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:40,141
- Oh. Well, how about
peanut butter and--

508
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:41,403
- Tall mocha latte for Tanya!

509
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:45,668
Max, for over a year, I've been
trying not to work for you,

510
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:46,713
and I've finally succeeded.

511
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:49,629
- But--
- My answer is no.

512
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,108
- No.

513
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,110
- No.

514
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:54,373
- No.

515
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,331
- Hell no.

516
00:22:57,637 --> 00:23:00,204
- How can you say that?

517
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:01,467
How can everybody say that?

518
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,685
We're talking
about New Amsterdam.

519
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,992
There's no place
in the world like it.

520
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:06,950
How can nobody
wanna fight for it?

521
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:10,345
- 'Cause we all lost our jobs
'cause of you, Max.

522
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,607
And now you want us
covering your six

523
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,609
like you're some kind
of Joan of Arc?

524
00:23:13,653 --> 00:23:16,351
Listen, I'm sorry, Max,
all right,

525
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,613
but you're just
gonna leave again.

526
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,049
You're gonna leave
New Amsterdam in the hands

527
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:20,616
