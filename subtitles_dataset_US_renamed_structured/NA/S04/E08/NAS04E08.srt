1
00:00:05,744 --> 00:00:06,093
.

2
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:08,530
She's coming for us.
Why does it feel so personal?

3
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:10,445
Because it is.

4
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:12,142
Do you guys know that
Veronica is forcing me

5
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:13,187
to see patients again?

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,666
Seriously?
Yes.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,277
And she knows that
you were threatened

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,713
and attacked
by a patient, right?

9
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:20,063
Yeah, made that pretty
abundantly clear and yet--

10
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:21,195
You know, she's been
pitting me against

11
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:22,587
Baptiste playing us
off each other.

12
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:24,763
A real "there can
only be one" vibe.

13
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:27,723
Well, she's extorting me.

14
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,377
Wait?
I'm sorry, what?

15
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,553
For--for actual money?

16
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:34,643
Donations for the hospital's
endowment fund.

17
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:36,471
She expects you to fund
this whole hospital?

18
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:38,386
That's ludicrous.
What is she thinking?

19
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:39,778
I don't know.

20
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:41,432
Maybe she heard my family
has money or something.

21
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,782
God.

22
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:45,697
You--you guys know
what's happening, right?

23
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,177
She's trying to push us out.

24
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:48,526
Mm-hmm,
she sees us as a threat.

25
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,093
We're Max's people.
Yeah.

26
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:52,530
Yeah, well, in two weeks
Max is jumping ship

27
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:55,098
leaving
the rest of us here to sink.

28
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,708
Whoa, whoa, hold up, no,
back that up.

29
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:58,710
That's not happening.
We've known Max

30
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:01,148
for three years.
Has he ever let you down?

31
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:04,281
Not me, all right?
He is going to handle Veronica.

32
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:06,196
And I'll bet you money
right now

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,458
he is ten steps ahead of her.

34
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:12,246
Oh, God, I--I am so behind.
You think?

35
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:15,162
I mean, here I am
with multiple graduate degrees,

36
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:16,511
and I'm struggling to pack

37
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:18,556
a container full
of other bloody containers.

38
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,341
Luna's grandparents
are never allowed to buy her

39
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,647
another stuffed animal again.

40
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,607
"We've got acres of time
to pack," he said.

41
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,609
"We'll start packing tomorrow,"
he said.

42
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,873
Yeah, well, what happened
to all that highly organized

43
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,570
Bristol fashion
I kept hearing about?

44
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,137
It booked passage
on the "Titanic"

45
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:35,617
the minute I fell in with you.

46
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,663
What do you say
we just burn it all down?

47
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:41,449
Wait? Even the Tupperware?
Especially the Tupperware.

48
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,585
We're really leaving,
aren't we?

49
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:49,239
Yeah.
I feel like

50
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:52,155
I'm abandoning our hospital
after all it gave me.

51
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,765
Don't you feel pangs of guilt?

52
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:55,593
Yeah, I did,
but then I packed it up

53
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,769
with the rest
of the bathroom stuff.

54
00:01:57,813 --> 00:02:02,774
We're not abandoning anybody.
We're just choosing ourselves.

55
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:04,298
That's okay.

56
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:06,474
Yeah.
It's gonna be okay.

57
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:08,911
Say it with me.

58
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,434
It's gonna be okay.

59
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:15,613
Yeah, but say it again
like you actually believe it.

60
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:16,788
both: It's gonna be okay.

61
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:18,486
Yeah, you can
do better than that.

62
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,705
both: It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

63
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:22,403
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

64
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:24,709
It's gonna be okay.

65
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,330
This is not okay.

66
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:38,941
I think you're actually
allergic to a balanced budget.

67
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,291
That's not balanced.
That's upside down

68
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:43,685
and you're gonna leave
this place unrecognizable.

69
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:46,296
Do you know what else
is unrecognizable?

70
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,517
This hospital's operating
expenses during COVID.

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,216
There wasn't enough room on
the form for a number that big.

72
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,741
So desperate times,
desperate measures.

73
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:59,614
You are calling
for the firing of three dozen

74
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,268
of this hospital's top doctors,

75
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:05,315
Dr. Reynolds, Dr. Bloom, Dr.
Frome, Hartman, Flores--

76
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,275
Laying them off, yes.

77
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,843
Those top doctors have
departments that are top-heavy.

78
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:14,759
Look at the numbers, Max.

79
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,588
This isn't personal. It's math.

80
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,895
Yeah, well,
here's some math for you.

81
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,592
You need two signatures
for this,

82
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:23,464
and you're never getting mine.
If I don't co-sign

83
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:25,944
this piece of garbage,
then it is dead on arrival.

84
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:28,512
Who's got the leverage now?
If you'll excuse me,

85
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,993
I've got some very important
emails to attend to.

86
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:34,736
Hey, here's one on compassion
and empathy in the workplace.

87
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:39,480
Maybe I'll just forward
that one to you.

88
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,222
I'll let you know
when I get it.

89
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,623
I understand, Dr. Sharpe,

90
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,366
I just wish
it was gonna be you.

91
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,715
Oh, so do I, Gillian,

92
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,458
but believe me,
I'm leaving you in good hands.

93
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:02,807
Is now a good time?

94
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,722
Speaking of,
I would like to introduce you

95
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:07,551
to the wonderfully talented
Dr. Agnes Kao.

96
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:10,424
She's the acting interim chair
of our neurology department.

97
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:13,688
Actually, I've been the full
chair for quite some time now.

98
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:16,517
Really?
For several months, yeah.

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,954
Ms. Sorel, it's a pleasure
to meet you

100
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,390
and equally important,

101
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:23,698
you have to talk to me
about this cool bag.

102
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,569
It's my daughter
Trini's favorite.

103
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:28,529
And in true fourth-grade
fashion, she forgot it at home.

104
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:32,489
So after today's treatment,
I'll be running it over.

105
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:35,057
Yes, we should talk
about today's treatment.

106
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:39,888
I know your expressions
at this point, Dr. Sharpe.

107
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:43,370
Just say it.

108
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:46,329
Your lymphoma didn't respond

109
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,723
to the last
round of chemo as we hoped.

110
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,511
But there is a new option
available for central nervous

111
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,818
system lymphomas like yours.

112
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,776
Instead of the normal
chemo infusion,

113
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,430
we would like to inject
high-dose

114
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:03,390
methotrexate directly
into your cerebrospinal fluid.

115
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,653
It requires we bore
a small hole in your skull

116
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:06,958
just to access the area.

117
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:10,005
Hang on, guys;
you want to inject chemo

118
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:13,095
directly into my brain
through a hole in my skull?

119
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:16,620
Despite how it sounds,
it's an outpatient procedure.

120
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,405
Very safe.

121
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:21,103
With Dr. Kao and I,
you are in great hands.

122
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,540
You'll be dropping off
that amazing bag to Trini

123
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:26,021
in no time at all, okay?

124
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:32,332
Okay.

125
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:37,685
I am so sorry, Agnes,

126
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,948
I had no idea that
you'd been made full chair.

127
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,863
It's fine.
No, it's not.

128
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:43,473
It's unconscionable.

129
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,388
You've been so focused
on your big move to London.

130
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,608
No reason to keep tabs
on the rest of us.

131
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:50,001
Agnes, you have received
a position of power

132
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:52,569
at one of the top medical
institutions in the country.

133
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:53,831
As a woman of color,

134
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,660
do you realize
the rarefied air you are in?

135
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,749
I'm guessing pretty rarefied.

136
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:01,404
Yes, It's stratospheric.

137
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:02,797
And it's happening
right at a time

138
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,147
when Veronica is taking over.
There's no way

139
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,063
I can leave you to face life
under her regime unequipped.

140
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:11,153
I definitely don't want
to be unequipped.

141
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:14,417
Look, starting from today
and for the rest of the time

142
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:15,723
I'm here, we are gonna meet,

143
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,028
and I'm gonna tell you
everything I know.

144
00:06:17,072 --> 00:06:18,639
I'm gonna help you strategize,

145
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,162
I'm gonna tell you
where the bodies are buried.

146
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:21,468
Like a mentor?

147
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:25,428
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly like a mentor.

148
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,778
We are gonna get you
battle-ready.

149
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,568
Okay, great.
So until next week, all right?

150
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,528
Thank you.
Tough session?

151
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,051
Oh, my God.
I should not be in there.

152
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:43,185
That's not true.
Yes, it is, Gladys.

153
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:48,233
I--I used to at least know
what to say, you know.

154
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:50,061
I used to be able to help
a patient contextualize

155
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:51,889
a breakthrough or navigate them
through the weeds.

156
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,935
Now it's, like, nothing.

157
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:55,545
I'm like a question mark
in there.

158
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,504
You're still getting
your sea legs back.

159
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,680
No, I'm not.

160
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:01,551
You know, when therapy is going
well it feels like music.

161
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,771
It's like,
I can--I can hear music

162
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:05,686
in my heart and in my mind like
there's a rhythm.

163
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:06,904
It's a dance.
I know when to push.

164
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:08,471
I know when to listen.

165
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:11,692
I know how to help.
Now I'm just...

166
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:16,044
I--I don't hear it.
I'm not hearing a single note.

167
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:18,916
Oh, Iggy.

168
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,702
All right,
I'm just--I need some air.

169
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:22,746
I'll be back.

170
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:44,289
Veronica stopped me again.

171
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,727
Said she found a way to

172
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,512
"take some pressure
off my department."

173
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:51,122
Well, she all but begged me
to sell your ass

174
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,908
down the river.

175
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:54,996
Divide and conquer.

176
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,782
Mm-hmm,
till the best man wins.

177
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,088
I don't want to have to
fight you

178
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:04,135
to keep this job, Floyd,

179
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:07,835
but I'm not gonna lay down.

180
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,712
Who says we have to
play her game?

181
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,847
What are you up to?

182
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,284
I don't know.

183
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:24,982
If you ask me,

184
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:28,159
the woman don't know
who she messing with.

185
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,250
All right, folks,
today we will be performing

186
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:34,252
a robotic-assisted
coronary artery

187
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:38,213
bypass graft
using this baby right here.

188
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:41,825
Now, three-dimensional images
of the heart

189
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,566
will be displayed
on these monitors.

190
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,786
I'll be running point
operating the arm over here,

191
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,919
and watching my back today
and every day is

192
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:53,620
our very own chair of surgery,
Dr. Claude Baptiste.

193
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:57,275
Let's dance.

194
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:03,934
Chester Larkin, returning.
I'll take it over there.

195
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:06,110
Chester, hey,
thanks for calling us back.

196
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:07,677
Yeah, I got a voice mail

197
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:11,855
saying I had to get
my pacemaker interrogated.

198
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,683
It's not a good cop,
bad cop kind of thing.

199
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,902
Just a simple procedure.

200
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:17,034
Oh, well,
that's good to hear,

201
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:19,254
but the only thing is,
I can't have a surgery today.

202
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:20,560
I'm on a shift.

203
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,126
Oh, well, we don't even
need you to come in.

204
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,216
We run the diagnostics remotely
through your cardiac pacer

205
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,305
just to make sure
it's doing its job.

206
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:28,698
Does it hurt?

207
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:31,048
You ready to find out?
I guess so.

208
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:36,184
All right, so open the app
on your phone.

209
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:42,669
Okay, now what?

210
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:47,412
And it has started.
Easy peasy.

211
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:50,154
I got to be the only bionic
handsome cabdriver

212
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:51,895
in all of New York.

213
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:55,812
Wonders of the internet,
right?

214
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:00,774
Schedule is still not done?

215
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:04,125
My system was set up for four
residents, and now we got five.

216
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:07,650
Just takes longer.

217
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:10,305
Who knew I'd
ever need long division again?

218
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:12,786
Well, wrap it up, Einstein;
we need you out there.

219
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,265
My point exactly.

220
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:17,268
We're so short on nurses,
but we have extra residents.

221
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:19,183
It's weird.
Don't you think it's weird?

222
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:20,315
You know what, Casey?

223
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,099
Who cares
how many residents we have?

224
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,275
Four? Five?
I mean, they're all talented.

225
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:27,017
Would it kill you
to do a little math? God.

226
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,117
Okay, Gladys, I am back.

227
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:42,642
I had a moment there.
I apologize.

228
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:46,167
And what the heck
are you doing to that mouse?

229
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:51,694
All our patient files
are missing.

230
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,043
That's impossible.

231
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,479
No, I looked everywhere.
They're just gone.

232
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,786
Okay, did you click
on the little house?

233
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,309
The little house is gone.

234
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,877
The little house
can't be gone.

235
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,059
Oh. What the hell?

236
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:14,151
So there's no room
for negotiation?

237
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:17,154
Always be extremely firm
in your position with Veronica.

238
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:20,810
Never back down, or she'll
steamroll right over you.

239
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,511
Hang on. That can't be right.

240
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,035
What's the matter?

241
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:30,167
The chemo reservoir.
It's empty.

242
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,996
But isn't all dosing
networked through the pharmacy?

243
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,476
Yeah, they're supposed
to control

244
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,826
everything that gets delivered
down to the microgram.

245
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,437
Wait, but if the
reservoir's empty--

246
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,439
They just pushed five times

247
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:45,008
the chemo directly
into Gillian's brain.

248
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,531
But that would be fatal.

249
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:48,185
Agnes, our patient is
gonna code within ten minutes.

250
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:49,926
We need to get to the ED now.

251
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:03,723
Dissecting the LAD.

252
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:09,859
Isolating a graft
insertion site.

253
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,514
The margin on the left is
looking a little narrow, Floyd.

254
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:15,473
I'd inch over a bit
to accommodate.

255
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:19,086
Thank you very much.

256
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,392
I mean, I would move over
just a touch.

257
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:24,047
I'm trying to.

258
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:26,441
Is there lag time
in the command?

259
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:30,140
No.
Hmm.

260
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,403
Floyd,
wh--what are you doing?

261
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:34,449
It's not me.

262
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,324
Floyd, Floyd, BP's dropping.

263
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,196
Stop the robotic surgery
before more damage is done.

264
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:45,286
It's not responding.

265
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,853
Doctor, we're not
controlling the arm.

266
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:49,159
What?

267
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,118
Then who the hell is?

268
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:01,389
.

269
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:03,739
The hack's a work of a group
known to us as Disco Bunny.

270
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,219
Doesn't sound very scary.

271
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,655
Disco Bunny is a former GRU

272
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:09,353
cyber cell
who have attacked 253 hospitals

273
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:11,138
and healthcare clinics
around the world.

274
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:12,400
Maybe a little scary.

275
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,358
Yeah, they're ruthless,
cruel, greedy,

276
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,578
and when you opened that email,
Dr. Goodwin,

277
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,059
you gave them the keys
to your kingdom.

278
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:20,234
What are our options?

279
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:21,670
Limited I'm afraid.

280
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,454
The Treasury
Department's Office of Foreign

281
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,761
Assets Control is quite clear.
Those who pay a cyber-ransom

282
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,589
may face civil
and criminal penalties.

283
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,243
What? Are you serious?

284
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,071
Yes, it only encourages
further attacks, and this year

285
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,376
has already seen
an increased targeting

286
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,856
of hospital
and healthcare providers.

287
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,554
So what are we
supposed to do?

288
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:38,687
Well,
our cybersecurity experts

289
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,254
can help restore
New Amsterdam's

290
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:42,822
compromised network
department by department.

291
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,476
What's the timeline on that?

292
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,652
Weeks...to months.
Months?

293
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:50,394
Listen, we're not a tech
company or some oil pipeline.

294
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:53,397
We're a hospital with patients
who depend on us every day.

295
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,574
We have to pay that ransom.

296
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:59,708
Well, in situations like this
you can request a certification

297
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,579
of OFAC compliance
to avoid the penalties.

298
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,320
Great, that's what
we're gonna do.

299
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:06,410
Uh, uh, no, hang on.
This is a public hospital.

300
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,804
We do not have $10 million
just lying around.

301
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,588
Yeah, but HCC does.

302
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,721
The fact that I am here
right now is living proof

303
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,331
they do not
trust you with money.

304
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:18,770
They are not giving you
a dime, Max, and you know it.

305
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:22,296
But HCC might give it to me.

306
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,649
Of course,
we have to prove to them

307
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:31,609
that we are serious about
our fiscal responsibility.

308
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:34,917
Sign the budget, Max.

309
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:37,615
Get them out of our network.

310
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,401
We're gonna weather the storm.

311
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:42,925
Lauren, you need to put the ED
on diversion now.

312
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,448
Why? What's going on?
This might sound

313
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,015
like something out of
a James Bond movie,

314
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,409
but a Russian-backed cyber cell
has hacked the hospital

315
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:51,455
and are currently worming their
way through every department.

316
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:52,935
Holy hell.

317
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,328
Yeah.

318
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:56,199
Walsh, order
a Special Services Diversion.

319
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:57,548
Ship 'em all to Baptiste.

320
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,246
You got it.
Turan, treat and transfer.

321
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,769
This is really happening?

322
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,423
Yeah, the FBI is here,
and every minute that goes by

323
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,903
these hackers gain more
control,

324
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,556
and every piece of equipment
networked to our system

325
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,601
could be compromised.

326
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:08,342
Chester.
Who?

327
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:10,257
Chester Larkin.
I was running an interrogation

328
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,738
on his cardiac pacer.
Can you give him a call?

329
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:20,397
Computer is jacked.
They're locking us out.

330
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:23,618
Walsh, try yours.

331
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,663
That's not good.
He's not answering, Lauren.

332
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,535
You've gotta find him.
In all of Manhattan? How?

333
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,406
He's a horse carriage driver
in Central Park.

334
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,365
Go.

335
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,892
No patient files.
No SOAP notes.

336
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,851
No session schedules.
I mean, Iggy,

337
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:42,680
all of our patients'
prescriptions, they vanished.

338
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,595
Hi, yeah, this is Dr. Frome
from Behavioral Health.

339
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,771
We're having a bit of an
IT problem that--

340
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:48,208
yeah, yes, I'll hold.

341
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,993
We have a floor full
of inpatients with no record

342
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,821
of what they take
or when they're taking it.

343
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,736
We don't even know
when they got their last dose.

344
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,172
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

345
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:57,782
What does a rabbit have to do
with extortion-ware?

346
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:03,875
Oh, my God.

347
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,703
Maybe I can just...

348
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:07,009
No, no, no, no, no, don't,

349
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,011
Gladys.
Okay, and there's the rabbit.

350
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:11,361
Okay, we've been hacked.

351
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,276
The entire hospital
has been compromised.

352
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,495
For how long?

353
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:15,975
I don't know.
She said weeks maybe.

354
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,934
Iggy, how are we gonna figure
out what medications

355
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,544
our psych patients need

356
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,764
before they all start
going through withdrawal?

357
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:28,291
I...I don't know.

358
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,424
Thorax filled with blood.

359
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:32,426
Where's it coming from?

360
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,867
I found Chester.

361
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,522
He's tachycardic.
BP 185 or 115.

362
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:43,785
Chester, can you hear me?

363
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:45,265
What's happening to me?

364
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:47,006
Your pacemaker defibrillator
is misfiring.

365
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,834
It's shocking your heart.
Why? Why?

366
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,401
It's been triggering every
few seconds the whole way here.

367
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,663
Okay, let's get him
to Trauma One. Let's go.

368
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:55,666
Incoming.
Chemo overdose.

369
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,798
Okay, find me a donut magnet.

370
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,017
Copy.
What the hell?

371
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,409
Cranial infusion
chemotherapy.

372
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:00,889
She got a massive dose
of methotrexate.

373
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,499
Fever, tachypneic.

374
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:04,066
I mean, it must have been
a truckload of chemotherapy.

375
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,459
Turan, let's set 'em up
in the procedure room.

376
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,591
Let's go.
Got it. Come on.

377
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:08,853
What's her mental state?
Altered.

378
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:10,464
Her blood pressure
was down 80 over 40.

379
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:11,595
The chemo
is flooding her brain.

380
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:12,640
It's destroying her cells.

381
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,076
We need to start
leucovorin now.

382
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,773
We can't; her blood pressure
is way too low.

383
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,427
Well, then we need to fix it.

384
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,995
Okay, come on; we got you.

385
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,913
I'm gonna lower the bed.

386
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,877
Hooking up your IV.

387
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:38,883
♪

388
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:40,494
Come on, Gillian.

389
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:44,063
My daughter.
Come on.

390
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,716
BP's up to 100 over 60.

391
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,501
Good.
Now we can start leucovorin.

392
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,068
Hang in there, Gillian.

393
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,419
Shut it down.

394
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:56,031
Yes, I'm serious.
Transfer the ICU to Uni now.

395
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,337
We're falling apart here.

396
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,686
Yeah, I just came from ortho.

397
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:00,383
Their whole department
is in chaos.

398
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:01,863
We gotta do something.

399
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:03,430
Well, we are doing something.

400
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:04,996
We're listening to
the FBI's guidance.

401
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,390
Do not pay, and do not
embolden the criminals.

402
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:09,479
We can't weather this, okay?
I was wrong.

403
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,829
Someone is gonna get hurt.

404
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:14,832
Do you want me to use
my back channels

405
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:18,619
to pressure HCC
to find the money?

406
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:22,144
Would you do that?

407
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:23,972
Max, this is a political job.

408
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:26,540
If I'm cashing in
a chip that big,

409
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,064
I'm gonna need
something in return.

410
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,545
Your signature.

411
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,423
These are good people,
the ones you'd be firing.

412
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,991
We are both trying
to save this hospital.

413
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:47,865
You might not see it right now,
but we're on the same team.

414
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:01,052
.

415
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:04,012
Okay, 5 mils morning,
10 mils night.

416
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:05,883
You are a lifesaver.
Thank you very much.

417
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,015
Yeah, talk soon.

418
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:08,451
Okay, so I was able
to reach out

419
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:09,974
to ten of our patient's
previous doctors

420
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:11,715
and confirm our regimen.

421
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,108
11 of our patients
had family members

422
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,718
who were able
to reconstruct their doses.

423
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,503
Nice.
Okay, and nine of our patients

424
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:18,809
are currently on drug washout,
so they don't take any meds.

425
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:22,030
So what do we do
about the last five?

426
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,077
Purple circles.

427
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:30,865
No, used to be circles,
now triangles.

428
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:32,214
Sodium Valproate.

429
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:34,825
80 milligrams of Prozac
every day since 1991.

430
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,436
Thank you; that's great.
Why do you think

431
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,002
I'm so damn peppy
all the damn time?

432
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,787
Oh, gosh,
there's so many of them.

433
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,571
It takes like two glasses
of water to swallow 'em all.

434
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,226
Of course, I can't remember
what they're called now.

435
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,010
So sorry,
I'm totally ruining your day.

436
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,448
No, no, no, you're not.
It's okay.

437
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:52,191
They're for anxiety.

438
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,932
Aripiprafy, two pills.

439
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,108
I usually get
my midday dose about now.

440
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,981
That's great, Angelo.
Thank you so much.

441
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:02,940
No clue what you give me,
but I used to feel like...

442
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:07,031
wacka-wacka-wacka-wacka,
chh-chh-chh-chh-chh,

443
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:09,947
And now I feel like...

444
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,559
shhooo.

445
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:16,824
Okay, thank you.

446
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,783
Hey, you okay?
How can I help?

447
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:22,656
Oh, hey, I've got
a question for you.

448
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,223
Have you ever called
a dozen parents to see

449
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,050
if they might know
their kids' medications?

450
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:27,574
Sorry about all this.

451
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,793
FYI, blaming all of this
on Russian cyber pirates

452
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,839
really just raises
more questions than answers.

453
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:32,970
Yeah.
This is--

454
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,015
this is horrible, Max.

455
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,016
There's gotta be
a better solution.

456
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,191
Well, there is a solution,

457
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,584
but the cure
is worse than the disease.

458
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:39,977
What--whatever it is,
pull the trigger.

459
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:43,590
If you knew what it was,
you wouldn't be saying that.

460
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:49,160
If it helps the patients,
do it, all right?

461
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:50,901
Suction.
LAP PAD.

462
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,903
He's gonna flatline
if we don't find that bleeder.

463
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:54,514
What if it's not down,
it's up?

464
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:55,993
What do you mean?
We've been searching

465
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:59,301
the bottom of the
surgical field, not the top.

466
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:02,173
There, internal mammary
artery along the chest wall.

467
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,828
Aw, yeah, good eye,
but damn tricky location.

468
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:06,177
Can you reach it?

469
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:07,178
Yeah, just need you
to retract the heart.

470
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:08,310
I got you, brother.

471
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:11,531
Clamp.
Suture.

472
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:12,532
Okay.
Got it?

473
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,185
Yeah.
Okay, hold.

474
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,623
Okay.
Uh-huh.

475
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,799
Another.

476
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:20,322
Get in there.

477
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,063
That looks good.
Looks good.

478
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:24,195
Come on.
You got it. You got it.

479
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,980
Come on. Come on. Hold

480
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:26,981
You got it. You got it.

481
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:29,200
Ohh, let's go.

482
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,899
There you go. Nice job.

483
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:32,943
Thanks.

484
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,560
I know, buddy, I know, okay?
Hang in there.

485
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,562
We're gonna try and suspend
these shocks, okay?

486
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,912
Your ICD
has a magnet-sensitive switch.

487
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:49,220
This should reset it.

488
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:50,700
Yeah?

489
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,094
Maybe.

490
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:56,097
Maybe not.
Try another angle.

491
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,185
Okay.

492
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:59,666
Come on.
Come on.

493
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,191
Please make it stop.

494
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:05,846
Lauren, I don't understand.
This should have worked.

495
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:08,327
They're in the network.

496
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,372
Okay, push 100 milligrams
of Atenolol.

497
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,722
We're going with plan B.

498
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,942
What the hell is plan B?

499
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,205
I'm gonna have to take that
pacemaker out of his chest.

500
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:22,863
What's happening?
What happened?

501
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,168
I don't know.

502
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:25,909
His pulse is racing;
his tongue's swollen.

503
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,868
I need an EpiPen now.
He's anaphylactic. All right.

504
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,696
He's so warm.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

505
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,262
Thank you.
Okay, stay with me, Angelo.

506
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:35,745
Stay with me, buddy.
Stay with me. Breath.

507
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,704
There he is.
There you are. There you are.

508
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:40,097
Hey, hey, look at me.
Look at me.

509
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:43,100
You're okay. You're okay.
Take a deep breath.

510
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:45,755
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

511
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,368
Okay.

512
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,891
It just happened so fast.

513
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:55,635
Yeah, because we gave him
the wrong meds.

514
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,903
Hey, you got a sec?
Oh, Max, please tell me

515
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,383
there's a plan to solve this.
I've got patients--

516
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,080
Veronica's using
the hack against me.

517
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:07,516
What do you mean?

518
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,735
In order to get the money
to save this hospital

519
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:12,739
I had to sign this budget.

520
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:15,872
People we know and love
are about to be hurt.

521
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:22,139
Fired.

522
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:23,924
Max, this is bad.

523
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:27,710
Yeah.
Wa--was there any other way?

524
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:33,890
No, I mean, unless you got
$10 million lying around.

525
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,239
I keep telling myself

526
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:36,937
that we're not abandoning
our friends,

527
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,070
that we're not turning our
backs on this hospital, but...

528
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,165
I don't know what to do.

529
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,298
The only thing you can do.

530
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:54,171
You have to tell them yourself

531
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:59,002
before they find out
from someone else.

532
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:02,179
Max, look at me.

533
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:10,971
♪

534
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:14,017
It's gonna be okay.

535
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:16,193
Say it.

536
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,108
It's gonna be okay.

537
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:20,763
It's gonna be okay.

538
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:22,722

It's gonna be okay.

539
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:25,072

542

Hey, is he stable?
He's stable.

543
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:44,657
This is my fault.

544
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,356
The other patients we asked
described pill shapes, colors,

545
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,618
feelings that they had.

546
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:52,665
Angelo specifically
asked for Aripiprafy,

547
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:55,145
specifically for two pills.

548
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:57,626
He knew he was allergic?

549
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,455
Why--why would he want to
hurt himself?

550
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,153
Good question.
Talk to him and find out.

551
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,379
What happened?
She's bleeding from her gums.

552
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:12,598
BP's down, heart rate's up.

553
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,164
She's going into
hemorrhagic shock.

554
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:17,994
I've already hung
2 units of blood.

555
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,561
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

556
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:22,216
We are not giving up
on you, Gillian.

557
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:26,568
Look at me. Don't go there.
Reverse your thinking, okay?

558
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,135
You still have to drop off

559
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:31,138
that cool backpack
with your daughter, right?

560
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:32,313
Trini.

561
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:35,055
Right,
don't give up, not yet.

562
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:38,232
For Trini.

563
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:40,234
Reverse your thinking.

564
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:42,279
We somehow need
to reverse the chemo.

565
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:44,238
What does that mean?

566
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:48,677
It is a--it's a intravenous
dose of Uridine Triacetate.

567
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:50,418
Has it ever been done before?

568
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,159
I've only read case
reports of it ever working,

569
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:55,162
but I don't see
a better way, do you?

570
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:56,642
Almost got it.

571
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:05,172
Oh, got it.

572
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:10,090
Oh, his heart's crapping out.

573
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:12,440
No pulse. Run a pacing wire.

574
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:14,442
Wait. Isn't it connected
to the same network?

575
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:19,621
Oh, damn it. Move, move.

576
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,188
At least we know
this way works.

577
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,406
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

578
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,104
Come on, you can't keep
that up forever.

579
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:25,453
Eight, nine, ten...

580
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:26,933
I'm--I'm gonna
get Lucas in here.

581
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:30,197
No, we don't need Lucas.
Casey, I don't want Lucas.

582
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,026
Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

583
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:36,029
Come on, Chester, come on,
come on, stay with me.

584
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:37,639
Lucas coming in hot.
Five, six, seven.

585
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:42,035
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

586
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:45,604
Actually,
it wasn't a bad idea.

587
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,128
Chester, meet Lucas.
Lucas, meet Chester.

588
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,608
What's the longest
you've ever used him?

589
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,306
I'm pretty sure
it's gonna be today.

590
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,350
Two, three...

591
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:56,310
So I'm guessing you knew

592
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:59,052
you were highly allergic
to Aripiprafy.

593
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:04,057
All right.

594
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,278
Why don't you
tell me why you're here

595
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:10,759
in New Amsterdam
and just start there?

596
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:23,337
Okay.

597
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:27,210
Angelo, I am going
to shoot you straight.

598
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:30,213
It's that kind of day.

599
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:32,563
The way you treat
a suicide attempt varies

600
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,131
based on the patient's
medical history.

601
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:38,482
And today we--

602
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:43,096
we lost every shred of data
we have on you,

603
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:45,359
and you clearly
don't want to talk,

604
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:47,840
and I would rather
let you not talk,

605
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:49,537
but it would be
criminally irresponsible

606
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,670
and negligent of me
to not get your basic info.

607
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,063
So why don't you give me
the quickest, shortest version

608
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:56,500
of why you're here, and I
will get out of your hair?

609
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,677
Why?

610
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:02,724
So we can help you.

611
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:09,078
I'm here because I had
an Adderall overdose.

612
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:15,128
I--I went days without sleep,
brought on a psychosis,

613
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:17,783
now I have brain damage.

614
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:24,572
My brain works at 1/2
the speed it used to.

615
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,443
I used to be smart,
and now I'm dumb.

616
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:29,664
Can you help with that?

617
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,144
Not with the
processing speed, no.

618
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:33,276
That--that will
probably never come back.

619
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,539
Not probably; it's gone.

620
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,541
Yeah.

621
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:41,458
You don't know
what it's like to...

622
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:44,592
to...

623
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:54,123
Christ, I can't even
find words anymore.

624
00:28:55,821 --> 00:29:00,651
It's like I'm...

625
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:01,740
Like you're not you.

626
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,788
Yeah.

627
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:08,616
I mean, you know,

628
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:10,792
everyone sees the same you
on the outside,

629
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:15,362
but...

630
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:19,279
on the inside it's, like,
that's different.

631
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:20,584
Something is missing.

632
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:21,803
But no,
it's worse than missing.

633
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,805
It's--it's gone.

634
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:26,808
You don't recognize yourself.

635
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:32,466
I look in the mirror,
and it's my face,

636
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:34,294
but I'm not in there.

637
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:37,688
Even the positive feelings
feel like foreign.

638
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,953
Like they're someone else's.

639
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:44,391
I don't feel happy the way
I feel happy.

640
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:47,350
I don't feel sad
the way I feel sad.

641
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:51,659
Everything's wrong,
and I'm just--

642
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:53,704
Less.

643
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:59,275
You feel like you're less.

644
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:03,671
You know, the old version
of you is gone.

645
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:06,892
That's true.

646
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:09,416
It's okay to mourn him.

647
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:13,420
He deserves it.

648
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:17,946
But I am not talking to him.

649
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,255
I'm talking to you right now.

this new you packing

652

because you're not
who you wish you were.

653
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:34,789
You can't even make that choice
until you find out

654

who you are now.

655
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:43,929
So what do you think?

656
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:46,540
You want to find out together?

Hey, I got your page.
Tell me it's good news.

682
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:05,053
I asked HCC
for the $10 million ransom,

683
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:06,489
and they are considering it.

684
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:08,927
No, no. Considering it?

685
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,972
What can I say?
It's out of my hands.

686
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:12,669
No, no. We had a deal, okay?

687
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:16,456
You promised if I played ball
you would take care of this.

688
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:17,936
No.
I did what you wanted,

689

and you promise me that
you would take care of this.

690
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,724
I said that I would ask them,

691
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:27,423
and that is exactly what I did.

692
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,991
But there is
some good news here.

693
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:32,776
HCC is very appreciative
of the balanced budget

that we both signed.

695
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:38,478
Couldn't have done it
without you, Max.

696
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:49,924
.

697
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,578
Floyd, his heart needs
a spark

698
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:53,101
or this man is gonna die.

699
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:55,234
What about thermal cautery?
Great for a vasectomy.

700
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:57,279
Yeah, but the Bovie is the
only thing that has electricity

701
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:58,541
that's
not connected to the network.

702
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:01,327
Yeah, but it has
to be grounded.

703
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,806
Wait, wait, but isn't it A.C.?

704
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,243
Damn it.

705
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,419
Unless,
change it to unipolar.

706
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:10,597
Cautery.

707
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,728
You got it?

708
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:14,601
Almost.

709
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:15,776
Come on.

710
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,734
Here we go.
All right.

711
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:21,390
All right.
Here we go.

712
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,697
It's just like starting
a car battery.

713
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,395
Clear.

714
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:29,442
Firing.

715
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:31,400
Come on. Come on.

716
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:37,841
Come on.
Come on.

717
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:43,804
We got a heartbeat.

718
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:47,286
Wow. That's a new one.

719
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:49,201
All right,
let get him stabilized.

720
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:51,942
Suture.

721
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:56,860
You were right, you know.

722
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:58,471
About what?

723
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,517
Fuentes.

724
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:03,389
She doesn't know
who she's messing with.

725
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:14,008
I never would've thought
to reverse the chemo.

726
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,445
That was incredible.

727
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,797
Well, I--I have many,
many tricks to share,

728
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:24,410
you know,
as your unofficial mentor.

729
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:28,240
Yeah, about that,

730
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:32,853
I can't tell you
how honored I am.

731
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,290
But?

732
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:36,770
But I've been thinking
about it all day,

733
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:39,512
and it would be so comfortable,

734
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:43,603
so familiar, like my little
talks with Dr. Kapoor.

735
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:47,041
Then he left, and it completely
knocked me off my game,

736
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,697
and you'll be leaving too.

737
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:55,223
So maybe I need to learn how
to embrace the uncomfortable.

738
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,312
I'm the chair of neurology now,
and I need to figure out

739
00:34:57,356 --> 00:35:01,490
how to be that,
and I need to do it on my own.

740
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:10,282
Come here.

741
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:15,896
I guess maybe
I should be listening to you.

742
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,594
Thank you.
Okay.

743
00:35:22,032 --> 00:35:23,077
Hey.

744
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,385
Hey, how did
it go with Angelo?

745
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:27,951
Good. You know, I think
we've been really focusing

746
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,649
on the drugs and the PTSD,
but there's

747
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:31,738
a whole identity layer
there that we can dig into.

748
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:34,088
So I'm thinking art therapy,
drama obviously,

749
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,698
maybe help him
try on some new guises,

750
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:37,700
expand his sense
of himself, and--

751
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:40,355
Wait. Do you hear that?

752
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,052
No, do I hear what?

753
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:43,967
Sounds like somebody
found their music.

754
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:52,411
You.

755
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:11,604
Well, Lucas may not
exactly be subtle,

756
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:14,607
but he gets the job done.

757
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,608
Schedule's done.

758
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:17,000
Hey, let's hear it

759
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,046
for the power of
your third-grade long division.

760
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:20,917
A banner day.

761
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:24,443
How does your girlfriend
have a residency slot here?

762
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:27,968
A fifth slot that
we never had before?

763
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:32,320
I wrote her a letter
of recommendation.

764
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:38,457
That's all, and I don't
actually appreciate--

765
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,808
Please don't lie to me.
I'm not.

766
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:45,115
Fine, whatever.

767
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:49,772
Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien
to Admitting.

768
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:52,688
Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien
to Admitting.

769
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,652
I made a donation, okay?

770
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:01,001
To the Dean's
discretion refund.

771
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:03,177
There's nothing
illegal about it.

772
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,831
It was all completely
above board.

773
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:08,051
Which is why you've been
hiding it from everyone?

774
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:12,708
Does Leyla know?

775
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:21,064
No, but she doesn't need to.
Unbelievable.

776
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:22,849
Leyla is the best resident
we've ever had here.

777
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,938
I mean, why should it
even matter how she got here?

778
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:27,680
Because it matters.
Casey.

779
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,116
It's immoral.

780
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,510
It is self-serving,
and you have completely

781
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:35,688
undermined everything that
she's earned for herself.

782
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,516
You're right.
You're right, okay?

783
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,172
Okay, but you get why
I had to do it. I had to.

784
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:46,568
Please, please don't--
please don't say anything.

785
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,970
You know,
when the staff finds out,

786
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:59,059
and they will find out,

787
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:02,541
you're gonna lose
all their respect.

788
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:06,240
Hell, you already lost mine.

789
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,722
Casey.

790
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,121
Great, now what?

791
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,961
Ah, the wire transfer just
went through,

792
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:34,921
and we got a certification
of a compliance from OFAC.

793
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:37,010
No fines?
No, and no penalties.

794
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:39,969
Disco Bunny may look like
a deranged Russian Fraggle,

795
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:45,497
but those bastards kept their
word, and we are back online.

796
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,282
Most people would consider
this a win, Max.

797
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,240
You know,
for years I've been asking HCC

798
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:53,200
for money to improve things,

799
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:55,942
to make things better
for our patients,

800
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:58,858
for so many things, and now
we finally get that money,

801
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:01,774
and we have to hand it over
to hackers

802
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:05,691
who are leveraging human life.

803
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:09,564
Well, Agent Maldonado
seems to believe

804
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:13,046
that they can recover
some of the funds.

805
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:16,484
That's great. What about us?
What do we recover?

806
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,229
I know how difficult it was
for you to sign that budget.

807
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,100
No, you don't.

808
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:29,584
These people are not
your friends, Max.

809
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:33,719
They're your employees,
and today sacrifices

810
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,503
were made for the greater good.

811
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:39,812
Believe it or not,

812
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,857
you did what
was best for this hospital.

813
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:56,002
You wanted to see us?

814
00:39:56,045 --> 00:40:00,180
I--I had to make
a tough decision today.

815
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:01,877
I got backed into a corner,

816
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:04,097
and I had
to let some people go...

817
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,804
People who make this hospital
everything that it is.

818
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:24,726
And you were all in that list.

819
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:37,609
But I found another way.

820
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:49,751
♪

821
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:14,776
♪

822
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:41,760
What?

823
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:45,807
Is this some kind of joke?

824
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:48,462
I wish it was.

825
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,900
How many?
How many were laid off?

826
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:53,206
148.

827
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:54,990
Oh, my God.

828
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:15,968
Today I protected you
from Veronica.

829
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:19,362
But I can't protect you
tomorrow.
