00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:08,269
You want Dr. Shinwari
in your ED.

4
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:09,705
Are you talking
about a bribe?

5
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:11,315
I could lose
my medical license.

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,708
I could go to jail!

7
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:14,666
I gave Chance everything.

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,320
I just want him to get better.

9
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:18,235
You know,
all I've tried to do

10
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,716
is create a place
where people can heal.

11
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,413
I think I've been
successful with that.

12
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:26,200
I have never replaced
a successful medical director.

13
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:28,158
As you know,

14
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:30,030
I've been seeing someone.

15
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:33,685
Ah.

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:45,567
♪

17
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,701
So we're adults.

18
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,747
The fact that we can
come together like this

19
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:56,534
is a testament to that.

20
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:58,797
Claude and I have talked,

21
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:03,715
and this thing has happened,

22
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,197
and we agree the only way
to move forward

23
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:13,160
is to face
this situation head-on.

24
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:16,424
I'll admit,

25
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:21,124
I was a bit thrown

26
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:23,779
when I learned
you were sleeping with my wife.

27
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:28,392
But I--I've processed.

28
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:34,398
And I believe that
we can push through this

29
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:37,662
if we have no more secrets.

30
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:42,232
No more secrets.

31
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:45,409
The weird thing is,

32
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:47,585
I get what she sees in you.

33
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,719
You know, not--
not like that way, but,

34
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:52,242
you know?
Yeah, I do. I do.

35
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:57,552
Of course, and I feel
the same way about you, Claude.

36
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:00,337
But it's--

37
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:03,949
it's complicated.

38
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:08,693
I--I'm sorry we didn't--

39
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,739
we weren't more clear
when we were setting

40
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,654
our relationship ground rules.

41
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:14,177
We agreed that
we didn't want to know

42
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:16,179
who the other person
was seeing, but

43
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:19,530
we--we didn't really
lock down the part about, um,

44
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:23,186
getting involved...

45
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,234
with colleagues.

46
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:34,545
You want to say
something, Floyd?

47
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,856
No.

48
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:45,469
Well, I actually, uh, I just

49
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:46,992
hope that we can maintain

50
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:51,649
this level of honesty, uh,

51
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:55,610
and harmony.

52
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,398
Harmony.

53
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:05,837
Yes.

54
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:09,319
Harmony's a good word.

55
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,670
Excuse me, I'm so sorry,

56
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:14,324
but there's only
one quiche left.

57
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:15,891
They're super big.

58
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,849
Anyone want to share?

59
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:25,509
Okay, which thalamic nucleus

60
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:27,250
is primarily responsible for

61
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:30,035
processing input associated
with the activation

62
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,995
of Pacinian corpuscles
in your left hand?

63
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:35,389
Right VPL nucleus
of the thalamus.

64
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:36,738
Yes.

65
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,522
And where would
we most commonly find

66
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:39,958
the Morgagni hernia?

67
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:41,569
Left side or--
Right.

68
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,875
But you're not playing fair.

69
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,574
Welcome to
American medicine, baby.

70
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:48,315
Do you know which part
of the vertebral column

71
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:51,274
will show secondary curves
with concavity backwards?

72
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:53,276
Hmm? Hmm?

73
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,886
Cervical and lumbar.

74
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,586
And no more questions.
I want my breakfast.

75
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,631
You're gonna nail
this review.

76
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,334
What?

77
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:08,944
Nothing.

78
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:12,861
I'm just grateful
for these days,

79
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,950
this moment.

80
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:18,345
None of it possible
without you.

81
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:26,396
You have to put all
the donuts right here, huh?

82
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,833
Just, like, staring at me.
Thank you.

83
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,574
Oh, Dr. Frome.
Hi.

84
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,315
Hi, Dr. Fuentes, how are you?

85
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:34,099
Uh, Veronica.
Oh.

86
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,537
I, um, I was gonna call you

87
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,929
because I wanted to discuss

88
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:41,498
this whole
not seeing patients business.

89
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,979
Oh. Okay, yeah.

90
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:46,938
Because if you're going
to remain at New Amsterdam--

91
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:49,724
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
Hold on, back up.

92
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,813
You have to see patients.

93
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:54,424
Otherwise, I don't really
see a way forward for us.

94
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:57,775
Okay, um, Veronica--

95
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,823
Could I get, um,
a coffee, black.

96
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,520
I'm--I'm the chair
of the department.

97
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:05,740
And as the chair,
I--I have residents

98
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:07,219
that I'm overseeing 24-7.

99
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:09,613
I'm--I'm training them,
I'm shaping them, you know?

100
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,615
I don't--I don't have time
for patients.

101
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,574
Every other
behavioral health chair

102
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:14,966
in the city still practices.

103
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,577
I don't know that
that's true.

104
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,014
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

105
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:23,105
By abdicating, you are not only
hurting our bottom line,

106
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:25,629
you're damaging
the reputation of the hospital.

107
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,457
You're in a position
of prestige,

108
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,155
and prestige
is what we must lead with.

109
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,636
So let's get some patients
on the books, yeah?

110
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,683
But, um--
First thing after lunch?

111
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,126
Look, I'm not saying
it's a bad thing.

112
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,476
Well, it doesn't sound good
if it kept you up all night.

113
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,999
I'm just saying that
there's a lot of things

114
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,958
we never discussed.
There's a lot of boring,

115
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:53,701
traditional relationship stuff
that we kinda skipped over.

116
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:56,007
You mean like dating.
Yeah, I mean,

117
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:57,792
in less than 24 hours

118
00:05:57,835 --> 00:05:59,663
we went from being
friends and coworkers to--

119
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:01,578
To mad lovers
moving to London.

120
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,928
Yeah, which is
pretty awesome.

121
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:07,410
I know, but it does leave
some unanswered questions--

122
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,456
It does.
Like, um,

123
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,632
will I ever get
to meet your parents?

124
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:13,111
I mean, do you even
have parents?

125
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:16,724
Exactly like that.
I do have parents,

126
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,640
who divorced, thankfully,
when I was in med school.

127
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,685
Dad is, let's just say,
not a nice guy.

128
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,861
Drove my mom pretty much
all the way to Arizona,

129
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:27,865
where she married a guy
who is also a nice fella.

130
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,519
Uh, anyways,

131
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:32,217
we won't be visiting my dad
or Arizona any time soon.

132
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:34,002
Oh, wow.
Yeah, enough of that.

133
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,004
Can I ask you something?

134
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:39,224
Always.
Um...

135
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:43,881
what do you want Luna
to call you?

136
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:46,580
Oh, um, I don't--

137
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:49,452
what would you like her
to call me?

138
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:51,541
I don't know.

139
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:52,803
Last night,
as I was tucking her in,

140
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:56,633
she asked me if you were...

141
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,766
her new mommy.

142
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:04,859
Georgia is her mommy.

143
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:05,990
She never even knew Georgia.

144
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:13,041
And if you're gonna
be living with us--

good care of you, okay?

I'm okay.
No, you're not.

00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:00,975
Hey, STAT page?
Trauma One.

182
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:02,019
Can you--
Yeah.

183
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:05,675
Okay.

184
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:08,243
Rob! Rob, go get your head CT.

185
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:10,288
Go.

186
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,597
Forceps.

187
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,990
You good?
Give us a little room.

188
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,295
Yeah.
Can you see?

189
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,646
Yeah, there we go.

190
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,736
We're clear,
stanch the laceration.

191
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,782
Tachy at 144, 96 over 51.

192
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:28,698
Floyd, look at this.

193
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,178
Oh.

194
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:33,050
Bleeder's not our only problem.
Suture.

195
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:34,486
This puncture happened
in the crash,

196
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,705
but we need to know
what put him in the ambulance

197
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:36,837
in the first place.

198
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,968
Whatever it was
must have been bad.

199
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,317
Moreland was
tearing down that road.

200
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,928
Respiratory rate's 13.

201
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,277
Can you ask him?

202
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,020
No, Moreland's in CT
and Whitaker's in surgery.

203
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,239
Dispatch report.
On it.

204
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:13,395
♪

205
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,403
Promise me
that you'll save her first.

206
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,190
Hey, how are you?

207
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,931
Luna, say hi to your mom.

208
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,128
Give me a clue. Anything.

209
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,348
The report's missing.

210
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:56,394
Somebody tore it out.

211
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,704
Look, I know this isn't
where your head's at right now,

212
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,401
but you need to call
your union rep.

213
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,926
Police are gonna have questions
and you need to be protected.

214
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,144
When I was carrying
Whitaker in,

215
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:08,711
people were looking at me
like I'd killed--

216
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:10,844
Don't. Don't.
I need to be fired, Lauren.

217
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,106
The police should
put me in jail.

218
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,499
Robert,
you drive an ambulance.

219
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:16,806
There's not a single
human being who's needed one

220
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,460
who wished the driver
had gone slower.

221
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,854
Tell that to the man's family.
I met his wife, his grandson.

222
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,116
Okay, listen to me.

223
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,771
Two of the best doctors
at this hospital

224
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,077
are doing everything
they can for him right now.

225
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,340
And Whitaker
is gonna pull through.

226
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:30,820
Because that's our job.

227
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:34,955
And your job is to
stop blaming yourself, okay?

228
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,347
Another car cut you off.

229
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:39,786
This is not your fault.

230
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,831
Wasn't a car, Lauren.

231
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,833
I got around the car.

232
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:44,921
It was me, I--
Okay.

233
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,096
I was going too fast.

234
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,056
This was all me.

235
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,020
We did all we could.

236
00:11:57,064 --> 00:12:00,067
He's gone.

237
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,724
Hey, it's okay.

238
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:20,435
.

239
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,176
Oh, Max, hey!

240
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:23,830
Listen, I, um, I know things
are a little crazy

241
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,222
around here right now.
Yeah, beyond.

242
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,833
I have this thing
I need you to submit me for.

243
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,138
It's a little time-sensitive,

244
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,792
so I put stickies
everywhere you need to sign.

245
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,489
For the NAPA Prize?
Why is this time-sensitive?

246
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,100
They've been trying
to give it to me for years.

247
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:34,797
Yeah, and you've been
making fun of it for years.

248
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,364
Yeah, which was
incredibly immature of me.

249
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,888
I believe you called it
a spiky, ugly little award

250
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:41,195
that was ironic
in its Freudian obliviousness.

251
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:43,806
Yesterday it was oblivious,
today it's prestigious.

252
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,288
What changed?
Uh, our new medical director.

253
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:48,376
Veronica wants this?

254
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,899
Yeah, she says that I'm, uh,

255
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:51,422
bringing down the department
by not practicing,

256
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,947
and that I'm lowering
the prestige of the hospital.

257
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,252
I thought I would
throw her a little bone--

258
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:56,950
You know what this is?
This is retaliation

259
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:58,908
for me hiring Wilder
without her sign off,

260
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:00,867
and now she's putting
the squeeze on you. I'm sorry.

261
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,390
I'm trying to think
of a way to neutralize her,

262
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:05,393
but I can't--
Yeah, okay, but Max, I, um,

263
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:07,830
I can't go back
to seeing patients.

264
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:11,007
I'm nowhere near ready.

265
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:13,270
Yeah, it's okay.

266
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,445
Take your time.

267
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,056
Okay, thank you.

268
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,016
All right.

269
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,063
Thank you.
Welcome.

270
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,067
Mr. Newbounde.

271
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,895
Hi, you must be Alijah.

272
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:31,419
I'm Dr. Sharpe.
This is my colleague Dr. Kao.

273
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:33,116
They say she had
a small stroke,

274
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,901
that maybe it was
because of her sickle cell.

275
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,076
This stroke
may have been small

276
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,381
but the next one may not be.

277
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,906
We are very sorry
to have to tell you this,

278
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:42,212
but we found a blockage
in your basilar artery,

279
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,475
which supplies blood
to the cerebellum.

280
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,130
This is the area of the brain
that controls your motor skills

281
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,437
and cognitive functions.

282
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:53,093
Uh, what does that mean?

283
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,442
Alijah's sickle cell anemia

284
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:56,618
is restricting
the blood flow to her brain.

285
00:13:56,661 --> 00:14:00,448
But with proper testing,
we can prevent another stroke.

286
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:02,929
Tell me, Mr. Newbounde,
has Alijah ever had

287
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,887
trans-cranial
doppler screenings?

288
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:07,281
Of course, we relied on them.

289
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:11,938
I was taking her to get 'em
once a year until last March.

290
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,461
Why did you stop?

291
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:15,463
The program was discontinued.

292
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:17,857
It was? Where?

293
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,121
Here.

294
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:27,605
Hey.

295
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:28,955
Hey. Where you heading?

296
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:31,000
OR, to plate a broken bone.
I'll take her.

297
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:32,001
No, it's okay, I got it.

298
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,481
Uh--

299
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:35,004
didn't you just lose someone?

300
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,093
I need you prepping
for the M&M.

301
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:38,921
M&M?
There's nothing to review.

302
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,054
The guy was basically gone
when we got him.

303
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,099
Just let me take care of her.

304
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,319
Prep for the M&M.

305
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:47,582
Last time I checked,
Dr. Reynolds,

306
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:52,108
you were still my deputy
and I was still your chair.

307
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,893
Harmony, right?

308
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:08,995
Dr. Reynolds, do you mind
if I walk with you?

309
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:10,257
Be my guest.

310
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,912
Um, I need your take
on something.

311
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,174
Every department
has its strengths

312
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:16,393
and weaknesses, right?

313
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:19,266
But yours seems
a bit top-heavy.

314
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,528
I beg your pardon?

315
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,095
Well, you and Dr. Baptiste,

316
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:23,705
both excellent surgeons,

317
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,098
and two of our highest-paid,

318
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:28,144
and yet,
you often share patients.

319
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:30,016
Can you explain that?

320
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:32,409
I mean, is that
really efficient?

321
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:36,370
It is, if you're trying
to save a patient's life.

322
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,546
Oh, okay.

323
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,940
Well, Dr. Baptiste
had some thoughts on this.

324
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,115
I just wanted
to check in with you.

325
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:46,032
Oh, you spoke to Baptiste?

326
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,338
I did, yes, this morning.

327
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,471
Well, what did he say?

328
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,429
Oh, I mean,
I can't divulge the contents

329
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,127
of a private conversation
with you.

330
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,347
But I will tell you that
he had some pretty bold ideas

331
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:02,222
on how to rebalance
your department.

332
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:03,658
Did he?
Mm-hmm.

333
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,486
And I'm sure you'll
have ideas as well,

334
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,402
so let's set up
a time to chat, yeah?

335
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:11,492
I know we can cut
the suit to fit.

336
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:19,021
Right.
I understand, thank you.

337
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,283
Where's Moreland?

338
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,329
Uh, he's waiting
to talk to the police.

339
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:24,026
Well, he's gonna
talk to me first.

340
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,376
Max, you understand
this isn't his fault, right?

341
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,378
He's one of us. Max--

342
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,206
Where's the dispatch report,
Rob?

343
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,079
It should be
in the ambulance.

344
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,994
Yeah, should be,
but it isn't,

345
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,734
because someone tore it out.

346
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:39,085
Okay, look, anything
you want from the report,

347
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,564
you can get from 911 dispatch.

348
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,436
I just called 911 dispatch,

349
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:45,047
and the patient that
he picked up, Mr. Santangelo,

350
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,615
who is now dead,
didn't call 911,

351
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:49,269
he called
the non-emergency line,

352
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:50,661
'cause he had a fever,
and his wife was concerned.

353
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:54,187
The man didn't even
need an ambulance.

354
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,278
That's why you took
this report, isn't it?

355
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,541
You were driving like a madman
with a non-emergent patient,

356
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:05,502
whom you knew had no business
being in your vehicle!

357
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,606
Keep it.

358
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,652
Or give it to the cops.

359
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:27,133
I'm sure they'll
want to read it.

360
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:45,716
.

361
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,849
Even if he was
driving recklessly,

362
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:49,329
there's no way
they're gonna hang him.

363
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:51,635
When a cop goes down,
who's the first on the scene?

364
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,028
Paramedics.

365
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,943
The blue line covers them too.

366
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,076
No, he shouldn't need cover.

367
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,078
He's never done anything
like this before.

368
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,818
Well, that may be true,

369
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:03,604
but he killed a dude
with a runny nose, Laur.

370
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,649
And he almost killed
his partner.

371
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,738
Who's side are you on?

372
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:10,219
There are no sides.

373
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:12,134
It's just what happened.

374
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:15,094
Well, I want to know
why it happened.

375
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,843
Uh, Lauren.

376
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,062
Did you get my message?

377
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,890
Uh, I didn't know
you left me one.

378
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:31,153
I did. I wanted to thank you.

379
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:35,157
Mm, for what?
For your donation.

380
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:38,291
The donation you made to
the Dean's discretionary fund

381
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,640
a few months back?

382
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,598
I came across it
in the financials.

383
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:45,211
That was very,
very generous of you.

384
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:50,825
Are--are you not comfortable
discussing this?

385
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:53,697
No, no, um, I just--

386
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:57,005
money stuff, I like
to keep things confidential.

387
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:59,050
Oh, yeah, no, no,
of course, of course.

388
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:01,183
Yeah, it's a--
it's a family trust,

389
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:04,143
so you know, we make donations
like this all the time.

390
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,057
It's nothing special.

391
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,408
Oh. Well, if that's the case,

392
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,105
you might consider
a second gift

393
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,413
to the hospital's endowment.

394
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,850
A second, um--

395
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,286
uh, I don't know, uh,

396
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,637
I'd have to talk to my mother
and my sister and--

397
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:22,204
Mm-hmm.
And the lawyer.

398
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:25,686
Uh, I don't make
these decisions alone, so.

399
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:29,124
Is--is Dr. Shinwari involved?

400
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,083
If so, I'd like to extend
my gratitude to her as well.

401
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,085
No.

402
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:37,350
I mean, she doesn't know
that we do this.

403
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:38,699
Mm.

404
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:41,658
And I'd like to
keep it that way.

405
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:44,226
Gotcha.

406
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,882
Okay, well, have a think
about the endowment.

407
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:49,840
Your money would go
much further there.

408
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,233
And it wouldn't
have to be a lump sum gift.

409
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:54,236
We could work out
a quarterly situation.

410
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,674
And Leyla doesn't have
to know about that either.

411
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,379
Dr. Ketner.
Helen. Good morning.

412
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:07,989
I understand that
we're no longer offering

413
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:10,034
doppler screenings.
Can you tell me why?

414
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,080
No funding.

415
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,255
Since then?

416
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,954
Since you
reallocated the money.

417
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,782
Since I reallocated it?

418
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:21,132
In the early days
of the pandemic.

419
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,352
No, no, no.
Listen, it's not possible.

420
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:25,789
There's no way
that I would cut a vital test.

421
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,965
No one was coming in
for any tests then,

422
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,011
so you asked if we could
move some money around

423
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:33,275
to treat the effects
of long-term COVID.

424
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,759
But I--I didn't mean--

425
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:42,371
I didn't realize that it, um,
that it never came back.

426
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,852
A lot of tests
never came back.

427
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:49,335
Whole departments
never came back.

428
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:53,774
But this test
saves lives and...

429
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:00,824
Yeah. Hey, come in.

430
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:03,871
Congratulations, Dr. Frome.
I think.

431
00:21:03,914 --> 00:21:06,874
Dr. Fuentes just called.
She wanted us to know

432
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:10,007
that you are being awarded
this year's NAPA Prize.

433
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,183
Yes! Oh, what?

434
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,055
So it happened. I got it.

435
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:16,057
I got the award? And she knows.

436
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,364
Yes.
Oh!

437
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:21,062
Why do you look so excited?
I thought you didn't want

438
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:22,498
anything to do with
the NAPA people?

439
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,283
I mean, you said
their hearts were...

440
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,284
both: Black and rotten.

441
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,285
Yeah, I know what I said.

442
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,808
But she sounded happy about it?

443
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,941
About the--she was happy
about the prestige of it all?

444
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:32,160
She did.

445
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:34,771
In fact, I mean, she suggested

446
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,338
that you make a point
of mentioning the award

447
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,906
to all of your new patients.

448
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:41,256
Which surprised me,
because I didn't know

449
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,347
you were seeing new patients.

450
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:51,222
She still wants me
seeing patients?

451
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,355
She wanted me to confirm that
they were on your schedule

452
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:57,054
for today.

453
00:21:57,098 --> 00:22:00,275
No.

454
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,886
Oh--

455
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,149
oh, God, no.

456
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,195
No. No! No!

457
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:08,936
That's--
Iggy.

458
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:11,112
I--my--my--oh,

459
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,940
I can feel my throat
closing up, literally.

460
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:14,811
Okay, okay.

461
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:16,160
Now, just--just breathe.
Oh, God.

462
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,946
You are so good with people.

463
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:22,036
You are so empathetic.
No, no, no, not right now.

464
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,298
I would be damaging
to them, Gladys.

465
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,734
I'm--I'm--I--

466
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,519
watching your shrink
pass out from lack of oxygen,

467
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:27,824
that's not--

468
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:30,349
that's not helpful, mm-mm.

469
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:35,092
Is--

470
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:38,922
is this still about Chance?

471
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:39,967
Yeah.

472
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,883
Yes, it's about Chance.

473
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:44,275
It's about Chance.
It's about everybody.

474
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,625
It's about everyone
who's ever sat on that couch

475
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:46,974
and made their nightmares mine.

476
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,410
I took them all on
and made them mine.

477
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:50,325
I took them all on, and I--

478
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,154
I just was starting
to feel like--

479
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:55,156
I just was starting to have
dreams of my own again,

480
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:59,856
you know, and I--
and not confuse everything.

481
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,992
Okay.
Yep, Iggy, just breathe.

482
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:06,341
Yeah.
It's okay.

483
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,342
Mmkay, okay, all right.

484
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,170
Yeah, it's just--okay.
Mm.

485
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:12,347
So, what do you think
you want to do?

486
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,479
I don't know, I don't know.
Okay.

487
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:18,658
I don't know. Um, I, uh--

488
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:21,878
I think, uh...

489
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:30,147
Resign.

490
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:40,201
Floyd, you need something?
I'm here to see my patient.

491
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:41,594
Did you do the work
for your M&M?

492
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:42,682
Yes, I did.

493
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:45,032
What have you done
for Ms. Perez?

494
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,947
Nothing, because
she's stable.

495
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,514
For now.

496
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:50,516
Which, last time I checked,

497
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,300
that was a good thing.

498
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:53,954
I need to put that plate in.

499
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:56,130
And I told you not to.

500
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:01,440
Oh.

501
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:05,269
She can't breathe.

502
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,664
Collapsed lung and
internal bleeding.

503
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,144
All right,
she needs an OR now.

504
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:13,495
Dr. Baptiste, Ms. Garcia's
heart rate's plummeting.

505
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:16,280
Better tend to your patient,
doctor.

506
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:23,549
It's okay, it's okay.

507
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,468
So what's the emergency?

508
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,688
Mr. Santangelo lived
on the Upper East Side.

509
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,037
What were you doing 40 blocks

510
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,299
outside the hospital
jurisdiction?

511
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:36,518
Is that why you were
driving so fast,

512
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,607
just to make up the miles?

513
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:44,570
This is me now, Rob,

514
00:24:44,613 --> 00:24:47,442
not the police.

515
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:52,012
And you need to tell me
why this happened.

516
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,231
We were ordered
to make the pickup.

517
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:57,191
What? Ordered by who?

518
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,762
Our battalion chief.

519
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,111
Why?

520
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:05,547
Why were you driving
1,000 miles an hour

521
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:06,548
for a man with a fever?

522
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:09,595
Hey, look--

523
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:12,423
we were told
to ignore jurisdiction.

524
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,469
Grab any patient we could
anywhere in the city,

525
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,297
then drive bat out of hell
to make the drop

526
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,646
so we can get back out
onto the street

527
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,430
as soon as possible.
That's insane.

528
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:22,433
Why would he tell you
to do that?

529
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:24,740
Private ambulance companies
are killing us, Lauren.

530
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,047
This is how you compete.

531
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,310
Your chief, he's done.

532
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:30,398
It wasn't his idea.

533
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:33,444
Oh, yeah? Then whose was it?

534
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:38,406
Dr. Fuentes,
your new medical director.

535
00:25:56,946 --> 00:25:57,164
.

536
00:25:57,207 --> 00:26:00,820
You're coming to me
for money.

537
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:03,126
Uh, yes, I realize

538
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,824
that we started off
on the wrong foot,

539
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,913
and I am sorry
about that, but--

540
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:11,787
You thought I was a superfan
trolling the halls.

541
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,354
Yes, well,
obviously, I've been

542
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:16,400
making tons of mistakes lately,
but I'm here to own them.

543
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:18,707
I, um--

544
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,667
I cut funding
off the doppler screenings

545
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,799
for our sickle cell patients.

546
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:26,019
It was the peak of COVID
and we were moving fast--

547
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:29,718
obviously too fast--and I--

548
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:32,895
um--

549
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:35,289
okay, look,

550
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:39,119
I take every part of my job
incredibly seriously,

551
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:42,339
but the part that I view
as more than a job,

552
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:46,343
as, um, as a higher duty,

553
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:50,217
is taking care of children.

554
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,916
And I have let one down.

555
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,135
In the ICU right now,

556
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:56,832
I have a patient
who may never walk again,

557
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,312
and she is 14.

558
00:26:58,355 --> 00:27:01,228
She had a stroke, a stroke
that may have been avoided

559
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,447
had I have not
ended the program.

560
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,798
So I have come here
to ask you--

561
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,800
to beg you for the money,

562
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,366
so that I can reinstate
the program,

563
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,936
so this can never happen again.

564
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,722
You know how bad
the financials are, right?

565
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:19,768
And that's why
the board brought me in.

566
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:22,989
Yeah.

567
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:24,338
But I hear you,

568
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:28,821
and I appreciate
you taking responsibility.

569
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't think every program
is worth keeping.

570
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:38,308
But this one sounds
like it might be.

571
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:43,052
So I will find a way
to get you that money.

572
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:45,533
Um--

573
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:51,234
thank you. Thank you.

574
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,411
I don't have a lot of friends
around here,

575
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,413
and even though you're leaving,
I--I hope

576
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:58,111
that I can count you as one

577
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:00,243
until you're out the door.

578
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,071
Absolutely.

579
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,987
Thank you.
Yeah, of course.

580
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:16,825
So the source of the blood
in her lungs was her leg.

581
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,784
She had a fractured rib.
I fixed that.

582
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,829
Now I'm onto the leg.
She has osteoporotic bones.

583
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,091
That's why there are
two fractures,

584
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:23,440
and that's why
the screws will never hold,

585
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,442
and why I didn't want you
taking her to the OR.

586
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:28,097
Which is why
I'm trying something new,

587
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,882
expandible pedicle screws.

588
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:31,187
They'll never hold
without cement.

589
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:34,234
Hey, nurse,
could you bring me the cement?

590
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,286
I'm sure your
novel surgical technique

591
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,897
will impress
our new medical director.

592
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,333
As opposed to you
trying to impress her

593
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:49,466
by sending me to do
a completely unnecessary M&M.

594
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,122
Hope that helps
your rebalancing.

595
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,472
Who don't we do this
together, Dr. Reynolds,

596
00:28:55,516 --> 00:28:56,996
since we're so good at sharing,

597
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,085
and save the rest
of this discussion for later?

598
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:02,044
Nurse, scalpel, please.

599
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:11,662
You're not resining.
I am.

600
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:15,492
I mean, I think I am. I guess.

601
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:18,191
I don't know, what other--
what other options do I have?

602
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:21,629
Iggy, we just blew through
all our savings

603
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,936
driving across country,
living in an RV for months.

604
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,938
I know, I know,
and the odds of me

605
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,417
actually getting a job
at any other hospital

606
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:29,855
where I don't have
to see patients, is

607
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,160
slim to none, at best.

608
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:35,121
And I'm--

609
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:37,645
I don't--I mean,
I don't know what to do.

610
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,168
Martin, I'm asking you
to tell me what to do.

611
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:41,997
I don't know what to do.

612
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,607
Trust your own words,
all right?

613
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:45,435
All you ever say is
how much you love this place.

614
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,873
I do.

615
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,353
I do love it.

616
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:51,528
But I can't--I can't--

617
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:54,357
I can't see patients anymore.

618
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:58,318
I can't.

619
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:02,496
Can't now or forever?

620
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:05,238
I don't know.

621
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:06,630
I don't know, I don't know.

622
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:09,285
I don't know the answer
to that question. I--

623
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:12,941
and I just--

624
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:15,683
seeing a patient, I just--

625
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:18,729
I--my heart begins to race,

626
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:23,299
and my--my palms get sweaty,
and I--

627
00:30:23,343 --> 00:30:24,997
I can't do it. I can't.

628
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,217
I just envision
all of the people

629
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:31,264
that I'm gonna hurt
because I'm not ready.

630
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:36,704
And I'm not willing to do that.

631
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:40,664
Okay.

632
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:45,191
Resign.

633
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:46,714
Are--are you sure?

634
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:49,325
I mean, if you're not
completely on board, I'll--

635
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:52,067
you know, say the word,
I'll figure it out.

636
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:54,156
We'll figure it out.

637
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,419
That's what we do.

638
00:30:56,463 --> 00:31:01,076
Hand this in.

639
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,209
What about the money?

640
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:07,256
Babe, you're going through
something really big.

641
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,608
The money isn't as important.

642
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:15,264
If we need to move, we'll move.

643
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:18,050
If the kids
need to start new schools,

644
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:21,749
they'll adapt.

645
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,142
We'll all adapt,

646
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:27,668
'cause that's what
families do for each other.

647
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,714
I love you.

648
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,419
Yes.

649
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:41,160
I told them to drive faster.

650
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:42,770
Someone died!

651
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:45,033
What kind of
insane, reckless--

652
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,687
Dr. Bloom, are you aware

653
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,994
that the majority
of paramedics in this city

654
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,517
work for private
ambulance companies?

655
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,910
So what?

656
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,521
I mean, we have a contract
with the fire department.

657
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:56,523
Which I told them
we'd terminate

658
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:58,003
unless they got competitive.

659
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,396
So you blackmailed them.
Great.

660
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,442
Max, the private
ambulance companies

661
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,313
all have backroom deals

662
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:06,446
with the private hospitals.

663
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:08,709
They are strongly encouraged
to only pick up

664
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:11,668
insured patients,
the big ticket procedures,

665
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,148
the money makers,

666
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:15,237
which leaves the uninsured,

667
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:17,544
the homeless,
and the poor for us.

668
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:20,199
We are a public hospital!

669
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:26,292
That desperately
needs money to survive, Max.

670
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:30,470
So I incentivized the chief

671
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:33,342
by making him realize
that a win for us

672
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,735
is also a win for him.

673
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,780
Mm, well,
killing our patients

674
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:38,826
isn't exactly a win.

675
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:45,137
I am truly sorry about
what happened this morning.

676
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,182
But accidents can happen
at any speed.

677
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:49,706
So what exactly did you say
to the fire chief?

678
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,318
I mean, how far are they
supposed to just drive around,

679
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:56,278
just scooping up people
who don't even need them?

680
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:57,714
They have a daily quota,

681
00:32:57,758 --> 00:32:59,803
and they're incentivized
to meet or exceed it.

682
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:02,241
You know, the NYPD
tried a quota system

683
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:03,894
and, uh, it led to
the mass incarceration

684
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:07,202
of Black and brown people and
nearly tore this city apart.

685
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:12,555
And I believe you are
out of here in two weeks,

686
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:18,083
so none of this
is really your problem anymore.

687
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:25,438
.

688
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:27,048
No, listen, hey!
Your issue--

689
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,267
In the scrub room.

690
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,530
Sorry, young brother,
but it's my job

691
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:31,748
to make the hard decisions!
Guys--

692
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:33,054
My issue is that because

693
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:34,490
you're threatened
by me and Lyn,

694
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:35,752
you're trying to edge me
out of my job.

695
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:37,058
Guys, stop this, now.

696
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:38,581
And because you're
the woman's new flavor,

697
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,497
you think you can talk down
to me in front of my team?

698
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:42,977
Floyd is not anybody's
new flavor.

699
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,848
I was making
a medical decision--

700
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,111
Stop it! Both of you!

701
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:47,677
If you think
yelling our business

702
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:49,940
all over this hospital
is going to help anything,

703
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,855
you're wrong!
Oh, and now you want to help.

704
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,075
'Cause falling in love
with another man, this man,

705
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,729
was not part of our agreement.

706
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:58,036
You opened the door, Claude.

707
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,602
You're the one who wanted this!

708
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:01,082
You're the one who wanted more.

709
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,953
More of you.

710
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,433
I just wanted
to make you happy,

711
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:08,742
'cause you sure as hell
weren't happy with just me!

712
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:16,967
That's not true.

713
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:19,840
That's how it felt.

714
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,977
I'm sorry.

715
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,024
I'm sorry for all of this.

716
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,985
As soon as you saw
she was my wife,

717
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:36,987
you should have declined
the deputy chair.

718
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:40,904
I broke it off, Claude.
I thought that was the solve.

719
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:49,565
But I love her.

720
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,269
And I know you do too.

721
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:03,623
How did we think that
we could just have breakfast

722
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,800
and everything would be cool?

723
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:09,107
Sure, we could pretend
that it's cool,

724
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,153
but it's not.

725
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,547
Not for me.

726
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:24,034
Me either.

00:35:24,078 --> 00:35:27,821

I'm sorry
I wasn't upfront day one.

729
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:48,929
I'm sorry I started something
I couldn't handle.

730
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,065
And I'm sorry

731
00:35:55,109 --> 00:36:00,288
for caring so much
about both of you.

732
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:20,613
The clients are nervous.

733
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:22,049
How much are they getting
for their return?

734
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:24,225
Are they overpaying? You know?

735
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,967
My wife,
she doesn't think about this.

736
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:32,886
All she cares about is
getting to the theater on time.

737
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:37,107
And the crazy part is
we've already seen "Hamilton."

738
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:40,198
I don't get
what the big deal is.

739
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:44,245
So we're a few minutes late.
So what?

740
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:46,029
If I don't take care
of the clients,

741
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:47,379
then I'll be out of a job

742
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:48,989
and I don't have any money

743
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:52,645

"Hamilton" tickets anyway.
