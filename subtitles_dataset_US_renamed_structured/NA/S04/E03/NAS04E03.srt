1
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:12,751
.

2
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,102
- If you were going to move
to another country,

3
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:18,279
you wouldn't tell me
at a party, right?

4
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:20,455
- You still upset?

5
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:21,891
- Not that they're together.

6
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:24,850
I mean, that part could not
have taken any longer.

7
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,026
But moving to London?

8
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:28,071
- What about the hospital?

9
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:31,031
Max is the glue.
He holds us together.

10
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,815
- New Amsterdam survived
before him.

11
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:35,687
It'll survive after him.

12
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:39,865
Plus, they have
a new deputy chair of surgery

13
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,868
who's kicking ass.

14
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:44,870
- You know he was the first
person there to believe in me?

15
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:48,700
- You know, I've never said
this out loud before, but...

16
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:52,182
he's kind of my hero.

17
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:58,101
- He's not dying.
- Feels like he is.

18
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,103
And Helen--
- She was always there

19
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:02,149
whenever I needed a friend.

20
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:04,716
- First Vijay, now this?
What's next, Gladys?

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,328
It's oh--God, I can't
even--that's not--

22
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:09,373
It's too much, too fast.

23
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,766
- What if the new
medical director goes back

24
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:12,202
to the way it was?
I mean, do I quit?

25
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,248
I just--I don't know.

26
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:19,905
- Stop talking.

27
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:22,082
- Yes, ma'am.

28
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:28,088
- I think I can help.

29
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:35,791
- How am I gonna survive
five days without you?

30
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,923
- Relax.

31
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:41,492
They don't need your anxiety,
they need your support.

32
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:45,670
Just be happy for them.

33
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:48,891
- Yeah.

34
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:51,285
Yeah.

35
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:52,503
Why should they be
the only ones having

36
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:55,724
exciting new sex, right?
- Right.

37
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,383
- This is the morning song!
Sing along. Come on.

38
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:05,995
- It's Miss Abigail.
- But is she in the apartment?

39
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:07,997
- Just on YouTube.

40
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:10,913
I think we're fine.
I think we have five minutes.

41
00:02:10,956 --> 00:02:14,438
- Let's get this day started
with today is--

42
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:17,441
- Waffle, waffle, waffle.

43
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,269
- Oh, dear God.
- One sec.

44
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:25,449
- Waffle, waffle, waffle.

45
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:28,235
- You want waffles?
Who wants waffles?

46
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:29,888
- Me.
- You do?

47
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:31,716
Do you want extra gooey syrup?

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,371
I think so.
Let's get some.

49
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:41,683
♪

50
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:52,215
♪

51
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:56,741
- Looking for the six?
- I'm--I'm sorry, what?

52
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:59,179
- It's all good.
Tourists always get confused,

53
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:00,310
but this isn't
a subway entrance.

54
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:03,357
It's actually a hospital.
- You don't say.

55
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,054
- Guessing you already
knew that.

56
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:06,621
- Well, it was the hundreds of
people walking around in scrubs

57
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,144
that kind of tipped me off.

58
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,192
Do you happen to know where
there's a Dr. Max Goodwin?

59
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,845
- You know what?
He's off campus today.

60
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,499
But I can take you up
to his assistant.

61
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:19,503
- Oh no need.
No need, Dr.?

62
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:21,853
- Reynolds.
- Dr. Reynolds.

63
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:25,509
Besides, I think it best that
Max not be here for this.

64
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:31,733
- Welcome to the NovaCo
Five-Borough Science Fair.

65
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,520
I'm Ron Elgin, chief
advancement officer for NovaCo.

66
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:39,523
And I'd like to introduce
our judge for the festivities.

67
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:42,570
Let's give a warm welcome
to Dr. Max Goodwin.

68
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,311
- Thank you guys.

69
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:45,877
Thanks for having me.

70
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,663
Thank you to Ron and to NovaCo
for putting this together.

71
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:49,968
This is amazing.

72
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,710
When I was your age,
I built a can crusher

73
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:55,670
for my science fair,
and it was not the coolest.

74
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:58,499
I didn't win, but it did crush
cans like nobody's business.

75
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,370
So I'm very excited to see

76
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:02,546
what neat things you guys
have come up with.

77
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,722
Let's judge.

78
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,463
- It's about automated
segmentation

79
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:09,292
for color quantification
in African cichlid fish.

80
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,511
- Interesting.

81
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:11,990
Question:
should I still be the judge

82
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,818
if the only word I got
there was fish?

83
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:15,298
- I got a college lab
to let me use

84
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:19,128
their 3-D printer for accuracy.
- Oh. Good for you.

85
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:23,001
Looks expensive. Sorry.

86
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:25,308
Wow, even the old volcano guy
is crushing it.

87
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,354
This is amazing.
Smoke and everything.

88
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,660
Even dinosaurs. Very cool.

89
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,271
- Picking a winner
won't be easy.

90
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:33,621
- Yeah, what about
a 14-way tie?

91
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,798
Is that a turnip?

92
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,325
- I grew it myself.
- Not the flashiest entry.

93
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,675
- You'll change your mind when
I tell you how this turnip's

94
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,330
gonna fix the world.
- Okay.

95
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:50,072
Imani Moore, bring it on.

96
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:51,987
- So this is a smart suture.

97
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,119
It's what most
American hospitals use.

98
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,774
It's coated with sensors that
are like tiny thermometers.

99
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,298
Infection raises temperature,

100
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,734
so when your wound's heat
goes up,

101
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:01,692
it uses smartphone technology
to alert your doctor.

102
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:02,606
- We have these
at our hospital.

103
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,173
They're super cool, right?

104
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:05,435
- Unless you live
in a place where

105
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,784
your doctors can't afford
smartphones.

106
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,699
Then the smart suture's
a dumb piece of thread

107
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:10,614
that knows you might die
but can't tell anybody.

108
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,660
- Yeah, that does seem
less cool now.

109
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:15,358
- Suture number two:
no sensors, no thermometers.

110
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:17,578
Made from a common turnip.
And it knows

111
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,928
if you have an infection
just as fast as the fancy one.

112
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:22,104
Infection doesn't just change
a wound's temperature.

113
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:24,672
It also changes its pH.
And the natural pH level

114
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:26,021
of a turnip-infused suture

115
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,849
will, upon infection,
change color.

116
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,633
So when it does,
you go to the doctor.

117
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:31,374
See, smart sutures need phones,
high-speed Internet,

118
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:34,551
1,800 microscopic thermometers.
I just need a root vegetable.

119
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:38,250
- Imani, this could save lives.

120
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:40,165
How did you come up with this?

121
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,516
- I'm a first generation
immigrant, Dr. Goodwin.

122
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,692
Surgical site infections
in impoverished countries

123
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,694
are nine times higher
than in America.

124
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:49,740
That's some ripe you-know-what,
so I'm gonna fix it.

125
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:52,787
P.S., if I win, I plan to use
the prize money to help pay

126
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,266
for Banneker Medical School,

127
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,530
which would get me a big step
closer to my goal.

128
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,358
- And what is that?

129
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,447
- Like I said,
I'm gonna fix the world.

130
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,059
- Oh.

131
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,461
- Any new life-changing
announcements

132
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:17,159
I should brace myself for?
- Mm-hmm.

133
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:21,163
Yeah, I just spent
my first full night at Max's.

134
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,730
And it was eye-opening.

135
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:25,385
- Okay, if you think I can be
bought off

136
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,864
by salacious gossip...

137
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,518
- The man snores.

138
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:30,955
I'm on, like,
zero sleep right now.

139
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,741
It's not just the snoring.
He's messy.

140
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:37,571
He's really messy.
Like, Luna is the clean one.

141
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,921
And he's disorganized.
His place is cramped.

142
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,879
My closet is bigger
than his entire apartment.

143
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:44,012
- But to be fair, your closet--
it's amazing.

144
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:45,709
- And to top it all off,
he was out of toilet paper.

145
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,972
I mean, is this my life now?
My God.

146
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:52,716
- At least you're not freaking
out about the little things.

147
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,675
- I was so busy falling
in love,

148
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:55,676
I forgot that being
together

149
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,417
actually meant living together.

150
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,636
- Maybe you should dump him.

151
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,943
At least then we get to keep
at least one of you.

152
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,163
It's just a thought.

153
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:09,341
- Here is your medal
for first place.

154
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:14,782
And perhaps better yet,
your check for $50,000.

155
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,523
- I can't believe this
is happening.

156
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:22,572
- It's about to get better.
Follow me.

157
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,966
Ron, I'd like
to introduce you

158
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,490
to the future,
Miss Imani Moore.

159
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:28,970
- Great project.
Congratulations.

160
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:30,885
- Thank you.
- And because NovaCo's

161
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:34,279
underwriting all of this, they
can make your idea a reality.

162
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,977
And New Amsterdam wants in.
We'd like to preorder

163
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,371
$35,000 worth.
How does that sound?

164
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:42,592
- I gotta call my parents.

165
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:45,073
- Max, NovaCo already produces

166
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:46,944
a chemically based
smart suture.

167
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:48,250
- Yeah, but this is totally
different.

168
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:49,773
I mean, it uses turnips.

169
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:52,297
- And after all of the R&D
that went into our sutures,

170
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:55,736
they'll never cannibalize those
margins with a similar product.

171
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,959
- But you own her concept.

172
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,874
So what are you going

- Wow.
Well, we'll just see what

345
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:06,470
our legal department has
to say about this.

346
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:09,082
- They aren't suing
your hospital, Dr. Goodwin.

347
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,432
They're only suing
our daughter.

348
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:19,222
- Heads up.
Make a hole.

349
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:20,963
Coming through.

350
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,660
Come on, come on.
Come on.

351
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,579
- Patient with a GSW
to the right thorax.

352
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,320
Here for a thoracotomy
with a subsequent

353
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,583
vascular and chest wall
reconstruction.

354
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:34,498
- We're gonna lift on three.

355
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:37,153
Ready. One, two, three.

356
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:44,160
Wait, this--this--

357
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,731
- Dr. Reynolds,

358
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,863
when you're done scrubbing in,
we'll be ready to go.

359
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,517
- Yeah.

360
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:00,437
.

361
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:02,918
- They have a strong case.

362
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,354
- This morning, our daughter
was valedictorian.

363
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,052
She won the biggest
science fair in the state

364
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:09,185
with a cash prize that would
help pay for med school.

365
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:12,319
And then you encourage a child
to throw her life away.

366
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,929
- I'm not a child.

367
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,192
And if NovaCo wants to sue,
let's go to court.

368
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:18,934
- You're not going anywhere.
You're grounded.

369
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,284
- What I'd give to be able
to ground you, too.

370
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:23,852
- I'm sure you would. Listen,
we're gonna figure this out.

371
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,898
Okay? I can call
Banneker Med School right now.

372
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,030
I promise you
they're not gonna care

373
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,597
about some ridiculous lawsuit.

374
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,774
- Dr. Goodwin, NovaCo's
on the board at Banekker.

375
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,602
- Really?

376
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,386
Wish I had that information

377
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,040
before I said that.
Um--

378
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,999
There are a lot of
other great schools.

379
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,088
And NovaCo's on the board
of just about all of them.

380
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,437
They're gonna make sure our
daughter

381
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,960
never gets in anywhere.

382
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,614
She's not
from generational wealth.

383
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:48,268
This was her shot.
This.

384
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,230
- All I can say is that
until I make this right,

385
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,015
I'm gonna be by
your daughter's side.

386
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,104
- No, you'll be by her side
for the next five weeks,

387
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,541
and then you're leaving
the country.

388
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:04,066
We do business with NovaCo.
I know their top people.

389
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,069
I can get them to back off,
but only if Imani agrees

390
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:11,682
to leave her turnip sutures
back at the science fair.

391
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:14,076
Let it go.
- She will.

392
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,469
Thank you.
- Hold up.

393
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,906
Dad, I'm 18.

394
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,995
This is my decision.
This is my life.

395
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:25,087
Look, making the world better's
hard but I learned it's not

396
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,481
about when they say no.
It's about what you do next.

397
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:32,834
Whatever you think I should do
next, Dr. G, I'll do it.

398
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:42,539
♪

399
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:54,116
- I hope you don't think
I'm being too forward.

400
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,205
- I do not. I'm glad
you're speaking right now.

401
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:58,860
I hate elevator silence more
than anything in the world.

402
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:01,993
- You're Dr. Ignatius Frome,
chair of behavioral health,

403
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:03,821
right?
- Yeah, yeah.

404
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:07,042
So much for being incognito.

405
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,000
- Um, I couldn't help
but notice that

406
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,655
your nurse-to-patient ratio
on your ward

407
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,918
is very disconcerting.

408
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:17,052
- Yeah, it is.
I know, right?

409
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,140
But, I'm sorry,
what's your name?

410
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:19,228
I didn't catch it.

411
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:21,926
- 13-to-1 ratio, to be exact.

412
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,667
- You counted.
- I did, yeah.

413
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:26,409
Unfortunately, those numbers
puts your department

414
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,803
at the bottom of most
of the New York State

415
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,021
public hospitals.

416
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:31,936
So...
- Yeah. Why--

417
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,461
Yeah, you know,
I've written HCC,

418
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:36,245
and I've petitioned the board,
and at this point

419
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,160
I would do anything to get them
to take me seriously.

420
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,944
- Anything?
- Yeah.

421
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,859
Yeah, anything within reason,
you know.

422
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,908
Well, you know, I used
to work at this hospital

423
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:49,650
that, for legal reasons,
I can't really name.

424
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:52,696
But we had
the exact same nursing shortage

425
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,438
on our psych ward,
and we fixed it overnight.

426
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,571
- Overnight?
How did you find the nurses?

427
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:59,094
- Oh, no, we didn't.

428
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,489
We cut the patients.

429
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,360
Oh, this is me.
Very nice to meet you.

430
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,754
- Yeah, yeah, you too.
Take care.

431
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:08,843
- You, too.

432
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,497
- You paged me?
- What?

433
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,194
Yes. Yeah I did.

434
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:13,848
Um, I need you--I need you
to reassign

435
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:14,805
all of Wandy's cases.

436
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:16,329
Clear the decks.

437
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,069
- All of them?
- Yes. Do it, please.

438
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:19,332
Thank you.

439
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,205
Thank you.

440
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,121
- Hey.
- Hey.

441
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,560
- Why you letting
the other residents

442
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,606
take the lead
on every procedure?

443
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,216
- Are you spying on me?

444
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,697
- You are the most
skilled resident in my ED,

445
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,959
but you don't act like it.

446
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:39,352
It's like you're stepping up
to the plate

447
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,918
and you're gonna
strike out looking.

448
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:43,573
Okay, you gotta take some cuts.
Give the ball a ride.

449
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:46,707
- Is that basketball?
- Baseball.

450
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,144
- Hmm.
- Never mind.

451
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,540
Look, I was like Roxana
when I was a resident.

452
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,324
Cutthroat, driven.

453
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,370
She's gonna take
every advantage she can,

454
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,285
which is why you need
to show everyone

455
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,243
just how capable you are.

456
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,984
I mean, where's
the woman who pulled off

457
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,986
a renegade
needle decompression?

458
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:10,078
Where's the woman who pinned me
down in bed this morning?

459
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,211
- She's right here.

460
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,300
- Well, then show them.

461
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:17,259
Stop keeping how amazing
you are all to yourself.

462
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:21,959
- Okay.
Okay, I will.

463
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:24,135
I will ride the ball
or whatever.

464
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,660
- Maybe you're more
of a hockey person.

465
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,842
- We assume you've come
to comply with our demands.

466
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,147
Sign this,

467
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:38,149
and the suture matter
will be settled.

468
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,589
- No, thank you.

469
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,681
- So you're choosing a trial
against the fourth largest

470
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,639
pharmaceutical company
in the country?

471
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:52,425
- No, absolutely not.
That sounds terrifying.

472
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:53,991
No, we'd like
door number three.

473
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,297
That's the one
where we don't fight

474
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,995
because we're working together.

475
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,956
You could sue this 18-year-old
girl for half a billion dollars

476
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:05,307
that she doesn't have,
or you could walk out of here

477
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:08,310
with a vast,
new, untapped market:

478
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:11,487
the entire developing world.
Think about it.

479
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:14,360
There are over 100 countries
that can't afford

480
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:17,798
your smart sutures,
but they can afford turnips.

481
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:21,192
You can improve health care
for half the planet

482
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,630
and turn a profit
while doing it.

483
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,458
I don't know how you could
say no to that.

484
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:34,641
- We'll see you in court.

485
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:38,297
- Wait, wait, wait.
Um, don't do this.

486
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,735
This could change the world.

487
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:45,869
- And this is the clause
in the science fair application

488
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:49,046
which states that NovaCo owns
the winner's IP.

489
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,354
We can sell it, sit on it,
we can put it in a cookbook.

490
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,965
And that's Imani's signature.

491
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:58,534
Next time, read the fine print.

492
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,585
- Bullet's out.

493
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:07,587
- Blood pressure's
dropping.

494
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,371
- Bleeder?
- I don't see it.

495
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:11,068
- Well, it must be
something else.

496
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,461
- Myocardial infarction?

497
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:13,680
- I was thinking
adrenal crisis.

498
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,638
- Could be a
renal--There, look.

499
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:17,379
Piece of the bone fragment
from the scapula must have

500
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:19,294
penetrated the diaphragm
and lodged into the abdomen.

501
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,904
- Like a small dagger.
- Yeah.

502
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:23,124
- Hang a unit of blood.
- And push calcium chloride

503
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:27,650
to help the clotting.

504
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:29,173
Wait, stop.

505
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:40,097
- Would you rather go with TXA?

506
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:43,449
- Sorry, no. No, no, no.
Just, um--

507
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,974
Push the calcium chloride.
Sorry.

508
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:50,804
- Okay. I'm gonna go and
grab Dr. Hartman to assist.

509
00:22:58,725 --> 00:22:58,942
.

510
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,249
- Not now.
- It's important.

511
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,338
- Like your love
of kickboxing important

512
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,384
or like a patient is coding
important?

513
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:08,561
- If I'm forced to choose,
somewhere right in the middle.
