we need to go now.

353
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,051

Okay.

354
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,227

355
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,403

Okay.

Okay, great, great.
Thank you, everybody.

359

- Yeah, yeah, okay.

363
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,030
Okay, so I know that that was
very unnerving for a lot

364
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:31,120
of you, but I promise you,
we are... we are protected here.

365
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:32,817
We are very safe
from the storm.

366
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,341
And the good news is
we only have to huddle

367
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:36,212

the next four or five hours.

368

it's for all of our safety.

371
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:42,653
- Being enclosed
in a tight space

372
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,220
can trigger physical reactions.

373
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,135

okay, everybody?

a social worker now.

702
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:36,019
- We make a good team,
Doctor Bloom.

703
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,240
- I concur, Doctor Shinwari.

704
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:43,940
- So...

705
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:46,204
let's go
do something about it.

706
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:56,910
- Earlier,
when I brought you a coffee,

707
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,129
I saw a look on your face.

708
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:03,221
Flash of worry.

709
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:06,267
- No, I was appreciating it.

710
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,443
- You were wondering
whether you had to pay me back.

711
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:17,409
We started
with this money thing,

712
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:19,324
and it keeps coming back.

713
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:26,200
It's in everything we do,
and it's not going away.

714
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:32,293
- Lauren, let's just go home,
get some sleep.

715
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:36,645
- You need money,
and you need my apartment,

716
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,560
and you need your immigration
to go through...

717
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,956
And you need all those things
more than you need me.

718
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:45,654
- No, don't say that.

719
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:47,221
- What happens when we fight?

720
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:51,312
You can't win
because I have all the power.

721
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:53,140
What if you want
to break up with me?

722
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:56,230
You can't leave.

723
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,581

just taints everything.

Even me getting you
a cup of coffee.

725
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:10,288
So you're gonna
take my apartment.

- What?
No, no!

727

you get your visa.

with you.

729
