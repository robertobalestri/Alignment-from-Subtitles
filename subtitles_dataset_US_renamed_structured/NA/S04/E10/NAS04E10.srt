356
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,516
How bad?

357
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,821
It's getting worse
by the minute.

358
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:12,389
Okay, go.
I'll head up there now.

359
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,438
I heard your patient's lungs

360
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,353
are stiff
and difficult to ventilate.

361
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:22,312
Yes, and I paged
for a general consult.

362
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,836
The chair of surgery
doesn't need to swoop in.

363
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,577
If it's a possible
KPC infection,

364
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,492
I need to know about it.
Okay.

365
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:30,755
And, Lyn, you should know

366
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,322
that I'm in for complicated.

367
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,889
And being with you has shown me

368
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,414
that I might even
like complicated.

369
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:51,298
Course rhonci throughout
with diminished breath sounds.

370
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,995
Left lower lobe.

371
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,866
That's how my last patient
with KPC started.

372
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,390
X-ray tells the same story.
All right.

373
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,739
Well, there's no treatment
for this,

374
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,306
but if we can remove
the infected lobe

375
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:00,785
before it spreads
to the rest of the lungs,

376
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,483
we might be able to stop
the infection in its tracks.

377
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:04,964
That's a long shot.
It's all we got.

378
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,010
♪

379
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:10,230
Simon,
tell me you got good news.

380
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:12,841
I put the CDC's strongest
antibiotics in each dish--

381
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:14,886
Cipro, Colistin, Vancomycin.

382
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,019
Bacteria should not be able
to survive in this environment.

383
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,020
And?

384
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:19,717
New Amsterdam's KPC strain

385
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:21,850
not only survived,
it flourished.

386
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:23,547
Nothing worked?

387
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:25,941
This is what antibiotic
resistance looks like.

388
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,596
New Amsterdam is
the third hospital this year

389
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,555
to get an infection like this.

390
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:35,385
And what happened to patients
at the other hospitals?

391
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,345
They died.

392
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:44,742
.

393
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,918
There must be a common link,

394
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:49,660
but all the infected
came from different floors.

395
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:51,445
They were admitted
to different departments,

396
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:53,273
and given various treatments.

397
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:56,624
From arrival
to first symptoms,

398
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,974
looks like roughly a 48-hour
incubation period

399
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,498
for the bacteria.
Okay.

400
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:04,197
So...

401
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,417
let's go back
to hour one for every patient.

402
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,593
Where did they enter?

403
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:12,248
All but three went in
through the ED.

404
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:13,467
Okay, then what?

405
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,338
Six went through radiology
for imaging.

406
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:17,862
And five went to cardio.

407
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,603
Okay, then those
are our common links.

408
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,301
We need to put the ED
on full diversion

409
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:23,433
and lockdown cardiology
and radiology.

410
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,870
We have to test
every square inch.

411
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,960
Don't we need the medical
director to authorize that?

412
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:31,659
Well, when she returns, you
can tell her to give me a ring.

413
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:33,617
Okay, guys, let's go.

414
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:41,364
So you're telling me
the strongest antibacterial

415
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:42,539
the CDC has won't work?

416
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,628
It doesn't even make a dent.

417
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:47,283
Well, then we need to think
of something else, and fast.

418
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,068
Our supplies are pushed
to the brink.

419
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,766
I mean, the ward you just put
me in charge of is almost full.

420
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,637
Okay, what about something
other than antibiotics,

421
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:54,899
like phage therapy.

422
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,640
I've already tried it.

423
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:58,294
Nothing in the phage trials
works on this train.

424
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:01,384
Immunotherapeutics,
like pegfilgrastim?

425
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:05,084
Or heavy doses of probiotics
for microbiota modulation?

426
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,868
They're good as
preventative measures,

427
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:10,567
but it's too late
to help those already infected.

428
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,746
What about CRISPR?

429
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,270
We could alter the Cas9 enzyme

430
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:20,360
and turn the KPC gene function
against itself.

431
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:21,883
Possibly.

432
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:26,583
It's experimental and time
consuming, but it could work.

433
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:28,455
Let's do it.

434
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,413
Can you believe this, Thora?

435
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:31,980
You believe what this kid
puts us through?

00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,895
Don't yell at him.
I'm not going to yell at him.

00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:39,074
He's gonna know I'm over this.
Okay, okay.

438
