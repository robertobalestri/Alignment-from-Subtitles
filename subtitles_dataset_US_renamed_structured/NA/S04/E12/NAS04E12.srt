1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,339
Well, I did it for love.

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,341
I left behind a dream job

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,094
and, uh, 7-Elevens, the Yankees...
the things we do, right?

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:15,223
But really, living in London has just
been the absolute best, truly.

5
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,683
That's great to hear, Dr. Goodwin.

6
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,562
And I just got my medical license
in the UK.

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,480
Not in the US. Had that one already.

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,984
So I'm ready to go back to work.
You just say the word.

9
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,861
We're looking for a urologist.

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,530
Not the word I was hoping for.

11
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,701
Get your head in the game. Okay. Okay.

12
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,370
Tell me about your most recent employment.

13
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,913
NHS Hampstead.

14
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,832
Ah, yes. Uh, in what capacity?

15
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,668
-Receptionist.
-Receptionist?

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,795
-Mm-hm.
-And the reason you left?

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,881
[nervous chuckle] Kind of a funny story.

18
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:53,052
I got fired, uh, by my girlfriend
for starting an insurrection.

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,180
That sounds worse than it is. [chuckles]

20
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,599
[whispers] Here we go. Hot

21
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,269
For six years where I specialized
in the study of infectious diseases.

22
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,938
That is one incredible CV, Dr. Goodwin.

23
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,358
Well, those are just the highlights.
The full reel would knock your socks off.

24
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,569
-Well, you certainly are qualified.
-Thank you.

25
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,821
One might say overly qualified.

26
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,282
Really? Who would say that?
Uh, I would not say that.

27
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,576
I would say I'm just exactly...
[clicks tongue]

28
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,952
the right level of qualified.

29
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:22,540
Hiring someone who could so easily replace
me doesn't sound like the wisest of ideas.

30
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:28,713
And before that, you were medical director
of New Amsterdam in New York City.

31
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,465
Perhaps you should have led with that.

32
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,217
I, uh... [chuckles]

33
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,176
Note taken.

34
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,513
May we reach out
to the current medical director,

35
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,557
Veronica Fuentes, for a reference?

36
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,184
I'd really rather you didn't.

37
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,102
It's going to work out.

38
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,900
Look, I know there are a million reasons
not to hire me, but... but I need this.

39
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,026
I mean, I love this.

40
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,696
This is what I was trained to do,
provide care, healing, helping people.

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,116
I don't care if I have to see patients
in some back alley...

42
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,119
I will do it. I... I just...
I'm begging you.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,995
Please...

44
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,791
just... put me back to work.

45
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,376
-It's a no.
-No.

46
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,586
Apologies... but no.

47
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,755
We just don't have a position for you,

48
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,716
but I have no doubt
you'll land someplace wonderful.

49
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,927
-It's a no.
-No.

50
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,387
[all] No. [echoing]

51
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,854
{\an8}How is she? Is she still spotting?

52
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,649
{\an8}All good there, but, you know,
being on bed rest for 23 hours a day

53
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:33,611
{\an8}-is working her last nerve, as am I.
-I guess we're both in the doghouse.

54
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,699
{\an8}Yeah. But, hey, thanks for covering
for me, man. I got a few job interviews.

55
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,993
{\an8}-If she needs anything--
-Of course, I'm happy to help.

56
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,661
{\an8}Okay. All right. Yeah.

57
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,414
{\an8}-Just... excuse... Thanks.
-Sorry. Yes. Right.

58
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,291
{\an8}Hey, uh, Floyd, um...

59
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,126
{\an8}So, do... [sighs]

60
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,837
{\an8}Do you know your way around?

61
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,965
{\an8}No. No, no, no.
I've... I've never been inside... here.

62
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,634
{\an8}-I... haven't been anywhere.
-Okay.

63
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,263
{\an8}Okay, um... bedroom's upstairs.

64
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,932
{\an8}-Right.
-Okay. Uh... Yeah.

65
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,442
{\an8}The lab called. They want
all blood cultures sent in duplicate.

66
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:17,155
{\an8}Also, for the love of God,
please stop ordering SED rates.

67
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,823
{\an8}[background chatter]

68
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:19,782
And, uh...

69
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:25,079
{\an8}obviously, uh, Dr. Shinwari dropped out
of the residency program,

70
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,333
{\an8}but she failed to fill out
some exit paperwork

71
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,711
{\an8}and she didn't leave
any forwarding information.

72
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,591
{\an8}Somebody here must know
where she is, right?

73
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,263
{\an8}It's for official paperwork, okay?

74
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,516
{\an8}You wouldn't be betraying any trust,
or anything like that.

75
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,397
{\an8}Look, I know that one of you
knows where she is, okay? So just--

00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,071
Hit his head on the stairs
at Madison Square Garden.

79
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,948
All right.
Uh, let's get him to trauma one.

80
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,618
Secondary survey, clear his spine.
Order a head CT. You know the drill.

[PA announcement]
<i>Dr. Singh to radiology lab.</i>

82
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,378
No, it's personal.

83
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,464
And I'm only here
in a professional capacity.

84
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,014
Okay. Maybe I will tell you
after our insurrectionist meeting,

85
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,976
which, by the way,
is highly unprofessional.

86
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,310
Hi.

87
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,437
-Oh! Hi.
-Hi.

88
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,023
What are you doing here?

89
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,611
-Nothing.
-Nothing. I like to come here and think.

90
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,072
I get that. Dead bodies are pretty quiet.

91
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,991
Although if you listen
with your root chakra,

92
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,742
you can hear them from the other side.

93
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:46,953
Uh...

94
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,371
It's a joke.

95
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,290
[laughs] I'm not crazy, remember?

96
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,876
Right. Totally.
So, uh, you were looking for me.

97
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,587
[Mia] Yes. Veronica placed me
in the oncology department.

98
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,881
So I wanted to reach out and connect.

99
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,842
[Ben] She did? Why?

100
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,844
Well, my work can be very helpful
with patients

101
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:07,056
who are going through chemo and radiation
and, you know, we're both new here.

102
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,475
-So I thought we could work together.
-Mm.

103
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,311
Show each other
where the bodies are buried.

104
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,896
Pun intended.

105
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,189
Mm.

106
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,607
[Ben] And accomplished.

107
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,693
Uh, so I guess I'll see you around.

108
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,028
-Great.
-[Wilder] Mm.

109
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,963
Are your sessions
always this action-packed?

110
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,090
No, this one's the wildest.

111
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,468
Well, like I've said,
this is your time, so...

112
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,761
Pssh. Not really.

113
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,764
These check-ins are mandated
by the higher-ups, aren't they?

114
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,974
Yeah. That's right, so I'll be checking in

115
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,393
with all of your coworkers
over the course of the year.

116
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,312
Job's fine. Marriage is fine.

117
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,230
You don't want to be
doing better than fine?

118
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,859
Well, at the end of a shift,
I'm too tired for much excitement.

119
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,236
What's that look like? The fatigue.

120
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,446
Tell me about that.

121
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,115
I lie down on the couch,
grab a couple cold ones,

122
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,366
turn the TV on.

123
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,952
My wife asks me questions about my day,

124
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,913
which I don't want to talk about.

125
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,582
She gets mad. I get defensive.

126
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,250
Typical marriage, right?

127
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,003
But you used to interact more,
right, with your wife?

128
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:21,839
Why'd you stop?

129
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,969
Like I said, I'm tired.

130
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,846
When did this start?

131

[phone buzzes]

132
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,060
Time to go to work.

133
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,978
-Great talk.
-Yeah. Okay.

134
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,897
Now, remember, as per your employer,

135
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,108
I will be observing you
for the rest of the day, so...

136
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,027
Yeah.

Mr. Jerrino. Hi, I'm Dr. Bloom.

140
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,589
You're at New Amsterdam Hospital.

141
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,842
You remember hitting your head?

142
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,926
Who won the game?

143
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,930
-Excuse me?
-Knicks. Who won?

144
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,891
Oh, uh, I don't know.
I can ask around later.

145
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,437
Can you check, please? Now?
It's really important, super important.

146
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,022
I was wearing my lucky jersey.
We were up by ten and I think--

147
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,733
-Okay. Okay.
-Oh, wait. Where is my jersey?

148
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,403
Uh, all your belongings are in that bag
at the foot of the bed.

149
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:29,574
Thank God. Some people think it's trashy
'cause I only wash it when they win.

150
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,578
Like a cleanse, you know,
but it's getting kind of...

151
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,831
99-96. Knicks lost.

152
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,083
-No, impossible. Can I see?
-Yeah.

153
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,670
Damn it! They blew it.

154
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,631
No D. They threw it away.

I can't...

162
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,689
I can't get enough air.

00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,586
-No cancellations.
-...to pick one.

171
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,088
-See you in four weeks. Just hold tight.
-Anyways, I'll, uh,

172
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,634
-wait around for a little bit and, uh...
-[man] How do you reckon I'll get around?

173
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,887
-If you're, uh, too busy, I'll just, um...
-[arguing in background]

174
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,555
I'll see you at home. Love you.

175
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,183
[man] ...unscrew me leg, then,
and leave it here?

176
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,936
-It's not doing me any good.
-We'll see you in a month, Mr. Chiltern.

177
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,104
-What's that?
-Some information.

178
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,856
Number 37.

179
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,405
Uh, Mr. Chiltern,

180
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,116
I'm Dr. Max Goodwin.

181
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,577
How can I help?

182
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,751
Médecins Sans Frontières
on the Afghan border? Oh my gosh.

183
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,670
What a powerful experience
that must have been.

184
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,882
It got me to understand how much
we doctors can do with very few resources.

185
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,467
I know Hampstead's on a slim budget,

186
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,761
but there's so much to be done
with what's at hand.

187
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,055
I couldn't agree more. When
I became medical director,

188
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,099
I had this overwhelming responsibility

189
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,935
that I had to impart
the best of myself to this institution,

190
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:25,064
knowing that it was a direct reflection
of me, of my values, my principles.

191
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,857
"Do not follow where the path may lead.

192
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,318
Go instead where there is no path
and leave a trail."

193
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,611
Emerson.

194
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,530
It was a pleasure meeting you, Dr. Sharpe.

195
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,282
Likewise, Dr. Vaishya.

196
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,538
I think I just found my number two!

197
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,707
Ah. He's lovely, I'm sure.

198
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,835
He's devoted his life to those in need
and he quoted Emerson.

199
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,754
-Now, if that's not sign--
-I'm not sure how things are in America,

200
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,258
but we don't see many female hospital
directors in our corner of the world.

201
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,429
-Go on.
-You've been given the rare opportunity

202
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,181
to really start changing
the face of the NHS.

203
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,643
A female deputy could pay dividends
for generations to come.

204
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,062
Otherwise,
who's going to train the next you?

205
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,108
Right. I hadn't thought of it that way.

206
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,444
Hiring a woman
could be a shot across the bow,

207
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,321
but it's your decision, of course.

208
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,491
[exhales]

209
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,328
[Max] Hm. Well, that is a nasty bump.

210
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,122
Yeah, I could've told you that.
Don't make you a doctor,

211
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,416
-does it, mate? Ow! Ow!
-Let's see here.

212
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,712
Sorry. Uh, this is osteoarthritis.

213
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,589
That doesn't sound good.

214
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,342
Well, it's not that bad.
I can get a needle, drain this fluid,

215
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,553
and the swelling should go down
and you should feel better immediately.

216
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,765
You sure you're actually a doctor?

217
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,642
Actually, I, uh...

218
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,145
used to run
America's oldest public hospital.

219
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,605
[laughs]

220
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,981
Yeah, sure you did.

221
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,526
Yeah. So, uh, you stay here

222
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,488
and, uh, I'm going to grab
some medical supplies. I'll be right back.

223
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,579
[clears throat]

224
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,164
Hey, Priscilla.

225
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,418
Hi there. I was out getting
some snacks for my beloved.

226
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,670
I thought you might like one.

227
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,880
What a prince.
I'll give it to her straightaway.

228
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,717
You know what? I was actually thinking
I might give it to her myself.

229
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,344
-Sure. Yeah, of course.
-Is that okay?

230
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,888
-Awesome. Nice to see you. You look great.
-You too. Thank you.

231
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,765
[chuckles]

232
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,163
[PA announcement]
<i>On call pediatric nurse, station five.</i>

233
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,125
<i>On call pediatric nurse, station five.</i>

234
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,128
What the hell happened to me?

235
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,214
-[Lauren] You had a heart attack.
-Full on?

236
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,217
And then some.
A stress-induced cardiomyopathy,

237
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,344
which has left you
with an aortic aneurysm.

238
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,431
[tuts] You kidding?
My dad runs marathons every year.

239
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,808
My grandpa's still kicking at 93.

240
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,936
Well, you... you've got an aneurysm
that could blow at any minute.

241
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,148
Look, cardiology's going
to come down here for a consult,

242
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,734
but I'm pretty sure they're going
to recommend open-heart surgery.

243
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,488
I... I don't get it.
I take good care of myself.

244
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,241
I drink smoothies every morning
with real kale.

245
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,326
I go on hour-long walks.

246
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,455
-I eat good.
-Well, how long you been a Knicks fan?

247
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,747
I never wasn't one. Why?

248
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,960
Okay. Well, according to this ultrasound,
you got the heart of an 80 year old.

249
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,172
That's stress, adrenaline,
fluctuating heart rate

250
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,258
-based on who wins and who loses.
-What are you trying to say, Doc?

251
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,677
Nico,
the Knicks are literally killing you.

252
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,847
[laughs]

253
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,269
[Ben] Willow, thanks for coming.
Can I get you anything?

254
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,480
Yeah, less cancer would be great.

255
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,609
[Ben]
That's what all we're all hoping for.

256
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,404
Now, you have lost a few pounds
since your appointment a few weeks ago.

257
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,824
My high school self
would be jumping for joy.

258
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,202
[Ben] How's your appetite?

259
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,914
Nothing looks good or smells good.

260
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:13,459
Just talking about my appetite
is making me feel sick.

261
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,086
So let's just not, okay?

262
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,718
Willow, many patients who are in remission

263
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:27,640
and have a recurrence feel angry, anxious.

264
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:33,187
But this regimen,
etoposide, cisplatin, cytarabine,

265
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,605
is still your best shot.

266
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,316
But I am concerned about the side effects.

267
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,692
Yeah, me too.

268
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,363
But I have an idea how to fix them.

269
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,490
That's wonderful.

270
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,451
I want to stop all the treatment.

271
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,578
I give up.

272
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,040
No, wait.

273
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,338
Don't go in my head. Get out. Get out.

274
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,800
[Aya] Hey, lady, you can't be here.
This is a place of business.

275
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,346
You think I don't know what you want?
[chuckles] I know.

276
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,973
You're trying to hide in the internet,

277
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,393
but I get a special text
when you're trying to find me.

278
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,061
Yep. Yep. Sure. Sure.

279
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,730
All right. Move it along. Move it along!

280
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,857
Don't you touch me. Get away from me.

281
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,529
Ma'am, I'm going to repeat this, okay?
You need to move now.

282
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,657
-[woman] Get away from me!
-Okay. You know what? You were warned.

283
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,201
You're moving... now! Let's go.

284
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,079
-Let's go. Don't fight me.
-[woman mumbling]

285
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,998
[Aya] There you go. Okay?

286
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,250
[woman laughs]

287
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,297
[woman] Watch out.
There’s always cops there!

288
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,594
[sighs]

289
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,679
As exciting as it looks in the movies...

290
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,764
-Yeah.
-[woman] You can't just stand there!

291
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:55,853
So, um, I think I know why
you're so tired all the time.

292
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,730
What are you talking about?

293
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,650
Aya, I believe
you are suffering from PTSD.

294
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,485
[woman] Yeah, I got a table!

295
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,751
I'll admit, I was so excited to learn
that you were also at Cambridge.

296
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,461
I can't believe I just missed you.

297
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,546
I know. And reestablishing our ties

298
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,798
with the university
is going to be a coup for Hampstead.

299
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,760
And having you as a mentor
would be life-altering.

300
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,430
Well... [chuckles] it was such a pleasure
to meet you, Dr. Stewart.

301
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,723
-I'll be in touch.
-Sure.

302
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,724
Thank you.

303
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,602
-Can you sign these?
-Yeah, of course.

304
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,732
I think I just found my number two,
very exciting, a powerful woman.

305
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,985
Just thinking about
Hampstead's Muslim population.

306
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,071
-Okay.
-It's big and growing.

307
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,032
Why not have more clinic staff
that looks like our patients?

308
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,576
Well, I come from
a Muslim background myself.

309
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,870
You do?
You never mentioned it on television.

310
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,040
-Well, I meant my father was.
-That's okay.

311
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,917
It's not front and center for you.

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,835
But for many of our patients, it is.

313
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,089
And statistically, being treated
by physicians who look like you

314
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,925
and understands where you're coming from,
leads to better outcomes.

315
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:12,137
-Uh, yes. That's absolutely true.
-I know you'll make the right decision.

316
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,180
You always do.

317
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,896
You done yet? Can I look now?

318
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,564
Uh... not just yet.

319
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,318
I am repositioning

320
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,237
so I can draw the fluid out.

321
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,239
I don't want to know the details, man.

322
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,323
-Right.
-Needles.

323
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:35,661
Of course. So, um,
how long have you been driving a cab?

324
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,415
Oh, since I was 18,
I was one of the knowledge boys.

325
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,127
Memorized the blue book
till I knew this city inside out.

326
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,086
Hm.

327
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:48,007
Always knew this is where
I wanted to be... behind a wheel.

328
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,510
Never wanted to do anything else.
Do you believe that?

329
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,678
Mm.

330
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,682
I cannot imagine
not being able to drive anymore.

331
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,726
I know the feeling.

332
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:04,148
All right.
Let's not, uh, stop the meter just yet.

333
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,735
Oh, King Ada!
Mate, that needle really hurts.

334
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,903
No, that's not the needle.
That's something else.

335
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,447
Oh, easy, tiger. Easy.

336
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,869
Have you been doing work on your knees,
sanding floors or things like that?

337
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,079
-Lino.
-Lino?

338
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,330
Linoleum?

339
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah. Just done my daughter's flat.
How do you know?

340
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:27,796
I think the lino work has created a new
effusion here just above the kneecap.

341
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,007
Well, I'm glad I kept
that appointment for next month.

342
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,718
No need to wait a month. I can fix it
right now. Let's see your hand.

343
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,261
Just put some pressure right here

344
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,805
and I'll be back.
I'm going to grab one more thing.

345
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,896
Hey there.

346
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,901
The only thing that woman
loves more than surprises is biscuits.

347
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:52,196
Honestly, you and Dr. Sharpe
are adorable. Off you go.

348
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,155
Okay.

349
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,377
Nico, I got great news.

350
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:11,090
-KD blew out his knee?
-No, I got you a spot.

351
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,759
The OR miraculously carved out
a spot for your heart surgery.

352
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,885
So we're good to go.

353
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,971
I got to push it a day.
My guy's got a game. It's a can't-miss.

354
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,849
Okay, Nico,
your surgery is the can't-miss.

355
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,601
Can I wear my lucky jersey?

356
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,521
No. They're going to cut open your chest.

357
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,774
Then no can do.
My guys need me, Dr. Bloom.

358
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,278
Nico, listen to me, okay?
You're going to die.

359
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,074
How are the Knicks losing again
more important than your life?

360
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,035
They are my life.

361
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,374
Look, I don't have a girlfriend.

362
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,626
I don't have a job I love.

363
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,294
I don't have...

364
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:52,923
a lot.

365
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,092
But these games...

366
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,595
the past games, the draft,

367
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,598
the die-hards like me...

368
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,643
they're my everything.

369
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,646
[PA announcement]
<i>Environmental services worker up front.</i>

<i>Environmental services worker</i>
<i>to admitting.</i>

371
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,983
I think I have a solution...

372
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,193
and I hate it.

373
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,029
[siren wailing distantly]

374
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,258
Floyd?

375
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,845
You're awake.

376
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,472
And you're in my kitchen.

377
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,850
Where's Claude?

378
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,603
Well, he had a few interviews
he couldn't postpone,

379
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,148
so he asked me to look after you.

380
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,233
Tag teaming?

381
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,153
Mm. I prefer not to call it that.

382
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,324
You hungry?

383
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,617
Yes. I'm starving.

384
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,204
I'm craving those pierogies
on the Lower East side.

385
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,163
Yeah.

386
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,832
But soup works for now.

387
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,293
Okay. I'll make you some.

388
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,469
Going through pictures?

389
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,804
You guys look so young.

390
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,514
We were.

391
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,518
And happy.

392
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,065
We were.

393
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,530
[phone buzzes]

394
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,245
It's the hospital.

395
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,165
Oh, go. Go, go, go.
I'll... I'll be fine by myself.

396
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:51,875
Yeah?

397
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,378
[sighs]

398
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,635
[sighs softly]

399
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,353
[Ben] Thank you for waiting.

400
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,773
I would eventually like to go home.

401
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,527
[Ben] I want to propose
an experimental surgery.

402
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,531
It's shown promise in several trials
and I can apply for compassionate use.

403
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,827
It is not without risk,
but we can get the cancer out in one go.

404
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,162
Am I supposed to light up at this news?

405
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,918
[Ben] Let me send you home with
some information about the trials. Okay?

406
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,799
Take your time. Think about it.

407
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,010
If you have any questions, I am here.

408
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,970
I don't need to think about it.

409
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,305
The answer's no.

410
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,724
[Ben] It's a big decision, Willow.

411
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,560
-We can talk about this tomorrow.
-I don't want to talk to you.

412
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,770
I want to talk to Dr. Sharpe.

413
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,524
[Ben] I am sorry, Willow.
I know that these transitions--

414
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,777
Transitions? This is my life.

415
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,531
I don't know you and I don't trust you.

416
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,909
Can I go now?

417
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,334
I'm not remembering some, like, trauma.

418
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,794
No. People with PTSD
aren't remembering trauma.

419
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,254
They're re-experiencing it.

420
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,007
They're responding to stimulus
from an event in the past,

421
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,717
not from what's happening
in front of them.

422
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,761
Today on the streets
with that homeless woman,

423
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,430
you were responding to something
that wasn't there.

424
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,059
What I was responding to was
a screaming nut case in front of me.

425
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,270
-Well, why'd you raise your voice?
--Because she was screaming.

426
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,564
Yeah. At the visions in her head,
not at you.

427
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,442
She barely even looked at you
and then you... and then you grabbed her.

428
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,277
You went straight to physical force

429
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,446
with a person
who wasn't displaying any violence,

430
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,365
who may not have even been
aware you were there. Why?

431
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,951
You know how many reprimands
I've gotten for undue force?

432
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,704
Zero. So you saying
I'm out here being cruel?

433
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,999
-I didn't say cruel.
-Subconsciously freaking out or whatever.

434
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,668
You're wrong.
I do what I was trained to do.

435
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,129
What you saw, that wasn't trauma.

436
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,300
That wasn't even intense.
That was a normal day.

437
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,513
You're sweating a lot for someone
who just went through normal.

438
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,807
How long you had the towel?

439
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,434
Colombo with the towel over here.

440
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,894
How about cold ones?

441
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:19,272
-How many do you drink on the couch?
-Oh my God.

442
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,025
You're not drinking to relax.
You're drinking to suppress.

443
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:22,984
Tell me I'm wrong.

444
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,154
Leave it alone.

445
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,114
I can't.

446
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,827
Whatever it is that you are suppressing
has made you aggressive.

447
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,121
That means we're not just talking
about your marriage.

448
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,331
In your line of work,
people could get killed.

You want to see me at work, get in.

452
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:56,351
When I saw way too many people that looked
like my parents, cousins and aunties

453
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,103
coming through the hospital doors

454
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,939
with chronic illnesses
too late for us to treat,

455
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,816
I knew I needed to change that.

456
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,818
So I began Healthy Habibi.

457
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,572
It's part pop-up clinic,
part lively street team.

458
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:12,117
We've been able to create some successful
preventative medicine initiatives

459
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,535
all around Hampstead.

460
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,745
Oh my God. You're fantastic.

461
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,416
I'm sorry. Is that a bad thing?

462
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,544
No, no, of course it's not.

463
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,421
It's just I have, um...

464
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,633
I have a tough and impossible
and debilitating decision to make

465
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,677
and you are so incredible.

466
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,387
You've just made it even harder.

467
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,599
Honestly, I'm at a complete loss.

468
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,103
-I shouldn't burden you with any of this--
-[knocking]

469
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,021
Yep.

470
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,566
Sorry to bother, ma'am, but I caught
this one trying to steal medical supplies.

471
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,483
Hey, babe.

472
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,077
Hey, thanks for coming out
on your day off.

473
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:01,917
Well, I spent the day trying and failing
to take care of my pregnant girlfriend

474
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,878
at the behest of her husband
in their house.

475
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:09,633
You know, I marvel at how quickly
your life became this fascinating.

476
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,509
Know what? I'm nowhere in there.

477
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,929
But why should I be?

478
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,098
It's not like they're going to add
a picture of me to the bookshelf,

479
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,392
especially when I'm making
everything more complicated.

480
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,686
All right. You signed up for this. Yeah?

481
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,438
Yeah.

482
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:27,150
Well, then quit being so passive.
I mean, show her you care.

483
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,694
You got to get in the game,
make some plays.

484
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,821
Not for Baptiste, but for you.

485
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,449
It's the only way
you're going to stay in this.

486
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,452
Uh, what... What the hell is this?

487
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,996
[sighs] You think you got a secret?

488
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:45,669
If anybody finds out about this,
I am going to kill you with my bare hands.

489
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,546
Okay.

490
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,267
I'd like to press charges for kidnapping.

491
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,060
Okay. I'll let Dr. Wilder know.

492
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,271
You know where she's taking me?

493
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,816
I do and, uh,
I have to say I'm a little surprised.

494
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,789
Willow, this is Dr. Mia Castries.
She's the chair of Holistic Medicine.

495
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,958
Hi, Willow. It's nice to meet you.

496
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,584
Where are the wind chimes?

497
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,005
My bamboo chimes are at home,
but I appreciate the humor.

498
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,966
I'm here all week. Maybe.

499
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,805
[Ben] I need to give you a reason
to trust me.

500
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:43,226
I don't know Dr. Castries,
but she comes highly recommended.

501
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:48,398
I don't trust Dr. Castries
because I don't give away my trust easily.

502
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,774
Does that sound familiar?

503
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,571
But I am willing to put all that aside
if she can help you.

504
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,072
Will you let her try?

505
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,582
Hi. Okay.

506
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,543
Can I take your hand?

507
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:11,463
Okay.

508
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,593
Okay. This is called acupressure.

509
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,970
It's noninvasive.

510
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,930
It's what we call good touch.

511
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,226
This is pressure point P6.

512
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,814
Its meridian pathway travels up your arm
into your chest, into your upper abdomen.

513
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,068
It's okay if it's a little bit achy,
but it shouldn't be painful.

514
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,153
It's... not.

515
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:40,492
Okay. So I'm going to take your other hand
and I need you to do one thing for me.

516
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,414
Can you say, "I accept healing touch"?

517
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,749
With a straight face?

518
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,710
Energetically speaking,
that is not required.

519
00:27:55,882 --> 00:28:00,011
I accept... healing touch.

520
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:03,890
I...

521
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:09,145
accept... healing touch.

522
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,526
[emotionally] I accept...

523
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,320
healing touch.

524
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,991
I accept. [sobs softly]

525
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,954
What are you feeling?

526
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,916
Extremely self-conscious.

527
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,794
Anything else?

528
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,133
Hunger.

529
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,635
[nervous chuckle]

530
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,729
-[man 1] I'm not going nowhere!
-[man 2] Get the hell out of here!

531
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,439
-Stay in the car.
-[cop] Get back inside!

532
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,316
-[man 2] He's costing me customers!
-[cop] Sir, inside now!

533
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,860
[man 1] Get away from me!

534
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,155
-[Aya] Hey, hey, anyone get hurt?
-Guy's a live wire.

535
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,656
-[Aya] Sir. Look at me.
-Back off!

536
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,616
[Aya] I don't want
any more trouble out of you.

537
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,328
I'm not telling you again. You're going
to move your ass down the street.

538
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,789
You want us to take you in? Move it along.

539
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,791
In three, two...

540
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,628
Hey, don't even think about it!
Hands where I can see 'em!

541
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,339
-[Iggy] Hey, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[murmuring]

542
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,799
Dr. Frome, get back in the car.

543
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,469
-Get away from me, man!
-What the hell you doing?

544
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,137
-Get back in the car.
-I will. I will.

545
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,347
One sec.
I just want to talk to our friend here.

546
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:31,394
Leave me alone! All of you!
You and you and you!

547
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,396
Can we please have him carted off?

548
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,900
Please, please, please.
I just want to talk.

549
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,819
Can we do that for a sec?
That's all I want to do.

550
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,989
I'm... I'm Iggy, by the way.
It's nice to meet you.

551
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,741
What's your name again?

552
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,951
Erman.

553
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,245
[Iggy] Erman. It's a solid name.

554
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,372
Love that name.

555
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,834
So what Erman and I
can agree on here is that

556
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,171
when, uh, you're having a day like today,
raising your voice

557
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,507
is kind like the worst thing
we can do, right?

558
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,426
No one likes raised voices,
do they, Erman?

559
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,303
-[Erman] No.
-[Iggy] No.

560
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,471
[Erman] No.

561
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,182
But you do... you do like it here, right?

562
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,309
I mean, you chose this spot
for a particular reason.

563
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,895
I'm assuming
it wasn't the bistro lighting.

564
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,772
It's cold.

565
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,817
The heat lamps. Yeah.
It's cold out here, huh?

566
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,861
-Yeah.
-What about a, uh, a hot coffee?

567
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,240
Erman, you want a hot cup of joe?
Can I get you that?

568
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,117
Can we make that happen?
Can we get a cup of coffee?

569
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,245
-Now you want me to give you coffee?
-I'll cover it.

570
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,206
Thank you. It's on me. Okay, Erman?

571
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,042
Things are... confusing.

572
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,962
[Iggy] Yeah. I bet. It's scary.

573
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,466
Hey, Erman. There's a church up the block
with a heater in the back.

574
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,009
Did you know that?

575
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:48,680
-You got to push me away?
-No, no, no. Not pushing. Just helping.

576
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,348
Just helping.

577
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:54,435
-This ain't yours and it ain't his!
-No, of course not.

578
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,896
It's just a lot quieter there. Okay?

579
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,356
And between you and me, the, uh,

580
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,609
the coffee at the church
is better than the stuff they serve here,

581
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,862
but that's our little secret, all right?
Thank you.

582
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,822
Here you go.

583
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,824
But, you know,
things are going to get better.

584
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,076
Okay? I promise you.

585
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,498
-Come on. Let's walk.
-[murmuring]

586
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,958
[distant siren wails]

587
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,046
-[woman] Let 'em through.
-[indistinct chatter]

588
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,477
[Iggy] Hey.

589
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,896
Hey.

590
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,273
-Do you mind?
-No.

591
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,858
Thank you.

592
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,278
Yeah. Good old St. Joe's.

593
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,865
They allow the unhoused
to hang out out back.

594
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,910
I wish I could say
Erman's situation was okay,

595
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,579
but at least he's not in danger, you know?

596
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,750
-That's good.
-Mm-hm.

597
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,418
Yeah, it is.

598
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,589
[sighs]

599
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,299
Last year, um...

600
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,511
I had a terrible call.

601
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,931
Kid getting beaten.

602
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,518
We're supposed to compartmentalize.

603
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,813
Anyway, another call comes in.

604
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,025
Garden-variety
street crazy causing a scene.

605
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,194
I go to move her,

606
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,989
but when I touch her, she freaks out.

607
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,742
She fights back. She's scared.

608
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,621
And I'm doing this hold we learn.

609
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,209
It's what we're supposed to do
to minimize the danger.

610
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,712
But this hold they teach us...

611
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,549
it's so easy to just...

612
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,260
crack their shoulder.

613
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,348
And I did.

614
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,309
She starts screaming.

615
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,896
It was so messed up...

616
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,651
'cause I didn't feel sorry for her,
or regret...

617
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,863
or anything like a decent human being.

618
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:16,035
I fractured her shoulder in three places
and all I felt was...

619
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,871
-Angry.
-Yeah.

620
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:26,587
You know, people with PTSD,
they often freeze out the ones they love.

621
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,299
It's like with you and your wife.

622
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,095
You pull back
because you're afraid if you don't,

623
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,514
she's going to see that you're bad person.

624
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,560
But that's not the truth.
You're not a bad person.

625
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,022
You said it yourself.
You're doing your job.

626
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,065
You're doing what you're supposed to do.

627
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,527
But officers are not equipped

628
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,364
to handle a mentally unstable person
who isn't committing a crime.

629
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,825
That's not your job. That's my job.

630
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,327
That's a social worker's job.

631
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,455
What about the next time?

632
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:06,294
Well, I teach doctors and nurses
how to deescalate psychosis all the time.

633
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,463
I'd be more than happy to teach you.

634
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,422
[sighs]

635
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,966
Everything I do has to be sanctioned,

636
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,679
approved by the committee,
union reps, training.

637
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:20,016
There's no going rogue even if it helps.

638
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,979
Well, then,
maybe I'll just have to make it official.

639
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,940
Teach the whole NYPD?

640
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,234
Heck, yeah. Why not?

641
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,403
That's crazy.

642
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,656
Okay. But we don't use that word anymore.

643
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,869
Bananas. I will accept bananas.

644
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:40,870
[chuckling]

645
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,497
-All right.
-All right?

646
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,790
That's bananas.

647
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,420
-How's that feel?
-It's a world of difference.

648
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,090
You are legitimate then, eh?

649
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,843
-On my better days.
-Well, I'll wager this is one of 'em.

650
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,515
-Thanks, Doc.
-Yeah.

651
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,725
Hey, I didn't even get your first name.

652
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,852
-Sid.
-Max.

653
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,229
Be good.

654
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,276
It's a bit smaller than New Amsterdam,
but at least it's outdoors.

655
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,908
No one would hire me.

656
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,286
And I... just wanted to feel useful.

657
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,626
I thought you said that
the interviews were going well.

658
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,002
Yeah, I did say that,

659
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,088
-but I was lying to you.
-Hm.

660
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,924
I was either overqualified
or underqualified,

661
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,469
or just the right qualified
with the wrong references.

662
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,722
Oh, you'll find the right spot.
I know you will.

663
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,393
-That makes one of us. How's your day?
-It's not much better.

664
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,352
-No?
-No.

665
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,437
-Interviews no good?
-Quite the opposite.

666
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:52,942
The candidates are remarkable,
but they're just somehow not quite enough.

667
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,528
Every community needs representation,

668
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,447
and hiring one
means eliminating the other.

669
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,409
So it looks like whoever I hire,

670
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,578
I'm going to be letting down
some part of this place.

671
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,746
-Hm.
-Some part of myself.

672
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,957
Shame you can't just hire another you.

673
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,337
Oh wait. That's brilliant.

674
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,214
-What?
-Thank you. [giggles]

675
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,884
Of course. Uh, glad I could help...

676
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,387
[PA announcement]
<i>Transport team to unit 7B.</i>

677
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,848
<i>Transport team to unit 7B.</i>

678
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,434
Dr. Bloom?

679
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,855
-[Lauren] Yeah, I'm right here.
-Yeah. How did it go?

680
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,358
Okay. So there were some complications
with your procedure,

681
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,819
-but Dr. Reynolds and his team--
-I meant the game.

682
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,863
Did we win?

683
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,657
-Nico--
-Just lay it on me, Doc.

684
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,328
-They got slaughtered.
-Ah! [groans]

685
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,079
-Total blowout.
-[grunts]

686
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,707
And you wore the jersey.

687
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,462
Nico, I just told you that you almost died
and you're asking me about a jersey.

688
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,421
Why?

689
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,506
Because I'm a Knicks fan.

690
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,050
Because you're an addict.

691
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,093
-[snorts]
-What?

692
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:05,223
The very definition of addiction
is the compulsive engagement

693
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,434
in rewarding stimuli
despite adverse consequences.

694
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,687
Tell me, which part doesn't apply to you?
Your body is screaming at you

695
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,148
that your engagement with the Knicks
isn't healthy

696
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,858
and you're just not listening.

697
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,362
I did wear the jersey, okay?

698
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,823
But if I'm being honest,
I kind of wish I hadn't.

699
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,746
I need more calm in my life.

700
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:30,873
Yeah. I'll say.

701
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,834
Less anticipation of failure.

702
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,169
Exactly.

703
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,424
No more obsessing over the Knicks.

704
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:44,887
Good.

705
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,934
Well, because baseball's
starting up spring training.

706
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,686
Nico, come on.

707
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,480
Let's go, Mets. Let's go, Mets.

708
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,564
You best be kidding.

709
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,150
I'm not kidding.
I just heard we got Max Scherzer.

710
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,361
I think we'll make the playoffs this year.

711
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,363
[Ben] You did wonders for Willow today.
Thank you.

712
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,449
And if we continue our sessions together,
I can help manage her pain

713
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,159
and her nausea as well.

714
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,955
But if you want to do more
and help more people,

715
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,832
we have a way to do that, but...

716
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,043
Veronica can't know.

717
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,337
Are you in?

718
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,715
Are you asking the holistic doctor

719
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,759
if she'll say yes to
something mysterious and unusual?

720
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,179
-[Ben] Welcome to the resistance.
-Hm.

721
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:37,982
What is this?

722
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,444
-Pierogi Platter from First Avenue Deli.
-Flowers from Sherene's Garden.

723
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,821
[exhales] Uh... [chuckles]

724
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,781
Who sent all this?

725
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,827
[phone rings]

726
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,873
Hey, Floyd. How'd it go?

727
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,916
All good. Yeah.

728
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,878
Um, hey, listen, when you get home

729
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,423
and, uh, Lyn thanks you
for everything you got her,

730
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,967
just... just say you're welcome.

731
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,137
Okay. But wait, I didn't get her anything.

732
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,848
[Floyd]
<i>You have a beautiful home, Claude.</i>

733
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,850
A beautiful life.

734
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,521
Just say you're welcome. Yeah?

[clears throat softly]

737
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,205
Spit it out, Zamaya.

738
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,042
I'm here about a theoretical situation.

739
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,215
I'm listening.

740
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,884
What if a few friends of another friend

741
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,887
were worried about that friend
throwing their future away?

742
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,266
But the friends worried about the other
friend are worried about their futures

743
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,520
due to certain... retribution.

744
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,523
Is she safe?

745
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,360
Is... Is she okay?

746
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,587
As I met with you, Narin,

747
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:28,801
I thought this person really has
something special to offer our community.

748
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,223
And when I met with you, Rahul,
I felt the same thing.

749
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,936
And again, with you, Charmaine.

750
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:45,734
This hospital's second in command,
who might one day be its medical director,

751
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,196
has to represent
our multidimensional community.

752
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,783
So, Charmaine, I'm hiring you.

753
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,869
Thank you. Oh.

754
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,955
And, Narin, I'm hiring you.

755
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,707
Oh, that's wonderful.

756
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,460
-And, Rahul, you're hired too.
-Thank God.

757
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,545
[laughter]

758
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,755
You're all hired. Now, let's get to work.

759
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,466
-Shall we?

-Hey.
-All right?

766
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:28,944
Yeah.

767
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:33,657
So I hope you don't mind,
but, uh, I've told a few mates about you.

768
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,784
-You... you have?
-Yeah.

769
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:39,246
I know it's late, but all these fellas
have got appointments months away

770
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,165
and they all need to keep working.

771
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:45,169
The thing is, we don't know why
you're doing this, but we don't care.

772
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,005
And they don't mind
my little clinic in the alley.

773
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,132
You think they need somewhere posh?

774
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,301
They just need help.

775
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,222
That I can do.

776
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,227
-So this is Ken.
-Hey. Nice to meet you.

777
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,521
-[Sid] Matthew.
-[Max] Hey, pleasure. Hey.

00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,022
-[Sid] Eric.
-Nice to meet you.

00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,441
-Dennis.
-How are you? A pleasure.

00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,236
-[Max] Yeah, we got time for this?
-[Max] Yeah, sure.
