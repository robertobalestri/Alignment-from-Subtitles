1
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:06,223
.

2
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:08,443
One triangle cut
turkey sandwich,

3
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:12,142
no crust coming right up.

4
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:13,361
Strong and black
like your woman.

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,061
Do not distract me from apples.

6
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:20,498
Peeled apples, that's key.

7
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,545
Bread here is going to go on
both sides on the sandwich.

8
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:28,245
OJ in the blue cuppie.
And I got a problem.

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,551
What?
I'm out of sun butter.

10
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,422
Do you happen
to have any soy nut,

11
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,729
almond, oats, anything?
I do not.

12
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:35,165
Da-da?

13
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,080
Would you do me
a favor and just--

14
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:38,516
just do her lunch real quick?
I'll be right back.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,085
Wait. Her lunch?
Yes, yes, of course.

16
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:45,262
Wait, her lunch? I don't--

17
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:48,439
Blue--blue cuppie.

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,098
Come on!

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,586
Ugh!

20
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:07,545
Ooh!

21
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:09,808
Ooh, no--oh, no!

22
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:32,353
Are you trying
to ruin your life?

23
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:34,790
All I did was suggest coffee.

24
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:38,141
With a super-hot
French street artist,

25
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:40,883
who, on at least one occasion,

26
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:42,189
you actually--
Oh, no, no.

27
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:44,234
Bloom, we were
in a relationship,

28
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:47,585
and I cannot believe
I told you that.

29
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:49,283
Well, I guess I just have
one of those faces

30
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,762
where people want
to tell me things.

31
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:55,245
Look, I acknowledge
how kinetic it was between us.

32
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,857
Like this delicious feeling
of butterflies all over my skin

33
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:02,905
whenever he was even
remotely close to me.

34
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:04,254
But we've both moved on.

35
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,778
It's just--it's gonna be nice
to catch up.

36
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:08,389
Over a quick cup of coffee.

37
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:09,607
Yeah,
over a quick cup of coffee.

38
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,131
Okay, look, I get it.

39
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:12,915
In three weeks, your whole life
is gonna be different.

40
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,613
It is completely natural
to have a total breakdown

41
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,528
right about now.
It's only a bit of fun.

42
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:18,834
Besides, he hasn't
even texted back.

43
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:20,183
He--he might not.

44
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:21,489
You know he will.

45
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:25,580
And if you're honest,
you kinda want him to.

46
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:28,191
Look, for your own emotional
safety, across the board,

47
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,280
the best thing to do
is bail, okay?

48
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:34,371
Is that him?

49
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,898
Helen?

50
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:41,944
Sandra Fall.

51
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:44,947
My tenacity knows no bounds.
I will catch up with you.

52
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,644
Um, I know you're not
a political person,

53
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:48,429
but non-politically,
you're on my team.

54
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:49,952
So where is she?
Who?

55
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,476
The monster who gave me this
"to don't" list to stop me

56
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,609
from doing anything remotely
helpful for this hospital.

57
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:55,784
Veronica's at
some conference.

58
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:58,221
Wait, wait,
she's--she's not here?

59
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,831
Mm-hm, and she just
wanted to make sure

60
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:00,832
you don't do anything...

61
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:03,487
Dr. Kao?
Stupid. I tried.

62
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:05,663
Did you still need approval
to change those

63
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:07,926
intake protocols
for dementia patients?

64
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,842
Dr. Fuentes said if I wanted
a yes, I'd have to wait.

65
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:13,671
That's funny because
I'm saying yes right now.

66
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,543
Really?
Oh, yes.

67
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:17,240
It's pretty expensive.

68
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:20,591
Day of yes, Agnes.
Day of yes.

69
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:23,333
Did you ask Dr. Fuentes
for 12 new fetal monitors?

70
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:24,682
I did,
but I haven't heard back yet.

71
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:25,857
Well, you're hearing back
right now

72
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,816
and the answer is yes.

73
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,861
I can't believe you took
the time to read my memo

74
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,602
about compensation
for the night shift workers.

75
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:32,908
I don't even work
the night shift

76
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:34,431
but I just felt moved
to, like, you know--

77
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:35,563
Larry, Larry,
to every single word

78
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,739
of your 42 page memo,
I say yes.

79
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:39,567
Hand massages
for chemo patients.

80
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,655
Yes.

81
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:41,786
Meditation in the atrium.

82
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,527
Yes.
Sweet.

83
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:46,269
Casual, wait for it, Mondays.

84
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:47,270
Yes.

85
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:48,445
Bring your cat to work day.

86
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:49,446
Yes.

87
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,318
Honestly? Sleep pods.

88
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,581
Yes to all of it.

89
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:59,543
Remind me what patient
this is about?

90
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:02,503
Uh, it's not about a patient.

91
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,897
Oh. Um, what's up?

92
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,295
As you know, I've been, uh...

93
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:15,385
I've been seeing someone.

94
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,953
Uh...

95
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:26,048
Ah.

96
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:39,757
I--
No, I--I'm--

97
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:42,412
It's--

98
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:44,371
Sometime--
No, really.

99
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:45,850
It's, I--I--
Well--

100
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:55,817
I gotta--

101
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:08,612
That went well, right?

102
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:13,138
65 year old male
with stage four Parkinson's.

103
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,749
Fell on the sidewalk.
Head laceration.

104
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,534
Is he cognizant?
Unfortunately.

105
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:19,623
Okay, bay 24.

106
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,409
Okay, Mr. Rayburn,

107
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:23,627
what can you tell me
about your fall?

108
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,629
Nearly stuck the landing.

109
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:28,980
Coach said I still
qualify for nationals.

110
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:30,373
Okay.

111
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,810
And what's the last thing
you remember on impact?

112
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,725
Falling.

113
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,032
Okay.
Don't you have paperwork?

114
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,425
Thank you.
On it.

115
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:39,513
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

116
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:40,992
This is going well.

117
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:43,778
Dr. Bloom doesn't laugh.

118
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,736
Give it to me straight,

119
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,739
but not in a way that's
gonna make me freak out.

120
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:51,873
Okay, Mr. Rayburn, what
concerns me isn't your head,

121
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,049
but why a man
with stage four Parkinson's

122
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:56,486
is walking alone in the city
without a caregiver.

123
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,488
Oh, I have a caregiver.

124
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,011
Where is he?

125
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,405
And help has arrived.

126
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:07,889
It's real close!

127
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:12,589
Wait for it.

128
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,417
Gonna totally be worth it.

129
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:15,505
Anybody see a curly haired guy

130
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:16,637
with blood gushing
out of his face?

131
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,160
Oh, there you are.

132
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:20,031
Be right there.
I get paid by the hour.

133
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:23,034
If you walked any slower
you'd be dead.

134
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:25,950
I'm coming. Stop rushing me.

135
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:28,649
Everybody's so serious
in here.

136
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:29,737
Kit Vale.

137
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,174
I've got it from here,
Your Honor.

138
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,523
He takes care of you?

139
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,744
Not by choice.
Oh, okay.

140
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:38,136
What took you so long?

141
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,529
I waited for your jokes
to land.

142
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:42,010
That's cruel.
And in public too.

143
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,228
Am I getting punked?

144
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:46,754
That's all, folks.

145
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,192
Gladys, I'm using the door.
I was just notified

146
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,194
Shane Lewis missed art therapy.

147
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:54,196
Uh, okay, well then,
go get him.

148
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,677
No one knows where he is.
He lives here.

149
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,896
He lives--Shane lives
in the hospital.

150
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,158
Yeah.

151
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,551
Security wouldn't
just let a patient

152
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:04,598
with borderline personality
disorder leave.

153
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,643
Check-in.

154
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,124
Check-in!

155
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,605
Check-in.

156
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,563
Sorry.

157
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:14,999
Check-in.

158
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:17,088
Oh, geez. Oh, uh--

159
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:21,049
Oh, God!
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

160
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:24,139
Shut the door. Hah.
Ooh.

161
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,100
At least he's still
in the building.

162
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,889
Helen.

163
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:36,194
Why didn't you tell me?

164
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,153
Breathtaking even
when you're breathless.

165
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:39,937
How could you not tell me?

166
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,809
What?
What you want me to say?

167
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,854
"I have stage three
pancreatic cancer

168
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:46,030
and it's kicking my ass?"

169
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:47,597
It's been eight years
since I've seen you,

170
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,599
much less talked to you.

171
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,949
I didn't want to bother you.

172
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:54,256
You could never bother me.

173
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:55,823
This is the last time,
all right?

174
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:57,128
I promise.

175
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:59,304
Please don't talk
like it's already over.

176
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:02,743
Hey, Doc.

177
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:05,180
Will you tell her
for me, please?

178
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,140
Scar tissue from
the radiation

179
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:12,840
is tying together the spleen,
liver, and small intestine.

180
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:15,146
The tumor is wrapped
around his aorta

181
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,801
and his superior
mesenteric arteries.

182
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,978
I'm sorry, but it is
my opinion that surgery

183
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,285
isn't worth the risk.

184
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:31,336
If it's not impossible,

185
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,035
then it is worth the risk.

186
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:41,042
Helen.

187
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:42,304
We'd have to find

188
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:45,568
the best surgical oncologist
in the world.

189
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,875
I think Max just met her.

190
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:59,800
♪

191
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,591
Thank you
for coming so quickly.

192
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:11,681
Thank you for granting me
surgical privileges.

193
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:12,987
All right, this hallway's
a little shorter

194
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,684
than we're used to,
so I'm gonna talk fast.

195
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,904
Your patient's tumor
is unresectable

196
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:19,123
because it spread
to the hepatic hilum,

197
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,952
and it envelops
the hepatoduodenal ligament

198
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,780
and all surrounding structures.

199
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:25,216
The portal vein is compressed

200
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,827
and the superior
mesenteric vein.

201
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,350
Okay, so he's not
even a candidate

202
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:30,744
for Whipple surgery,
and yet here you are

203
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:33,877
with your entire
surgical team, why?

204
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:36,010
Multivisceral
ex-vivo surgery.

205
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:38,055
It's curative,
but extremely rare.

206
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,274
Takes at least 20 hours,

207
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,232
requires subbing
in a second team,

208
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:42,669
has a low survival rate

209
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:44,671
and will cost your hospital
around $2 million.

210
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,150
But before you say no,

211
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,239
know that it is your patient's
only viable option.

212
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:49,893
Yes.

213
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,199
Yes, you are aware of that?

214
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:53,854
Yes to the ex-vivo.

215
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,203
The medical director
of my hospital

216
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:56,334
would never allow that.

217
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,423
I can't think of any who would.

218
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,990
Well, you caught me
on my day of yes.

219
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,731
So, uh, we're doing this.

220
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:06,257
So how are you gonna resect
a tumor this pervasive?

221
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,824
Oh, I'm gonna remove

222
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,434

abdominal organs,

223
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:12,046

whatever looks good back in.

224
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,787
Mm!

225
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,745
Did she really just say that?

226
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,791
Yes, she did.

229
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,717
How can she even see
without loops?

230
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,197
Some people born Deaf
are more sensitive to light

231
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,677
and motion in their periphery.

232
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,897
I know she's got her team
to back her but

233
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,334
no loops, no cochlear implant.

234
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:41,553
Not to sound ableist,
but, damn.

235
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:42,816
Well, I think
they would agree with you.

236
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,253
Do you see this, Helen?

237
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,428
Yes.

238
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,560
Yeah, it's, uh--

239
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:51,476
it's incredible.

a little off to you?

Here we go.

248
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:32,822
Okay, so...

249
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:37,261
that is not something
that I anticipated seeing.

250
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:39,655
Ever, really.

251
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701

Anyone living on the ward
is prohibited from having sex.

That's it.
Why?

256
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:52,799
To protect people.

To protect people
from being abused,

many reasons.

259
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:58,543
Dr. Frome, we've been
in a committed relationship

260

261
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,982
We don't need to be
protected from each other.

262
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:05,550

Okay.

Um, well, I'm a fan of love,

00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,993
Guilty as charged, but...

266
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:16,518
you guys were both admitted
under conservatorship.

267
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,302

very real concerns about you

We need a defib.

360
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,588
Paddles are charged.

361
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,027
Clear.

362
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,073
No pulse, go again.

363
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:30,206
Clear.

364
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,599
I got a pulse.

365
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,601
Normal sinus rhythm.

366
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,652
What was that about?
With Helen?

367
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,219
Does she know him?

368
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,960
Yeah, they dated
when I first got here

369
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,397
for a couple of years.

370
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,051
Oh.

371
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:53,012
Dr. Reynolds,
Dr. Wilder needs you in OR 2.

372
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,404
I'm good.

373
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:00,671
I lost the stomach.
Fell apart while I was in

374
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,282
the lower esophageal junction.

375
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,501
It needs a full reconstruction
by the time we reinsert

376
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:06,416
or I'll have
to close without it.

377
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,071
Hey, is--is there
a reason you think

378
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:11,204
he might not live
without a stomach?

379
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,640
Yes, it's looking like

380
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:15,077
he's not gonna have
a small intestine.

381
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,133
Can I get a monocryl
and a tapered needle?

382
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,357
You're getting perforation.
Yeah.

383
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:36,490
Let me try anchoring this flap.

384
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:42,017
Damn it.
It's tissue paper.

385
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,280
I still need a stomach.

386
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:48,371
Then you're gonna
need to make one.

387
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,286
All right,
switching over to plan B.

388
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,462
A piggyback jejunal
interposition reconstruction.

389
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:53,768
Now, not only
is this complicated,

390
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,639
but we're gonna have
to do it twice as fast.

391
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:59,295
So hands up if
you've done it before.

392
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,427
Any thoughts?

393
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,645
Well, the procedure
I assisted on

394
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,126
was led by Dr. Baptiste.

395
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,433
He executed it flawlessly

396
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:10,350
and I believe
he's in the building.

397
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,482
Okay.

398
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:14,223
Someone page Dr. Baptiste.

399
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:17,183
I need him down here STAT.

400
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,447
Squeeze it.

401
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,363
Hmm.
Kit.

402
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:26,061
We can't do the squeeze test
unless you squeeze it.

403
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,410
I can live with that.

404
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,933
Who'd you say is watching Bob
while you're here?

405
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,544
You know, I'll tell you what?
You give it a squeeze,

406
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:33,677
I'll go find out for you.
Not cutting a deal.

407
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,331
Okay, you want to
play it like that?

408
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,203
Can you close the curtain
for me, please?

409
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:38,508
Thank you.

410
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,250
Easy, nurse Ratchet.
You're mean.

411
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:44,688
Hm, I'm just glancing over
your physical therapy records

412
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:46,429
and it seems that
you skipped over half

413
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:49,215
of your PT appointments
at the clinic this month alone.

414
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:52,522
I think we both know how
you'd do on the squeeze test.

415
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,002
You got me.

416
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:55,873
My squeeze scores probably
are lower because instead of

417
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:57,571
going to the most
depressing gym in the world,

418
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:58,789
I'm working my muscles out

419
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,356
following a slightly less
depressing program

420
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,531
called caring for Bob.

421
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:02,706
And how does that work?

422
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,186
I cook his meals,

423
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,145
help him bathe,
brush his teeth.

424
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,190
I'm even hitting way back
there, extra-credit muscles

425
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,713
when I fake laugh
at his horrible jokes.

426
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,672
How do you get the toothpaste
out of the tube?

427
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:14,283
So I kind of wedge the tube
on a stack of books

428
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,719
and then just sort
of lean on it.

429
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,591
That's not PT, Kit.

430
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,549
That's a workaround, okay?

431
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,203
Shortcuts might help you now

432
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:24,554
but in the long run,
they're hurting you.

433
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:27,122
Okay, well,
I am gonna recommend

434
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,211
that Bob move
to an assisted living facility.

435
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,865
You think
I haven't tried that?

436
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:32,910
I suggest that
at least once a week

437
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:35,870
and the wave of insults
I'm hit with are so specific

438
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:37,698
I insist you let me
watch you try to do it.

439
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,179
Go ahead, try.
I want to see it.

440
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:43,312
Come on, you go ahead.
Go ahead, it'll be fun.

441
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:44,922
Shane and Felicity
have both asked

442
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,490
that we get together to discuss

443
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:49,927
in hopes that we can all
move forward together.

444
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:52,191
I don't understand.
Let him finish, Dad.

445
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,149
Yeah, so normally,
I don't support

446
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,195
any kind of relationship while
two patients are in treatment.

447
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,587
Sex.

448
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,328
They're having sex.
Just say it.

449
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,504
Yes, they are--
they're having sex.

450
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:04,246
And it's hard for me
to discount, in this case,

451
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,466
that they have made
tremendous strides

452
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,858
since they started dating
each other in here.

453
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:09,251
In fact,
if you look at the files--

454
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:10,731
How can we trust
you're not gonna

455
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:12,341
hurt yourself again if it ends?

456
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:14,343
Mom, I love him.
Can you just listen?

457
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:16,345
Yeah, if we can all
just listen here.

458
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,566
Our son has borderline
personality disorder.

459
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,132
I mean, we don't know
what he's capable of.

460
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,178
What the hell does that mean?
It's not Shane's fault.

461
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,919
Okay, everyone, please.
Everyone sit down.

462
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:27,791
No, this is obviously not
the right place for Felicity.

463
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:29,358
This is the right place
for me.

464
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,620
Tell them it's
the right place for me.

465
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:31,926
She can't be in here.

466
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,493
Breaking up is hard enough

467
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:35,277
on people
without mental problems.

468
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,453
We're not breaking up!
Who says we're breaking up?

469
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:38,846
You forced me to get in here

470
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,456
and now you want to force
every move that I make?

471
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,328
Guys--
Clearly, this was a mistake.

472
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,330
Get off of me!
We're taking you out of here.

473
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:45,331
Go get help.

474
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,420
Just get back! Just back up!

475
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:48,551
All right.
God!

476
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:49,770
No, no, no, no, no, no.

477
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,293
Shane! Shane, don't--
Okay.

478
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,295
Stop, stop, stop.

479
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:54,644
Just--everyone back up
a little bit.

480
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,690
Back up, please.
Back up a little bit, please.

481
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,438
Retractor.

482
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,266
More pressure
on the leading edge.

483
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,445
Claud, I--
Can the jejunal stump

484
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:15,926
support an anastomosis?

485
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,407
I believe so.
Then clamp it.

486
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:32,378
Should I put on
your playlist, Dr. Reynolds?

487
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,423
both: No.

488
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,038
Fresh kits to tray one.

489
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,998
Preservation clock
is eight hours plus.

490
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,567
Cleanup on aisle five.

491
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,352
And the pancreas is clear.

492
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,049
All right,
let's get Team 2 in here

493
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:54,965
before we move
on the gallbladder.

494
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:56,706
Team 1, thank you.

495
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,534
Really amazing work, guys.
Thank you.

496
00:21:58,578 --> 00:21:59,709
You should sleep.

497
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:03,452
No, I am good. Thank you.

498
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:06,803
#7 scalpel.

499
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,066
This liver is
remarkably healthy

500
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,287
given how much the person
it belongs to used to drink.

501
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,379
Do tell.

502
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:21,731
I like being reminded
of the patient's humanity.

503
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:24,386
Um...

504
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,780
Guillaume was--

505
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:31,437
is wild.

506
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,049
You know where he took me
on our third date?

507
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,051
Cuba.

508
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:39,749
It was completely illegal,

509
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:42,970
but Guillaume always
knew someone who knew someone

510
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:44,319
and suddenly, there we were,

511
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,843
sneaking off
a merchant marine boat.

512
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:50,760
Not 20 minutes later,
we were in a beach bar,

513
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:54,938
challenging locals
to drinking games.

514
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:57,593
We lost.

515
00:22:57,637 --> 00:23:01,423
Then we wound up on a beach
near a mangrove forest

516
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:04,644
watching the sun come up
over the Caribbean.

517
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:10,432
Doesn't sound like
you lost to me.

518
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,913
That was us. We never--

519
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:15,829
we never thought about things,
we just--

520
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:18,788
we just did them.

521
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:21,400
Fearlessly.

522
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,491
Seems like you miss that.

523
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:33,324
.

524
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:43,291
♪

525
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,555
Max, I'm sorry.

526
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,209
For what?
You know.

527
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:50,864
I mean, you asked about
Helen and Guillaume's past

528
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,474
but people don't
always wanna know

529
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:53,954
what they think
they wanna know.

530
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:56,347
Oh, no, it's all good.

531
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:58,959
I'm just processing.

532
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:00,917
Of course, if the
situation was more normal,

533
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:01,962
she probably would've
said something.

534
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:03,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

535
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:04,878
You know, besides,
we're not in high school.

536
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:08,403
It'd be weird if we didn't
have a past, right?

537
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,839
I don't know.

538
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,493
I mean, you know this guy,

539
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,495
all our friends know this guy.

540
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:16,498
I've never even heard his name.

541
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,326
I'd give you the edge.

542
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:21,198
All of your organs
are in the same room.

543
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,331
It's not about jealousy.
No?

544
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:24,550
It's like moving
into a new house

545
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:26,160
and you discover this basement

546
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:27,291
that you didn't even know
was there.

547
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:29,555
On one hand, you know,
it's exciting.

548
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,992
But on the other hand,

549
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:34,995
why didn't the real estate guy
tell me about this?

550
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:37,867
What's down there?

551
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:45,875
You know, if you ever
look up Guillaume's art,

552
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,225
you'll see
it's pretty far out there.

553
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,227
And Helen was always
telling us stories about

554
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,273
how she helped him
do crazy things.

555
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:53,927
Crazy things like what?

556
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,452
Like slapping a mural on the
side of the Tri-State bridge.

557
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,888
That mural?
Mm-hmm?

558
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,977
The one that's over
the 50-foot drop to nothing?

559
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:03,937
Yeah, like someone
painted a cliff.

560
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,635
The resection is done.
We're coming in.

561
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:09,943
Wilder is scrubbing.
Thank you.

562
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:12,206
Are you telling me that
while Guillaume was

563
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:15,339
dangling over a river and
painting in the face of death,

564
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:18,212
Helen was holding the rope?

565
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:21,520
I'm telling you that
Guillaume held the rope.

566
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:32,966
Bob?

567
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,707
Still here.

568
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,275
Just relaxing
in an electric bed

569
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,539
in a germ-free room,

570
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:46,022
taking in
the comforting hum of machines

571
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:49,199
that won't let me die.

572
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:50,418
Cool.

573
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:53,290
I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

574
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:57,164
A smile.

575
00:25:57,207 --> 00:26:00,428
I knew Casey was wrong.

576
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,299
He said you didn't laugh.

577
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:05,520
Honestly,
I think humor is overrated.

578
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,740
I much rather have
a good meal or great sex

579
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,524
than have someone
try to make me giggle.

580
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,353
Well, with a good laugh,

581
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:14,442
if it's done well

582
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:17,184
and with the right person,

583
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:19,621
it changes everything.

584
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:25,279
But you didn't come here
to discuss laughter.

585
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:26,280
No.

586
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:27,673
No, I didn't.

587
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:30,240
Look, I know you're not
gonna want to hear this,

588
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:32,460
but you need 24 hour care

589
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,636
from an assisted living
facility.

590
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,203
Look, come on.

591
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:38,248
You can yell at me
all you want.

592
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,120
It is time, okay?

593
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:46,126
You think I don't know that?

594
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:48,563
I slept like a baby last night.

595
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,348
I'd love nothing more
than to live somewhere

596
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,568
where they made
it easy for you.

597
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,657
Okay.
But it's not gonna happen.

598
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:58,051
What? Why not?

599
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,661
When I got sick,

600
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:03,273
Kit stuck by my side,

601
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:07,060
even though he was
handsome and moody

602
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:10,106
and could've had
a date any evening,

603
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,673
but it gave him purpose.

604
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:13,719
And thank God it did

605
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:15,503
because when he had the stroke,

606
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:19,463
that purpose became drive.

607
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:23,032
Yeah, I--I don't see
how that's a reason.

608
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:27,820
I'm his reason for living.

609
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:31,475
I can't take that away
from him.

610
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:36,785
Don't, don't, no, no, no, no.
Please, don't--

611
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:38,657
don't do this. You don't--
don't sign that because

612
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,397
if you--if you take
your daughter out of our care,

613
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:41,921
you will subvert
all of the progress we've made.

614
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:44,140
Progress? Were you in
the conference room yesterday?

615
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:46,360
They have too many problems
to be in a relationship.

616
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:47,709
Yeah, but they have been.

617
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,537
Successfully
for quite some time now.

618
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,756
So it won't matter.

619
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,192
It won't matter
if you transfer hospitals,

620
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,628
if you break them up
temporarily.

621
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,675
They will find each other
because they're in love.

622
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:57,806
They will find
each other out there.

623
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,330
Do you understand?
I know you guys do.

624
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:01,549
So if--if you let them
stay on here,

625
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,377
continue on with me,
we can help them.

626
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,726
We can work with them
to help understand

627
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,119
their feelings
more productively.

628
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:07,555
And that way when they do
end up in the real world,

629
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:10,253
which they will,
they will be prepared.

630
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:14,562
Why are you so invested
in keeping them together?

631
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:18,392
Because I don't believe that
anyone should intentionally

632
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:20,481
keep people
who love each other apart.

633
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:22,701

What do you mean?

635
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,400
Shane was in the ED
getting his hand rebandaged

636
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:27,836
and she asked
if she could go say goodbye.

637
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,447
Oh, not this again.

638
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:33,712
Uh, uh, folks, hang on. Guys--

639
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:37,193
Well, how can we find them?
They could be anywhere.

640
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:40,109
No.

641
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:44,461
No, no, not anywhere.

Yeah, confirmed.

Organs are looking great.

646
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:06,614
Is that "hang loose?"
Does that mean we're clear?

647
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,181
Yeah, we're clear.

648
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,704
Yes.

what's going on?

712
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:15,183
They will move into
the office on the middle floor.

713
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:17,229
Oh, now I see it.
Look, whoever it is,

714
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:19,405
Bob, they're gonna help you
with the day-to-day things

715
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:21,276
that will probably
get harder to do.

716
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,191
And, Kit,

717
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:26,716
they will make sure that you do
your PT exercises on the daily.

718
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,414
But more importantly,

719
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:30,111
they will make sure
that you can still

720
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,591
take care of each other.

721
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:33,941
'Cause that's its own
kind of healing.

722
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:42,123
Our lack of response
means we're in.

723
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:44,169
Good.
Shall we?

724
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:46,040
If we must.

725
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,216
Oh, we must.

726
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,305
For the record, Doc,

727
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,481
you make me laugh.

728
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:54,179
Thanks, Bob.

729
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:56,094
Can we have Chinese?

730
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,747
We had Chinese last night.
What about Thai food?

731
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:58,966
I don't like Thai food,

732
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:00,968
how about somewhere Croatian?

733
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:03,101
Latvian! I want Latvian.

734
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,624
Casey?

735
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,408
What do you need?

736
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:08,671
You know all those times
you talk about jet-skis,

737
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:12,240
and laser tag, Russian spies?

738
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:14,677
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'll stop.

739
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:18,464
Actually, don't. Ever.

740
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:22,120
In fact, the more the better.

741
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:23,686
Really?
Yeah.

742
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,602
'Cause now you can rent
jet-skis over by Little Island.

743
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,038
And since I'm gonna try
to get, like, super close

744
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:29,431
to see if I can rock
the island with my wake,

745
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:31,259
but I think I'm gonna
need more jet-skis

746
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:33,261
to make some kind of impact,
so if you want to come,

747
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,307
yo, let me know, we can do it.

748
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:41,748
Floyd, come in.

749
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,750
We should've
told you sooner

750
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:46,274
And Lyn wanted to,
but I didn't.

751
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:49,712
And now I regret it.

752
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,717
You should've never
told me.

The surgery was--

755
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:12,474
it was dangerous

756
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:15,216
and it was unpredictable

757
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,525
and ultimately thrilling.

758
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:22,397
So basically, it was
the you of surgeries.

759
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:30,231

I thought I was going to--

760

No.

You are not done yet, mister.

762

766

Did you only say yes because
it was your day of yes?

767
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:14,493
When it comes to a patient,
I always say yes.

768

chicken fried rice?

769

770
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,326
No.

771
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:25,286

Yeah, I see that.

Yeah, no, I would love that,

776
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:37,733
But I'll tell you what,

783
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:57,840
No.

Welcome to the team.

Hey, Veronica just called

anything important today.
Mm, did she?

And what did you tell
the beast?

792
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:23,562
I told her it was just

793
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,433
another typical day
at New Amsterdam.

794
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:26,521

I can't hear you.
There's cars.

797
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,309
Okay, I love surprises
as much as the next girl,

798
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,354
but you need to tell me
why we're on this bridge

799
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:36,357
or you're gonna go off it.

800
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,275
Could you--

801
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,363
could you move?
'Cause I'm actually

802
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:45,323
trying to see
the art right here.

803
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,803
Get up.
Ow, ow, ow.

804
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,588
Violent.

805
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,459
Reynolds told you
about the mural.

806
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:53,374
Maybe.

807
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:56,334
How'd you feel about it?

808
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,771
I've been asking myself
all day.

809
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:03,341
And, um, I feel...

810
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:08,824
I feel like it's incredible.

811
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:13,220
I heard what you said.

812
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:17,311
To Veronica.

813
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,270
That maybe
you weren't gonna leave.

814
00:39:20,314 --> 00:39:22,403
There was just
a hollow threat.

815
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:24,013
I didn't know what else
to throw at her.

816
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:27,539
I--

817
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:30,542
sorry you heard it.

818
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,674
Yeah, well,
it definitely hurt.

819
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:36,809
And then failing
at Luna's lunch.

820
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:39,333
I don't know, I'm feeling--

821
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:44,425
I'm feeling just
really insecure at the moment.

822
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:47,385
And then I saw
that text from Guillaume

823
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:51,606
and it reminded me of
a version of myself that was

824
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,304
confident and fearless.

825
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:55,871
But I am sorry
that I never told you

826
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:58,613

No, don't be.

to have a life.

828
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:06,708
No, the only thing
I care about now is us.

829
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:09,885
Moving forward.

830

Happy?
How can you even ask that?

833
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:24,422
I mean, you have this whole
wild and carefree life

834
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:25,901

835
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:30,776
